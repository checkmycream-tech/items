            <li>great way to get rid of facial hair</li>
            <li>Just a cheap plastic tool that works like a mini razor.  </li>
            <li>Cheap piece of junk that broke while I was taking it out of the package.</li>
            <li>Especially does great on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I chose this razor because it&#x27;s light and pivoting ability.  </li>
            <li>It was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this buy the original one.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s bright &#x27;enough&#x27; and helps when trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>I wish that I could say more, but honestly, I don&#x27;t really understand how it works</li>
            <li>This personal aid does a good job at a fraction of the price of competitors like No</li>
            <li>I like the earlier model better, but this is better quality than some of its competitors.</li>
            <li>The older model of Finishing Touch was much better.</li>
            <li>the  trick when you need to touch up or get a quick trim.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly delivered but didnt like the item itself.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t for you to be able to give yourself a full Brazilian, shave your legs, or shape your brows like a professional waxer.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact it doesn&#x27;t actually say so, the packaging gave me the impression the hair remover is some kind of laser device.</li>
            <li>and I need something right away.  </li>
            <li>I received this item almost right away.  </li>
            <li>Great for in between removal of hair in small and out of the way places</li>
            <li>Just received this product,tried it immediately and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Works very well really like it !!</li>
            <li>Did not last more than a month</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I go over an area, there are still hairs left.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t necessarily add to the product, but I do like the design that allows it to stand up (as opposed to having it roll around the top of my dresser).</li>
            <li>This is exactly what the title claims...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had time to really use it and get acquainted with all the parts and all the different functions.</li>
            <li>First I noticed it is much louder than the Panasonic one, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the past &amp;#34;Finishing Touch&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>regular works better than new elite.  </li>
            <li>It only removes fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It can only cut fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Weak...doesn&#x27;t really get the job done.</li>
            <li>VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li>Thanks m</li>
            <li>the light only serves to highlight the hair that is still there.  </li>
            <li>It did not take out the whole root of the hair on my chin.  </li>
            <li>However, I have tried to use it and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>This one only has option to have light on all the time and it snags your hair way too often.  </li>
            <li>A very inexpensive product that really works well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many guess I&#x27;ll go back to old fashioned plucking</li>
            <li>The other one is ok but</li>
            <li>I had the original one and it lasted for years before it finally wore out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since ordered a new Panasonic and can&#x27;t wait to get that one!</li>
            <li>The cover on this one seems to close and stay locked together better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the pivot head is a lil more stiff but it works just as well</li>
            <li>This one cost the same, but is much better quality than my previous one.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>This is not painless and it will not remove anything but soft hairs,  </li>
            <li>I can no longer wax because of medication, and plucking got real old on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Shaves close enough to clean up nose hairs, slight lip hair, and hair on my hands.</li>

            <li> Shaves close enough to clean up nose hairs, slight lip hair, and hair on my hands.</li>
            <li> First one lasted about 3 years before the blade became dull but</li>
            <li> was using a razor of this type before,and that worked ok similar to this one,needless to say it was a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> and when we finally got it off it would only go half way back.</li>
            <li> This will likely break eventually with repeated use, but beats the other &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; versions of the same product.</li>
            <li> Too long for me to return it.</li>
            <li> Finishing Touch Elite Lighted Personal Hair Remover with Pivoting Head ... Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well for minor jobs.</li>
            <li> However, the razor did not seem to be sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the generic brand versions and they are less reliable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not a very sturdy item and she broke it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of removing fine to medium hair from small areas that are tricky to shave or painful to wax.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, it does not turn on anymore.  </li>
            <li> then again I only used it about once a month - nothing heavy duty.</li>
            <li> never really used it.</li>
            <li> It leaves very short stubble, so it&#x27;s not good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> RETURNED IT AND THREW THE OTHER ONE IN GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> I remove the battery from the unit because based on past experience when I left the battery in it tends to drain.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of other places on my body which grow a few hairs, and it&#x27;s not enough to bother me or make me need to shave/wax it, but now that I have this little device, I use it on those mentioned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth the price, if you want a durable trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really not a useful item in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It takes out only some of the hair not the thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love it for the chin hairs or black when I hate..</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these in the past 6 months and have returned al of them  Not one of the shaved a single hair.</li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY ROUGH AND NOT SMOOTH AT</li>
            <li> ITS AWFUL IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND DOES NOT REALLY REMOVE THE HAIR IN THE FIRST PLACE</li>
            <li> waste of money for me</li>
            <li> As for Mom got both of us a green Pro max.  </li>
            <li> The light is annoying.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of use it no longer moved and one time the blade piece even popped off.</li>
            <li> It is just poor excuse for a small shaver.  </li>
            <li> Says for the face, but has no &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; and for coarse hair useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it used to come with an extra blade, but no longer.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s just a small hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> it just seemed to be an ordinary razor,would not get another one.</li>
            <li> Forget it if there is a thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Tried it on eyebrows and not great.</li>
            <li> Lack of power make this item almost useless.</li>
            <li> The blades caught on the hairs instead of cutting them.  </li>
            <li> hair don&#x27;t know why this product is getting bad reviews</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product for myself</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>

            <li> It works great for me.  I can no longer wax because of medication, and plucking got real old on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Says for the face, but has no &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; and for coarse hair useless.</li>
            <li> Not as efficient as ads would have you believe but works fine in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan.  The hair grows back with stubble.</li>
            <li> Product was purchased as a gift, so I cannot speak about its capabilities.  I can say that the company shipped promptly and product looked just as it was described.</li>
            <li> I bought one a month  ago for a Mother&#x27;s day gift. It had hairs in it and was taped together in places.  The battery cover would not come  off and when we finally got it off it would only go half way back. Too long for me to return it. It will work until the battery quits. The other one is ok but regular works better than new elite.  As for Mom got both of us a green Pro max.  Thanks m</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t works really good</li>
            <li> I do not like this hair remover.  It only removes fine hair.  It does not remove coarse hair.  The light is annoying.  The older model of Finishing Touch was much better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 16 year old daughter. Unfortunately this is not a very sturdy item and she broke it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic version of this hair remover, but it broke after two years and I need something right away.  This was the all they had at the store, so I got it.  First I noticed it is much louder than the Panasonic one, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove hair as well.  I can still feel hairs and the light only serves to highlight the hair that is still there.  No matter how many times I go over an area, there are still hairs left.  I&#x27;ve tried using the pivot head and changing angles, but nothing seems to work.  I&#x27;ve since ordered a new Panasonic and can&#x27;t wait to get that one!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. great way to get rid of facial hair</li>
            <li> Works very well really like it !!</li>
            <li> makes facial hair grow faster and thicker!! Do not buy this item. Do not buy this item!! Do not buy this item!!</li>
            <li> I received the Elite as a gift. I used it to removed my unwanted mutton-chop sideburns. It was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> does not work like advertised</li>
            <li> Love this product. I had the original one and it lasted for years before it finally wore out. Use it a lot for chin hair and eyebrows.  It&#x27;s got plenty of power and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> ITS AWFUL IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND DOES NOT REALLY REMOVE THE HAIR IN THE FIRST PLACE</li>
            <li> The blades caught on the hairs instead of cutting them.  It definitely does not work as advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> It is good and not expense at all, I like it because you can use it before you go out and your face will look smooth.</li>
            <li> item broke does not work</li>
            <li> It did not take out the whole root of the hair on my chin.  It takes out only some of the hair not the thick hair.</li>
            <li> This came quickly and in perfect condition. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I received this item almost right away.  However, I have tried to use it and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I wish that I could say more, but honestly, I don&#x27;t really understand how it works and therefore I can&#x27;t really give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the past &amp;#34;Finishing Touch&amp;#34; shavers I&#x27;ve had.  This one only has option to have light on all the time and it snags your hair way too often.  It works fine, but if it didn&#x27;t snag my hair, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is not painless and it will not remove anything but soft hairs,  Forget it if there is a thick hair.  It is just poor excuse for a small shaver.  This was a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> the  trick when you need to touch up or get a quick trim. Love it for the chin hairs or black when I hate..</li>
            <li> This is handy and convenient. Works best on fine hairs. Unfortunately it used to come with an extra blade, but no longer. Some work better than others. There is often a faulty connection between battery and contact and I often have to jiggle it around before it begins to work again. Until something better comes along i will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact it doesn&#x27;t actually say so, the packaging gave me the impression the hair remover is some kind of laser device. But, it&#x27;s just a small hair trimmer. It does a decent job of removing fine to medium hair from small areas that are tricky to shave or painful to wax. (Upper lip, ankles) It leaves very short stubble, so it&#x27;s not good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Finishing Touch Elite Lighted Personal Hair Remover with Pivoting Head ... Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Does not remove hair all that well. Tried it on eyebrows and not great.</li>
            <li> This was my second one of these. I&#x27;ve used the generic brand versions and they are less reliable. This will likely break eventually with repeated use, but beats the other &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; versions of the same product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> it just seemed to be an ordinary razor,would not get another one. it did not meet my expectations.i was using a razor of this type before,and that worked ok similar to this one,needless to say it was a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because i wasn&#x27;t looking to spend alot of money. Works well for minor jobs. A big plus is the head tilts and lights up.</li>
            <li> I thought this product worked very well ,and U cant beet the price very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;I think it works just as good as some that cost more</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  It gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once but, I like the ease of using it and the results were good.</li>
            <li> A very inexpensive product that really works well.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. It was a total waste of money. Very disappointed. Maybe they work for some.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use. Bought it as Christmas gifts for family and friends. Everyone loves it!  Makes me look like a hero.</li>
            <li> The item broke upon assembly. Very cheap. The plastic pieces won&#x27;t stay in place. It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in a store.  I always use finishing touch.</li>
            <li> If I had another chance, I would save my money and not purchase this - remember you get what you pay for!  After only a few uses, it does not turn on anymore.  Changed batteries, tested batteries - not working.  Just a cheap plastic tool that works like a mini razor.  Hair returns immediately and to remove hair, one must go over and over a spot...</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for original finishing touch that died. Great for quick touchup grooming when getting ready to go somewhere. The cover on this one seems to close and stay locked together better than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday .  Haven&#x27;t had time to really use it and get acquainted with all the parts and all the different functions.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought</li>
            <li> Already have a much superior product at home.  Plus, I don&#x27;t even remember ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This personal aid does a good job at a fraction of the price of competitors like No No.  So far it is performing as we expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair. And you&#x27;ll have to cut your hair beforehand, because it doesn&#x27;t work well with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Great for in between removal of hair in small and out of the way places like I use it on my chin and sides of my face weekly.</li>
            <li> Works fine for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Stopped working after 3 months. No refund or returns accepted after 90 days.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one I had from another company it&#x27;s a nice replacement the pivot head is a lil more stiff but it works just as well</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of junk that broke while I was taking it out of the package. Are you kidding me? Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> so I had a finishing touch but I lost it and purchased the finishing touch elite. After a few days of use it no longer moved and one time the blade piece even popped off. I do not recommend this buy the original one.</li>
            <li> Just received this product,tried it immediately and like it very much.I would highly recommend this product.Especially does great on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t necessarily add to the product, but I do like the design that allows it to stand up (as opposed to having it roll around the top of my dresser).</li>
            <li> I chose this razor because it&#x27;s light and pivoting ability.  However, the razor did not seem to be sharp enough.  It can only cut fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s safe, quick, and very reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a HUGE help with both my parents. Dad is 90 and Mom is 88. No matter one&#x27;s age, ya gotta ROCK! And I&#x27;m proud to say that as they approach 68 years of marriage, they ALWAYS want to look good for one another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YEE HAW!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly delivered but didnt like the item itself.  Doesn&#x27;t cut well at all wouldn&#x27;t recommend . Really not a useful item in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove hairs as stated on the face, it removed the length of hair but stubs remains not go at all.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these in the past 6 months and have returned al of them  Not one of the shaved a single hair. I don&#x27;t have many guess I&#x27;ll go back to old fashioned plucking Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lack of power make this item almost useless.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the title claims... It is a FINISHING TOUCH. This isn&#x27;t for you to be able to give yourself a full Brazilian, shave your legs, or shape your brows like a professional waxer. It&#x27;s a finishing touch! Perfect to get any stray hairs you left after shaving, without having to lather up again and use a razor. There are a couple of other places on my body which grow a few hairs, and it&#x27;s not enough to bother me or make me need to shave/wax it, but now that I have this little device, I use it on those mentioned. I can, however, use the attachable trimmer head to shorten larger areas of hair before shaving if I&#x27;ve let them get too overgrown. 4 stars because the Finishing Touch Elite does not quite get &amp;#34;as close as shaving&amp;#34; in areas on my body that have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased one of these. First one lasted about 3 years before the blade became dull but then again I only used it about once a month - nothing heavy duty. Shaves close enough to clean up nose hairs, slight lip hair, and hair on my hands. The light is ok it&#x27;s bright &#x27;enough&#x27; and helps when trimming nose hair. Can&#x27;t comment on the pivoting head .... never really used it. When I finish using it I remove the battery from the unit because based on past experience when I left the battery in it tends to drain. Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product for myself but it works good for edging up my grandsons after their haircuts.</li>
            <li> Broke after using it for 5 minutes</li>
