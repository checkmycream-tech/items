            <li>Kudo&#x27;s I LOVE this product because it gives volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>But it is a very strong, useful mousse.</li>
            <li>I have to assume she thinks it is a great product as no other product was considered.  </li>

            <li>Works great for extra umph.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and it works fabulously to help lift my hair up from my scalp and give it the body I am looking for.</li>

            <li>Love this product, give my fine completely straight hair volume</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use before you blow dry.  </li>
            <li>great, just not much of a deal</li>
            <li>will check more closely next time ):</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Big Sexy Hair root pump by my hairdresser over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>I was an avid user of  Revlon&#x27;s Guts, but this is my new go-to!!</li>

            <li>It makes my hair kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>In combination with the Big Sexy Hair Spray I can do anything with my long white hair.</li>
            <li>What I like most about the product it does not darken the color, is not sticky on the hair, can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>

            <li> It makes a difference, my hair is thin</li>
            <li> but it left my hair as if I had used a ton of hair spray on my roots ,,, terrible</li>
            <li> Horrible product adds zero root lift even when using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

            <li> over priced!  Thought it was larger bottles I usually get online...will check more closely next time ):&lt;br /&gt;Product great, just not much of a deal</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>

            <li> I am a white female with medium length blonde natural curly hair. I was introduced to Big Sexy Hair root pump by my hairdresser over 2 years ago. He suggested I use in place of hairspray, as the final touch to any other product or just by itself. What I like most about the product it does not darken the color, is not sticky on the hair, can be used on wet or dry hair. The cost is high for my pocket, but it last a very long time. I use it 5 out 7 days and this is the third time in 2 years I have re-purchased. Amazon has the best price I have found, plus it came with 40% more!</li>
            <li> Gives good lift without being greasy or hard to run your fingers through.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product adds zero root lift even when using a blow dryer. It made my hair feel very heavy and untouchable even when using a small amount. WAY OVER PRICED!!!</li>
            <li> My wife asked my to purchase this.  I have to assume she thinks it is a great product as no other product was considered.  This supplier provided free shipping without even requiring Amazon&#x27;s $35 minimum.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS,I&#x27;M 64,I NEEDED SOME HELP WITH THINNING HAIR.OH MY, I&#x27;M SO PLEASED.THANK YOU!!!!!!.IT HAS MADE A MAJOR DIFFERENCE! LOVE</li>
            <li> I was an avid user of  Revlon&#x27;s Guts, but this is my new go-to!!</li>
            <li> Bravo Athena! Thank You for my order arriving one and half weeks before I expected it. Kudo&#x27;s I LOVE this product because it gives volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Too sticky for me. It makes blond hair look darker, obvious that there&#x27;s product in my hair. But it is a very strong, useful mousse.</li>
            <li> Have been using this Root Pump for years and it gives my hair body when I blow dry it.  I use it everytime I wash my hair.  Its a great product.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.. kinda like hair spray. I thought It was going to be a mouse. It makes my hair kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> A travel companion recommended this product, since her hair looked so great when mine didn&#x27;t I tried it and it works Great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use before you blow dry.  It makes a difference, my hair is thin and I do not have a lot of it, but this product makes my hair bounce without making it heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, except the sprayer spurts sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  A small amount does wonders for my hair.  If you use too much you will be disappointed and not like the product.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. Love it</li>
            <li> love it!! you only use a little and its great for my hair and my kids.</li>
            <li> it is not 10 oz as stated smaller than the real 10 oz in stores</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wanted to like this one very much, but it did not work!, not only that but it left my hair as if I had used a ton of hair spray on my roots ,,, terrible, i could not even touch it...&lt;br /&gt;no good at all</li>
            <li> In combination with the Big Sexy Hair Spray I can do anything with my long white hair. The two together is unbeatable. My hair has never held a curl, it was fine thinning and oily hair. You would never know it now.</li>
            <li> Love this product, give my fine completely straight hair volume</li>
            <li> If you have short hair that needs volume, this is it. End of story.</li>
            <li> Awful. Builds up in your hair and is so sticky</li>
