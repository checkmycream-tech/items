            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They work so great.  </li>
            <li>They work great on ALL types of acne.</li>
            <li>Great for blemishes, too.</li>
            <li>YOU CANNOT COVER THESE WITH MAKEUP, they are just really good for overnight healing.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>So glad I found these!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Amazingly I had never heard of these until a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, these did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think these are superior because they have WAY better &#x27;sticking power.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I also tried the Nexxcare kind</li>
            <li>they are effective.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super noticeable, which is great.</li>
            <li>Great quality product, these really work!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t have a problem keeping it on my face overnight.</li>
            <li>It works better than any spot treatment ever.</li>
            <li>should give it more time).</li>
            <li>These are my favorite patches too.  </li>
            <li>Either product doesn&#x27;t blend perfectly and it&#x27;s obvious you have a plastic dot on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extracted oil from a blemish and helped reduced redness and inflammation overnight, more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>Works most of the time.</li>
            <li>They are better than the Nexcare, IMHO.</li>
            <li>They stick MUCH better than the Nexcare.  </li>
            <li>:)  Update:</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, truly works</li>
            <li>and this brand is much more adhesive</li>
            <li>Dots definitely work, try a couple of brands and decide which ones you like best.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>To me, that&#x27;s the most important thing to treat anyway, because then you can apply makeup and it hides the blemish much better.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that hydrocolloid patches can be found at most drugstores (you&#x27;ll just have to cut the pieces up yourself - which is fine by me).  </li>
            <li>They are visible, especially if you have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>Happy to report that they are awesome and really do absorb the whole pimple/zit and so smooth and clear</li>
            <li>Yes, they work best when the head has been carefully pierced with a sterile point.</li>
            <li>Also the patches romove easy so it does not damage your skin</li>
            <li>The thing I love the most though is that they help smooth even the scratches and ease pain in the morning which helps make for a smooth an clean makeup application.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used hydrocolloid bandages, first of all they are amazing.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I just bought 3 more packages for when I go off to school after I loved the first one so much.</li>
            <li>Any who, as mentioned before, this product receives 5 stars from me for being genuine and keeping to what it promised to do.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I was acne free.</li>
            <li>I have purchased multiple boxes and am still quite happy with them.</li>
            <li>It sticks great and doesn&#x27;t come off in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>Not as well as the old Pond&#x27;s acne patches...but fairly well.</li>
            <li>The dots work best on zits that are open or very close to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Having clear skin is very important to me and this is a life saver!</li>
            <li>Originally I tried Nexcare Acne</li>
            <li>but the bandage somehow brings all the gunk underneath your skin to the top and absorbs it so your pimples heal much faster!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truly amazing product that I cannot live without it on my bag.</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re going to bed with a face full of band-aids.</li>
            <li>have to say, I really think this is the better product.</li>
            <li>Great for absorbing oil if pimple is not open and oozing.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it (and everyone) says!</li>
            <li>They stick amazingly well, even if you&#x27;ve pulled them back.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I was ordering when I got these, but they were cheap enough I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you put them on, to do so on a freshly washed face, before you&#x27;ve put on any face products.</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you scar easily and have acne with whiteheads.</li>
            <li>These shrink pimples super fast!</li>
            <li>I got these &amp; tried them right away.</li>
            <li>work really nicely and clear up my pimples fast, although they can sometimes fall off, but they work really well</li>
            <li>First time trying this brand.</li>
            <li>They definitely work better on the zits that have formed a head.</li>
            <li>The product itself receives 5 stars because it does exactly what promises to do.</li>
            <li>First, I wash my face, then pop any blemish that I might have.</li>
            <li>Works well, but are pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I use them for smaller issues, but the blister band aids are better for larger areas&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>is actually the favorite because it has 3 sizes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just got these and after one night, I&#x27;m pretty ecstatic about them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much too visible on my skin to ever wear during the day, but they&#x27;re a good overnight fix to get the swelling and redness to go down.</li>
            <li>And they stick better on flat parts of the face.</li>
            <li>:) But these are more clear and less noticeable, which I like, even if I&#x27;m just going to sleep in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They pretty much heal acne overnight.</li>
            <li>She said they blend in with your skin and pretty much suck the zit</li>
            <li>Then, make sure your face is COMPLETELY dry and stick this baby on your popped blemish.</li>
            <li>They accomplish 3 main things, from my perspective as a parent: 1)they clear pimples quickly; 2)they keep kids from picking and potentially scarring their fair skin; 3)they cover a red oozing bump</li>
            <li>These patches/dots come in 2 sizes, which is nice, but they are MUCH thicker and do not blend in with the surface of your skin, so you can&#x27;t blend in the patch with makeup to make it less visible.</li>
            <li>but once it is flat it is easy to cover with makeup.</li>
            <li>Then I read about a certain kind of bandage that actually pulled out fluid so a breakout would be almost healed overnight.  </li>
            <li>It is stickier and much clearing patches compared to The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover.</li>
            <li>An absolute must try for those fighting acne.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t see them.</li>
            <li>They work really well, however there is a catch.</li>
            <li>But it cleared up the lighter acne very well(overnight).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but they blend into your skin really well</li>
            <li>These patches are pretty much only good for days when you don&#x27;t leave the house, or if your acne is on a part of your face that is consistently and heavily covered by hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really improved the clarity of my skin, because often the pimple goes away without me picking at it or thinking I can pop it (which never ends well and leaves me with scars and pigmentation).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and Iâ€™m ready for you.</li>
            <li>Absorbing Cover.</li>
            <li>Really extract the moisture.  </li>
            <li>An absolute must have for my skin.</li>
            <li>Give your face a gentle wash after removing them, if the wetness bothers you.</li>
            <li>While they won&#x27;t blend with makeup, they work very well as spot treatments.</li>
            <li>These really do work.</li>
            <li>but figured I&#x27;ve tried so many other products why not give this a try.</li>
            <li>These are thinner but stick better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>If there was no oil to pull out of the zit, the sticker is clean, so you can actually see it working.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that they sometimes come off easily after application, but overall very effective.</li>
            <li>They were inexpensive, so I bought a box of the better known brand (which is almost $3.00 more expensive) along with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d discovered these in high school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>around the stickers, before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed these ones blend in a little better.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but these are really great.  </li>
            <li>With a zit in a &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; area like the chin, jawline, or near the nose, they are very prone to coming off.</li>
            <li>Slips off too easily and the smaller size is tiny.</li>
            <li>These only stick well to very clean, perfectly dry skin.</li>
            <li>the world I actually live in</li>
            <li>Worked real well on my face with the smaller acne, not what I really wanted this for.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that there were more of the larger circles than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I previously was purchasing a product similar to this from a more well-known brand that starts with the #3.</li>
            <li>put it on top of my pimple and it truly absorbs oil or pus and the next day the pimple is less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they do reduce the time it takes them to clear up.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne for over 30 years and always looking for products.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK, at least they will wear them around the house</li>
            <li>Tried this brand side by side with nexcare and was completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>I would only use it at night though, because you can&#x27;t really cover up the bandage with makeup</li>
            <li>the price is lower compared to The Nexcare Acne... will give update later after I used it few more times.</li>
            <li>You MUST thoroughly wash and pat dry your face first.</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I been using The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover, but after using it for some time it only worked after the pimple to mature with a white head.</li>
            <li>Youre better off paying a few extra dollars to buy from a brand that actually works.</li>
            <li>Even those bumps that never really do anything, that are full of clear fluid (lymphatic fluid) almost disappear overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 2 brands of hydrocolloid patches for acne, this one and the SmartMed Cover-Dots, and this one is my least favorite of the two.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell about the overall effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I was a bit skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li>These patches work surprisingly well - especially on those angry deep monsters that never seem to go away.  </li>
            <li>It also had a hard time sticking despite being put on a clean face.</li>
            <li>and they do a great job at healing big, painful pimples.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from adult acne on/off for the last several years.</li>
            <li>Especially for those lovely breakouts the night before a special event you are desperate to get rid of!</li>
            <li>I have acne which scars easily and a bad habit of scratching when they don&#x27;t heal quickly.</li>
            <li>and I tried it out right away on a couple small blemishes I had.  </li>
            <li>They basically speed up the cycle and help your skin heal much faster, and with less scarring/darkening.</li>

            <li> They accomplish 3 main things, from my perspective as a parent: 1)they clear pimples quickly; 2)they keep kids from picking and potentially scarring their fair skin; 3)they cover a red oozing bump</li>
            <li> These patches/dots come in 2 sizes, which is nice, but they are MUCH thicker and do not blend in with the surface of your skin, so you can&#x27;t blend in the patch with makeup to make it less visible.</li>
            <li> but once it is flat it is easy to cover with makeup.</li>
            <li> Then I read about a certain kind of bandage that actually pulled out fluid so a breakout would be almost healed overnight.  </li>
            <li> It is stickier and much clearing patches compared to The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover.</li>
            <li> An absolute must try for those fighting acne.</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t see them.</li>
            <li> They work really well, however there is a catch.</li>
            <li> But it cleared up the lighter acne very well(overnight).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but they blend into your skin really well</li>
            <li> These patches are pretty much only good for days when you don&#x27;t leave the house, or if your acne is on a part of your face that is consistently and heavily covered by hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really improved the clarity of my skin, because often the pimple goes away without me picking at it or thinking I can pop it (which never ends well and leaves me with scars and pigmentation).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and Iâ€™m ready for you.</li>
            <li> Absorbing Cover.</li>
            <li> Really extract the moisture.  </li>
            <li> An absolute must have for my skin.</li>
            <li> Give your face a gentle wash after removing them, if the wetness bothers you.</li>
            <li> While they won&#x27;t blend with makeup, they work very well as spot treatments.</li>
            <li> These really do work.</li>
            <li> but figured I&#x27;ve tried so many other products why not give this a try.</li>
            <li> These are thinner but stick better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> If there was no oil to pull out of the zit, the sticker is clean, so you can actually see it working.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they sometimes come off easily after application, but overall very effective.</li>
            <li> They were inexpensive, so I bought a box of the better known brand (which is almost $3.00 more expensive) along with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered these in high school.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> around the stickers, before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed these ones blend in a little better.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but these are really great.  </li>
            <li> With a zit in a &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; area like the chin, jawline, or near the nose, they are very prone to coming off.</li>
            <li> Slips off too easily and the smaller size is tiny.</li>
            <li> These only stick well to very clean, perfectly dry skin.</li>
            <li> the world I actually live in</li>
            <li> Worked real well on my face with the smaller acne, not what I really wanted this for.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that there were more of the larger circles than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I previously was purchasing a product similar to this from a more well-known brand that starts with the #3.</li>
            <li> put it on top of my pimple and it truly absorbs oil or pus and the next day the pimple is less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they do reduce the time it takes them to clear up.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne for over 30 years and always looking for products.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK, at least they will wear them around the house</li>
            <li> Tried this brand side by side with nexcare and was completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I would only use it at night though, because you can&#x27;t really cover up the bandage with makeup</li>
            <li> the price is lower compared to The Nexcare Acne... will give update later after I used it few more times.</li>
            <li> You MUST thoroughly wash and pat dry your face first.</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I been using The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover, but after using it for some time it only worked after the pimple to mature with a white head.</li>
            <li> Youre better off paying a few extra dollars to buy from a brand that actually works.</li>
            <li> Even those bumps that never really do anything, that are full of clear fluid (lymphatic fluid) almost disappear overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 brands of hydrocolloid patches for acne, this one and the SmartMed Cover-Dots, and this one is my least favorite of the two.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell about the overall effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I was a bit skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> These patches work surprisingly well - especially on those angry deep monsters that never seem to go away.  </li>
            <li> It also had a hard time sticking despite being put on a clean face.</li>
            <li> and they do a great job at healing big, painful pimples.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne on/off for the last several years.</li>
            <li> Especially for those lovely breakouts the night before a special event you are desperate to get rid of!</li>
            <li> I have acne which scars easily and a bad habit of scratching when they don&#x27;t heal quickly.</li>
            <li> and I tried it out right away on a couple small blemishes I had.  </li>
            <li> They basically speed up the cycle and help your skin heal much faster, and with less scarring/darkening.</li>
            <li> one star off is because of the assortment: you 36 dots, 12 large and 24 small.</li>
            <li> With these patches, you can very clearly tell that there is a round translucent disc on your face, whereas the Smartmed cover-dots are thinner and can be concealed with makeup because the edges aren&#x27;t as obvious.</li>
            <li> While they are not magic, there is a very noticeable reduction in the size of inflammation.</li>
            <li> Put them on a popped pimple at night and by the morning they are flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the swelling and redness doesn&#x27;t last NEARLY as long when I use the patch on my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Just put it over the popped zit at night and in the morning, the zit is flat and the oil residue is on the sticker.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> However, I would wish to take away a star because there is just not enough patches to last a person with more troubled skin a week!</li>
            <li> Better off getting regular hydrocolloid bandages and cutting to size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just as curious as many as to why these are not a more commonly known acne remedy???  </li>
            <li> Did not work even though I followed what other reviewers said and only used it for white heads.</li>
            <li> (they can stay on all night but aren&#x27;t hard to peel off your face when you&#x27;re ready)</li>
            <li> Once I pat my face dry, I allow my skin to air dry for some time as well.</li>
            <li> dry while you go about your day, sleep or even shower.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and do not come off the sheet cleanly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the patches gonna turn white and the swelling was down without any damaging squeezing or picking</li>
            <li> These are not just for those little white pimples.</li>
            <li> Also helps with dried acne/sores that take awhile to heal (common for us older folks!).  </li>
            <li> Adult acne sucks, but these patches do the trick.</li>
            <li> Carefully peel the patch from the paper and stick over pimple.</li>
            <li> Then I apply toner and any other acne fighting product.</li>
            <li> Those items worked well too, but I came upon these as a recommended item when I purchased the other.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work as well as the other brand</li>
            <li> They worked pretty well, but are expensive.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these is that the small size is a bit too small; they are difficult to center and can come unstuck easily.</li>
            <li> I think my pores are rather unusually deep, therefore they take a few nights (and therefore quite a few patches) to pull all of the gunk out; but they work!  </li>
            <li> This brand is cheaper than some acne absorbing pads, and less expensive than others.</li>
            <li> If I have a bit zit, I can lance it then put this on and by morning it&#x27;s all shrunk down and doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> They do not absorb as well as brands I have previously used either.</li>
            <li> It did not clear up the hard core acne</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve tried all the creams and soaps and everything else that tends to dry my face out, but Iâ€™m tired of that dry, itchy, scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li> It is a little piece of plastic</li>
            <li> Been using them for a little over a week now on them &amp; they are shrinking.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles overnight, but the improvement was very minimal and was no more than if I had not used any patch at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that cutting up the generic target bandages from my local store is the cheapest option for me.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a waste of money for me</li>
            <li> DO NOT moisturize or put ANYTHING else on your face until AFTER the patches are firmly on.</li>
            <li> I get every few weeks before I had the chance to panic and pick.</li>
            <li> So it only works on broken skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted a few cause</li>
            <li> For those areas, we cover the dot with a small round bandaid.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to flatten zits and draw out all the gross crap from them (including the clear lymphatic fluid of those big, raised nasty zits!)</li>
            <li> However (for me at least), these also help to bring the deeper, headless zits out to the surface (over time)</li>
            <li> Not nearly as effective as the Nexcare acne patch.</li>
            <li> and it sucks the gunk out of my pimple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gross upon removal from the face (The blemish feels wet and nasty, as does the underside of the used patch) but the improvement is unmistakable.</li>
            <li> A word of advice for those who say that these little suckers don&#x27;t stick - you&#x27;re doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> These are not good for use until you have &amp;#34;ripe&amp;#34; pimples and the like.</li>
            <li> And the hard bumps hurt!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the science behind it works</li>
            <li> and I actually have one of these bad boys on my face as I type!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about how these work</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but read a lot of blogs that swore they worked.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from bad acne as a kid.</li>
            <li> They also worked for a cold sore I had!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not the quality I was expecting. Slips off too easily and the smaller size is tiny. Better off getting regular hydrocolloid bandages and cutting to size.</li>
            <li> First time trying this brand. It is stickier and much clearing patches compared to The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover. Don&#x27;t know if the patches gonna turn white and the swelling was down without any damaging squeezing or picking yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I been using The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover, but after using it for some time it only worked after the pimple to mature with a white head. Otherwise, it&#x27;s useless. Also, I think the pimple last longer and getting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving this a try this the price is lower compared to The Nexcare Acne... will give update later after I used it few more times.</li>
            <li> Great quality product, these really work!</li>
            <li> work really nicely and clear up my pimples fast, although they can sometimes fall off, but they work really well</li>
            <li> These patches are great! Put them on a popped pimple at night and by the morning they are flat. You will have to wait for the red spot to fade but once it is flat it is easy to cover with makeup. Also the patches romove easy so it does not damage your skin</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about how these work but figured I&#x27;ve tried so many other products why not give this a try. Happy to report that they are awesome and really do absorb the whole pimple/zit and so smooth and clear I almost forgot that I have something on my face. Would recommend to anyone to keep on hand... Especially for those lovely breakouts the night before a special event you are desperate to get rid of!</li>
            <li> I tried using these patches on several occasions. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles overnight, but the improvement was very minimal and was no more than if I had not used any patch at all. This was definitely a waste of money for me and I wish I didn&#x27;t buy into the hype.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these did nothing for my skin. Then keep the pimple from getting larger, but don&#x27;t make it any smaller.</li>
            <li> It works on me. I like to use it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but these are really great.  They don&#x27;t cure a blemish overnight but they do reduce the time it takes them to clear up.</li>
            <li> While they are not magic, there is a very noticeable reduction in the size of inflammation. To me, that&#x27;s the most important thing to treat anyway, because then you can apply makeup and it hides the blemish much better. So glad I found these!</li>
            <li> Squeeze at night and place one of these babies on before bed and the spot will be flattened by morning. I also never have a mark afterwards. Having clear skin is very important to me and this is a life saver! #makeupfreefriday  https://www.facebook.com/ThaliaDoesMakeUp  Here is a photo of me without any make up and I actually have one of these bad boys on my face as I type!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it (and everyone) says! I&#x27;m just as curious as many as to why these are not a more commonly known acne remedy???  I think my pores are rather unusually deep, therefore they take a few nights (and therefore quite a few patches) to pull all of the gunk out; but they work!  They definitely work better on the zits that have formed a head. Yes, they work best when the head has been carefully pierced with a sterile point. However (for me at least), these also help to bring the deeper, headless zits out to the surface (over time) as well.  A word of advice for those who say that these little suckers don&#x27;t stick - you&#x27;re doing something wrong. You MUST thoroughly wash and pat dry your face first. Once I pat my face dry, I allow my skin to air dry for some time as well. Then I apply the patches over the needed areas. DO NOT moisturize or put ANYTHING else on your face until AFTER the patches are firmly on. These stick so well that sometimes it actually hurts just a wee bit while peeling them off.  The product itself receives 5 stars because it does exactly what promises to do. However, I would wish to take away a star because there is just not enough patches to last a person with more troubled skin a week! I went through both the Nexcare brand as well as this brand within 1 week before attaining the drugstore ones!!!  I did some research and found that hydrocolloid patches can be found at most drugstores (you&#x27;ll just have to cut the pieces up yourself - which is fine by me).  Any who, as mentioned before, this product receives 5 stars from me for being genuine and keeping to what it promised to do. An absolute must try for those fighting acne.</li>
            <li> Did not work even though I followed what other reviewers said and only used it for white heads. It also had a hard time sticking despite being put on a clean face. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have acne which scars easily and a bad habit of scratching when they don&#x27;t heal quickly. These are AWESOME. I put them on before I go to bed, don&#x27;t absentmindedly scratch, and when I wake up the next morning, the whiteheads and even the blackheads are drastically reduced in size! These are not good for use until you have &amp;#34;ripe&amp;#34; pimples and the like. They will not work for cystic acne. The thing I love the most though is that they help smooth even the scratches and ease pain in the morning which helps make for a smooth an clean makeup application. YOU CANNOT COVER THESE WITH MAKEUP, they are just really good for overnight healing. I just bought 3 more packages for when I go off to school after I loved the first one so much. Highly recommended if you scar easily and have acne with whiteheads. It even healed the dreaded nose pimple I get every few weeks before I had the chance to panic and pick. Miracles do happen.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I was ordering when I got these, but they were cheap enough I decided to give them a try. So far I&#x27;m a fan. First, I wash my face, then pop any blemish that I might have. Then I apply toner and any other acne fighting product. Then, make sure your face is COMPLETELY dry and stick this baby on your popped blemish. I&#x27;ve found that the swelling and redness doesn&#x27;t last NEARLY as long when I use the patch on my blemishes. It is a little piece of plastic so it is noticeable, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it in public. Most of the time I don&#x27;t have a problem keeping it on my face overnight. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend moisturizing too close to the patch, the lotion will cause it to fall off. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I found out about these pads quite by accident. I have had adult acne for over 30 years and always looking for products.  Amazingly I had never heard of these until a couple weeks ago. Then I read about a certain kind of bandage that actually pulled out fluid so a breakout would be almost healed overnight.  I was skeptical but read a lot of blogs that swore they worked.  I ordered a pack and I tried it out right away on a couple small blemishes I had.  They did indeed disappear overnight.  The big test was that I get some under skin cysts.  I can feel them and know they are there but you really don&#x27;t see them. Of course I pick at them and I shouldn&#x27;t but it is what it is.  I put one of these on one of the cysts I felt starting and the next morning...all gone!  I will be reordering these on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> Great product. Only complaint is that they sometimes come off easily after application, but overall very effective.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered these in high school. They work really well, however there is a catch. They won&#x27;t suck the oil out of a zit that hasn&#x27;t popped, it has to be popped. So it only works on broken skin. BUT, for those who can&#x27;t resist popping zits, this is a miracle tool. Just put it over the popped zit at night and in the morning, the zit is flat and the oil residue is on the sticker. If there was no oil to pull out of the zit, the sticker is clean, so you can actually see it working. It works better than any spot treatment ever.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used hydrocolloid bandages, first of all they are amazing. They pretty much heal acne overnight. My only complaint with these is that the small size is a bit too small; they are difficult to center and can come unstuck easily.</li>
            <li> I got these &amp; tried them right away. I got face &amp; body acne &amp; different types. Worked real well on my face with the smaller acne, not what I really wanted this for. I got this cause I got cyctic acne on my body. And the hard bumps hurt! Been using them for a little over a week now on them &amp; they are shrinking. It did not clear up the hard core acne but it did make it better(I should give it more time). But it cleared up the lighter acne very well(overnight). And yes, I walked around with them on. Had to, I&#x27;m a picker &amp; this will help you from squeezing on your bumps too! I wasted a few cause I thought you had to change them after every bath but no, they will stay on in the shower &amp; you supposed to wait till it turns white to remove. I will buy again cause I don&#x27;t know what else helps with cyctic(hard bumps with no puss) acne.</li>
            <li> These shrink pimples super fast! They aren&#x27;t super noticeable, which is great. They stick amazingly well, even if you&#x27;ve pulled them back. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works well, but are pretty pricey. I&#x27;ve found that cutting up the generic target bandages from my local store is the cheapest option for me.</li>
            <li> Patches are the only thing that has worked for me.  These are my favorite patches too.  You only wear them at night but they blend into your skin really well so you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re going to bed with a face full of band-aids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 brands of hydrocolloid patches for acne, this one and the SmartMed Cover-Dots, and this one is my least favorite of the two. These patches/dots come in 2 sizes, which is nice, but they are MUCH thicker and do not blend in with the surface of your skin, so you can&#x27;t blend in the patch with makeup to make it less visible. With these patches, you can very clearly tell that there is a round translucent disc on your face, whereas the Smartmed cover-dots are thinner and can be concealed with makeup because the edges aren&#x27;t as obvious. These patches are pretty much only good for days when you don&#x27;t leave the house, or if your acne is on a part of your face that is consistently and heavily covered by hair.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne on/off for the last several years. I previously was purchasing a product similar to this from a more well-known brand that starts with the #3. Those items worked well too, but I came upon these as a recommended item when I purchased the other. They were inexpensive, so I bought a box of the better known brand (which is almost $3.00 more expensive) along with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I really think this is the better product. Not because it&#x27;s cheaper though. They both fundamentally do the same thing. They both extract pus and oil from your pimples. I think these are superior because they have WAY better &#x27;sticking power.&#x27; I put them on at night and they don&#x27;t fall off, where sometimes the others would come off in the night. I would recommend if you put them on, to do so on a freshly washed face, before you&#x27;ve put on any face products. I put on the stickers, and then proceed with putting on my moisturizer, etc. around the stickers, before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed these ones blend in a little better. Either product doesn&#x27;t blend perfectly and it&#x27;s obvious you have a plastic dot on your face. :) But these are more clear and less noticeable, which I like, even if I&#x27;m just going to sleep in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend them. It&#x27;s extracted oil from a blemish and helped reduced redness and inflammation overnight, more times than I can count. It&#x27;s really improved the clarity of my skin, because often the pimple goes away without me picking at it or thinking I can pop it (which never ends well and leaves me with scars and pigmentation). They come in two different sizes on the sheet, so you have options there too. I&#x27;d highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> In my perfect world, I wouldn&#x27;t need these. In my almost-perfect world, these would be metal-detectable (so I could wear them all day at my manufacturing job, instead of just at night) and have a smiley face on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world I actually live in, these do help- especially in getting me to leave my blemishes alone. They basically speed up the cycle and help your skin heal much faster, and with less scarring/darkening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I was a bit skeptical of this product. However, after trying it I am now a committed purchaser! If I have a bit zit, I can lance it then put this on and by morning it&#x27;s all shrunk down and doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore. They are awesome. My only wish is that there were more of the larger circles than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Bought this cause it was cheaper than Nexcare, but I regret it. Doesn&#x27;t stick well and doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> They work so great.  Put on before bed and wake up with your spot so much smaller or even gone.  Never picking at my face again.</li>
            <li> These patches work surprisingly well - especially on those angry deep monsters that never seem to go away.  Thanks for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. They also worked for a cold sore I had! A must have for anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work as well as the other brand and I&#x27;d recommend to get the name brand. Corners peel off and aren&#x27;t as absorbent. I thought I&#x27;d try this because it was cheaper but it&#x27;s lower quality.</li>
            <li> Works most of the time.</li>
            <li> I suffered from bad acne as a kid. A dose of Accutane later and I was acne free. Now, for some reason, in adulthood Iâ€™m being plagued by zits on my face. Iâ€™ve tried all the creams and soaps and everything else that tends to dry my face out, but Iâ€™m tired of that dry, itchy, scratchy feeling. A friend who is a makeup artist recommended these patches to me. She said they blend in with your skin and pretty much suck the zit dry while you go about your day, sleep or even shower. The day the package came, I put one on a zit that was stubbornly sticking to my face. Day three now and itâ€™s gone. Bring it on, zits. There are 36 patches in this pack of varying sizes and Iâ€™m ready for you. Adult acne sucks, but these patches do the trick. Iâ€™m living proof.</li>
            <li> Originally I tried Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover. They worked pretty well, but are expensive. While researching what the pads were made of (and how they work) I ran into this brand and decided to take a chance. They are better than the Nexcare, IMHO. They stick MUCH better than the Nexcare.  These are not just for those little white pimples. They work great on ALL types of acne. Even those bumps that never really do anything, that are full of clear fluid (lymphatic fluid) almost disappear overnight. Also helps with dried acne/sores that take awhile to heal (common for us older folks!).  Wipe area with alcohol (to degrease the skin). Do not use medication / medicated pads. Carefully peel the patch from the paper and stick over pimple. I use them at night and let the area breathe during the day.  I can&#x27;t see wearing ANY of these pads in public unless you don&#x27;t care that people WILL see them. These are like hair rollers: you can cover the rollers, but people are still going to know you are wearing them!  If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you that&#x27;s fine.  :)  Update: I have purchased multiple boxes and am still quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> I feel these work as well as the nexcare brand and are a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me.  Had issues with getting item to stick to my face.  The ones that did stick and were left on overnight did nothing to my breakouts.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Great for absorbing oil if pimple is not open and oozing.</li>
            <li> Love them.  Great for blemishes, too.</li>
            <li> Love this product, truly works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on top of my pimple and it truly absorbs oil or pus and the next day the pimple is less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly amazing product that I cannot live without it on my bag.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  Really extract the moisture.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these! Amazed that I didn&#x27;t hear about them until now. An absolute must have for my skin. I don&#x27;t know how the science behind it works but the bandage somehow brings all the gunk underneath your skin to the top and absorbs it so your pimples heal much faster!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as effective as the Nexcare acne patch.</li>
            <li> These are thinner but stick better than the other brands. I use them for smaller issues, but the blister band aids are better for larger areas&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these! I also tried the Nexxcare kind and this brand is much more adhesive (they can stay on all night but aren&#x27;t hard to peel off your face when you&#x27;re ready) and they do a great job at healing big, painful pimples. They&#x27;re much too visible on my skin to ever wear during the day, but they&#x27;re a good overnight fix to get the swelling and redness to go down.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell about the overall effectiveness of this product. It seems to have a &amp;#34;drawing out&amp;#34; quality on blemishes. I will update this review as time goes by.</li>
            <li> These work find. Not as well as the old Pond&#x27;s acne patches...but fairly well. The price is right!</li>
            <li> With a couple of teen kids in the house, we keep a lot of acne-fighting products on hand. Absorbent zit covers are so simple---no medicine to overdry skin!---but they are effective. They accomplish 3 main things, from my perspective as a parent: 1)they clear pimples quickly; 2)they keep kids from picking and potentially scarring their fair skin; 3)they cover a red oozing bump so I don&#x27;t have to look at it! We&#x27;ve used this brand and a couple of others ([[ASIN:B00PBX3TN6 CosRx]] is actually the favorite because it has 3 sizes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of things to remember, though:&lt;br /&gt;1. These only stick well to very clean, perfectly dry skin. And they stick better on flat parts of the face. With a zit in a &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; area like the chin, jawline, or near the nose, they are very prone to coming off. For those areas, we cover the dot with a small round bandaid.&lt;br /&gt;2. The dots work best on zits that are open or very close to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;3. They are visible, especially if you have very fair skin. Neither of my kids would considering wearing these in public. That&#x27;s OK, at least they will wear them around the house so my eyes are shielded from the sight of a giant pimple staring at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one star off is because of the assortment: you 36 dots, 12 large and 24 small. This brand is cheaper than some acne absorbing pads, and less expensive than others. Dots definitely work, try a couple of brands and decide which ones you like best.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to conceal a blemish and blend with makeup, this may not be for you. If you&#x27;re looking for something to flatten zits and draw out all the gross crap from them (including the clear lymphatic fluid of those big, raised nasty zits!) then this will serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;I just got these and after one night, I&#x27;m pretty ecstatic about them. It&#x27;s a little gross upon removal from the face (The blemish feels wet and nasty, as does the underside of the used patch) but the improvement is unmistakable. Give your face a gentle wash after removing them, if the wetness bothers you. It won&#x27;t last long. While they won&#x27;t blend with makeup, they work very well as spot treatments. Love them. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.  The nexcare brand dots are wonderful and I hoped these would be similar. Tried this brand side by side with nexcare and was completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and do not come off the sheet cleanly. They do not absorb as well as brands I have previously used either. Would not recommend this product. Youre better off paying a few extra dollars to buy from a brand that actually works.</li>
            <li> Works as directed. I put it on overnight and it sucks the gunk out of my pimple. It sticks great and doesn&#x27;t come off in the middle of the night. You can see the bump is smaller and the bandage is dirtier when you take it off. I would only use it at night though, because you can&#x27;t really cover up the bandage with makeup and it&#x27;s somewhat noticeable</li>
            <li> These really do work. Totally worth the money.</li>
