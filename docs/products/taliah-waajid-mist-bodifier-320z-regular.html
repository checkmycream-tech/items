            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>It came in a timely manner but the top wasn&#x27;t on all the way so some of the lotion had leaked out.</li>
            <li>I initially ordered this product in the 8oz size and now that I know it is perfect for her hair type</li>

            <li>I love this stuff because it keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li>This size is perfect for my families needs as we all have locks and use this mist  multiple times a week.</li>
            <li>I will give a more detailed review about the quality of the product on the spray bottle page.</li>
            <li>, it does say that once it is opened it has a shelf life of 12 months but we go through this stuff so quickly that I am sure we will have no problem using it all up within a year.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it was my first time buying the 32oz.</li>
            <li>The great this is this product goes a long way,no need to over saturate  the hair.</li>
            <li>hope they don&#x27;t ever stop carrying these products because I absolutely love them and they are as natural as you can get for the price!!!</li>
            <li>I love the coconut like smell it offers.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the standard size bottle because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not (yes, Shea Butter</li>
            <li>It has a faint, pleasant smell, it is not greasy whatsoever which I find to be a very important qaulity.</li>
            <li>Gives thirsty hair exactly what it needs.  </li>
            <li>It leave my hair as soft in it&#x27;s original state.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to balance because I have too much moisture.</li>
            <li>and it keeps knots out of it which makes detailing so much easier.</li>
            <li>I was just spraying it on her dry hair which works just fine</li>
            <li>But it smells so good and makes my hair so manageable and fluffy that this is my must have when I wear my hair in a fro which is almost daily.</li>
            <li>If you have very curly hait, this product conditions and keeps your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone with natural or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>def be buying again, the product arrived as scheduled, well packaged, which when I ordered it I did not think about, the fact it could leak, this seller made sure it was nicely wrapped multiple times tightly and it only leaked just a little bit.</li>
            <li>It enhances her curls, adds shine (not greasy shine, just natural shiny hair) and the curls dry fairly quickly and softly.</li>
            <li>I often use it on weave hair as well, but when I take my hair down I love it just the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful Amazon sells it in the large size, since I cannot purchase it locally.</li>
            <li>We are both natural and our hair soaks it up for moisture.</li>
            <li>Just remember to save your old spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with the Cantu for Natural Hair moisturizing Curl Activator cream.....</li>
            <li>If you are someone that is a all natural person, this is the product to purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair as well as my two young daughters.</li>
            <li>It leaves our locks soft, well scented and shiny...</li>
            <li>It does not dry crunchy.</li>
            <li>but now I get her hair slightly damp first to make the product go further.</li>

            <li> If your hair is dry all the time, this will definitely do the job and never is greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who is almost 2, she has 3b/3c hair, it gets really dry and tangled on the back of her head and</li>
            <li> I love using this after I cold wash my hair.</li>

            <li> Cost less buying bigger.</li>
            <li> I just spray it all over her hair, rub it in with my hands, take a wide tooth comb and detangle, then use my fingers to style her hair, then let it dry....</li>
            <li> It can be used every day, and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I also used some of the other products from Taliah Vaajid.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it was formulated for her specific hairtype, I mean, to stop breakage and whatnot.</li>
            <li> thick, dry hair Taliah Waajid is the truth!</li>
            <li> EXTREME DRY AND THIN HAIR( BABY HAIR)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> EXTREME DRY AND THIN HAIR( BABY HAIR) THIS IS YOUR PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever! If your hair is dry all the time, this will definitely do the job and never is greasy.  It works well on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  It helps to keep my locs moisturized.</li>
            <li> I did not get to use this product as it was damaged when I receiv it. The cap was dislodged and the contents spilled all over the box.</li>
            <li> Gives thirsty hair exactly what it needs.  I would highly recommend to anyone with natural or relaxed hair. So awesome!</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner. It protects and moisturizes curly kinky hair without sticky residue. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> My favorite product. Been using it for 8 years now. It works wonders on my hair and my daughters hair. We are both natural and our hair soaks it up for moisture. It doesn&#x27;t take long to lock in the moisture. Sometimes I need to balance because I have too much moisture.</li>
            <li> Cost less buying bigger. Just remember to save your old spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the product. It came in a timely manner but the top wasn&#x27;t on all the way so some of the lotion had leaked out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who is almost 2, she has 3b/3c hair, it gets really dry and tangled on the back of her head and the only product that seemed to help before I discovered this stuff was the Garnier Fructis products for curly hair but I didn&#x27;t like all of the chemicals that they use in their products and I didn&#x27;t think it was formulated for her specific hairtype, I mean, to stop breakage and whatnot. So, I shopped around forever trying to find a product that seemed to be what we needed but at an affordable price. I initially ordered this product in the 8oz size and now that I know it is perfect for her hair type I went ahead and ordered the 32 oz size since it is cheaper that way, it does say that once it is opened it has a shelf life of 12 months but we go through this stuff so quickly that I am sure we will have no problem using it all up within a year. I use this product as a detangler/leave in conditioner, it has the best results when her hair has been just washed but even if I don&#x27;t wash it I still get good results....I was just spraying it on her dry hair which works just fine but now I get her hair slightly damp first to make the product go further. It has a faint, pleasant smell, it is not greasy whatsoever which I find to be a very important qaulity. It does not dry crunchy. It enhances her curls, adds shine (not greasy shine, just natural shiny hair) and the curls dry fairly quickly and softly. I just spray it all over her hair, rub it in with my hands, take a wide tooth comb and detangle, then use my fingers to style her hair, then let it dry....I use this product in conjunction with the Cantu for Natural Hair moisturizing Curl Activator cream.....the mist bodifier works great by itself and even better with the Cantu....hope they don&#x27;t ever stop carrying these products because I absolutely love them and they are as natural as you can get for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair moisturized.  Great for two-strand twist out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;ve bought several 16oz bottles. I plan to use this bottle to refill my spray bottle. I will give a more detailed review about the quality of the product on the spray bottle page.</li>
            <li> After spending countless dollars trying to find something that would help soften by thick, dry hair Taliah Waajid is the truth! I originally bought the standard size bottle because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not (yes, Shea Butter I&#x27;m giving you the side eye). But it smells so good and makes my hair so manageable and fluffy that this is my must have when I wear my hair in a fro which is almost daily.</li>
            <li> There are so many things you can do with this item. I love the coconut like smell it offers. If you are someone that is a all natural person, this is the product to purchase. I often use it on weave hair as well, but when I take my hair down I love it just the same. It leave my hair as soft in it&#x27;s original state. I love using this after I cold wash my hair. It can be used every day, and a little goes a long ways. Great item to buy. I love using this product. I also used some of the other products from Taliah Vaajid.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for my natural hair.  I&#x27;m grateful Amazon sells it in the large size, since I cannot purchase it locally.</li>
            <li> If you have very curly hait, this product conditions and keeps your hair so soft and manageable. This is my third purchase!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it keeps my hair moisturized and it keeps knots out of it which makes detailing so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was my first time buying the 32oz. I use it on my hair as well as my two young daughters. My only issue was it appeared that the container was lacking about 1 or 2 oz.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and detangler. Smells great. I use it daily to soften and moisturizer my hair. I also use daily when my hair is in braids</li>
            <li> I was overjoyed to learn that I could buy this product in this size, I&#x27;m a faithful user though buying it at my local beauty supply store was become costly. This size is perfect for my families needs as we all have locks and use this mist  multiple times a week. The great this is this product goes a long way,no need to over saturate  the hair. It leaves our locks soft, well scented and shiny...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def be buying again, the product arrived as scheduled, well packaged, which when I ordered it I did not think about, the fact it could leak, this seller made sure it was nicely wrapped multiple times tightly and it only leaked just a little bit.</li>
