            <li>Super-moisturizing and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>smells so good  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the transitioning process and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good moisturizer for my hair.</li>
            <li>it smells good</li>
            <li>feels good and</li>
            <li>It also smells REALLY good.  </li>

            <li>Loved, loved, loved this product.</li>
            <li>Love using this product and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this hair butter!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought this product really  worked best when i needed to braid or twist my hair; i have 4b hair</li>
            <li>Its also nice for ponytails and braided styles.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast &amp; the product was wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>This has a heavier, creamy consistency, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for use in warm or humid weather.</li>
            <li>Today will be a warm day.</li>
            <li>everything always comes nicely wrapped this product</li>
            <li>I researched this product mostly based on reviews and thought it would be a good moisturizer for relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s better than most over the counter, drug store brands, it&#x27;s still not so great.  </li>
            <li>Salon products are really the best way to go for hair moisturizing and anti-breakage.</li>
            <li>I loved it the most when I used it during the time I had micro braids.</li>
            <li>It seems great however, it absorbs into my hair really quickly, it doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized after the day has ended.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, this seems like an excellent moisturiser!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes completely and it smells great!</li>
            <li>But I love love love it!</li>
            <li>Yes I did purchase this wonderful hair butter because I saw great reviews on YouTube on this hair butter cream, and everything I heard about this hair product is true blue.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice like a nice light mango cocoa scent.that is not bothersome.</li>
            <li>Exactly was I was looking for as a moisturizer and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered mine and went to store and got some more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Most scents bother me</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This will always be a staple product :).</li>
            <li>It has helped prevent breakage and gives me more than just a temporary sheen.  </li>
            <li>I like this a lot better than the Cantu Shea Moisture</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Lovely smell too.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say it is my favorite</li>
            <li>I really want to mix this product with Shea Moisture moisturizing cream for some reason I feel these two would make a great combo.</li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews and hearing about this product from many websites I decided to take a plunge and give a try.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased that I did.</li>
            <li>Mostly I apply to my ends and the breakage is reduced.</li>
            <li>and I love the size.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would do with my hair</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m 9 weeks post relaxer, I call myself stretching my relaxers.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and leaves hair soft with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product as well of Its&#x27; quality.</li>
            <li>Although, if you have afro textured  hair,make sure to apply it to your hair thoroughly otherwise it gets gunky.</li>
            <li>Idk, I may have to revisit it, as the last time I tried it, my hair didn&#x27;t seem impressed.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs well, and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li>The smell has a strong citrus aroma.  </li>
            <li>eh its ok nothing special about it</li>
            <li>APPLY A LARGE AMOUNT!!!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used by Elasta QP and for the most part I am quite pleased with this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Nice pretty product and worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>(online &amp; in-store)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my relaxed hair because I heard such great things.  </li>
            <li>However, for the winter it will keep your hair supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and fruity of course.</li>
            <li>and i realized i been missing out on the best moisturizer i use organic root stimulator oil moisturizer lotion.</li>
            <li>My twists were beautiful and then when I took them down I was even more impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the other reviews I&#x27;m sure this is a great product</li>
            <li>Great to use before flat ironing hair to keep hair from overly drying out</li>
            <li>this stuff is AMAZING right next to shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie but even more moisturizing!</li>
            <li>So I wouldnt personally use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer for dry thirsty hair.</li>
            <li>Great for dry conditioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural, and this is so amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect, its not to thick and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film over the hair.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>i really thought it would be a better moisurizer</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>It is a light, pleasant fruit scent that does not linger and is not loud or very strong to the nose (I am fragrant sensitive).</li>
            <li>I enjoy using right after showering.</li>
            <li>and I can pretty much maintain my straight hair for a good two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice many significant changes in the new formula</li>
            <li>Ilove this product and it came it quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, light smell and thick but not greasy consistency.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work simply because it smelled so good</li>
            <li>But it does work ok on my 3 years old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I am so happy about this hair butter as it makes my hair soft, not greasy and quenches my strands thirst (especially the ends of my hair</li>
            <li>I had transition to natural hair, and I must say, this is one of my favorite products out there to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is great for adding moisture and keeping hair soft, especially when you need to refresh a twist-out or braid-out style.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer for my 4B natural hair.</li>
            <li>works so well that it made the relaxed part of my hair look like I had gotten it freshly relaxed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is better for natural hair, or curly permed, or just curly, not for relaxed.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try something regardless of your hair type, this will be worth it.</li>
            <li>One other plus is it smells good, too.</li>
            <li>Small amounts are great</li>
            <li>She recommended this product as a daily moisturizer and I am glad I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Overall it is okay</li>
            <li>Once it dries in, my hair is so soft and so smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth, and soft whenever I use it.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it to my hair it did not disappear into my hair immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time moisturizering with a butter</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says..</li>
            <li>It does have quite a few good ingredients on the listing, although there are some silicones in there as well.  </li>
            <li>smells amazing, not super greasy, little goes along way , daily use, heat protectant , and like I said smells great !</li>
            <li>This smells really good and a little bit on your ends really helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>I found Hairveda&#x27;s red satin tea moisturizer to be a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be purchasing it again soon.</li>
            <li>but given i do have really reallly dry hair but for the most part it did what it promised.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this olive oil and mango butter to those natural/transitioning/relaxed as it works very well!</li>
            <li>my natural hair is so soft now YES!!!!!</li>
            <li>She has really curly hair and is much softer than mines.</li>
            <li>I must admit my hair Absolutely loves this stuff I wish I could get it by the gallon.</li>
            <li>My hair really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>It contains &#x27;cones&#x27; but my hair has not suffered at all, I think it has thrived really.</li>
            <li>Would you believe that this stuff gets my edges and nape straight?</li>
            <li>It will make your hair feel very greasy and make you not want to touch it.</li>
            <li>It really is like a butter.</li>
            <li>Its also very affordable</li>
            <li>I do plan to buy again because it is very affordable for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff really moisturizes without feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Too much moisture and oil can create bacteria and flakes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seal as much when I used this product</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you will have a product build-up issue.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>Using this product I was still able to wrap my wet hair even at week 9.</li>
            <li>It is really thick and smells good.</li>
            <li>and I think my hair felt more moisturized longer with this butter than the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>And WOW, I was hooked on this after my first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a moisturizing creme on clean hair and for daily moisture.</li>
            <li>and I admit I usually am willing to try any and every product out there that&#x27;s recommended by the natural gurus.</li>
            <li>do suggest you purchase it from Walgreens/Drugstore dot com as it is more than half price</li>
            <li>Quick back story:</li>
            <li>really glad I bought this product and have actually bought another bottle recently for my boyfriends mother!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product, especially for natural african-american hair.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if it is the mango in this product, but when I put it on my scalp, it make my head smell very funny to the point on the second day I had to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, but it leaves my hair very dry after a couple minutes after using it.</li>
            <li>I am natural but wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li>At week 10 I got a relaxer touch up only because I had an event to attend and wanted a fresh perm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old black female who decided it would be brilliant to bleach my hair and dye it pink.  </li>
            <li>I tend to only use this when my hair is in it&#x27;s flat ironed state which works great; it doesn&#x27;t feel too watery, too greasy nor too heavy.  </li>
            <li>so there was some new growth for it to contend with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a hair journey trying out new products.</li>
            <li>This was an inexpensive way to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that my hair was very soft and shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li>im not usually one to write reviews</li>
            <li>i will definitely recommend to all hair types although it is not an all natural product it works better than most expensive organic products in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My new growth has never been this manageable, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural girl.</li>
            <li>but it does sooth my scalp and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and have had to play around to see what products my hair likes and doesn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>it literally melts in your hair and my hair felt soooooo soft</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair manageable, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4b/4c.</li>
            <li>I have added some aloe vera to it and the results are soft manageable hair with volume and lots of shine.</li>
            <li>Keeps my strands moisturised and soft.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a bigger tub though, it&#x27;s a real staple product for my hair.</li>
            <li>but this was just simply too much.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is I wish it was sold in bigger quantity because I use it so much I go thru it really fast.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and it makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in shock of how soft my curls are.</li>
            <li>I AM protein sensitive and when I realized this, I knew I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I must say, I have never had such success in a moisturizer since growing my perm out and actually being natural.</li>
            <li>I will say it did keep my hair moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, pliable and elastic, which keeps it from breaking.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up to style my hair, it is manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>Now my natural hair?</li>
            <li>This product is EXTREMELY thick (think vanilla pudding), smells lovely, think sweets.</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning to natural hair and when I do my protective styles, this moisturizer is a must!!!  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey though, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I use this a few days after I&#x27;ve washed/conditioned my hair, and it really helps keep my hair soft and moist for a whole day!</li>
            <li>It really quenches dry hair and my hair is now soooo soft</li>
            <li>Spent soooo much money!</li>
            <li>I decided I would grow my hair back fresh and longer that it used to be (and my hair was originally mid back length).</li>
            <li>It moisturizes the hair very well, but it does not seem to want to dry.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I could be using too much, but I did it different ways in different sections of my hair</li>
            <li>THis moisturizer quenches my super dry african american hair.</li>
            <li>I use this on my scalp right before I gel my hair down</li>
            <li>Lastly, I am AA women with natural hair 4B/C hair.</li>
            <li>That can form bacteria on your scalp, if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>I recently grew my relaxer out and have officially been fully natural for about six months now.</li>
            <li>The molecular structure (how it looks on the teeny-tiny level) of mango butter is very similar to the natural oils that the scalp and body produces.</li>
            <li>Hair drinks this stuff up and is left moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I have learned that I only need a little bit because if you use too much, your hair will be white.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best out there, but it&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve tried to date :]</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my relaxed hair fuller and softer immediately.</li>
            <li> , I felt like eating it lOl</li>
            <li> I was not too happy about that because I am having some difficulty handling my hair because it is so thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Super-moisturizing and smells really good.  </li>
            <li> smells so good  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the transitioning process and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good moisturizer for my hair.</li>
            <li> it smells good</li>
            <li> feels good and</li>
            <li> It also smells REALLY good.  </li>
            <li> When I had relaxed hair, my hair LOVED this stuff, as well as my transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> Loved, loved, loved this product.</li>
            <li> Love using this product and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this hair butter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought this product really  worked best when i needed to braid or twist my hair; i have 4b hair</li>
            <li> Its also nice for ponytails and braided styles.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast &amp; the product was wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This has a heavier, creamy consistency, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for use in warm or humid weather.</li>
            <li> Today will be a warm day.</li>
            <li> everything always comes nicely wrapped this product</li>
            <li> I researched this product mostly based on reviews and thought it would be a good moisturizer for relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s better than most over the counter, drug store brands, it&#x27;s still not so great.  </li>
            <li> Salon products are really the best way to go for hair moisturizing and anti-breakage.</li>
            <li> I loved it the most when I used it during the time I had micro braids.</li>
            <li> It seems great however, it absorbs into my hair really quickly, it doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized after the day has ended.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, this seems like an excellent moisturiser!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes completely and it smells great!</li>
            <li> But I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Yes I did purchase this wonderful hair butter because I saw great reviews on YouTube on this hair butter cream, and everything I heard about this hair product is true blue.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice like a nice light mango cocoa scent.that is not bothersome.</li>
            <li> Exactly was I was looking for as a moisturizer and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered mine and went to store and got some more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Most scents bother me</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This will always be a staple product :).</li>
            <li> It has helped prevent breakage and gives me more than just a temporary sheen.  </li>
            <li> I like this a lot better than the Cantu Shea Moisture</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Lovely smell too.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t say it is my favorite</li>
            <li> I really want to mix this product with Shea Moisture moisturizing cream for some reason I feel these two would make a great combo.</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews and hearing about this product from many websites I decided to take a plunge and give a try.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> Mostly I apply to my ends and the breakage is reduced.</li>
            <li> and I love the size.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would do with my hair</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m 9 weeks post relaxer, I call myself stretching my relaxers.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and leaves hair soft with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product as well of Its&#x27; quality.</li>
            <li> Although, if you have afro textured  hair,make sure to apply it to your hair thoroughly otherwise it gets gunky.</li>
            <li> Idk, I may have to revisit it, as the last time I tried it, my hair didn&#x27;t seem impressed.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs well, and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li> The smell has a strong citrus aroma.  </li>
            <li> eh its ok nothing special about it</li>
            <li> APPLY A LARGE AMOUNT!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used by Elasta QP and for the most part I am quite pleased with this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Nice pretty product and worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> (online &amp; in-store)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my relaxed hair because I heard such great things.  </li>
            <li> However, for the winter it will keep your hair supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and fruity of course.</li>
            <li> and i realized i been missing out on the best moisturizer i use organic root stimulator oil moisturizer lotion.</li>
            <li> My twists were beautiful and then when I took them down I was even more impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the other reviews I&#x27;m sure this is a great product</li>
            <li> Great to use before flat ironing hair to keep hair from overly drying out</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMAZING right next to shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie but even more moisturizing!</li>
            <li> So I wouldnt personally use it on my own hair!</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer for dry thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> Great for dry conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural, and this is so amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect, its not to thick and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film over the hair.  </li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> i really thought it would be a better moisurizer</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> It is a light, pleasant fruit scent that does not linger and is not loud or very strong to the nose (I am fragrant sensitive).</li>
            <li> I enjoy using right after showering.</li>
            <li> and I can pretty much maintain my straight hair for a good two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice many significant changes in the new formula</li>
            <li> Ilove this product and it came it quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, light smell and thick but not greasy consistency.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work simply because it smelled so good</li>
            <li> But it does work ok on my 3 years old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I am so happy about this hair butter as it makes my hair soft, not greasy and quenches my strands thirst (especially the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> I had transition to natural hair, and I must say, this is one of my favorite products out there to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is great for adding moisture and keeping hair soft, especially when you need to refresh a twist-out or braid-out style.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for my 4B natural hair.</li>
            <li> works so well that it made the relaxed part of my hair look like I had gotten it freshly relaxed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is better for natural hair, or curly permed, or just curly, not for relaxed.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try something regardless of your hair type, this will be worth it.</li>
            <li> One other plus is it smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Small amounts are great</li>
            <li> She recommended this product as a daily moisturizer and I am glad I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Overall it is okay</li>
            <li> Once it dries in, my hair is so soft and so smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth, and soft whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it to my hair it did not disappear into my hair immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first time moisturizering with a butter</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says..</li>
            <li> It does have quite a few good ingredients on the listing, although there are some silicones in there as well.  </li>
            <li> smells amazing, not super greasy, little goes along way , daily use, heat protectant , and like I said smells great !</li>
            <li> This smells really good and a little bit on your ends really helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I found Hairveda&#x27;s red satin tea moisturizer to be a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this is that it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be purchasing it again soon.</li>
            <li> but given i do have really reallly dry hair but for the most part it did what it promised.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this olive oil and mango butter to those natural/transitioning/relaxed as it works very well!</li>
            <li> my natural hair is so soft now YES!!!!!</li>
            <li> She has really curly hair and is much softer than mines.</li>
            <li> I must admit my hair Absolutely loves this stuff I wish I could get it by the gallon.</li>
            <li> My hair really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> It contains &#x27;cones&#x27; but my hair has not suffered at all, I think it has thrived really.</li>
            <li> Would you believe that this stuff gets my edges and nape straight?</li>
            <li> It will make your hair feel very greasy and make you not want to touch it.</li>
            <li> It really is like a butter.</li>
            <li> Its also very affordable</li>
            <li> I do plan to buy again because it is very affordable for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff really moisturizes without feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Too much moisture and oil can create bacteria and flakes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seal as much when I used this product</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will have a product build-up issue.</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> Using this product I was still able to wrap my wet hair even at week 9.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and smells good.</li>
            <li> and I think my hair felt more moisturized longer with this butter than the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And WOW, I was hooked on this after my first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a moisturizing creme on clean hair and for daily moisture.</li>
            <li> and I admit I usually am willing to try any and every product out there that&#x27;s recommended by the natural gurus.</li>
            <li> do suggest you purchase it from Walgreens/Drugstore dot com as it is more than half price</li>
            <li> Quick back story:</li>
            <li> really glad I bought this product and have actually bought another bottle recently for my boyfriends mother!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, especially for natural african-american hair.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if it is the mango in this product, but when I put it on my scalp, it make my head smell very funny to the point on the second day I had to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, but it leaves my hair very dry after a couple minutes after using it.</li>
            <li> I am natural but wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li> At week 10 I got a relaxer touch up only because I had an event to attend and wanted a fresh perm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old black female who decided it would be brilliant to bleach my hair and dye it pink.  </li>
            <li> I tend to only use this when my hair is in it&#x27;s flat ironed state which works great; it doesn&#x27;t feel too watery, too greasy nor too heavy.  </li>
            <li> so there was some new growth for it to contend with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a hair journey trying out new products.</li>
            <li> This was an inexpensive way to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my hair was very soft and shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li> im not usually one to write reviews</li>
            <li> i will definitely recommend to all hair types although it is not an all natural product it works better than most expensive organic products in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My new growth has never been this manageable, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl.</li>
            <li> but it does sooth my scalp and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and have had to play around to see what products my hair likes and doesn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> it literally melts in your hair and my hair felt soooooo soft</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair manageable, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4b/4c.</li>
            <li> I have added some aloe vera to it and the results are soft manageable hair with volume and lots of shine.</li>
            <li> Keeps my strands moisturised and soft.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger tub though, it&#x27;s a real staple product for my hair.</li>
            <li> but this was just simply too much.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is I wish it was sold in bigger quantity because I use it so much I go thru it really fast.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and it makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in shock of how soft my curls are.</li>
            <li> I AM protein sensitive and when I realized this, I knew I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I must say, I have never had such success in a moisturizer since growing my perm out and actually being natural.</li>
            <li> I will say it did keep my hair moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, pliable and elastic, which keeps it from breaking.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up to style my hair, it is manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> Now my natural hair?</li>
            <li> This product is EXTREMELY thick (think vanilla pudding), smells lovely, think sweets.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning to natural hair and when I do my protective styles, this moisturizer is a must!!!  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey though, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this a few days after I&#x27;ve washed/conditioned my hair, and it really helps keep my hair soft and moist for a whole day!</li>
            <li> It really quenches dry hair and my hair is now soooo soft</li>
            <li> Spent soooo much money!</li>
            <li> I decided I would grow my hair back fresh and longer that it used to be (and my hair was originally mid back length).</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the hair very well, but it does not seem to want to dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I could be using too much, but I did it different ways in different sections of my hair</li>
            <li> THis moisturizer quenches my super dry african american hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp right before I gel my hair down</li>
            <li> Lastly, I am AA women with natural hair 4B/C hair.</li>
            <li> That can form bacteria on your scalp, if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> I recently grew my relaxer out and have officially been fully natural for about six months now.</li>
            <li> The molecular structure (how it looks on the teeny-tiny level) of mango butter is very similar to the natural oils that the scalp and body produces.</li>
            <li> Hair drinks this stuff up and is left moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I have learned that I only need a little bit because if you use too much, your hair will be white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a light pale green creamy texture, especially when applied to the hands and emulsified.</li>
            <li> one was good and the other had clearly gone bad.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and it is late afternoon now</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s helping with my hair growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my flat ironed hair and have had no reversion; I use it as the moisturizer in my moisturize/seal routine.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I decided to stay away from sew-ins and flat irons, so about four weeks ago I was referred by a friend to try the Elasta QP line of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> For anyone with troubled hair I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was a little too heavy for my hair, even though my hair usually likes a much more concentrated product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so like super serious!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really moisturized for at least two days.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it and order from here as long as I am in an APO, AP address.</li>
            <li> i only spent 6 bucks on this at walgreens go and buy!</li>
            <li> I did a big chop, and use it every other day on my TWA.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I put this throughout my hair to the ends in 4 sections every single night.  </li>
            <li> I am relaxed 4c and always need a relaxer touch up every 6 weeks because my new growth is so thick and dry.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough try it but use sparingly a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way since it instantly feels moisturized when applying.  </li>
            <li> A little actually goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Can be applied on wet or dry hair&lt;</li>
            <li> but I gave it away after a couple tries.</li>
            <li> I found the site mentioned above from another black female who wanted her hair to grow and got it past her booty.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really dry after only a few hours of wearing it!</li>
            <li> maybe it was old but it was all hard and as i had the other for comparison</li>
            <li> again a  little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> and I learned a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that say they will moisturize your hair</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY !</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisterizers, and nothing has done the work that this product does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews and let me tell you, it was money well spent!</li>
            <li> I saw they had this Olive Oil &amp; Mango Butter Moisturizer (which was something I needed because previous products I used made my hair very dry)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it doesnt weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> At week 4 I started applying, daily, a small amount to new growth only,  when applied to scalp it itches like crazy, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> Anywho, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will keep thick, coarse, hair moisturised, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I put a bit on the sides and nape, brush, and ties it down..</li>
            <li> I usually wrap, air dry and go</li>
            <li> so I now order it from them since its priced for less.</li>
            <li> OMG i been on my hair journey for a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> I used a slight bit on my hand &amp; added a little bit of water to it so that it wouldn&#x27;t be so concentrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying it, I roller set my hair and when I removed the rollers this morning I saw that the curls did not set tightly.  </li>
            <li> The only con: the mixture of mango and olive oil makes for a weird scent, but it&#x27;s not strong so it wasn&#x27;t enough to put me off the product.</li>
            <li> After I put it in my hair, I&#x27;ll use a little coconut oil or something equivalent</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;3. makes the hair noticeably softer in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, especially since I relaxed it.  </li>
            <li> May start to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Like every other hair cream, felt too thick.</li>
            <li> The product is not too greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and I am hard to find products that work on my dry, brittle and sometimes hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> With it being so thick it weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have had my eyes on this product for at least a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Use it on dry, damp or wet hair you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to wrap my hair after shampooing due to thick roots at week 5 .</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s AMAZING,I highly recommend it,you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Seriously, what was I waiting for trying this!</li>
            <li> it was undeniable something was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to describe but</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is overpriced on amazon.</li>
            <li> Without this, my hair is very difficult to comb.  </li>
            <li> so disappointed</li>
            <li> It was horrible on my hair</li>
            <li> Oh, my God, this is terrible for textured hair, or relaxed.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible for relaxed hair, and she has relaxed hair.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl. I use this on my scalp right before I gel my hair down (if I choose to wear that style). But the smell is incredible, almost makes you want to eat it! Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s helping with my hair growth but it does sooth my scalp and make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone.  I love this stuff.  Just wanted you all to know that you can purchase this product at Walgreens for $3.99.  Either online or in the actual store.  Just ordered mine and went to store and got some more.  Looking out for your pockets.</li>
            <li> Sold for $3.99 at WALGREENS!!! (online &amp; in-store)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. Smells great and leaves my relaxed hair fuller and softer immediately. This will continue to be a staple in my hair therapy routine!</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is the mango in this product, but when I put it on my scalp, it make my head smell very funny to the point on the second day I had to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product oh gosh my natural hair is so soft now YES!!!!! would buy again and again a  little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Most scents bother me but I had to admit this product smelled amazing! From the other reviews I&#x27;m sure this is a great product but it just didn&#x27;t agree with my hair. It left a residue. I&#x27;m natural and have had to play around to see what products my hair likes and doesn&#x27;t like and this was one my hair didn&#x27;t like. I really wanted this to work simply because it smelled so good but I gave it away after a couple tries.</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;m transitioning to natural, and this is so amazing on my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best out there, but it&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve tried to date :]</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really dry after only a few hours of wearing it! So I wouldnt personally use it on my own hair! But it does work ok on my 3 years old daughter&#x27;s hair. She has really curly hair and is much softer than mines. So it works different on her hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many! Spent soooo much money! I have had my eyes on this product for at least a couple of years. I have had some difficulty finding it on the ground. I stumbled upon it on the ground and tried it. My hair is like butter! A little goes a long way! I also ordered a couple of jars on Amazon and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. As a recovering product junkie, I want to throw out all of the order moisturizers I swore by. This will always be a staple product :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out and plan to buy another!  Super-moisturizing and smells really good.  This has to be the #1 and if not close to the #1 moisturizer for relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I use this a few days after I&#x27;ve washed/conditioned my hair, and it really helps keep my hair soft and moist for a whole day! Also, it smells wonderful. &lt;3</li>
            <li> I brought this product after I read the reviews. The smell is wonderful and not to strong.  The texture is perfect, its not to thick and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film over the hair.  You can use it every day if you want. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it and it comes in a big jar.  Its perfect</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my relaxed hair because I heard such great things.  It was horrible on my hair but I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Like HG wonderful.  Don&#x27;t order from Amazon.  I got mine for $3.99 at Walgreens.com because my local Walgreens didn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I have watched dozens of YouTube videos with naturalistas praising this product!  I couldn&#x27;t find any in my local stores, so I purchased here.  This is an awesome product.  Without this, my hair is very difficult to comb.  It has helped prevent breakage and gives me more than just a temporary sheen.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I thought this product really  worked best when i needed to braid or twist my hair; i have 4b hair</li>
            <li> I have been on my HHG(healthy hair journey) since 2009 and since then been trying to find a staple moisturizer....well this is finally it! it literally melts in your hair and my hair felt soooooo soft,it&#x27;s AMAZING,I highly recommend it,you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I must admit my hair Absolutely loves this stuff I wish I could get it by the gallon. It keeps my hair manageable, soft and moisturized. I have natural 3c/4b/4c.</li>
            <li> Seriously, what was I waiting for trying this! I&#x27;m a code-5 product junkie and I admit I usually am willing to try any and every product out there that&#x27;s recommended by the natural gurus. I held off on this for the longest and I regret it. The smell is delicious! I&#x27;ve been using it on my flat ironed hair and have had no reversion; I use it as the moisturizer in my moisturize/seal routine. I am so happy about this hair butter as it makes my hair soft, not greasy and quenches my strands thirst (especially the ends of my hair&lt;br /&gt;). I like this a lot better than the Cantu Shea Moisture leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest you purchase it from Walgreens/Drugstore dot com as it is more than half price there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this olive oil and mango butter to those natural/transitioning/relaxed as it works very well!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I am currently transitioning to natural hair and when I do my protective styles, this moisturizer is a must!!!  It keeps my hair soft and smelling great.  I have recommended this product to family and friends and they rave about it as well.  I have tried a lot of products but this is the only one that has given me the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, not super greasy, little goes along way , daily use, heat protectant , and like I said smells great !</li>
            <li> Yes I did purchase this wonderful hair butter because I saw great reviews on YouTube on this hair butter cream, and everything I heard about this hair product is true blue. Use it on dry, damp or wet hair you will not be disappointed. I have added some aloe vera to it and the results are soft manageable hair with volume and lots of shine. Can&#x27;t say enough try it but use sparingly a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A must-have hair staple. Great moisturizer, light smell and thick but not greasy consistency.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Great for my twist outs! Keeps my strands moisturised and soft. Lovely smell too. Also have used it as a de-tangler and it works wonders. My hair really enjoys it. Wish it came in a bigger tub though, it&#x27;s a real staple product for my hair. It contains &#x27;cones&#x27; but my hair has not suffered at all, I think it has thrived really. It is my &#x27;go-to&#x27; hair butter.</li>
            <li> I love this hair butter! I am natural but wear my hair straight. Would you believe that this stuff gets my edges and nape straight? I couldn&#x27;t either! I put a bit on the sides and nape, brush, and ties it down..VOILA!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a recommendation from blackhairgrow.com because my hair has just recently started to grow. Quick back story: I&#x27;m a 20 year old black female who decided it would be brilliant to bleach my hair and dye it pink.  About six months after doing so the front of my hair fell off. I then took one of those buzzing razor things and shaved my entire head. I decided I would grow my hair back fresh and longer that it used to be (and my hair was originally mid back length). I found the site mentioned above from another black female who wanted her hair to grow and got it past her booty. She recommended this product as a daily moisturizer and I am glad I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;1. Can be applied on wet or dry hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Great to use before flat ironing hair to keep hair from overly drying out&lt;br /&gt;3. makes the hair noticeably softer in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con -&lt;br /&gt;NEVER APPLY A LARGE AMOUNT!!! I&#x27;m so like super serious! It will make your hair feel very greasy and make you not want to touch it. Small amounts are great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I bought this product and have actually bought another bottle recently for my boyfriends mother! I hope it works for you</li>
            <li> I had transition to natural hair, and I must say, this is one of my favorite products out there to use on my hair. It does the job. My hair has grown a lot and I thank this product. It helps to prevent breakage because it keeps my hair moisturize. I truly recommend this for all hair type. Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This was a little too heavy for my hair, even though my hair usually likes a much more concentrated product but this was just simply too much. It really is like a butter. I switched to Wave Nouveau and my hair couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> i ordered two elasta qp olive oil &amp; mango butter moisturizers from cbs express. one was good and the other had clearly gone bad. maybe it was old but it was all hard and as i had the other for comparison it was undeniable something was wrong. so disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, especially for natural african-american hair.  It is great for adding moisture and keeping hair soft, especially when you need to refresh a twist-out or braid-out style.  It does contain water so it can cause your hair to \\&quot;go back\\&quot; if it is blown out or straightened.  But I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this moisturizer.  I just love the smell.  The only thing I can say is I wish it was sold in bigger quantity because I use it so much I go thru it really fast.</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMAZING right next to shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie but even more moisturizing! the smell is nice like a nice light mango cocoa scent.that is not bothersome. It really quenches dry hair and my hair is now soooo soft i will definitely recommend to all hair types although it is not an all natural product it works better than most expensive organic products in my opinion. Its also very affordable i only spent 6 bucks on this at walgreens go and buy! i will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used by Elasta QP and for the most part I am quite pleased with this moisturizer.  I tend to only use this when my hair is in it&#x27;s flat ironed state which works great; it doesn&#x27;t feel too watery, too greasy nor too heavy.  I also don&#x27;t suffer from any reverting to my ends or roots and I can pretty much maintain my straight hair for a good two weeks.  The product plus has no mineral oil and petroleum so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it sitting on your hair.  A little bit goes a long way since it instantly feels moisturized when applying.  Nice pretty product and worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> A little actually goes a long way.  It does have quite a few good ingredients on the listing, although there are some silicones in there as well.  I have had it for just about 3-4 weeks and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. After I wash my hair I use a coconut oil mixture I make at home myself and this together. Leaves my hair feeling so soft and moisturized. Its also nice for ponytails and braided styles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two or three months now; I purchased this product from a nearby Walgreens for about $7. Overall it is okay, I can&#x27;t say it is my favorite but I will purchase again because of the price and what it does. It is difficult for me to describe but the product sort of coats the hair then actually moisturizing it. Using this product, there were times when I felt as though I didn&#x27;t need to moisturize my hair in the evening or even the following morning. I really want to mix this product with Shea Moisture moisturizing cream for some reason I feel these two would make a great combo. I was not a fan of using Shea moisture cream solo . I do plan to buy again because it is very affordable for me. Lastly, I am AA women with natural hair 4B/C hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast &amp; the product was wonderful!!! It smells nice &amp; its a good moisturizer for my hair! It is a little pricey though, but it was worth it! This is definitely in my hair regimen now!</li>
            <li> I picked up a jar a couple months ago but am just now getting around to trying it. I&#x27;m glad I did! I have 4a/4b hair and this keeps my hair moisturized all day without feeling greasy. This has a heavier, creamy consistency, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for use in warm or humid weather. However, for the winter it will keep your hair supple and smooth. Also, if you decided to straighten your hair there&#x27;s not enough water in it to make your hair revert. The only con: the mixture of mango and olive oil makes for a weird scent, but it&#x27;s not strong so it wasn&#x27;t enough to put me off the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and I am hard to find products that work on my dry, brittle and sometimes hard to manage hair. After reading so many reviews and hearing about this product from many websites I decided to take a plunge and give a try. I am really pleased that I did. The product is not too greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff. Once it dries in, my hair is so soft and so smooth. I believe it actually benefits my hair as well. Mostly I apply to my ends and the breakage is reduced. For anyone with troubled hair I would strongly recommend this product. It&#x27;s always a headache for me to find products and now I&#x27;ve finally found something.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for my 4B natural hair. Makes my hair so smooth, and soft whenever I use it. Will continue to use it and order from here as long as I am in an APO, AP address. Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li> Loved, loved, loved this product. It is a great moisturizer for dry thirsty hair. It can be used to moisturize and seal at night.</li>
            <li> Purchase this item because it was recommended by a friend.  Exactly was I was looking for as a moisturizer and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, but it leaves my hair very dry after a couple minutes after using it. I am relaxed. I gave it 2 stars only because of the scent, I felt like eating it lOl</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and it is late afternoon now and my hair still looks and feels moisturised.  When I first applied it to my hair it did not disappear into my hair immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it, I roller set my hair and when I removed the rollers this morning I saw that the curls did not set tightly.  The moist. has since disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess next time I will use setting lotion since there isn&#x27;t any ingredient in there that would cause the curls to set anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 12 weeks post relaxer so there was some new growth for it to contend with and it won the battle.  My hair is thin, especially since I relaxed it.  This moist. works so well that it made the relaxed part of my hair look like I had gotten it freshly relaxed.  I was not too happy about that because I am having some difficulty handling my hair because it is so thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the jar says: \\&quot;softer fuller looking hair\\&quot;, I can attest to the softer, but not to the fuller part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this seems like an excellent moisturiser!</li>
            <li> Ilove this product and it came it quickly in the mail.  Its a great product for kids and I love the size.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry hair. Put in hair overnight, and felt an immediate difference the next morning.  This stuff really moisturizes without feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would do with my hair but it turns out it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I have relaxed hair and it makes my hair really soft. A little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t use a lot. After I put it in my hair, I&#x27;ll use a little coconut oil or something equivalent and I&#x27;m good to go! I think it will last a long time. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I heard all about how wonderful this product was and decided to try it for my hair journey.  Oh, my God, this is terrible for textured hair, or relaxed.  It has some sticky stuff in it.  It moisturizes the hair very well, but it does not seem to want to dry.  This is better for natural hair, or curly permed, or just curly, not for relaxed.  Maybe I could be using too much, but I did it different ways in different sections of my hair and I still do not like the way it feels.  So I mixed some of it with my ORS Olive Oil Cream because I dont want to waist it.  But, I will say I will not be purchasing this product again.  Ms. Lora on youtube does not know what she is talking about.  This product is terrible for relaxed hair, and she has relaxed hair.  She must of been paid for that video.  The smell has a strong citrus aroma.  I dont see where they have used olive oil in this product at all.  It has been over an hour and my hair still feels damp in some areas.  That can form bacteria on your scalp, if you are not careful.  The scalp needs to breathe.  Too much moisture and oil can create bacteria and flakes.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m 9 weeks post relaxer, I call myself stretching my relaxers. I&#x27;ve tried other products that say they will moisturize your hair but they did not do the job. This product is awesome. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY ! The smell is light and fruity of course. I&#x27;m still in shock of how soft my curls are. Today will be a warm day. So I&#x27;ll see how they hold up after the gym and going outside!</li>
            <li> Great product! Unfortunately it is overpriced on amazon. walgreens has it for 3.99 so I now order it from them since its priced for less. A little goes a long way, and it doesnt weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I like it...I&#x27;m on a hair journey trying out new products. This was my first time moisturizering with a butter and I learned a little goes a long way. I didn&#x27;t seal as much when I used this product and I think my hair felt more moisturized longer with this butter than the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. I can see myself purchasing again....FYI: I have relaxed 4C hair.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff. I did a big chop, and use it every other day on my TWA. May start to use it everyday. It smells great, and leaves hair soft with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> THis moisturizer quenches my super dry african american hair. If you want to try something regardless of your hair type, this will be worth it. THe packaging was also excellent.</li>
            <li> **I ended up giving the product away because it made my hair break at one point. I think it was the protein in it. I AM protein sensitive and when I realized this, I knew I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it. Hopefully this review helps those who can use protein like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3c/4a coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known about this creme for ages but finally took the plunge to try it out. And WOW, I was hooked on this after my first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a moisturizing creme on clean hair and for daily moisture. I focus on the length of my hair and then especially my ends. I use about a nickel sized amount per section of hair. All I can say is that my hair was very soft and shiny and moisturized. My twists were beautiful and then when I took them down I was even more impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a light pale green creamy texture, especially when applied to the hands and emulsified. It melts into the hair. It is a light, pleasant fruit scent that does not linger and is not loud or very strong to the nose (I am fragrant sensitive).</li>
            <li> i really thought it would be a better moisurizer but given i do have really reallly dry hair but for the most part it did what it promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my relaxed hair for about three weeks.  It seems great however, it absorbs into my hair really quickly, it doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized after the day has ended.  If you use too much, you will have a product build-up issue. This is my nite regimen as I would use this on my hair then seal the ends with argan oil.  I found Hairveda&#x27;s red satin tea moisturizer to be a whole lot better. It leaves my hair really moisturized for at least two days. Check it out!!</li>
            <li> I recently grew my relaxer out and have officially been fully natural for about six months now. I decided to stay away from sew-ins and flat irons, so about four weeks ago I was referred by a friend to try the Elasta QP line of shampoo and conditioner. I wanted to do my research before I bought so I came to amazon to look at the reviews for all of the products I could find. I saw they had this Olive Oil &amp; Mango Butter Moisturizer (which was something I needed because previous products I used made my hair very dry) therefore I decided to invest and try it. I must say, I have never had such success in a moisturizer since growing my perm out and actually being natural. I love this product so much. I bought it from Walgreens for 5.99. The only downside to this is that it runs out very quickly. I will need to refill this tub soon. But I love love love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen this at the store but never wanted to pay the listed price. This was an inexpensive way to try a new moisturizer. I enjoy using right after showering.</li>
            <li> eh its ok nothing special about it</li>
            <li> The molecular structure (how it looks on the teeny-tiny level) of mango butter is very similar to the natural oils that the scalp and body produces. Hair drinks this stuff up and is left moisturized and soft. Great for dry conditioning.</li>
            <li> I tried this product over the summer. It made my hair shed alot.  Something in it doesn&#x27;t agree with my hair.  I will say it did keep my hair moisturized and soft. It is really thick and smells good. A little bit does go a long way with this product. With it being so thick it weighed my hair down. I didn&#x27;t like that either.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with the shipping everything always comes nicely wrapped this product smells so good  im not usually one to write reviews thanks again</li>
            <li> I bough this at Walmart for 5.68. Walgreens you would have to pay shipping which totals up to 9 bucks. I put this on my ends and they instantly got moisturized and no hair broke off when I combed it ! This smells really good and a little bit on your ends really helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome moisturizer, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I don&#x27;t notice many significant changes in the new formula but I think it&#x27;s still awesome. Smells great, absorbs well, and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Essentially, with any product, you get what you pay for.  I researched this product mostly based on reviews and thought it would be a good moisturizer for relaxed hair.  While it&#x27;s better than most over the counter, drug store brands, it&#x27;s still not so great.  Salon products are really the best way to go for hair moisturizing and anti-breakage.</li>
            <li> This product has been my staple product in my hair care regimen. I have tried other moisterizers, and nothing has done the work that this product does. I don&#x27;t even need to apply an oil for sealing (but i do when I can, which is often). I am on my third one I believe... so yea, I aint going no where!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! The smell is awesome. I have learned that I only need a little bit because if you use too much, your hair will be white. I loved it the most when I used it during the time I had micro braids. I used a slight bit on my hand &amp; added a little bit of water to it so that it wouldn&#x27;t be so concentrated. It makes my hair feel so soft. I am a 4b/4c.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It smells lovely. I will certainly be purchasing it again soon.</li>
            <li> I am relaxed 4c and always need a relaxer touch up every 6 weeks because my new growth is so thick and dry. Started using this product 30 days ago and I love it. At week 4 I started applying, daily, a small amount to new growth only,  when applied to scalp it itches like crazy, don&#x27;t know why. My new growth has never been this manageable, soft and moisturized. At week 6 to my surprise I didn&#x27;t need a relaxer touch up, same for weeks 7, 8, and 9. At week 10 I got a relaxer touch up only because I had an event to attend and wanted a fresh perm. Now my goal is to relax every 13 weeks.  Only  4 relaxer touch ups per year,  saves money and thickens hair. I have a short bob cut and after shampooing and conditioning  I usually wrap, air dry and go and it&#x27;s difficult to wrap my hair after shampooing due to thick roots at week 5 . Using this product I was still able to wrap my wet hair even at week 9. Incredible !!!!!! I LOVE this stuff. One other plus is it smells good, too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product as well of Its&#x27; quality. Although, if you have afro textured  hair,make sure to apply it to your hair thoroughly otherwise it gets gunky. also great moisturizer product.</li>
            <li> Love using this product and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the transitioning process and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good moisturizer for my hair. I bought this product based on the reviews and let me tell you, it was money well spent! It moisturizes completely and it smells great! I recommend!</li>
            <li> OMG i been on my hair journey for a year and a half now. and i realized i been missing out on the best moisturizer i use organic root stimulator oil moisturizer lotion. but this elasta qp mango butter and olive oil is the best there is out there u ask me.. it smells good feels good and it does exactly what it says.. i recommend this product to all women. and if u suffer from dryness this is what u need.. its amazing i swear by it.. try it out now what are u waitin for lol</li>
            <li> Like every other hair cream, felt too thick.</li>
            <li> This hair moisturizer does just what it says.  It makes my hair soft, pliable and elastic, which keeps it from breaking.  I put this throughout my hair to the ends in 4 sections every single night.  When I wake up to style my hair, it is manageable and soft.  It also smells REALLY good.  A little bit goes a long way.  My hair is no longer dry and brittle.  The prices for this product are best at Walgreens.  I cannot recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> When I had relaxed hair, my hair LOVED this stuff, as well as my transitioning hair. Now my natural hair? Idk, I may have to revisit it, as the last time I tried it, my hair didn&#x27;t seem impressed. This product is EXTREMELY thick (think vanilla pudding), smells lovely, think sweets. Some people say its too heavy, but I believe it depends upon how much product you use. Anywho, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will keep thick, coarse, hair moisturised, this is the product for you.</li>
