            <li>this is my favorite Dr Denese product , however,  I think all of her products are exceptional ( these I just can&#x27;t do without )</li>
            <li>I easily pass for 45!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought they were being polite (and very kind) but my physicians (including my dermatologist) say \\&quot;whatever you&#x27;re doing keep doing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Her products work better than Philosophy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this product for what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and so does my daughter.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>not even sure what it is</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick delivery, everything is ok.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>however it made my skin for oily and so it made me breakout more.</li>
            <li>Use a lot of her products, and love them all.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Denese&#x27;s products, a bit pricey</li>
            <li>It helps my skin to stay nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love most of her products.</li>
            <li>love this product , you can see the difference</li>
            <li>I love the smell :)</li>
            <li>Now I make sure that I do not run out.</li>
            <li>Love these, part of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing from another source but found it at this site for a better price with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Have used Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for years and love them...</li>
            <li>I use this product in the morning and on top of that I use Obagi Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I find they work well together to generate  healthy skin cell turnover and boost collagen.  </li>
            <li>If my magical elixir or whatever is out there</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No oiliness or dryness at all...just fresh healthy looking skin!</li>
            <li>So easy to use in this format.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received the product very quickly from seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried these on Amazon, and not paid full price on QVC.  </li>
            <li>Not sure they are all that firming, but they are very good astringent pads, and get your skin nice and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>After the serum absorbs, I use either Dr. Denese Triple Strength Advanced Wrinkle Smoother or Dr. Denese HydroShield Face Emulsion.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased these on QVC as a set</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product after seeing a presentation on QVC with Dr. Denese.</li>
            <li>Tried the Hydroshield Cleansing Cream for the first time and love the feel of this on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin started breaking out again, it hasn&#x27;t for quite a while because I used the original pads.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clean and youthful.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean &amp; tingly after using.  </li>
            <li>I paid such a high price on QVC and I wanted to get more when I found the great prices here.</li>
            <li>I used the entire product, it is good at cleaning your skin</li>
            <li>People can&#x27;t believe my true age.</li>
            <li>bu they are much more reasonably priced here.</li>
            <li>The facial pads were definitely a good buy.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than all of those products you would pay three of four times as much for.</li>
            <li>These pads mildly exfoliate and help keep your skin smooth-looking.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to get into my facial lines and make them look more prominent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin all of my life, but now that I&#x27;m a new senior citizen, they help me keep my skin tone even, clear, and my pores clean, and my skin tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and have seen a huge improvement in my skin (smoothness and very few breakouts).  </li>
            <li>I have been pleased with all her products so far.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good price for a beauty product I have used for several years.</li>
            <li>These pads help to keep my complexion fresh and even up skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by best kept secret...</li>
            <li>It is vital for a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>So, thank you Dr. Denese for creating products with the right percentage of ingredients  that enable them to do what you say they do and thank you to Amazon for making the products affordable.  </li>
            <li>Lot of liquid in each bottle, Just the right amount.</li>
            <li>these pads really clean your face and make your complexion look so good..would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This product as well used with her serum work exactly as stated in her literature.</li>
            <li>I am a Dr. Denese avid user and love these facial pads for day time.  </li>
            <li>MY FACIAL SKIN LOOK SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>at first I could see a glow to my skin and people at work</li>
            <li>I love these firming facial pads, and have been using them nightly since they first came out.</li>
            <li>Love these skin firming pads along with the facial wash.</li>
            <li>I will be buying for many years into the future.</li>
            <li>I got a red face after the first application, then realized I need to be more gentle with the pads.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old, many people tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But after using the products faithfully for about 6 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many of Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for a long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend her products without reservation!!&lt;br /&gt;The facial pads work wonders on your face, reducing wrinkle lines while keeping your face looking youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li>Product excellent for daily facial cleansing at night, or even other times.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel clean, hydrated and not dry and taught!</li>
            <li>Great value and convenient for getting rid of dead skin cells, will always have this is my daily routine,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>and I am a real fan.</li>
            <li>Preps skin in a gentle way and makes the skin feel refreshed and moist.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Dr Denese to everyone!</li>
            <li>This really tightens up my face.</li>
            <li>The pads come really soaked with the product.</li>
            <li>It looks much clearer and firmer.</li>
            <li>I hope to find it soon as I really need something.</li>
            <li>Also, the pads are almost dripping because there is so much product on them, they do not skimp on product.</li>
            <li>The advanced firming facial pads in conjuction with the Hydroshield serum is a Winner.  </li>
            <li>My first attempt was never processed and I was shipped a new 90-day supply and my credit card</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is any better than the generic pads, but this is what I&#x27;m using now, primarily because I use other Dr. Denese products and I love them!</li>
            <li>Hands down better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that promises to help firm up your face,nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I felt more refreshed than firm.</li>
            <li>and this is the one Dr Denese product that I just can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>We both cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I am a new convert to anything made by Dr. Denese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sent me a prepaid return label for the new shipment, and said the charge would be refunded to my credit card.</li>
            <li>- I won&#x27;t live without these pads.</li>
            <li>Someone responded that this product is not for use on the neck, but here&#x27;s why I apply it ( wiping gently nightly with the same single pad) to my face and neck : While no claim is made by the company about its effectiveness in removing, over time, and possibly preventing skin tags on the neck, nor do I maintain that it&#x27;s suitable for others, it has worked for me for years.</li>
            <li>These pads do help keep my mature skin more firm.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Advanced Firming Facial Pads for several years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  </li>
            <li>I use Dr. Denese&#x27;s Advanced Firming Facial Pads 1-2 times daily.  </li>
            <li>Because these pads really do generate skin cell turnover for me, I find I must use an SFP30+ broad spectrum day cream to protect my new skin from the sun&#x27;s aging rays.  </li>
            <li>Usually my completion is very clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>They are very moist and do not dry out in the jar.  </li>
            <li>The pads come in a jar, they are saturated with product and there is some clear liquid product in the jar as well.  </li>
            <li>wow, yes, spend the money.  </li>
            <li>Skin is soooo soft &amp; skin firmer.</li>
            <li>old) try it</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything out there and nothing worked as this product with my 48 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin that often is irritated by glycolic and retinol products.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and wanted something that was recommended for toning/firming my face.</li>
            <li>I am an old fan of this product.</li>
            <li>These facial pads really do the job.</li>
            <li>After using this regimen for 45 days, my small pores are now microscopic, my nasal labio fold lines appear plumped, my marionette lines are definitely shortened, and the fine lines seem to be vanishing.  </li>
            <li>The container had no seal, the pads were soaked and dripping wet with something that did not smell or feel like the real Dr. Denese product.</li>
            <li>I receive a lot of compliments on my skin and feel it is due in large part to this product line.</li>
            <li>I really think they are slowing down my skin aging.</li>
            <li>not sure if there is any firming going on, but everything just looks better, spots, clarity, pores, maybe even a little glow happening.</li>
            <li>But today I noticed the refund came through, minus about $9, which I assume means they are charging me shipping for the order they should never have sent me in the first place due to their error.</li>
            <li>I see a little improvement in my skin, but guess I am always searching for something that I can really tell a difference.</li>

            <li> My skin started breaking out again, it hasn&#x27;t for quite a while because I used the original pads.</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clean and youthful.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean &amp; tingly after using.  </li>
            <li> I paid such a high price on QVC and I wanted to get more when I found the great prices here.</li>
            <li> I used the entire product, it is good at cleaning your skin</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t believe my true age.</li>
            <li> bu they are much more reasonably priced here.</li>
            <li> The facial pads were definitely a good buy.  </li>
            <li> It is so much better than all of those products you would pay three of four times as much for.</li>
            <li> These pads mildly exfoliate and help keep your skin smooth-looking.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to get into my facial lines and make them look more prominent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin all of my life, but now that I&#x27;m a new senior citizen, they help me keep my skin tone even, clear, and my pores clean, and my skin tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product and have seen a huge improvement in my skin (smoothness and very few breakouts).  </li>
            <li> I have been pleased with all her products so far.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price for a beauty product I have used for several years.</li>
            <li> These pads help to keep my complexion fresh and even up skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by best kept secret...</li>
            <li> It is vital for a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> So, thank you Dr. Denese for creating products with the right percentage of ingredients  that enable them to do what you say they do and thank you to Amazon for making the products affordable.  </li>
            <li> Lot of liquid in each bottle, Just the right amount.</li>
            <li> these pads really clean your face and make your complexion look so good..would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This product as well used with her serum work exactly as stated in her literature.</li>
            <li> I am a Dr. Denese avid user and love these facial pads for day time.  </li>
            <li> MY FACIAL SKIN LOOK SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> at first I could see a glow to my skin and people at work</li>
            <li> I love these firming facial pads, and have been using them nightly since they first came out.</li>
            <li> Love these skin firming pads along with the facial wash.</li>
            <li> I will be buying for many years into the future.</li>
            <li> I got a red face after the first application, then realized I need to be more gentle with the pads.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old, many people tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> But after using the products faithfully for about 6 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many of Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for a long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend her products without reservation!!&lt;br /&gt;The facial pads work wonders on your face, reducing wrinkle lines while keeping your face looking youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li> Product excellent for daily facial cleansing at night, or even other times.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel clean, hydrated and not dry and taught!</li>
            <li> Great value and convenient for getting rid of dead skin cells, will always have this is my daily routine,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> and I am a real fan.</li>
            <li> Preps skin in a gentle way and makes the skin feel refreshed and moist.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Dr Denese to everyone!</li>
            <li> This really tightens up my face.</li>
            <li> The pads come really soaked with the product.</li>
            <li> It looks much clearer and firmer.</li>
            <li> I hope to find it soon as I really need something.</li>
            <li> Also, the pads are almost dripping because there is so much product on them, they do not skimp on product.</li>
            <li> The advanced firming facial pads in conjuction with the Hydroshield serum is a Winner.  </li>
            <li> My first attempt was never processed and I was shipped a new 90-day supply and my credit card</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is any better than the generic pads, but this is what I&#x27;m using now, primarily because I use other Dr. Denese products and I love them!</li>
            <li> Hands down better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that promises to help firm up your face,nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I felt more refreshed than firm.</li>
            <li> and this is the one Dr Denese product that I just can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> We both cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I am a new convert to anything made by Dr. Denese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sent me a prepaid return label for the new shipment, and said the charge would be refunded to my credit card.</li>
            <li> - I won&#x27;t live without these pads.</li>
            <li> Someone responded that this product is not for use on the neck, but here&#x27;s why I apply it ( wiping gently nightly with the same single pad) to my face and neck : While no claim is made by the company about its effectiveness in removing, over time, and possibly preventing skin tags on the neck, nor do I maintain that it&#x27;s suitable for others, it has worked for me for years.</li>
            <li> These pads do help keep my mature skin more firm.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Advanced Firming Facial Pads for several years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  </li>
            <li> I use Dr. Denese&#x27;s Advanced Firming Facial Pads 1-2 times daily.  </li>
            <li> Because these pads really do generate skin cell turnover for me, I find I must use an SFP30+ broad spectrum day cream to protect my new skin from the sun&#x27;s aging rays.  </li>
            <li> Usually my completion is very clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> They are very moist and do not dry out in the jar.  </li>
            <li> The pads come in a jar, they are saturated with product and there is some clear liquid product in the jar as well.  </li>
            <li> wow, yes, spend the money.  </li>
            <li> Skin is soooo soft &amp; skin firmer.</li>
            <li> old) try it</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything out there and nothing worked as this product with my 48 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin that often is irritated by glycolic and retinol products.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and wanted something that was recommended for toning/firming my face.</li>
            <li> I am an old fan of this product.</li>
            <li> These facial pads really do the job.</li>
            <li> After using this regimen for 45 days, my small pores are now microscopic, my nasal labio fold lines appear plumped, my marionette lines are definitely shortened, and the fine lines seem to be vanishing.  </li>
            <li> The container had no seal, the pads were soaked and dripping wet with something that did not smell or feel like the real Dr. Denese product.</li>
            <li> I receive a lot of compliments on my skin and feel it is due in large part to this product line.</li>
            <li> I really think they are slowing down my skin aging.</li>
            <li> not sure if there is any firming going on, but everything just looks better, spots, clarity, pores, maybe even a little glow happening.</li>
            <li> But today I noticed the refund came through, minus about $9, which I assume means they are charging me shipping for the order they should never have sent me in the first place due to their error.</li>
            <li> I see a little improvement in my skin, but guess I am always searching for something that I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months and my skin is better than ever before with less breakouts, less dryness, less wrinkles and much firmer.</li>
            <li> so they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use them every day, sometimes twice a day, even though the directions suggest a less frequent use.  </li>
            <li> They tell me my skin is tight with nearly invisible pores and an even skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is better and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Love it and it is much less expensive at Amazon than QVC!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I use one pad each evening, after cleansing my face, let the product from the&lt;br /&gt;pad dry, then I apply my serum and night cream.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and could not live without it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients burns my eyes with the fumes and as long as I keep them closed, the product does remove make-up.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few different makes of exfoliating pads</li>
            <li> At night I use TNS serum on a wet face.</li>
            <li> Not even my Chanel eye cream, since I use these products on my eye areas as well, being careful with the Dr. Denese not getting too close to the eye...if you try this skin regime your skin will transform itself...</li>
            <li> Even a half hoes a long way.  </li>
            <li> So from now, I find this product CHEAPER on Amazon with an extremely prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have been using NuSkin Nano Vitamins...</li>
            <li> when applied, other times I feel no tingling sensation at all.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my pore size reduced due to my skin</li>
            <li> every other night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few months I started to get little white pimples just underneath the skin.</li>
            <li> With the 2 products, I have to say, my rosacea is very minimal and my pores are non-existent.</li>
            <li> If you have never used glycolic or other similar products, start slow with this, as it will tingle a bit.  </li>
            <li> age spots faded, not gone, but definitely faded, my skin is smoother, my pores have shrunk by at least half.  </li>
            <li> I used someone else&#x27;s advice and cut these in half before use.</li>
            <li> I buy the 100 count and cut them in half</li>
            <li> Using half a pad is plenty after removing my makeup and washing my face at night.  </li>
            <li> SLIGHT MEDICINAL SMELL</li>
            <li> The lid must be sealed tightly after each use.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if these little pads worked or not.  </li>
            <li> It does burn just a little for a few seconds, but it isn&#x27;t so bothersome that I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> I especially didn&#x27;t like the day cream as it is very thick and rubs off on phone, clothes, etc.</li>
            <li> I apply it to skin below my eyebrow arch, but above my eyelids and it prevents that saggy, tired, eyelid look!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I wait a few minutes before applying serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and saw a difference about week 3.  </li>
            <li> Did they really firm my skin?  </li>
            <li> Someone just drowsed some pads in an alcoholic solution and sold it as the Firming pads.</li>
            <li> Big rip-off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for several years and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with anyone of them.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s there....</li>
            <li> I was sick of reading about products and throwing away so much money for products that did not deliver.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> I think these pads also help remove any minute residue the cleanser may leave behind, and helps sluff off any dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> My neck is firm!!</li>
            <li> These pads dried out my skin!!!!</li>
            <li> The pads are very very thin, yet each one has plenty of product.  </li>
            <li> This product was fake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost too frustrated at this point to even call to argue.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had originally purchased these on QVC as a set and this is the one Dr Denese product that I just can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I feel my skin tighter, brighter, and pores look smaller</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads every morning and night for years.  They exfoliate wonderfully and keep the lines at bay.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!!  I wish i had started using this 15 years ago.I have been pleased with all her products so far.</li>
            <li> This is better and less expensive.  I always keep coming back to Dr. Denise.  Her products work better than Philosophy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product for what it does for my skin. It has, however, totally discolored the neck of many of my expensive white cotton nightgowns. Someone responded that this product is not for use on the neck, but here&#x27;s why I apply it ( wiping gently nightly with the same single pad) to my face and neck : While no claim is made by the company about its effectiveness in removing, over time, and possibly preventing skin tags on the neck, nor do I maintain that it&#x27;s suitable for others, it has worked for me for years. I&#x27;ve not had to visit the dermatologist for their removal since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I won&#x27;t go one night without using them.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product after seeing a presentation on QVC with Dr. Denese. The product also included a hydrating serum as a duo product packaging. With the 2 products, I have to say, my rosacea is very minimal and my pores are non-existent. This product as well used with her serum work exactly as stated in her literature. I tried to write this type of review for QVC but it was denied as not applicable and did not meet their criteria for a review! So from now, I find this product CHEAPER on Amazon with an extremely prompt delivery. I LOVE this product and so does my daughter. We both cannot live without it. My skin has not looked better even in my youth!</li>
            <li> wow, yes, spend the money.  age spots faded, not gone, but definitely faded, my skin is smoother, my pores have shrunk by at least half.  not sure if there is any firming going on, but everything just looks better, spots, clarity, pores, maybe even a little glow happening.</li>
            <li> I used someone else&#x27;s advice and cut these in half before use. Even a half hoes a long way.  I noticed immediate results in my skin tone. THANKS!!! (Afican american female, moderate acne/scars)</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Really feels like it is penetrating the skin to firm up your face.  Also, cleans off dirt and debris.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...not even sure what it is but my skin feels and looks fresher and tighter...I am a new convert to anything made by Dr. Denese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No oiliness or dryness at all...just fresh healthy looking skin!</li>
            <li> Very good product, my skin likes it. I can recommend to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery, everything is ok. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I apply it to skin below my eyebrow arch, but above my eyelids and it prevents that saggy, tired, eyelid look!&lt;br /&gt;Also temporarily lessens the Marionette lines around the mouth.</li>
            <li> One of few products that really made a visible difference in my skin.  Love it and it is much less expensive at Amazon than QVC!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> These are great!  Keep your face looking amazing!</li>
            <li> This was ok but nothing great.</li>
            <li> Have used these for 2 years now.  Firming and non drying .  i use in morning after cleansing and before I put on my makeup primer.  this is my favorite Dr Denese product , however,  I think all of her products are exceptional ( these I just can&#x27;t do without )</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if these little pads worked or not.  would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These pads dried out my skin!!!!</li>
            <li> This works! I use pad, then apply Dr. Denese serum. After applying, there is a tingling where applied. I wait a few minutes before applying serum.</li>
            <li> This is really good skin care and I am a real fan. Preps skin in a gentle way and makes the skin feel refreshed and moist. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> These pads do help keep my mature skin more firm.  I use them every day, sometimes twice a day, even though the directions suggest a less frequent use.  I think these pads also help remove any minute residue the cleanser may leave behind, and helps sluff off any dead skin cells.  I use it on my face and my neck.  If you have never used glycolic or other similar products, start slow with this, as it will tingle a bit.  I&#x27;ve been using these for over two years.</li>
            <li> This product literally made my skin tighter, brighter, pores smaller, &amp; acne/oil gone! Skin is soooo soft &amp; skin firmer. I use only this &amp; the resurfacing face wash. Hands down better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used... Even proactive! La la love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for years and I like the way it finishes cleaning my face after I wash it. I think the it&#x27;s clean but these pads definitely show that it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Makes your skin feel clean, hydrated and not dry and taught!</li>
            <li> I have used a few different makes of exfoliating pads and I like these the best.  I buy the 100 count and cut them in half so they last a long time. Using half a pad is plenty after removing my makeup and washing my face at night.  I&#x27;m on my second jar!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is any better than the generic pads, but this is what I&#x27;m using now, primarily because I use other Dr. Denese products and I love them!</li>
            <li> Great product and have seen a huge improvement in my skin (smoothness and very few breakouts).  Definately will be keeping this product in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I love these firming pads!  I use them nightly and feel it has helped my skin to feel great.  I would highly recommend Dr Denese to everyone!</li>
            <li> I am a Dr. Denese avid user and love these facial pads for day time.  I can see the difference in the glow of my skin when I am out of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the firming pads for about two months that I got from QVC. I am 53 and my skin looks really good for my age(good genes,I guess) but my face was starting to sag.I paid such a high price on QVC and I wanted to get more when I found the great prices here.This really tightens up my face.I let my sister (55 yrs. old) try it and she said she could see and feel the difference in only 2 days.I have tried so many products that promises to help firm up your face,nothing worked.I was sick of reading about products and throwing away so much money for products that did not deliver. I use this on my neck and hands also.My hands look younger.I was really surprised.Thanks again for the great prices! I feel so much better when I look in the mirror.My neck is firm!!</li>
            <li> I used the entire product, it is good at cleaning your skin however it made my skin for oily and so it made me breakout more.</li>
            <li> This is one product that I would not be without. I have been using these pads for about three years, and they have made&lt;br /&gt;a BIG difference in the firmness of my skin. I use one pad each evening, after cleansing my face, let the product from the&lt;br /&gt;pad dry, then I apply my serum and night cream. I do not use them on my neck.</li>
            <li> Staple in my night routine!  GLOW GLOW GLOW!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Advanced Firming Facial Pads for several years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  They are wonderful &amp; really work.  Tried the Hydroshield Cleansing Cream for the first time and love the feel of this on my skin.  Not drying to my skin, etc.  Use a lot of her products, and love them all.</li>
            <li> Great value and convenient for getting rid of dead skin cells, will always have this is my daily routine,&lt;br /&gt;and the hydroshield face serum...great combo!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Denese products for about ten years.  These pads mildly exfoliate and help keep your skin smooth-looking.  I receive a lot of compliments on my skin and feel it is due in large part to this product line.</li>
            <li> Always like this product, works as advertise</li>
            <li> This product was fake! The container had no seal, the pads were soaked and dripping wet with something that did not smell or feel like the real Dr. Denese product. Someone just drowsed some pads in an alcoholic solution and sold it as the Firming pads. Big rip-off! Stay away! My skin started breaking out again, it hasn&#x27;t for quite a while because I used the original pads.</li>
            <li> A must have in your daily routine!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and saw a difference about week 3.  It has reduced my pore size and helped with the laughing lines.  I love Dr. Denese&#x27;s products, a bit pricey but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It helps my skin to stay nice and smooth.  Love most of her products. I always get the best prices through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 7 years. I really think they are slowing down my skin aging. People can&#x27;t believe my true age. I also use the serum and correcting firming night cream. I easily pass for 45!</li>
            <li> SLIGHT MEDICINAL SMELL TO PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE WHEN USED AM &amp; PM&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS STARTED TO MAKE MY FACIAL SKIN LOOK SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for several years and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with anyone of them.  Though I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old, many people tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  At first, I thought they were being polite (and very kind) but my physicians (including my dermatologist) say \\&quot;whatever you&#x27;re doing keep doing\\&quot;.  They tell me my skin is tight with nearly invisible pores and an even skin tone. My female physicians even ask me specifically what products I use because they want to start using them!  So, thank you Dr. Denese for creating products with the right percentage of ingredients  that enable them to do what you say they do and thank you to Amazon for making the products affordable.  Aging isn&#x27;t easy but having products you can rely on to help you look and feel your best makes it easier.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this line.  You will see and feel a difference. And, most importantly, you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li> love this product , you can see the difference</li>
            <li> Great product..been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while,I don&#x27;t notice but everyone says I look good. I love the smell :)</li>
            <li> Lot of liquid in each bottle, Just the right amount. I can tell the difference when I do not use it.  Now I make sure that I do not run out.</li>
            <li> Love these, part of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year. I was purchasing from another source but found it at this site for a better price with this purchase. My skin is definitely firmer, smoother, and my pores are smaller. I believe this product in combination with Dr. Denese&#x27;s Hydroshield Ultra Moisturizing Facial serum, which I have also been using for a year, has made my skin look 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these on the &amp;#34;Q&amp;#34; bu they are much more reasonably priced here. It&#x27;s a good product that works. So easy to use in this format.</li>
            <li> Have used Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for years and love them...these pads really clean your face and make your complexion look so good..would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried these on Amazon, and not paid full price on QVC.  I use them 1-3 times per week and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the menthol in this product.  Not sure why it&#x27;s there....but it&#x27;s not needed.</li>
            <li> When I received I also got a sample of the moisturizing serum- at first I could see a glow to my skin and people at work ask me what I was doing but didn&#x27;t know if it was the pads or the serum- when the serum ran out I realized I think the serum was the changing factor.</li>
            <li> I love these firming facial pads, and have been using them nightly since they first came out. Thy do what she says they do. I can tell a BIG difference in the tone and texture of my skin now also.  I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin all of my life, but now that I&#x27;m a new senior citizen, they help me keep my skin tone even, clear, and my pores clean, and my skin tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these pads, and will never go without them !!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clean and youthful.</li>
            <li> Tried just about everything out there over the years and this one is tops.  Wish I&#x27;d found it two decades ago.</li>
            <li> Love these skin firming pads along with the facial wash.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; from her website that includes the day cream, facial pads, hydrating serum and night cream. Very good deal price-wise with autoship, and I had high hopes since the ingredients look wonderful. But after using the products faithfully for about 6 weeks, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any positive changes to my skin. In fact, I felt my skin was looking duller. Very disappointed! I especially didn&#x27;t like the day cream as it is very thick and rubs off on phone, clothes, etc. I also didn&#x27;t like the tinting. It seemed to get into my facial lines and make them look more prominent. Then I experienced a glitch with cancelling the autoship. My first attempt was never processed and I was shipped a new 90-day supply and my credit card was charged. I called back and they apologized and cancelled this time, sent me a prepaid return label for the new shipment, and said the charge would be refunded to my credit card. Great! In spite of the inconvenience of having to drive to the UPS store! But today I noticed the refund came through, minus about $9, which I assume means they are charging me shipping for the order they should never have sent me in the first place due to their error. I&#x27;m almost too frustrated at this point to even call to argue.</li>
            <li> This an incredible product. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months and my skin is better than ever before with less breakouts, less dryness, less wrinkles and much firmer. I&#x27;ve tried everything out there and nothing worked as this product with my 48 year old skin. The pads come really soaked with the product. I use this product in the morning and on top of that I use Obagi Vitamin C. At night I use TNS serum on a wet face. I don&#x27;t need anything else, that is it. Not even my Chanel eye cream, since I use these products on my eye areas as well, being careful with the Dr. Denese not getting too close to the eye...if you try this skin regime your skin will transform itself...Other than that I have been using NuSkin Nano Vitamins...Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I m only using it for about 10 days but can see the differences in my skin. It looks much clearer and firmer. Very good product. Will order again</li>
            <li> Just the same brand and product and lower cost than QVC.  Product excellent for daily facial cleansing at night, or even other times.</li>
            <li> These glycolic pads have proven to be an excellent step in my anti-aging skin care regimen.  My nightly regimen includes cleansing, using one of these pads for about 60 seconds, follow with Dr. Denese HydroShield Ultra Moisturizing Face Serum.  After the serum absorbs, I use either Dr. Denese Triple Strength Advanced Wrinkle Smoother or Dr. Denese HydroShield Face Emulsion. The combination of these products has dramatically changed the texture of my skin.  I find they work well together to generate  healthy skin cell turnover and boost collagen.  I have sensitive combination skin that often is irritated by glycolic and retinol products.  I have had no adverse reactions to any of these products.  I researched the ingredients used in all these products and I found these formulas very impressive. I am absolutely so impressed with my results! After using this regimen for 45 days, my small pores are now microscopic, my nasal labio fold lines appear plumped, my marionette lines are definitely shortened, and the fine lines seem to be vanishing.  The pads come in a jar, they are saturated with product and there is some clear liquid product in the jar as well.  The lid must be sealed tightly after each use.  I&#x27;ve had no problem with the pads drying up.  The pads are very very thin, yet each one has plenty of product.  I use one pad nightly,  I use it on my face for about 60 seconds then wipe the back of each hand with it.  Sometimes it \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; when applied, other times I feel no tingling sensation at all.  Because these pads really do generate skin cell turnover for me, I find I must use an SFP30+ broad spectrum day cream to protect my new skin from the sun&#x27;s aging rays.  Great addition to my nightly skin care regimen - I won&#x27;t live without these pads.</li>
            <li> The ingredients burns my eyes with the fumes and as long as I keep them closed, the product does remove make-up.  But then, so does water.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price for a beauty product I have used for several years. These pads help to keep my complexion fresh and even up skin tone. I will be buying for many years into the future.</li>
            <li> Did nothing , I used as directed and nothing happened. At 68 I guess I am just grasping at straws here but I am not a quitter so on to the next find. If my magical elixir or whatever is out there I hope to find it soon as I really need something. So it isn&#x27;t Actizone Firming whatever. Next!</li>
            <li> The facial pads were definitely a good buy.  Did they really firm my skin?  I felt more refreshed than firm.</li>
            <li> use this in my 6 step evening Dr. D. routine.  My face feels so clean &amp; tingly after using.  Also, the pads are almost dripping because there is so much product on them, they do not skimp on product.</li>
            <li> I like that the pads remove any residue on my skin after cleansing but have not seen any firming of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and wanted something that was recommended for toning/firming my face. I use Dr. Denese&#x27;s Advanced Firming Facial Pads 1-2 times daily.  It does burn just a little for a few seconds, but it isn&#x27;t so bothersome that I stopped using it.  I see a little improvement in my skin, but guess I am always searching for something that I can really tell a difference. May not purchase again...?</li>
            <li> I like these firming pads.  They are very moist and do not dry out in the jar.  I like the value of 100 pads and I do think it has helped my skin without drying out my skin or making it red or irritated.  I will repurchase these.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for at least 10 years. I&#x27;am 51and have NO wrinkles on my forehead or eyes....this product delivers but you must be faithful to it!  It&#x27;s by best kept secret...people think I use Botox...NOT. I will never be without this product...ever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used it for years and am very happy with the results. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> The advanced firming facial pads in conjuction with the Hydroshield serum is a Winner.  I have used these for years and could not live without it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product part of my evening routine.  I noticed my pore size reduced due to my skin I used the product every other night.&lt;br /&gt;Received the product very quickly from seller.</li>
            <li> I am an old fan of this product. I keep on ordering it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My wife loves it. It is so much better than all of those products you would pay three of four times as much for. Dr. Denese is amazing!</li>
            <li> These facial pads really do the job. I have used many of Dr. Denese&#x27;s products for a long time. I stopped using these pads and exchanged it for a toner. After a few months I started to get little white pimples just underneath the skin. Usually my completion is very clear and healthy. After one phone call I am back using the pads and my skin has stated to look cleaner and firmer. I will never stop using this product. It is vital for a healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure they are all that firming, but they are very good astringent pads, and get your skin nice and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this product line. I highly recommend her products without reservation!!&lt;br /&gt;The facial pads work wonders on your face, reducing wrinkle lines while keeping your face looking youthful and healthy.</li>
            <li> I got a red face after the first application, then realized I need to be more gentle with the pads. A good product if used correctly.</li>
