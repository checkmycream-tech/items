            <li>I think it is a good straightener for the price.</li>
            <li>but the sales rep did a good job.  </li>

            <li>, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>

            <li>This is much better!  </li>
            <li>Love this straightner and recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>I looked around and saw this amazing deal</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>it has honestly become my new best friend!</li>
            <li>It heats up quick and does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My husband ordered me this for mother&#x27;s day and I love it.</li>
            <li>it does an ok job for the price</li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better straighteners from wal mart.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat as well as the truly expensive/professional ones, but you get more than what you pay for here</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Generally I love the colour</li>
            <li>, i was kind of sure it will look cheap, but</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the performance of this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this Flat Iron!!!</li>
            <li>The iron gets very hot and does a wonderful job of straightening my hair without taking me a hour to complete it.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I let it sit on for a while before I use it to get to full temperature and everything.  </li>
            <li>but it is fine</li>
            <li>It has great features like being ready to use within the first five seconds of turning it on.</li>
            <li>is certainly a fantastic deal for this straightener as well</li>
            <li>It has dual voltage, which is very useful.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re happy to see a long warranty.  </li>
            <li>I will have to say that this is a great straightning iron, I do not think I would have spent the $200.00 that they say it retails for but</li>
            <li>I recently moved to Europe and it works great with an adapter, my hair is bone straight right now, which is good because I have naturally wavy-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>my old revlon flat iron was way better than this, it&#x27;s good for a spare</li>
            <li>also adore the versatility of this product, you can easily create three styles: straight, curly, and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My mom has a Paul Mitchell professional iron that cost way more</li>
            <li>and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I own a Paul Mitchell flat iron as well that cost approx.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right.</li>
            <li>it is nicely made and looks pretty solid to me.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a flat iron that makes my hair straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After finding this out I decided to find a dual voltage hair straightener and after reading the reviews over many different dual voltage straighteners I decided on the Iso tourmaline ceramic straightener</li>
            <li>With one swipe her hair was perfectly straight!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no temperature adjustment so it can get too hot and burn my hair.</li>
            <li>I love my flat iron</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have curly thick hair, and this does a great job of giving me completely straight hair.</li>
            <li>After talking to my stylist she said the only way for me to get salon straight hair would be to spend more than twenty dollars on a straightner.</li>
            <li>It is relatively compact for travel, worked fine</li>
            <li>still it didn&#x27;t do much at all to her hair.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li>straightener gets my hair perfectly straight in a convenient amount of time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also heats up quite fast which is convenient as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>also does not make it very shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I use this straightener, it leaves my hair shiny and silky smooth all day long</li>
            <li>This particular one I ordered to keep in US and use when I&#x27;m around.</li>
            <li>I needed something that will straighten my hair a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Orange color easy to find in my dark closet.</li>
            <li>and I would say this $40.00 flat iron does as good of a job if not better than the Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li>First of all the flat irons heat up like the professionals.</li>
            <li>(does not flatten it out completely).</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift after my old hair straightener broke.</li>
            <li>I am currently serving overseas and am not able to use my Paul Mitchell iron so the dual voltage is able to be plugged directly into outlets overseas without blowing any breakers.  </li>
            <li>You can definitely tell it is a high end brand and the quality of it.</li>
            <li>This flat iron leaves my hair perfectly straight, extremely soft and flat.  </li>
            <li>Even though it was broken, it still worked :).  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, and I only bought it because I accidentally dropped my first one which caused one of the ceramic plates to break loose.  </li>
            <li>I had to practice a few times and watched the demo video before a got it right, but now I would not part with this device.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like to have my hair irond, but since I had them cut short, sometimes I have no other choice but to use iron</li>
            <li>For my hair it gets a little too hot</li>
            <li>I now have long, natural looking ringlet curls whenever I want.  </li>
            <li>I have also had a Herstyler iron for a long time, which also has ceramic plates and delivers negative irons and, though a little more expensive, it does far better than the Iso Professional Tourmaline (i guess u get what you pay for !).</li>
            <li>It is not obviously a high priced professional straightener</li>
            <li>I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair and this straightener makes it shiny and smooth.</li>

            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair and this straightener makes it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron rocks big time</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone who has curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I had another flat iron that used to catch hairs in the hinge and pull them.</li>
            <li> I do wish flat irons were required to have automatic shut off!</li>
            <li> Thats a marketing skeem to make you feel like your getting something expensive for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year for my house in Greece where I spent 2 months in the Summer.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of natural curl, but it is uneven, and it takes a lot of time using curlers in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It does not pull my hair and it makes them sleek for all day long.</li>
            <li> doesnt have a heat control so it stays one temp which is not good to get your hair REALLY straight</li>
            <li> Last February I was in Europe, bought a voltage converter and power adapter and found out the hard way that the Chi does NOT work outside of the U.S. because it is not dual voltage, I had to go 2 weeks with unruly hair!  </li>
            <li> so I am not very optimistic.</li>
            <li> since did not really care about that I got it anyways</li>
            <li> I have worried a few times now whether or not I turned the flat iron off after leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY curly (and frizzy) hair.  </li>
            <li> I have other iron at home made by BebyLiss</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews on here are scary but I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I wish I had the ability to turn down the heat I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> Should I also mention that this straightener was about half the cost of my Chi Turbo, which is now with relatives in the U.S. seeing as how it&#x27;s no use to me here.</li>
            <li> I did my hair in less than 5</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also notice that it tangles less and has no frizz</li>
            <li> Little tight ringlets.  </li>
            <li> For the past 7 or 8 years I always used a CHI straightener, swore by it and never used any other product.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out on my hair (which is thick and wavy) and it never really straightened it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few straighteners before but they do not at all compare to this one!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have really thick and curly hair and this iron</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> However, to my disappointment, the product does not live upto the claims made....</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought this</li>
            <li> Overall it was a bad purchase and it would be cheaper to buy one in Europe since I have to replace this one</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Herstyler is not a dual voltage iron.</li>
            <li> It is crap.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this last year for my house in Greece where I spent 2 months in the Summer. I used it 3 times and it stopped working. It has a 1 year warranty but I have to go through the vendor not Amazon so I am not very optimistic. Overall it was a bad purchase and it would be cheaper to buy one in Europe since I have to replace this one so I am paying twice.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and the reason I purchased this iron was because it has dual voltage. However, to my disappointment, the product does not live upto the claims made.... I have really thick and curly hair and this iron at best makes my hair wavy (does not flatten it out completely). I have also had a Herstyler iron for a long time, which also has ceramic plates and delivers negative irons and, though a little more expensive, it does far better than the Iso Professional Tourmaline (i guess u get what you pay for !). Unfortunately, the Herstyler is not a dual voltage iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend, because her CHI crapped out after haveing it for 6yrs. This product does not have ceramic plates! It takes her 45mins to straighten her hair! Oh yeah its not sold for $300. Thats a marketing skeem to make you feel like your getting something expensive for a cheap price. I saw a mall kiosk sell them for $120, and then they tell you, they like you and they drop it to $60...really? I was at that kiosk for self amusement. Dont do it. Stick with the CHI just not this product</li>
            <li> For the past 7 or 8 years I always used a CHI straightener, swore by it and never used any other product.  Last February I was in Europe, bought a voltage converter and power adapter and found out the hard way that the Chi does NOT work outside of the U.S. because it is not dual voltage, I had to go 2 weeks with unruly hair!  After finding this out I decided to find a dual voltage hair straightener and after reading the reviews over many different dual voltage straighteners I decided on the Iso tourmaline ceramic straightener and I absolutely love it. I recently moved to Europe and it works great with an adapter, my hair is bone straight right now, which is good because I have naturally wavy-curly hair.  Should I also mention that this straightener was about half the cost of my Chi Turbo, which is now with relatives in the U.S. seeing as how it&#x27;s no use to me here. You can&#x27;t adjust the temperature but that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me as when I used the chi I&#x27;d just leave it on the highest setting.  I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I was so impressed with this product that I had to take the time because it&#x27;s a life saver..well, hair saver..</li>
            <li> My friend bought an Ultra Iso straightener from one of those mall kiosks for 100 dollars. I tried it out and I loved it, but I refused to pay that kind of money. I have bought two Chis before and they both crapped out on me after a year. So I searched Amazon, talked to another friend who bought this item and took the plunge. It was the best decision I made. I get compliments every day on my hair. I have curly thick hair, and this does a great job of giving me completely straight hair. It also makes my hair super shiny. This is a great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> My husband ordered me this for mother&#x27;s day and I love it. I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair and this straightener makes it shiny and smooth. I love it!! Some of the reviews on here are scary but I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a while back. I tried it out on my hair (which is thick and wavy) and it never really straightened it. I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right. I even bought products to help with the straightening. I used it on my daughter a few times and it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for her hair either. Then this weekend I saw a lady at the salon straighten my daughters hair. With one swipe her hair was perfectly straight! Mine wouldn&#x27;t do that even if I continued to go over a spot over and over and over again! I tried again today on my daughters hair.. using the same technique that lady did.. still it didn&#x27;t do much at all to her hair. I always make sure I let it sit on for a while before I use it to get to full temperature and everything.  Very dissapointed in my purchase. I guess thats what I get for trying to be frugal!</li>
            <li> I will have to say that this is a great straightning iron, I do not think I would have spent the $200.00 that they say it retails for but it is great for the price that i paid.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the performance of this flat iron.  I own a Paul Mitchell flat iron as well that cost approx. $120.00 and I would say this $40.00 flat iron does as good of a job if not better than the Paul Mitchell.  It is dual voltage which is why I bought it.  I am currently serving overseas and am not able to use my Paul Mitchell iron so the dual voltage is able to be plugged directly into outlets overseas without blowing any breakers.  I would definately recommend this product and will use this as my back up iron to travel  with in the future.</li>
            <li> doesnt have a heat control so it stays one temp which is not good to get your hair REALLY straight (if you have curly hair)  it does an ok job for the price</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY curly (and frizzy) hair.  Little tight ringlets.  I have never been able to find a flat iron that makes my hair straight and smooth.  This flat iron leaves my hair perfectly straight, extremely soft and flat.  I don&#x27;t have one bit of frizz!!  I love it and use it all the time.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone who has curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good straightener for the price. However, I never checked to see if you could change the temperature before I purchased it and you can not change the temperature. For my hair it gets a little too hot and I wish I had the ability to turn down the heat I have a lot of hair but it is fine and after I am done using the straightener it smells like my hair burns.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought this but the sales rep did a good job.  I have a lot of natural curl, but it is uneven, and it takes a lot of time using curlers in the morning.  I had to practice a few times and watched the demo video before a got it right, but now I would not part with this device.  I now have long, natural looking ringlet curls whenever I want.  It never leaves my hair frizzy either.  I&#x27;m going to toss out the rollers.  This is much better!  Nice product.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron rocks big time I was very impressed!!! I did my hair in less than 5 min!!! I have have med length hair, I just did 1 passing on each section of hair and it is Done!!! Very happy with this Flat Iron!!! You have to buy it and see what I mean:D</li>
            <li> Good value for the price. Orange color easy to find in my dark closet. Almost was good as the chi but alot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few straighteners before but they do not at all compare to this one!&lt;br /&gt;This straightener gets my hair perfectly straight in a convenient amount of time!&lt;br /&gt;It also heats up quite fast which is convenient as well.&lt;br /&gt;After I use this straightener, it leaves my hair shiny and silky smooth all day long and I&#x27;ve also notice that it tangles less and has no frizz whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;I also adore the versatility of this product, you can easily create three styles: straight, curly, and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly a fantastic deal for this straightener as well, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> my old revlon flat iron was way better than this, it&#x27;s good for a spare and that&#x27;s all&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase this brand again</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift after my old hair straightener broke. It does not have heat control so it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. It takes forever to straighten my hair with it. I&#x27;ve had better straighteners from wal mart. It also does not have automatic shut off so when in a rush ro work I got a bright orange burn mark into my counter. It is crap.</li>
            <li> The best brand I&#x27;ve ever had. I had one for 5 years and now I am buying the same brand. It has dual voltage, which is very useful.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It heats up quick and does a great job. I had another flat iron that used to catch hairs in the hinge and pull them. Not this one. No complaints. Great product. My mom has a Paul Mitchell professional iron that cost way more and I think this one does as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Bought this to travel with and with the ability to use both 110 and 220 (or 221, whatever it takes) we were all set for travel.  It is relatively compact for travel, worked fine and we&#x27;re happy to see a long warranty.  It is not obviously a high priced professional straightener so if you buy it for travel, backup or such it is a 5 star product.  It doesn&#x27;t heat as well as the truly expensive/professional ones, but you get more than what you pay for here so that&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  Have had no problems.  I do wish flat irons were required to have automatic shut off! I have worried a few times now whether or not I turned the flat iron off after leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I love my flat iron it has honestly become my new best friend! It has great features like being ready to use within the first five seconds of turning it on. Not to mention the price I bought it for on amazon. You can definitely tell it is a high end brand and the quality of it. I love it I love it!!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like to have my hair irond, but since I had them cut short, sometimes I have no other choice but to use iron.. This particular one I ordered to keep in US and use when I&#x27;m around. I have other iron at home made by BebyLiss therfore I have a room to compare this product to smth else. Generally I love the colour, i was kind of sure it will look cheap, but since did not really care about that I got it anyways and here was my surprise- it is nicely made and looks pretty solid to me. It does not pull my hair and it makes them sleek for all day long. I think this was very good purchase. the only thing I would change is the switch button, it is inside of the product while being on a side would probably be safer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick curly and frizzy hair. After talking to my stylist she said the only way for me to get salon straight hair would be to spend more than twenty dollars on a straightner. I looked around and saw this amazing deal and it is well worth the money. The iron gets very hot and does a wonderful job of straightening my hair without taking me a hour to complete it. Love this straightner and recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I needed something that will straighten my hair a little bit more. Good for the money</li>
            <li> Great transaction! I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Her hair is looking great!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  This is my second one, and I only bought it because I accidentally dropped my first one which caused one of the ceramic plates to break loose.  Even though it was broken, it still worked :).  If something happens to the one I have now, I will be buying another one!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no temperature adjustment so it can get too hot and burn my hair. also does not make it very shiny.</li>
            <li> First of all the flat irons heat up like the professionals. Perfect size. Beautiful color as pictured. Would purchase again.</li>
