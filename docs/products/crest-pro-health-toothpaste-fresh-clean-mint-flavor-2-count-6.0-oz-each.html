            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>By far some of the best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li>Works ok and taste is OK, however I am wondering where it is made since it does not say made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I received a tube of this toothpaste as a free sample with a commitment to providing an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>More specifically, Crest Pro-Health Whitening.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not too minty, but leaves a nice clean feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased with the product after trying it for the first time</li>
            <li>This will leave your mouth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It does seem to help whiten your teeth some, leaves your mouth clean feeling, and tastes OK.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the flavor and texture of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and because I received a free sample.  </li>
            <li>I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>When I had a chance to get a full size tube free from Smiley360, I knew I had a winner.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste does make your teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced the same thing with Aqua Fresh.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I noticed that it was very different, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>After using one tube my teeth and mouth feel cleaner &amp; my smile is whiter.  </li>
            <li>This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast.</li>
            <li>I was happy to try this because I have been using a different toothpaste for sensitivity that is actually a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great mint taste that will last long after brushing.</li>
            <li>I did get a sample of this to try for free as long as I gave a genuine account of my experience.</li>
            <li>Crest is the way to go for healthy, clean and less cavities.</li>
            <li>i always like crest tooth paste, it keeps my breath fresh and my teeth clean and shiny white for me.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste to try.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>okay - gritty enough to make your teeth feel clean, minty enough for a fresh mouth.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>You can really feel it bubble up more than other brands.</li>
            <li>So when I saw Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste on sale recently I picked up two 6-ounce tubes.</li>
            <li>I have used this toothpaste in the past and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly having to clean out the cap just to get it to close enough not to leak out.&lt;br /&gt;Poorly engineered.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good toothpaste option if you can get past the initial grittiness.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not 100% squeaky clean, the cap doesn&#x27;t close tight.</li>
            <li>I know crest thinks they&#x27;re saving us those precious 2.4 seconds, but the amount of time spent cleaning this up and the amount of product lost make it not worth while.</li>
            <li>can we please go back to the old screw off caps?</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get him to do every day health things</li>
            <li> But this gel has an unpleasant grittiness to it when startng to brush.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not too minty, but leaves a nice clean feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I think you do something with your teeth with this.  It is a paste.</li>
            <li> This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Hmm. Brush your teeth with a known poison. Read the package. Find the poison control number. Feed LOTS of this to your kids, Sodium Flouride is known to make people docile while lowering their IQ. Do your research! Sodium Flouride is a a toxic waste by product of fertilizer production. DO YOU RESEARCH!!!!! Google for pictures of &amp;#34;flourosis&amp;#34; and ask &amp;#34;Do I want to do this to MY children?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my sister great value and she was very pleased with the product after trying it for the first time</li>
            <li> i always like crest tooth paste, it keeps my breath fresh and my teeth clean and shiny white for me.</li>
            <li> Works ok and taste is OK, however I am wondering where it is made since it does not say made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this toothpaste compared to the 3DWhite from Crest. This toothpaste also has the small plastic pellets that are causing chaos in our waterways, didn&#x27;t realize that until I started using it, so I won&#x27;t be buying this toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> I received a tube of this toothpaste as a free sample with a commitment to providing an honest review of the product. I enjoy the flavor and texture of this toothpaste. The clean mint flavor is not overwhelming, but I am still not able to drink OJ after brushing my teeth without it tasting disgusting. The paste has a grittier texture than other toothpastes, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting an additional scrub on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the cap is attached to the tube. It reduces conflict between people who are annoyed when the cap is left off of the toothpaste, and their spouses...</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does make your teeth feel clean but it is a bit too gritty for me. Also, the taste it leaves in your mouth isn&#x27;t too bad until you try to eat something. It lingers for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste to try. It is a whitening toothpaste that claims to fight cavities, sensitivity, gingivitis and tartar and freshen breath. I was happy to try this because I have been using a different toothpaste for sensitivity that is actually a toothpaste. The Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste is actually a gel and not the standard toothpaste consistency. I have always preferred a gel but other sensitive toothpastes do not come in a gel option. But this gel has an unpleasant grittiness to it when startng to brush. Other than that, I did like the taste and my teeth and mouth felt clean and fresh. Also, I could tell it was whitening my teeth because I have a resin filling that becomes quite visible when I use a whitening toothpaste. Overall it was a good toothpaste option if you can get past the initial grittiness.</li>
            <li> I change toothpaste brands every so often and have used Crest toothpastes in the past without incident. So when I saw Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste on sale recently I picked up two 6-ounce tubes. The very first time I used it, I noticed that it was very different, and not in a good way. It burned my mouth and lips and made the inside of my mouth feel rough. But I thought I would get used to it and so continued using it twice a day for a week. The strange feeling in my mouth never went away. Then yesterday I started getting shreds of skin/tissue in my mouth. Coincidentally, I had a dental appointment this morning. I had not yet mentioned the problem to the hygienist when *she* commented that I had skin/tissue sloughing in my mouth and asked what toothpaste I was using. When I told her Crest Pro-Health, she got this &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; on her face and said to get rid of it. Apparently a lot of people have a problem with its harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> All of the Crest tooth pastes make the inside of my mouth peel and my mouth dry. I&#x27;ve experienced the same thing with Aqua Fresh. When I stop using it, the condition goes away. Hate the stuff!</li>
            <li> I like this tooth paste okay - gritty enough to make your teeth feel clean, minty enough for a fresh mouth.&lt;br /&gt;But can we please go back to the old screw off caps? I know crest thinks they&#x27;re saving us those precious 2.4 seconds, but the amount of time spent cleaning this up and the amount of product lost make it not worth while. Especially if you travel...&lt;br /&gt;The flip cap does not snap closed tightly. If you stand it up like it&#x27;s designed to be, product leaks into cap. If you put it into travel bag and ANY pressure touches it, it leaks into the cap. And guess what? If ANY product is in the cap and it&#x27;s not 100% squeaky clean, the cap doesn&#x27;t close tight. And then it leaks. I&#x27;m constantly having to clean out the cap just to get it to close enough not to leak out.&lt;br /&gt;Poorly engineered.</li>
            <li> By far some of the best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste out there. This will leave your mouth feeling clean and healthy. No more sensitivity problems either. Great mint taste that will last long after brushing. It also noticeably whitens your teeth. It does what other toothpastes try to do. My teenage son loves it and swear he will never use another brand ever again. And it is a winner in my book since he is a boy and it&#x27;s hard to get him to do every day health things haha. I did get a sample of this to try for free as long as I gave a genuine account of my experience.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste in the past and liked it.  When I had a chance to get a full size tube free from Smiley360, I knew I had a winner.  This review is a result of me using it before and because I received a free sample.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is that it has a slightly gritty feel to it.  It does seem to help whiten your teeth some, leaves your mouth clean feeling, and tastes OK.</li>
            <li> Crest is the way to go for healthy, clean and less cavities. I have been using Crest for as long as I can remember. Good products, good prices, thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Garbage: threw it away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tube is garbage. Cap is garbage. Leaks and doesn&#x27;t close correctly; don&#x27;t consider traveling with this junk product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete and incompetent tube and cap design renders product as utter shameful garbage.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered the Crest Pro-Health line.  More specifically, Crest Pro-Health Whitening.  After using one tube my teeth and mouth feel cleaner &amp; my smile is whiter.  No funny/weird aftertaste in my mouth.  I&#x27;ve been recommending to friends and family and now you.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro Health for years and I love it.  You can really feel it bubble up more than other brands.</li>
