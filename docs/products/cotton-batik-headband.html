            <li>Love this Headband.  </li>
            <li>Colors are muted, more for wearing in the fall then in summer or spring</li>
            <li>it is okay.</li>
            <li>With so many colors, you can wear it with many outfits.</li>
            <li>I put mine through the washer and dryer and they all come out fine.</li>
            <li>It fit well around the head</li>
            <li>Fit well, appears like it is in the picture.</li>
            <li>bright mix printed headband is very cute, but way too tight.  </li>

            <li>Thanks you!</li>
            <li>The bright mix headband is workable if you have an incredibly small head.</li>
            <li>It stays put and doesn&#x27;t slip off of my very fine hair like other handbands have.</li>
            <li>and I did not like it as much.</li>
            <li>The Cotton batik headband is a bit snug, but potentially  wearable, but the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; cloth is 90% light brown.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cotton headband, there&#x27;s not all that much to say about it.</li>
            <li>I bought both a Silly yogi bright mix printed headband and a cotton batik headband.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty wide head band.  </li>
            <li>Wished it had been a bit more narrow than wide in front</li>
            <li>I wore it at work to try to keep my hair up in my surgical cap, I have thick hair and the cap elastic is cheap, so my hair is a battle all day at work.  </li>

            <li> The front opens wide or can be folded to a smaller width.</li>
            <li> It stays on tight enough so that it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, but also doesn&#x27;t slide back off my head</li>
            <li> It has a narrow elastic back covered with the same fabric as the front.</li>
            <li> Sometimes headbands can be too loose or too tight.  </li>

            <li> Bought for my daughter and she loved it!</li>
            <li> very good product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this Headband.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty wide head band.  It fit well around the head and it does stay put.  The color of the blue one is mostly tan like another reviewer indicated but I did like it a lot.  Wished it had been a bit more narrow than wide in front but i think you can fold it to achieve a smaller look.</li>
            <li> Fit well, appears like it is in the picture. Not super soft but not scratchy either.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in the  fabric and the fact that the band size can be adjusted simply by folding the fabric</li>
            <li> The colors and print in this headband are great. I find the elastic quite comfortable and will be looking to order more of the different designs offered.</li>
            <li> Product is not as bright as pictured. Colors are muted, more for wearing in the fall then in summer or spring</li>
            <li> it is okay. My mom loved this, but the I bought one for me and I did not like it as much.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wore it at work to try to keep my hair up in my surgical cap, I have thick hair and the cap elastic is cheap, so my hair is a battle all day at work.  At the end of the 12 hour shift the top of my head was very tender, haven&#x27;t tried it since.  Will have to figure a different avenue to maintain hair at work.</li>
            <li> I bought both a Silly yogi bright mix printed headband and a cotton batik headband.  The Cotton batik headband is a bit snug, but potentially  wearable, but the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; cloth is 90% light brown.  Given the photograph of the product, I knew to expect some brown but the color should be labeled differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bright mix printed headband is very cute, but way too tight.  I gave it to my 9 year old daughter who found it a bit tight too.  The bright mix headband is workable if you have an incredibly small head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cotton headband, there&#x27;s not all that much to say about it. It has a narrow elastic back covered with the same fabric as the front. The front opens wide or can be folded to a smaller width. I put mine through the washer and dryer and they all come out fine. None have faded.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear mine for style, I wear it because I sweat when I am out in the sun gardening and like that it is all cotton. It stays put and doesn&#x27;t slip off of my very fine hair like other handbands have.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a week and fits perfectly. It stays on tight enough so that it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, but also doesn&#x27;t slide back off my head</li>
            <li> Once for myself another for my sister as a gift she loved it. Will order again if needed. Thanks you!</li>
            <li> For me it fits just right on my head.  Sometimes headbands can be too loose or too tight.  Luckily, it is just the right size.  With so many colors, you can wear it with many outfits.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with Se;;er and Product</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments and is just fun to wear!&lt;br /&gt;I live at the beach and is perfect for summer.</li>
