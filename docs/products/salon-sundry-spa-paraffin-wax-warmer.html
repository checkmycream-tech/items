            <li>Love this paraffin bath!  </li>
            <li>Buy the wax, put it in a pan and set it in the sun would work better!</li>
            <li>Should it be helpful, those synthesized directions that worked for us are included here, but you can do your own investigating.&lt;br /&gt;Paraffin</li>
            <li>Liked the rack</li>
            <li>Excellent paraffin bath, modern design, adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li>at a greater price, I might add, than was offered on line.</li>
            <li>Just love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Great product, works really well.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t realty take 2 hours to heat up, more like 75 minutes.</li>
            <li>Have used it 3 times now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was the time they said it would be and was pleased to get it because it was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>I love this produce.</li>
            <li>May try adding more</li>
            <li>I sometimes do more dips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My PT said I&#x27;d notice more benefit over time as it reduces inflammation each time you use it.in 2 or 3 days and it sat here waiting for the warmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My PT said I&#x27;d notice more benefit over time as it reduces inflammation each time you use it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I find that it warms up very quickly, to melt the wax and stays at a very comfortable temperature to dip my hands into for therapeutic treatment.</li>
            <li>Also, go to YouTube and a couple of physical therapists have a very good video on how to use it.</li>
            <li>Also, go to YouTube and a couple of physical therapists have a very good video on how to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and very oily so no need to add mineral oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls aren&#x27;t the best, took me a while to figure them out: you have to hold down the arrows to adjust the temperature - simply touching them won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy but the hints about 35 degrees make it easier to reheat.</li>
            <li>and it was good that I printed out the comments by other buyers because it gave me a good look how to operated it.  </li>
            <li>Nice large size.  </li>
            <li>(yes, it IS deserving of the counter space);  the bath is ready to bring up to temp</li>
            <li>(one foot at a time would fit).</li>
            <li>Overall, happy with it.</li>
            <li>Amazon provided full refund and shipping label.  </li>
            <li>Not unpleasant,</li>
            <li>It is a large size that will fit your hole hand.</li>
            <li>My mother not finding it as useful as I hoped, but no complaints about the unit itself.</li>
            <li>at 38 is warm enough to keep the wax liquid and still do the job.  </li>
            <li>luckily the product is pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li>Place grate on top of solid paraffin or after wax is melted put grate in and allow it to sink to bottom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wax melts quickly, and once set, maintains a steady temperature.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Inside and out is all white and when you tap on the inside it sounds more like plastic than metal.</li>
            <li>But it hasn&#x27;t leaked after the first week.</li>
            <li>It looked exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Everything I wanted in a hot wax spa.</li>
            <li>Clean the unit after 40 or so treatments, or if the paraffin is no longer clear, or if sediment accumulates.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Clean the unit after 40 or so treatments, or if the paraffin is no longer clear, or if sediment accumulates.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>

            <li>Clean out paraffin residue with a soft paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>this hot wax really helps relieve the pain and the swelling.  </li>
            <li>When the tank is dry, refill with appropriate paraffin.sation in hands or feet - consult</li>
            <li>When the tank is dry, refill with appropriate paraffin.</li>
            <li>it was all white and the lid easy to lift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, easily holds six pounds of wax and only takes an hour or so to melt it.</li>
            <li>Hey if I could be so smart its just that some of the phrases or words used in the translation did not make any sense</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It stays at the temperature you put it and the paraffin melts really fast at the temperature they tell you to melt it at.</li>
            <li>It is doing very well</li>
            <li>65 C, then decrease temperature till 47 C, add some essential oils and enjoy my home hand therapy.</li>
            <li>Nice sleek design and more durable than the smaller less commercial type.</li>
            <li>Melt the wax at 60 but be sure and turn the temp down to 50 +/-</li>
            <li>It melts paraffin quickly and has enough space for a size 11 foot.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried that yet but would only move the unit to the floor before plugging it in as you don&#x27;t want to spill any hot wax!</li>
            <li>Product directions were extremely poorly translated Chinese to English and unintelligible at best.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and they expedited it but be aware if you use free shipping, that apparently also means you&#x27;re at the back of the line for even starting to process your order!</li>
            <li>so I have the other hand free to use my iPad,</li>
            <li>looks very professional.</li>
            <li>But be aware it does take some dedicated space, and then commitment to use it regularly.</li>
            <li>my advice is to be aware it takes time to melt the wax, and time to use it daily, or whenever.</li>
            <li>my advice is to be aware it takes time to melt the wax, and time to use it daily, or whenever.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>Had to send back - wouldn&#x27;t heat after first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to dip hands in and feet, one at a time.</li>
            <li>Heats wax quickly; is large enough for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Some brands say to always keep the paraffin level about the minimum level (4 lbs of paraffin) marked in the tub; this unit, however, does not have a minimum marking.  </li>
            <li>The inside and outside can then be cleaned with an all-purpose gentle cleaner</li>
            <li>The inside and outside can then be cleaned with an all-purpose gentle cleaner</li>
            <li>and I had a professional one I bought at a hair show and this unit works just as well.</li>
            <li>I set it up on an old microwave cart that I put in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It takes nearly 2 hours to melt 5 lbs of wax.</li>
            <li>Remove area, wait a few second and the repeat dipping 3 (or more)</li>
            <li>Remove area, wait a few second and the repeat dipping 3 (or more)</li>
            <li>Like the product very much, however, only 3 stars because it simply should not be sold with the &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; that is included.  </li>
            <li>the only problem with the cart is it is too high if I want to dip a foot</li>
            <li>The instructions are not clear, not translated correctly and say nothing about temperature settings, how much wax it will hold.  </li>
            <li>Warms up fast and is big enough to do your feet or elbows.</li>
            <li>Adjusting heat is a major plus</li>
            <li>I generally turn the unit on after lunch.</li>
            <li>In reading previous reviews it was clear that english was not the first language of the person who composed it</li>
            <li>Not only is the warmth of the paraffin soothing, it leaves my skin so soft and conditioned:  an extra bonus.  </li>
            <li>Easy to set up, however someone should edit the instruction manual as it appears to have been poor translation from mandarin to english.  </li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long even though I wrap my hands in plastic bags and bath towel.</li>
            <li> Did not come with complete directions, received page 3 and 4, pages 1 and 2 missing.</li>
            <li> Spent extra money to buy a Therabath with five-year warranty.</li>
            <li> others have noted, the instructions are a joke, written by someone with little knowledge of English.</li>

            <li> I got unscented paraffin and put few drops of lavender essential oil.</li>

            <li> Hope I don&#x27;t have any trouble sending it back.</li>
            <li> I also think it would use less electricity and less likely to catch fire.  </li>
            <li> As one who has never used a paraffin bath, it was necessary to explore Youtube and manuals from other products, combine that information along with the small bit that was usable from the enclosed manual and come up with something that made sense.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this paraffin bath!  My physician suggested I buy one to ease the arthritis pain in my hands.  Not only is the warmth of the paraffin soothing, it leaves my skin so soft and conditioned:  an extra bonus.  I keep this device on my kitchen counter (yes, it IS deserving of the counter space);  the bath is ready to bring up to temp and I use this at least once a day.  By peeling off the cooled paraffin, as directed, I am not using up the paraffin at all.&lt;br /&gt;(The extra bars of paraffin never were delivered - yet, although they were ordered at the same time).  I had to go to a local beauty supply store to buy the necessary additional paraffin to start using the bath.......at a greater price, I might add, than was offered on line.</li>
            <li> Temperature control did not work&lt;br /&gt;Then nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Quality seems very nice. Measures about 15&amp;#34;x 9 x 8. I bought it for my elderly mother&#x27;s arthritic hands. Temperature setting on unit and temp. instructions are in Centigrade; instructions written by someone with poor English skills. My mother not finding it as useful as I hoped, but no complaints about the unit itself.</li>
            <li> great product and shipping was excellant</li>
            <li> Like the product very much, however, only 3 stars because it simply should not be sold with the &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; that is included.  In reading previous reviews it was clear that english was not the first language of the person who composed it, however, the information is so poorly written that it is simply un-understandable and not safe.  As one who has never used a paraffin bath, it was necessary to explore Youtube and manuals from other products, combine that information along with the small bit that was usable from the enclosed manual and come up with something that made sense.  Should it be helpful, those synthesized directions that worked for us are included here, but you can do your own investigating.&lt;br /&gt;Paraffin Bath Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Use all common sense safety applications- use on level surface, not near bathtub, don’t immerse in water, keep away from small children, don’t leave empty unit plugged in, do not pour melted paraffin from tank, proper electrical connection…&lt;br /&gt;1) Remove all items from unit, including grate before adding wax.&lt;br /&gt;2) Add solid paraffin that is specified for use in paraffin bath.  “Depth of the wax in the pot should be half the height of the pot.” Some brands say to always keep the paraffin level about the minimum level (4 lbs of paraffin) marked in the tub; this unit, however, does not have a minimum marking.  Do not overfill.&lt;br /&gt;3) Place lid on unit.  Turn unit on.  Keep lid on when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;4) When unit is turned on, the factory setting is 50º C.  Adjust to 65ºC for heating.  After wax is melted adjust to 45-55ºC.  Use wax after the wax is within this range.  (Temps are from manual.)  Note, the temperature of the room can affect the temperature needed on unit.&lt;br /&gt;5) Place grate on top of solid paraffin or after wax is melted put grate in and allow it to sink to bottom.&lt;br /&gt;6) Do not use paraffin bath “if skin is damaged”.  (Any wounds, cuts, warts, inflamed skin, growths, impaired circulation, or decrease in sensation in hands or feet - consult doctor.)&lt;br /&gt;To Begin Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash and dry/sanitize area being treated before use.&lt;br /&gt;2) Remove rings/jewelry and clothing that could interfere.&lt;br /&gt;3) Some units say you may want to apply lotion with lanolin &amp;/or aroma therapy oils can be added.&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply a small amount of wax to the inside of wrist to insure the temperature of the wax is suitable.&lt;br /&gt;5) Slowly dip area being treated into paraffin (hand, elbow, foot)&lt;br /&gt;6) Remove area, wait a few second and the repeat dipping 3 (or more) times.&lt;br /&gt;7) Place area in plastic bag and then cover with towel or terry cloth mitt or booties.&lt;br /&gt;8) Keep paraffin on for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;9) Pull off plastic bag and paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;10) Discard used paraffin, especially if multiple people use bath (we don&#x27;t discard, peal off and put back in).&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Instructions from other units:  (have not yet cleaned ours)&lt;br /&gt;• Clean the unit after 40 or so treatments, or if the paraffin is no longer clear, or if sediment accumulates.&lt;br /&gt;• Do not use a tool that could scratch or damage the tank to remove paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;• Do not use abrasive cleaning products to cleaning the tank.&lt;br /&gt;• Unplug and remove grill; let the paraffin solidify.&lt;br /&gt;• Plug the unit back in/turn on until the paraffin loosens from the tank; unplug again.&lt;br /&gt;• Push down on one end of the paraffin to tip the other end up; lift out soiled paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;• Clean out paraffin residue with a soft paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;• The inside and outside can then be cleaned with an all-purpose gentle cleaner&lt;br /&gt;• When the tank is dry, refill with appropriate paraffin.sation in hands or feet - consult doctor.)&lt;br /&gt;To Begin Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash and dry/sanitize area being treated before use.&lt;br /&gt;2) Remove rings/jewelry and clothing that could interfere.&lt;br /&gt;3) Some units say you may want to apply lotion with lanolin &amp;/or aroma therapy oils can be added.&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply a small amount of wax to the inside of wrist to insure the temperature of the wax is suitable.&lt;br /&gt;5) Slowly dip area being treated into paraffin (hand, elbow, foot)&lt;br /&gt;6) Remove area, wait a few second and the repeat dipping 3 (or more) times.&lt;br /&gt;7) Place area in plastic bag and then cover with towel or terry cloth mitt or booties.&lt;br /&gt;8) Keep paraffin on for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;9) Pull off plastic bag and paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;10) Discard used paraffin, especially if multiple people use bath (we don&#x27;t discard, peal off and put back in).&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Instructions from other units:  (have not yet cleaned ours)&lt;br /&gt;• Clean the unit after 40 or so treatments, or if the paraffin is no longer clear, or if sediment accumulates.&lt;br /&gt;• Do not use a tool that could scratch or damage the tank to remove paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;• Do not use abrasive cleaning products to cleaning the tank.&lt;br /&gt;• Unplug and remove grill; let the paraffin solidify.&lt;br /&gt;• Plug the unit back in/turn on until the paraffin loosens from the tank; unplug again.&lt;br /&gt;• Push down on one end of the paraffin to tip the other end up; lift out soiled paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;• Clean out paraffin residue with a soft paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;• The inside and outside can then be cleaned with an all-purpose gentle cleaner&lt;br /&gt;• When the tank is dry, refill with appropriate paraffin.</li>
            <li> This paraffin is warmer is great for the price.  It melts paraffin quickly and has enough space for a size 11 foot.</li>
            <li> Good price on this product. We use it 4 to 5 times a week for arithis and trigger finger. Downloaded the instructions from the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> Poor product. Heats up to 65 degrees.. Buy the wax, put it in a pan and set it in the sun would work better!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and especially my hands really dry up after using water and sometimes broke out and painful.  I decided to try paraffin spa so I purchased this.  When my hands badly dried then I did few times a day...then yes, wonderful results!!  My hands get faster healing than only using hand cream.  I got unscented paraffin and put few drops of lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I find that it warms up very quickly, to melt the wax and stays at a very comfortable temperature to dip my hands into for therapeutic treatment. I keep the wax bath on constantly but at a lower temperature for when ever I need it.</li>
            <li> This warmer stopped working after maybe a week of having it. I work in a salon and I didn&#x27;t even get to use it on a client. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the controls did not function but when left plugged in  for some time they did start working. I&#x27;m now testing to determine whether this will be a recurring problem. If so I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
            <li> thought might come with wax.. Didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;No bags etc. Oh Well</li>
            <li> Just love it.  Use it for my feet which was very callous and painful.  With several uses my feet is a lot smoother sass nd there is no pain.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The bath is great but the shipping takes forever.  It works great for the price!</li>
            <li> Did not come with complete directions, received page 3 and 4, pages 1 and 2 missing.</li>
            <li> The instructions are not clear, not translated correctly and say nothing about temperature settings, how much wax it will hold.  Lots of mis-spelled words!  Made in China of course.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Everyone in the family is hooked on soaking their hands every night. Warms up fast and is big enough to do your feet or elbows. Nice sleek design and more durable than the smaller less commercial type.</li>
            <li> Great product, works really well. Wax melts quickly, and once set, maintains a steady temperature.  However, as has been mentioned before, the directions included are useless.  I followed the instructions in a review by &amp;#34;istadevata&amp;#34; dated March 6, 2015 and have had excellent results. I use this for arthritis and it provides excellent results.</li>
            <li> great quality. looks very professional. love them</li>
            <li> I was anxious for this to arrive because I have calcification between the joints of my hands and I thought the heat would give me some relief. Yes, it takes 2 hours to melt the wax but I have left it plugged in ever since. Melt the wax at 60 but be sure and turn the temp down to 50 +/- before taking a dip. So far, so good! I&#x27;ve used it twice a day on both hands and I&#x27;m feeling some relief. My only complaint would be the instructions, they really need someone who understands and can write the English language.</li>
            <li> does what it says and it heats up quickly no need to keep it plugged in all the time. It is a large size that will fit your hole hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. It doesn&#x27;t realty take 2 hours to heat up, more like 75 minutes. I really like it. It&#x27;s large enough to dip hands in and feet, one at a time.</li>
            <li> Have used it 3 times now and love it.  It stays at the temperature you put it and the paraffin melts really fast at the temperature they tell you to melt it at. Delivery was the time they said it would be and was pleased to get it because it was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I keep this wax warmer on all the time, I just lowered the heat to 38, when you start the unit it heats at 50.  Temp. at 38 is warm enough to keep the wax liquid and still do the job.  I also think it would use less electricity and less likely to catch fire.  I&#x27;m a licensed hair dresser and I had a professional one I bought at a hair show and this unit works just as well.</li>
            <li> Product worked about ten days when thermostat quit and couldn&#x27;t tell how hot wax was - very dangerous!  Product directions were extremely poorly translated Chinese to English and unintelligible at best.  Warranty only a year.  Amazon provided full refund and shipping label.  Spent extra money to buy a Therabath with five-year warranty.</li>
            <li> I love this produce. Heats wax quickly; is large enough for my hands and feet. I have hand issues and my hand doctor suggested this type of hand therapy. Works great. Hand joints working well and skin softness an extra bonus. Liked the rack it was all white and the lid easy to lift. Adjusting heat is a major plus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large, easily holds six pounds of wax and only takes an hour or so to melt it. I found that unless you add 8 oz. of mineral oil to every 4 lbs. of wax (what I used) the wax is too sticky and hard to get off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls aren&#x27;t the best, took me a while to figure them out: you have to hold down the arrows to adjust the temperature - simply touching them won&#x27;t work. Hold down and then it adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question is will this do anything for my trigger finger and the possible beginnings of arthritis?  I don&#x27;t yet know only having used it twice.</li>
            <li> Excellent paraffin bath, modern design, adjustable temperature. Great for my business!</li>
            <li> Works well and heat feels good on arthritic hands but it doesn&#x27;t last long even though I wrap my hands in plastic bags and bath towel. I leave it on for about 10 minutes but the feeling of heat subsides in about 5 mins. My hands are less painful overall so it must be helping. I set it up on an old microwave cart that I put in the bathroom. You need space for it and the only problem with the cart is it is too high if I want to dip a foot (one foot at a time would fit). I haven&#x27;t tried that yet but would only move the unit to the floor before plugging it in as you don&#x27;t want to spill any hot wax! I generally turn the unit on after lunch. It takes nearly 2 hours to melt 5 lbs of wax. I bought Paramed wax on Amazon. 6 lbs was about $25. It&#x27;s good and very oily so no need to add mineral oil. I only added 5-6 drops of peppermint oil as recommended by my physical therapist. May try adding more but we do notice a slight odor from it. Not unpleasant, just something we are not used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I cannot tell is whether the interior is plastic or metal. My PT said to get metal as some plastic units leak. Inside and out is all white and when you tap on the inside it sounds more like plastic than metal. But it hasn&#x27;t leaked after the first week. Overall, happy with it. But be aware it does take some dedicated space, and then commitment to use it regularly. It is easier to do one hand at a time unless you have someone to help cover your second hand. It would be hard to do both hands if you&#x27;re alone. I do one at a time so I have the other hand free to use my iPad, TV remote or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the product was fulfilled by Amazon, but not sure. In any case, after 5 business days, it had not even been processed for shipping! I contacted Amazon and they expedited it but be aware if you use free shipping, that apparently also means you&#x27;re at the back of the line for even starting to process your order! Pay for shipping if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I had the wax within 2 or 3 days and it sat here waiting for the warmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the instructions are a joke, written by someone with little knowledge of English. Another reviewer wrote out the directions, which was helpful. Also, go to YouTube and a couple of physical therapists have a very good video on how to use it. You must dip your hands or feet at least 5 times to get enough wax layer to provide enough heat. I sometimes do more dips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my advice is to be aware it takes time to melt the wax, and time to use it daily, or whenever. If you don&#x27;t have the time, this will just be another dust catcher. But if you can invest the time, it does seem to help arthritis pain. My PT said I&#x27;d notice more benefit over time as it reduces inflammation each time you use it.in 2 or 3 days and it sat here waiting for the warmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the instructions are a joke, written by someone with little knowledge of English.

            <li> works well.  needed 2 blocks of wax.  instructions were obviously translated into english, and not done well at that.  the grammar and spelling is so bad that they are laughable.  luckily the product is pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li> It looked exactly as advertised.  Haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Everything I wanted in a hot wax spa. i would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This paraffin wax warmer replaces one that gave out after 4 years.  It is doing very well and it was good that I printed out the comments by other buyers because it gave me a good look how to operated it.  It&#x27;s easy but the hints about 35 degrees make it easier to reheat.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, however someone should edit the instruction manual as it appears to have been poor translation from mandarin to english.  Hey if I could be so smart its just that some of the phrases or words used in the translation did not make any sense so I had to intuit the meaning.  Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> Works well. Nice large size.  Need about 4 lbs to fill to good level.</li>
            <li> my arthritic hands are very painful.  this hot wax really helps relieve the pain and the swelling.  the lavender fragrance is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m melting the paraffin @ 65 C, then decrease temperature till 47 C, add some essential oils and enjoy my home hand therapy.</li>
            <li> Defective. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to melt the wax. Hope I don&#x27;t have any trouble sending it back.</li>
            <li> Had to send back - wouldn&#x27;t heat after first use.</li>
