            <li>This product is not their best, but I am still a fan of the company.</li>
            <li>It was awesome!</li>
            <li>Best feature is it&#x27;s organic.  </li>
            <li>This is the best organic mascara I have found and it lasts all day and covers beautifully.</li>
            <li>Their packagings and bottles are always so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, which is another bonus in addition to the naturalness of their items.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great mascara</li>
            <li>Lol).</li>
            <li>Great choice for organic mascara.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage and volume.</li>
            <li>Worn alone, it looks great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great Price for a semi-natural product.</li>
            <li>I asked my hubby to find me cruelty free mascara for Christmas (he loves reading reviews and searching for the best products...</li>
            <li>I had to explain what mascara was and what traits good mascara has.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of separating the lashes.</li>
            <li>but it looks good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Physicians Formula makeup for 6 years and loved all their blush, eyeliner, concealer, etc.</li>
            <li>I loved the fat brush that made my lashes thicker and prevented lash splitting.</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews about smudging!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Very cool, very handy.</li>
            <li>organic goodness - looks lovely - lasts - good product</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to be sitting here typing without having my eyes tear up and burn . . .</li>
            <li>Does kind of come off</li>
            <li>Just not a product that holds up to the humidity of Tennessee summers or in the kitchen if you are around steam or heat of any kind.</li>
            <li>Good mascara but smears easily.</li>
            <li>There are much better alternatives that function better and are safer to use ingredients wise.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very easy and doesn&#x27;t clump up or flake off.</li>
            <li>Smudges and runs very easily</li>
            <li>My search for a safe, effective mascara continues...</li>
            <li>but this tube is made to be opened easily!</li>
            <li>However, easy smudging!  </li>
            <li>nicely and easily washes off at the end of the day</li>
            <li>Although this is a safe mascara option, its performance leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>I like to roll the wand as I apply mascara since most mascara&#x27;s wands are in a cylinder shape and this wand makes me slowdown when applying it.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara;</li>
            <li>I felt the need to leave a review because this deserves more than the 3 star rating is has.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>, when you are done, the result is lovely.</li>
            <li>wish the wand could pick up more</li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck.</li>
            <li>:) It does not, however, smudge onto my surrounding eye areas and stays on all day if I don&#x27;t touch it.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful mascara for the price and would recommend it to anyone who has a similar situation to mine.</li>
            <li>factor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, still way better than a synthetic product.</li>
            <li>I like it for what it is :)</li>
            <li>I love the packaging of this product and the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Most mascaras give me issues.</li>
            <li>This would get a better review but it immediately started coming off under eyes.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this adds to the melting effect of the product wherever my lashes touch my eyelids.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the raccoon eye look, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>both mascaras do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on and does not smudge, it dries quickly after you put it on</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find a product so well rated by EWG.org, and at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>I like to stay pretty natural with my looks so this mascara is perfect!</li>
            <li>The most important thing.</li>
            <li>I liked this alot better than the 100% pure mascara.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s on the PETA animal friendly list, but it&#x27;s not workable for me.</li>
            <li>This mascara will strengthen them and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>like how easy it is to remove it in the evening,</li>
            <li>Brush is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Oh also it was easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It felt tacky all day and smudged easily.</li>
            <li>and it smudged so easy.</li>
            <li>Works well for fullness and volume, but easily smudges under the eyes.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and goes on fairly easily.</li>
            <li>I can even come home in the evening, press my lashes to my lid as I remove my contacts and will see a perfect black outline of my lashes from the mascara.</li>
            <li>I like the Tarte Cosmetics Gifted Amazonian Clay Smart Mascara better.</li>
            <li>This Physicians Formula Organic wear is great for several reasons.</li>
            <li>CRUELTY FREE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised, as this mascara has one of the lowest irritancy ratings (which is a good thing).  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product and love love love that is is organic and makes my lashes bigger, bolder, and blacker!</li>
            <li>The brush is decent, and it has no smell which is nice.</li>
            <li>I introduced myself to the Physician&#x27;s Formula line of mascaras by trying their original one.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brand in and of itself, however, I do prefer their original mascara.</li>
            <li>Bummer because I was really excited for this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been switching over to the Physician&#x27;s Formula Organics line as an affordable, accessible alternative to all of the uber-pricey organic/cruelty-free/paraben-free, etc.</li>
            <li>But, to get a really pure mascara, I&#x27;ve found you have to pay about $18 to $25, and sometimes more.</li>
            <li>I really want to fully love this mascara, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>so light weight that it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes look full but it smudges quickly.</li>
            <li>Often got in my eyes which caused mild stinging and redness.</li>
            <li>Mascara runs quickly.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky and easy to smudge.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I ended up loving it, and decided to try a second style.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite natural mascara.</li>
            <li>I hope to try a different kind soon.  </li>
            <li>My major problem with this product was that it rubbed (for lack of a better word right now) off and created darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The tube is very, very easy to open.</li>
            <li>The downside: it smudges very quickly and leaves marks on bottom lid more than other mascaras.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are pretty stubby</li>
            <li>This mascara was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I may just be out of luck for wearing mascara at all, but this would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li>I started oil cleansing my face 2 weeks ago and since, my skin &amp; lashes have more moisture than prior to oil cleansing.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t learnt how to use it so that this is minimised (as opposed to the first day</li>
            <li>I only wear mascara on my top lashes</li>
            <li>The applicator is plasticy and the bristles are not long enough to give good coverage, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all these positive reviews, it disapointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really would be nice if it dried a little better while still being a natural product, but overall, it does make your eyelashes look a lot more exotic, and the lashes longer and accentuated.</li>
            <li>do wish it could dry more..</li>
            <li>My only issue with it is that it smears really easily</li>
            <li>Other mascaras would dry and become crusty, clumpy, and flaky (something I would love to pick at...which irritated my eyes even more).</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t make them brittle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with all my make-up junk-free.</li>
            <li>It clumps, but makes your lashes look much longer.</li>
            <li>I really like both.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive/red eyes and needed something gentle.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting that anyway.</li>
            <li>This one needs much work.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I tried really powdering my eyelashes before applying it.  </li>
            <li>I tried wiping as much off of the applicator with a tissue before applying.  </li>
            <li>I really like the voluminous and darkening effects of this mascara.</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>definitely the top natural mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Though I like the shape of the tube, it&#x27;s kind of big and chunky and can take up a lot of room in my makeup bag, I wish they would use a standard tube.  </li>
            <li>I love all their other products</li>
            <li>so I will try one of their other mascaras to see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li>Even tho the brush is the new plastic ones it applies VERY well and separates them.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>other nice thing is you find and purchase these Physician Formula mascaras at local stores like Walmart and CVS</li>
            <li>, it was very clumpy--but that might have been because the tube was possibly old?  </li>
            <li>This mascara burned my eyes when I first applied it and would not dry.  </li>
            <li>I cant stand these new rubber macara brushes that have these rubber stumps and cause my lashes to be drenched in mascara and split apart.</li>
            <li>I add a drop of natural saline contact solution and voila; like new!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look long, full and natural.</li>
            <li>- The black is truly a strong black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you can get major &#x27;panda eyes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and couldn&#x27;t  wear this at all.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty simple makeup routine: mascara and concealer(if needed).</li>
            <li>Only problem is its not water proof but leaves pretty effect on eyes and lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>Does not make dry flaky yuckiness on your lashes like cheap traditional mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Also I noticed since using this my natural lashes are a bit fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus there&#x27;s no parabens, no perfumes, all natural etc.</li>
            <li>I am surprised this product is even on the market.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how old it was</li>
            <li>Mostly natural.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, maybe I will try the waterproof next.</li>
            <li>I like how natural it is.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought their mascara and as soon as I put it on my freshly cleaned face, it left big black rings under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It also still bothers my eyes, like a sensitivity, but not nearly as bad as other commercial brands.  </li>
            <li>But it was gentle on my eyes, and had minimal drying/flaking.  </li>
            <li>Until I get a different mascara, I will use a lash comb and check a mirror frequently to remove smudges from under eye.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it takes a while to dry so avoid rubbing your eyes and putting too much on at once</li>
            <li>This organic black mascara really works!  </li>
            <li>My lashes all stuck together and looked extremely strange and it took over ten supplementary brush strokes with an e.l.f brand mascara smoothing brush to get them to look somewhat decent.</li>
            <li>or it will never dry.</li>
            <li>so it is not as hard to find like other organic mascaras :)</li>
            <li>If you are willing to spend a few minutes manually separating and distributing your mascara amongst your lashes, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue using the first one as my everyday choice but will keep this one as my backup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving three stars because this product... does not dry.</li>
            <li>and I find dotted black pieces around the bottom of my eye after a long day, but this is usually on hot days.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened I was expecting a possible dull black but to my relieve it was a strong black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the brush that came with this product, but my main issue was how it runs down my face when my eyes water.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really want to fully love this mascara, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> so light weight that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes look full but it smudges quickly.</li>
            <li> Often got in my eyes which caused mild stinging and redness.</li>
            <li> Mascara runs quickly.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky and easy to smudge.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ended up loving it, and decided to try a second style.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite natural mascara.</li>
            <li> I hope to try a different kind soon.  </li>
            <li> My major problem with this product was that it rubbed (for lack of a better word right now) off and created darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The tube is very, very easy to open.</li>
            <li> The downside: it smudges very quickly and leaves marks on bottom lid more than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are pretty stubby</li>
            <li> This mascara was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I may just be out of luck for wearing mascara at all, but this would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I started oil cleansing my face 2 weeks ago and since, my skin &amp; lashes have more moisture than prior to oil cleansing.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t learnt how to use it so that this is minimised (as opposed to the first day</li>
            <li> I only wear mascara on my top lashes</li>
            <li> The applicator is plasticy and the bristles are not long enough to give good coverage, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all these positive reviews, it disapointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really would be nice if it dried a little better while still being a natural product, but overall, it does make your eyelashes look a lot more exotic, and the lashes longer and accentuated.</li>
            <li> do wish it could dry more..</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that it smears really easily</li>
            <li> Other mascaras would dry and become crusty, clumpy, and flaky (something I would love to pick at...which irritated my eyes even more).</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t make them brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with all my make-up junk-free.</li>
            <li> It clumps, but makes your lashes look much longer.</li>
            <li> I really like both.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive/red eyes and needed something gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting that anyway.</li>
            <li> This one needs much work.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I tried really powdering my eyelashes before applying it.  </li>
            <li> I tried wiping as much off of the applicator with a tissue before applying.  </li>
            <li> I really like the voluminous and darkening effects of this mascara.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> definitely the top natural mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Though I like the shape of the tube, it&#x27;s kind of big and chunky and can take up a lot of room in my makeup bag, I wish they would use a standard tube.  </li>
            <li> I love all their other products</li>
            <li> so I will try one of their other mascaras to see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li> Even tho the brush is the new plastic ones it applies VERY well and separates them.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> other nice thing is you find and purchase these Physician Formula mascaras at local stores like Walmart and CVS</li>
            <li> , it was very clumpy--but that might have been because the tube was possibly old?  </li>
            <li> This mascara burned my eyes when I first applied it and would not dry.  </li>
            <li> I cant stand these new rubber macara brushes that have these rubber stumps and cause my lashes to be drenched in mascara and split apart.</li>
            <li> I add a drop of natural saline contact solution and voila; like new!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look long, full and natural.</li>
            <li> - The black is truly a strong black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you can get major &#x27;panda eyes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and couldn&#x27;t  wear this at all.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty simple makeup routine: mascara and concealer(if needed).</li>
            <li> Only problem is its not water proof but leaves pretty effect on eyes and lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Does not make dry flaky yuckiness on your lashes like cheap traditional mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Also I noticed since using this my natural lashes are a bit fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s no parabens, no perfumes, all natural etc.</li>
            <li> I am surprised this product is even on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how old it was</li>
            <li> Mostly natural.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, maybe I will try the waterproof next.</li>
            <li> I like how natural it is.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought their mascara and as soon as I put it on my freshly cleaned face, it left big black rings under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It also still bothers my eyes, like a sensitivity, but not nearly as bad as other commercial brands.  </li>
            <li> But it was gentle on my eyes, and had minimal drying/flaking.  </li>
            <li> Until I get a different mascara, I will use a lash comb and check a mirror frequently to remove smudges from under eye.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it takes a while to dry so avoid rubbing your eyes and putting too much on at once</li>
            <li> This organic black mascara really works!  </li>
            <li> My lashes all stuck together and looked extremely strange and it took over ten supplementary brush strokes with an e.l.f brand mascara smoothing brush to get them to look somewhat decent.</li>
            <li> or it will never dry.</li>
            <li> so it is not as hard to find like other organic mascaras :)</li>
            <li> If you are willing to spend a few minutes manually separating and distributing your mascara amongst your lashes, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using the first one as my everyday choice but will keep this one as my backup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving three stars because this product... does not dry.</li>
            <li> and I find dotted black pieces around the bottom of my eye after a long day, but this is usually on hot days.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened I was expecting a possible dull black but to my relieve it was a strong black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the brush that came with this product, but my main issue was how it runs down my face when my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed, there are other mascaras with the same skin deep ratings by the same brand that work better.</li>
            <li> only use Physician&#x27;s Formula (and other natural cruelty-free brands) for my eye makeup because I am big on trying to keep that area as chemical-free as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but it can sometimes drip little specks of black on my under eye if I pull the applicator through my lashes too quickly.</li>
            <li> but maybe it not drying is how it functions to keep your lashes conditioned and not dried out like other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sad because I really had so much hope!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on getting raccoon eyes, but I knew it didn&#x27;t dry because I felt my upper lashes several hours after applying and they were sticky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try another version of Physician Formula mascara possibly the CC (silver) or Fake out (pink) and see if I have better luck with those.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time saying anything bad as I love that it is on the natural side of things, but as other reviewers have said, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really dries completely.</li>
            <li> It dosn&#x27;t run at all for me (although I did have that problem with the 100% natural mascara of the same brand in the GREEN TUBE.)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really remove excess product from the wand with a tissue before use, due to the applicator being made of firm plastic.  </li>
            <li> I know this is probably due to the lack of chemicals used in other products to achieve this, but I have had another, very expensive natural mascara, that performed better in this category.</li>
            <li> Smudges all day long- embarrassing!</li>
            <li> There is a trick to applying this mascara faster - always let each coat to dry out before applying another.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t ever dry.</li>
            <li> (unfortunately) because it doesn&#x27;t even seem worthy of another try.</li>
            <li> It lasts awhile and dosn&#x27;t get cakey and gross after a couple weeks like that one did..if it starts getting a little dry</li>
            <li> takes minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It never really &amp;#34;sets up.&amp;#34;  If you happen to rub your eye, it gets on your face and fingers after hours of wearing it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not waterproof, but</li>
            <li> I expected an organic mascara to perform differently than a conventional one, but what difference I expected I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I am still new to makeup even though I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, and I found this on sale for $2 at target!  </li>
            <li> I will try one of their other organic mascaras to see if there is any improvement on the drying</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it in an active situation</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m blonde, the straight black looks really really artificial on me.  </li>
            <li> This mascara stays on clean for about 2 minutes, and then forms dark circles under your eyes that are impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> It never really &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; or dried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it never really dries, it just sits like a stiff goo on your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but Smears easily and burns if you cry :(</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have returned less than a handful of items out of the hundreds I have bought on Amazon, but this is one I would return.</li>
            <li> B00806TYUS KORRES Abyssinia Oil Volumising &amp; Strengthening Mascara - BLACK 01]], and Josie Maran Argan Triple Volume Mascara Black</li>
            <li> I had no problems with my previous mascara.</li>
            <li> In an hour I had spots of black under my eyes &amp; on anything my lashes happened to touch (fingers &amp; t-shirts).</li>
            <li> Flakes off and leaves black under my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> By the end of the night, it had smudged a little.</li>
            <li> I say &amp;#34;semi&amp;#34; because if you read ALL of the ingredients and do a little research, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s not the purest mascara on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used both this version and the Jumbo Lash version (the one in the green leaf container) of this brand.</li>
            <li> Specifically, the one that looks like a green leaf on a beige twig.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> , you do not have to worry about rubbing your eyes hard to wash it off and no worry about having raccoon eyes after washing this off like with other mascaras!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I usually have a little difficulty because my hands having moisturizer or something on them</li>
            <li> I usually get the one in the green bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is natural, does not have a terrible smell, does not irritate my eyes, is long-lasting, the brush evenly coats and separates lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump/flake, and it really does increase lash length/thickness/strength.  </li>
            <li> It also goes on thick, so lashes look oddly thick/clumped together.  </li>
            <li> My favorites are: [[ASIN:B003N4ST94 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Black Tea Mascara]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This mascara and my apparently slick lashes do not get along.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a total deal breaker, but can be annoying to constantly be wiping my eyelids during the day.</li>
            <li> This mascara does everything I want from a mascara; lengthens, thickens, darkens, and hardly any clumping.</li>
            <li> All it takes is a little humidity, or putting eye drops in your eyes, or heavens forbid any moisturizer around your eyes and halfway through the day you will look like a tired, sleep deprived junkie.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I have a major bad habit of \\&quot;picking\\&quot; at my eyelashes throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Does not have unpleasant smells like traditional mascaras.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> Also, there are some questionable ingredients when you do a little digging.  </li>
            <li> Did not fully dry on my eyelashes and seriously looked like a raccoon with how badly it smudged.</li>
            <li> This mascara I found does not become dry/brittle or clumpy, and when I feel the urge to pick at my eyelashes with this on, it smudges onto my fingers and is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I get really bad itchy eyes and allergy reaction to other mascaras...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if my eyes water, or I sweat, the mascara would run into my eyes and make them burn.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say this is going in the trash</li>
            <li> Irritates my eyes n makes me tear like crazy</li>
            <li> but this product was disappointing.</li>
            <li> When I put the mascara on, it looked like I had fake lashes!</li>
            <li> That is my bad for not noticing when I purchased.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was at work for maybe an hour, and it smudged so bad and wouldn&#x27;t come off my skin!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s helping me break my bad habit!</li>
            <li> This mascara runs so badly!</li>
            <li> then yes it will smudge...but waterproof mascara is horrible for your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is one of the worst smudging mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is an awful mascara.</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>
            <li> May be non toxic but it runs terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Although this is a safe mascara option, its performance leaves a lot to be desired. I found it smudging under my eyes during the day. My search for a safe, effective mascara continues...</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara. I didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;not drying&amp;#34; issue that others mentioned. Mine dries &amp; doesn&#x27;t smudge. It&#x27;s gentle on my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t make them brittle. I&#x27;m much happier with all my make-up junk-free. Let&#x27;s hear it for healthier cosmetics!</li>
            <li> WOW This organic black mascara really works!  When I first opened I was expecting a possible dull black but to my relieve it was a strong black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;1 - It truly lengthens the eyelashes. See picture attached to this review.&lt;br /&gt;2 - It does NOT clog or makes crumbs&lt;br /&gt;3 - Even tho the brush is the new plastic ones it applies VERY well and separates them.&lt;br /&gt;4 - The black is truly a strong black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so good:&lt;br /&gt;1- the shape of the plastic cap of wand (which is of a curved tip of a leaf) feels to me a bit cumber some. I like to roll the wand as I apply mascara since most mascara&#x27;s wands are in a cylinder shape and this wand makes me slowdown when applying it. I wish they would change the shape of the wand cap.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara; definitely the top natural mascara I&#x27;ve used. This is all I buy now. I felt the need to leave a review because this deserves more than the 3 star rating is has. It dosn&#x27;t run at all for me (although I did have that problem with the 100% natural mascara of the same brand in the GREEN TUBE.) This mascara does everything I want from a mascara; lengthens, thickens, darkens, and hardly any clumping. Well worth the price. I liked this alot better than the 100% pure mascara. It lasts awhile and dosn&#x27;t get cakey and gross after a couple weeks like that one did..if it starts getting a little dry I add a drop of natural saline contact solution and voila; like new! :) Also I noticed since using this my natural lashes are a bit fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS If you rub your eyes or cry or get caught it the rain then yes it will smudge...but waterproof mascara is horrible for your eyelashes. It is hell to remove, I&#x27;d lose lashes everytime regardless of the method. This mascara will strengthen them and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> organic goodness - looks lovely - lasts - good product</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t irritate your eyes. No dryness or redness. The downside: it smudges very quickly and leaves marks on bottom lid more than other mascaras.</li>
            <li> -1 star for taking a while to build some noticeable effect, yet, when you are done, the result is lovely. There is a trick to applying this mascara faster - always let each coat to dry out before applying another.&lt;br /&gt;I like how easy it is to remove it in the evening, takes minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the wand could pick up more product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great mascara and I plan on buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> I introduced myself to the Physician&#x27;s Formula line of mascaras by trying their original one. I ended up loving it, and decided to try a second style. This was the one that I chose, because it promised thicker, clump-free lashes. I was slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara was not clump-free at all. My lashes all stuck together and looked extremely strange and it took over ten supplementary brush strokes with an e.l.f brand mascara smoothing brush to get them to look somewhat decent. However, the advertised &amp;#34;lengthening&amp;#34; effect was delivered as promised, so it&#x27;s a 50/50 thing. It clumps, but makes your lashes look much longer. If you are willing to spend a few minutes manually separating and distributing your mascara amongst your lashes, this is the one for you. If you are searching for a grab, apply, and go style, this is not the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use Physician&#x27;s Formula (and other natural cruelty-free brands) for my eye makeup because I am big on trying to keep that area as chemical-free as possible. Their packagings and bottles are always so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, which is another bonus in addition to the naturalness of their items. I recommend this brand in and of itself, however, I do prefer their original mascara. I am going to continue using the first one as my everyday choice but will keep this one as my backup. This product is not their best, but I am still a fan of the company.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the brush that came with this product, but my main issue was how it runs down my face when my eyes water.  I love that it&#x27;s on the PETA animal friendly list, but it&#x27;s not workable for me.</li>
            <li> Burned when I had watery eyes</li>
            <li> Transfers to lower lid. Threw it away</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes look full but it smudges quickly.</li>
            <li> Product constantly wore off and cause irritation getting in my eyes.  Could maybe use it for a short outting but not for daily use.  Bummer because I was really excited for this product.</li>
            <li> I wish it was actually organic</li>
            <li> I have a pretty simple makeup routine: mascara and concealer(if needed). I like to stay pretty natural with my looks so this mascara is perfect! It goes on very easy and doesn&#x27;t clump up or flake off. The only drawback is that it takes a while to dry so avoid rubbing your eyes and putting too much on at once or it will never dry.</li>
            <li> I asked my hubby to find me cruelty free mascara for Christmas (he loves reading reviews and searching for the best products...I had to explain what mascara was and what traits good mascara has. Lol). This Physicians Formula Organic wear is great for several reasons. 1.) The tube is very, very easy to open. I usually have a little difficulty because my hands having moisturizer or something on them but this tube is made to be opened easily! Very cool, very handy. 2.) My eyelashes are pretty stubby so I curled them for about 15 seconds each eye and oh my goodness. When I put the mascara on, it looked like I had fake lashes! It was awesome! I ran and told my hubby all about it. 3.) Brush is easy to use. It does a good job of separating the lashes. 4.) CRUELTY FREE The most important thing. Plus there&#x27;s no parabens, no perfumes, all natural etc. This mascara has it all. Oh also it was easy to wash off. I haven&#x27;t worn it in an active situation so I don&#x27;t know if it smudges. By the end of the night, it had smudged a little. Not bad.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this mascara. It never really &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; or dried. It felt tacky all day and smudged easily. I tried to return it to Amazon and they said it was not a &amp;#34;returnable&amp;#34;, yet it was not sold by a third party retailer. I am still trying. I have returned less than a handful of items out of the hundreds I have bought on Amazon, but this is one I would return. DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I have used both this version and the Jumbo Lash version (the one in the green leaf container) of this brand. I really like both. I like the additional ingredients in this one but both mascaras do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on and does not smudge, it dries quickly after you put it on so you don&#x27;t have to worry about waiting for it to set.&lt;br /&gt;It nicely and easily washes off at the end of the day, you do not have to worry about rubbing your eyes hard to wash it off and no worry about having raccoon eyes after washing this off like with other mascaras!&lt;br /&gt;The other nice thing is you find and purchase these Physician Formula mascaras at local stores like Walmart and CVS so it is not as hard to find like other organic mascaras :)</li>
            <li> Irritates my eyes n makes me tear like crazy</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a product so well rated by EWG.org, and at such a great price!  Unfortunately, if my eyes water, or I sweat, the mascara would run into my eyes and make them burn.  I&#x27;m really surprised, as this mascara has one of the lowest irritancy ratings (which is a good thing).  Maybe I am just the exception.  For the price, it is at least worth trying out.  Maybe you will have better luck.</li>
            <li> My major problem with this product was that it rubbed (for lack of a better word right now) off and created darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really want to fully love this mascara, but I can&#x27;t.  I can list a bunch of attributes but as a contact lens wearer, my hands and fingers will tend to touch my eyes throughout the day and that is a big no no, b/c this SMUDGES - even hours after I&#x27;ve applied it.  I can even come home in the evening, press my lashes to my lid as I remove my contacts and will see a perfect black outline of my lashes from the mascara.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, there are other mascaras with the same skin deep ratings by the same brand that work better. Specifically, the one that looks like a green leaf on a beige twig.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, my eyes decided I shouldn&#x27;t wear mascara anymore. They reacted to every damn one I tried--cheap, pricey, so-called hypo-allergenic--nothing worked.  Until this one. I am thrilled to be sitting here typing without having my eyes tear up and burn . . . I can wear mascara every day again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the best-looking mascara I&#x27;ve ever used?  No, but it looks good and I can wear it all day without it bothering my eyes one bit.  Hallelujah.  I&#x27;m off now to order the eyeliner . . .</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this!  It is one of the worst smudging mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used. Smudges all day long- embarrassing!</li>
            <li> This is an awful mascara. Did not fully dry on my eyelashes and seriously looked like a raccoon with how badly it smudged. I am surprised this product is even on the market.</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews about smudging! This mascara stays on clean for about 2 minutes, and then forms dark circles under your eyes that are impossible to remove. Avoid this one!</li>
            <li> Great choice for organic mascara.  Does kind of come off and I find dotted black pieces around the bottom of my eye after a long day, but this is usually on hot days.  Overall, great product and love love love that is is organic and makes my lashes bigger, bolder, and blacker!</li>
            <li> I am still new to makeup even though I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, and I found this on sale for $2 at target!  I don&#x27;t know how old it was, I didn&#x27;t look for a date on the package (or if there even is one to begin with??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my thoughts on this mascara, it was very clumpy--but that might have been because the tube was possibly old?  But it was gentle on my eyes, and had minimal drying/flaking.  Though I like the shape of the tube, it&#x27;s kind of big and chunky and can take up a lot of room in my makeup bag, I wish they would use a standard tube.  I&#x27;m going to try another version of Physician Formula mascara possibly the CC (silver) or Fake out (pink) and see if I have better luck with those.</li>
            <li> This is the best organic mascara I have found and it lasts all day and covers beautifully.</li>
            <li> Smudges and runs very easily</li>
            <li> It smudges after a couple hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> horrible. horrible. doesn&#x27;t ever dry. made my lashes look clumpy. and it smudged so easy. I was at work for maybe an hour, and it smudged so bad and wouldn&#x27;t come off my skin! avoid.</li>
            <li> This is not waterproof. That is my bad for not noticing when I purchased. It was very sticky and easy to smudge. Often got in my eyes which caused mild stinging and redness. Just not a product that holds up to the humidity of Tennessee summers or in the kitchen if you are around steam or heat of any kind.</li>
            <li> This mascara was exactly what I was hoping for. I have very sensitive/red eyes and needed something gentle. In addition, I have a major bad habit of \\&quot;picking\\&quot; at my eyelashes throughout the day. Other mascaras would dry and become crusty, clumpy, and flaky (something I would love to pick at...which irritated my eyes even more). This mascara I found does not become dry/brittle or clumpy, and when I feel the urge to pick at my eyelashes with this on, it smudges onto my fingers and is not pleasant. So it&#x27;s helping me break my bad habit! :) It does not, however, smudge onto my surrounding eye areas and stays on all day if I don&#x27;t touch it. My eyelashes look long, full and natural. This is a wonderful mascara for the price and would recommend it to anyone who has a similar situation to mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving three stars because this product... does not dry. If you touch your lashes, you get, guess what? goopy stuff on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I like it. Mostly natural. Doesn&#x27;t make your eyes water. Does not have unpleasant smells like traditional mascaras. Does not make dry flaky yuckiness on your lashes like cheap traditional mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it could dry more.. but maybe it not drying is how it functions to keep your lashes conditioned and not dried out like other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from walmart, I did check the reviews before, but I thought why not try it, its not like I want synthetic stuff in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It really would be nice if it dried a little better while still being a natural product, but overall, it does make your eyelashes look a lot more exotic, and the lashes longer and accentuated. Which is basically what the function of mascara is.&lt;br /&gt;The messiness factor counted off a lot, but overall, I do like it, and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;However, next time I purchase I will try one of their other organic mascaras to see if there is any improvement on the drying factor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, still way better than a synthetic product.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and volume. My only issue with it is that it smears really easily and I look like a raccoon by midday.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It is natural, does not have a terrible smell, does not irritate my eyes, is long-lasting, the brush evenly coats and separates lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump/flake, and it really does increase lash length/thickness/strength.  Worn alone, it looks great but when I want thicker lashes and have the time, I will layer with a second mascara.  My favorites are: [[ASIN:B003N4ST94 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Black Tea Mascara]], [[ASIN:B00806TYUS KORRES Abyssinia Oil Volumising &amp; Strengthening Mascara - BLACK 01]], and Josie Maran Argan Triple Volume Mascara Black</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It lasts through my work day. The only problem is that it runs a bit. Definitely not water proof, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting that anyway. I like it for what it is :)</li>
            <li> Not my favorite natural mascara. The applicator is plasticy and the bristles are not long enough to give good coverage, in my opinion. I like the Tarte Cosmetics Gifted Amazonian Clay Smart Mascara better.</li>
            <li> Good mascara but smears easily.</li>
            <li> It never really &amp;#34;sets up.&amp;#34;  If you happen to rub your eye, it gets on your face and fingers after hours of wearing it.  It also still bothers my eyes, like a sensitivity, but not nearly as bad as other commercial brands.  I may just be out of luck for wearing mascara at all, but this would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this product (not from Amazon) based upon the two 5 star reviews on the site. Decided to wear it on a Sunday while I was doing chores &amp; running errands and not to work where a runny mascara may embarrass me. Thank goodness that was the choice I made. I expected an organic mascara to perform differently than a conventional one, but what difference I expected I&#x27;m not sure. I started oil cleansing my face 2 weeks ago and since, my skin &amp; lashes have more moisture than prior to oil cleansing. I had no problems with my previous mascara. This mascara and my apparently slick lashes do not get along. In an hour I had spots of black under my eyes &amp; on anything my lashes happened to touch (fingers &amp; t-shirts). Needless to say this is going in the trash (unfortunately) because it doesn&#x27;t even seem worthy of another try. Sad because I really had so much hope!</li>
            <li> The brush is decent, and it has no smell which is nice. But it never dries! 1/2 way through my day if I touch my eyelashes it wipes off on my finger. Flakes off and leaves black under my lower lashes. I really wanted to like this product, maybe I will try the waterproof next.</li>
            <li> I have used Physicians Formula for years and thought I&#x27;d try this since it&#x27;s the same brand.  I usually get the one in the green bottle.  I have very sensitive eyes and couldn&#x27;t  wear this at all.  It caused headaches and eye irritation all day.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it off.</li>
            <li> Works well for fullness and volume, but easily smudges under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Mascara runs quickly. Every time I look in the mirror I have to wipe under my eyes. Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Physicians Formula makeup for 6 years and loved all their blush, eyeliner, concealer, etc. This is the first time I bought their mascara and as soon as I put it on my freshly cleaned face, it left big black rings under my eyes.  I love all their other products but I never had mascara from any company that did this.  So unattractive.  I hope to try a different kind soon.  This one needs much work.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It lasts all day and goes on fairly easily. Sometimes it gets clumpy. I like how natural it is.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this mascara.  I&#x27;ve been switching over to the Physician&#x27;s Formula Organics line as an affordable, accessible alternative to all of the uber-pricey organic/cruelty-free/paraben-free, etc. cosmetics that I have to go to a specialty store to buy.  I bought the \\&quot;Lash Boosting\\&quot; variety because my eyelashes are shorter and thinner than I&#x27;d like.  I love the packaging of this product and the applicator.  However, this mascara DOES smudge!  Big time.  All it takes is a little humidity, or putting eye drops in your eyes, or heavens forbid any moisturizer around your eyes and halfway through the day you will look like a tired, sleep deprived junkie.  It&#x27;s like it never really dries, it just sits like a stiff goo on your eyelashes.  Yes, it does make my eyelashes fuller and longer, but I can&#x27;t deal with a mascara that just won&#x27;t set.  I tried really powdering my eyelashes before applying it.  I tried wiping as much off of the applicator with a tissue before applying.  Still, it comes off. I also don&#x27;t like that there isn&#x27;t a Brown color option.  Since I&#x27;m blonde, the straight black looks really really artificial on me.  I do like this brand so I will try one of their other mascaras to see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all these positive reviews, it disapointed. I loved the fat brush that made my lashes thicker and prevented lash splitting. I cant stand these new rubber macara brushes that have these rubber stumps and cause my lashes to be drenched in mascara and split apart.Most mascaras give me issues. This would get a better review but it immediately started coming off under eyes.</li>
            <li> This runs and smudges under my eyes with perspiration... not for going out dancing.  It also goes on thick, so lashes look oddly thick/clumped together.  You can&#x27;t really remove excess product from the wand with a tissue before use, due to the applicator being made of firm plastic.  Until I get a different mascara, I will use a lash comb and check a mirror frequently to remove smudges from under eye.</li>
            <li> Oy product that will not burn my face. Absolutely not waterproof, but so light weight that it is worth it. You can&#x27;t tell that you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Goes on well but Smears easily and burns if you cry :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but it can sometimes drip little specks of black on my under eye if I pull the applicator through my lashes too quickly.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t run, i do wish it created a bit of a longer lash look</li>
            <li> Great Price for a semi-natural product. I say &amp;#34;semi&amp;#34; because if you read ALL of the ingredients and do a little research, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s not the purest mascara on the market. But, to get a really pure mascara, I&#x27;ve found you have to pay about $18 to $25, and sometimes more. I really like the voluminous and darkening effects of this mascara.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you can get major &#x27;panda eyes&#x27;.  Even if you do apply sparingly there is some rubbing off during the day.  But I haven&#x27;t learnt how to use it so that this is minimised (as opposed to the first day I used it and thought it was a total disaster!)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time saying anything bad as I love that it is on the natural side of things, but as other reviewers have said, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it really dries completely. I know this is probably due to the lack of chemicals used in other products to achieve this, but I have had another, very expensive natural mascara, that performed better in this category. I was hoping to find a less expensive alternative. I have oily skin so I&#x27;m sure this adds to the melting effect of the product wherever my lashes touch my eyelids. It isn&#x27;t a total deal breaker, but can be annoying to constantly be wiping my eyelids during the day.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara. I get really bad itchy eyes and allergy reaction to other mascaras...not this one and I love it. Only problem is its not water proof but leaves pretty effect on eyes and lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> This mascara runs so badly! Love the raccoon eye look, then this product is for you. I shop cruelty-free and PF does NOT test on animals but this product was disappointing. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> May be non toxic but it runs terribly. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This mascara burned my eyes when I first applied it and would not dry.  I only wear mascara on my top lashes so I can&#x27;t comment on getting raccoon eyes, but I knew it didn&#x27;t dry because I felt my upper lashes several hours after applying and they were sticky.  Also, there are some questionable ingredients when you do a little digging.  There are much better alternatives that function better and are safer to use ingredients wise.  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> Best feature is it&#x27;s organic.  However, easy smudging!  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
