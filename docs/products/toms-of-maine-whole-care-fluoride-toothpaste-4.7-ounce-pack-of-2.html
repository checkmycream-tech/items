            <li>Tastes great, even after a bedtime glass of wine.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to mint so this was a great solution for me.</li>
            <li>Tasted Good.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste did seem to lessen my sensitivity and it tastes good.</li>
            <li>The Cinnamon Clove tastes just as good as the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tom&#x27;s products for many years and have enjoyed very good tooth and gum health.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s got a very good and natural taste and does leave my breath smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>but I love the toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a place to purchase them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find that Amazon carried the flavor of Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste that I love and have not been able to find recently - the cinnamon clove.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste cleans well, leaves my mouth fresh, and I love cinnamon.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a great product for someone who wants to brush right before a meal without affecting the taste of their food much.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon clove flavor is mild yet clean and the feeling/</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and my breath fresh after use.</li>
            <li>However, this is a very hot cinnamon flavor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sensitivity issues for most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use mint products so appreciate this fresh tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t give that whole mouth clean feeling</li>
            <li>I love cinnamon flavored everything and was also pleased the cinnamon and clove flavor was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love this Tp, it is the only one I can use do to a gag reflex.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy having this as an alternative to traditional toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>It cleans really well</li>
            <li>I have used many of the other Tom&#x27;s toothpastes without a problem.</li>
            <li>so if you aren&#x27;t ready for a little heat, I suggest you stick with a traditional mint :)</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try the toothpaste after having positive effects with the deodorant.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t experience the chemical sweet taste that you get from other well known brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A little exspensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, given my dentist&#x27;s opinion of my teeth, apparently it works well too.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, i would definitely recommend, makes you wanna brush your teeth. Tasted Good. A little exspensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having this as an alternative to traditional toothpaste flavors. The cinnamon clove flavor is mild yet clean and the feeling/taste afterwards is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try the toothpaste after having positive effects with the deodorant. Not sure what took me so long but I love the toothpaste as well. I love cinnamon flavored everything and was also pleased the cinnamon and clove flavor was not overwhelming. My teeth are clean and my breath fresh after use. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Everthing i was looking for</li>
            <li> It tastes bad. After using it twice a day for a week my mouth felt constantly dry. By two weeks I had little white bumps on my tongue that are sore. I would not recommend the cinnamon clove to anyone. I have used many of the other Tom&#x27;s toothpastes without a problem.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing.  Perfect for anyone not wanting to use a peppermint paste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitivity issues for most of my adult life. While doing some online research as to possibilities to reduce my sensitivity, I read that Clove toothpaste can help relieve the pain. I tried Toms Clove Toothpaste several years ago before it became Cinnamon Clove. This toothpaste did seem to lessen my sensitivity and it tastes good. You don&#x27;t experience the chemical sweet taste that you get from other well known brands of toothpaste. The Cinnamon Clove tastes just as good as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/06/2016 Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent purchases of this flavor of Tom&#x27;s Toothpaste tastes like stale cinnamon. Downgraded to two stars. Do not recommend..</li>
            <li> This flavor is imposssible to find in the stores. I&#x27;m glad I found a place to purchase them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years.  Tastes great, even after a bedtime glass of wine.  Also, given my dentist&#x27;s opinion of my teeth, apparently it works well too.</li>

            <li> I have been using Tom&#x27;s products for many years and have enjoyed very good tooth and gum health.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that Amazon carried the flavor of Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste that I love and have not been able to find recently - the cinnamon clove.  So I will be buying my Toms from Amazon regularly now.  Much appreciated.  Elizabeth Plofker</li>
            <li> I love this Tp, it is the only one I can use do to a gag reflex. Very good flavor.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to mint so this was a great solution for me. I had previously been using a toothpaste without mint and without sulfates, however it did not contain any fluoride. I decided I wanted to start using fluoride again. My sensitivity to sulfates was not an issue with this toothpaste (yes, it does contain SLS).</li>
            <li> It cleans really well but the flavor is way too potent for me:(  I prefer other Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste a lot but it just doesn&#x27;t give that whole mouth clean feeling I want.  However, it&#x27;s got a very good and natural taste and does leave my breath smelling nice.  I think this would be a great product for someone who wants to brush right before a meal without affecting the taste of their food much.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my boyfriend can use due to his allergies and sensitive teeth. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine cinnamon flavor. I can&#x27;t use mint products so appreciate this fresh tasting toothpaste. Very happy with product!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s toothepaste is one of the best. I like the fact that cloves are in this as it is good for tooth decay!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste. I have Sjogren&#x27;s so I am always looking for products that have xylitol in them for added dental health. The toothpaste cleans well, leaves my mouth fresh, and I love cinnamon. However, this is a very hot cinnamon flavor so if you aren&#x27;t ready for a little heat, I suggest you stick with a traditional mint :)</li>
