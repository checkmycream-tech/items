            <li>But otherwise the hairspray itself does great!</li>
            <li>This does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>I have tried and continue to try just about every hair spray out there in search of the perfect balance of hold and value.</li>
            <li>She’s very happy.</li>
            <li>Great hairspray!  </li>
            <li>It holds my curls perfectly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>and I did like it as it was a great finishing spray.  </li>
            <li>Great product, not sticky, greasy or gooie on the hair.</li>
            <li>This product also works great as a texturizing spray and it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>Best hairspray for fine hair.</li>
            <li>This hairspray has a good amount of hold without making my hair feel crunch or tangled.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hair spray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good choice.</li>
            <li>And the biggest thing we loved about it is that it had no scent</li>
            <li>And the biggest thing we loved about it is that it had no scent</li>
            <li>I have used it for both styling and as a finishing spray with good results.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t find the product to be so superior to justify the difference in price.</li>
            <li>it also smells really good.</li>
            <li>I can go out, dance all night, wind in the hair, honeys running their hands through it...and its all good.</li>
            <li>Keep your arm a good distance away from where you want it because it comes out forcefully.  </li>
            <li>A good every day spray.</li>
            <li>It works so good</li>
            <li>Great product all around. :)</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray!</li>
            <li>It is nice to find a product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>This hairspray will effectively hold it - whatever your style.</li>
            <li>and my hair is now holding to the style nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice if no one is going to touch your hair</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance, and the aerosol is perfect for not messing up your hair or making it wet.</li>
            <li>have very fine hair so</li>
            <li>I love that there are UV protectors that protect against sun damage and color fading.  </li>
            <li>Love all the Christophe products.</li>
            <li>so I had to do it more than once to distribute it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Again, more body and control than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT, like I said it did hold better than most products on my hair if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re going for, go for it.</li>
            <li>the hairspray I use cannot add any more weight or sticky crunchiness to my &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a bit more of a lighter mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that we could notice, which is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>that we could notice, which is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite hairspray, probably because of the scent and the fact that I can feel it in my hair.</li>
            <li>product itself is good - comparable to the Sebastian Shaper spray at a slightly more economical price.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li>I never tried this hair spray before but it appealed to me when searching on line for the shampoo by Christophe (which I fortunately found)!.</li>
            <li>- I use it more as a finishing spray vs. shaping</li>
            <li>This hairspray works perfectly for my various hair styles</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t see myself using any more than just this one can.</li>
            <li>I am impressed at the holding power, it is great at roots for lift and for updos that mean business.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean fragrance</li>
            <li>It did not feel brittle and was easy to comb through at night.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, you shoot it and spray...der.</li>
            <li>so she needed something with strong hold but wouldn’t bunch up her remaining hair.</li>
            <li>I step into our walk-in shower to spray to avoid it laying a fine crust on my sink area.  </li>
            <li>this hairspray works fine in holding your hair in place</li>
            <li>It is a light mist with a strong hold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a more economical alternative, though, I would check out the Suave Professionals</li>
            <li>At the same time, after a day helping in a classroom with lots of wind, my hair was in great shape.  </li>
            <li>It sprayed her hair with a strong spray and covered quickly.</li>
            <li>First the scent wasn’t overpowering so, she liked that right away.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to give the Cristophe Shaping spray a try to compare.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use hairspray every day - some days, more than once, so I am VERY particular about the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the brands</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of Christophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray free to try and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast, and keeps your style just right for many hours.</li>
            <li>It did the hold part reasonably quickly and she set her hair to what she likes.</li>
            <li>This provides nice body to my long fine hair; I flip my head over, shake my stuff while misting evenly.  </li>
            <li>Not really a fragrance, an odor and not that pleasant to my nose.  </li>
            <li>It does kind of leave a sticky residue on my walls and floor after repeated use in the bathroom (especially if I do not use the exhaust fan), so that is a bit of a concern.</li>
            <li>This is a nice big can.</li>
            <li>Cristophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray is a great product and works well.  </li>
            <li>But the hair spray itself works well and is worth checking out as an alternative to the Sebastian Shaper.</li>
            <li>Glad to find a new product I really like and works well!</li>
            <li>Next day hair was fine and easy to style.</li>
            <li>This was a very nice treat to compare with a little bit higher end hairspray</li>
            <li>This hairspray works just fine in keeping my hairstyle in check but there are a few negatives that I think kind of outweigh the positives.</li>
            <li>It has a medium hold, not stiff, yet you can brush it through your hair, even the next day with good results.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the odor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Better bet - Big Sexy Hair - Spray &amp; Play .[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B0017DI8QM Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play Hair Spray Regular by Sexy Hair for Unisex - 10 Ounce Hair Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came out better the second time.  </li>
            <li>Much later in the day, it loosened up a bit and felt more</li>
            <li>This hairspray has great, long lasting hold without making my hair look like it&#x27;s coated in hair product or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li>When I want a more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; tousled bob, I use a large curling wand to put big waves sporadically through my hair and I finish it off with this Cristophe hairspray.</li>
            <li>because it provides very good hold since my hair is very straight and difficult to style.  </li>
            <li>First of all and maybe most important, is that the hairspray leaves your hair with that crunchy, slightly hard feeling.</li>
            <li>It really comes out strong and suddenly.  </li>
            <li>My hair now keeps its curl much longer.</li>
            <li>It sort of worked, but the spray dries really fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I much prefer Sebastian Shaper.</li>
            <li>I expected it too be so much better.</li>
            <li>This hair spary really works</li>
            <li>It sprays out in quick strong bursts and took me a few shots to corral it to where I needed it.</li>
            <li>My hair went flat pretty quick.</li>
            <li>am surprised that some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the scent, because I have a pretty keen sniffer and didn&#x27;t pick up anything bothersome at all in the smell.  </li>
            <li>I previously used Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s classic spray, but I like this much more.  </li>
            <li>spray is a little more forceful than I prefer.  </li>
            <li>This is a little bit more than I normally spend on hair spray, I normally go with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I use Diamond Shine normally and thought to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years, love the smell, not sticky in our humid weather and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I tried Cristophe Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray and was immediately thrilled to find that the spray is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d stick with a product that costs 3X what my normal brand runs, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and strong holding power of the Christophe Hair Spray!</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s a bit sticky, but once brushed</li>
            <li>After finally getting the front just the way I wanted it, I went to spray it and blew the whole thing apart!  </li>
            <li>So I was pretty leery of using a spray-type hair spray since I didn&#x27;t think I could get a similar hold.  </li>
            <li>This spray is stiff when you first use is, but the stiffness quickly goes away while the hold stays with you.  </li>
            <li>This has a floral scent that is a little too strong for my liking but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell of the hairspray is a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>Big fan - this is a much higher-end hair spray than I would normally consider buying, but what a difference.</li>
            <li>Her only complaint was the powerful blasting from the can itself when you spray it, but that&#x27;s easy to fix by holding it further/farther (grammar police, I apologize).  </li>
            <li>they tend to be too perfumed and/or heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, color treated hair and this works very well at holding my style in place, whether it be a simple spritz to my bangs for a casual weekend excursion or a more elaborate up do for formal events.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The haispray leaves hair shiny and not stiff.</li>
            <li>Hair kept it&#x27;s style throughout the day but still felt soft at the end.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something to control my fly-away, partly gray, naturally curly, medium length hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I will use Cristophe Professional.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I was surprised at the quality of the Suave spray since I am a bit of a product snob when it comes to hair care.</li>
            <li>have the straightest hair (the only straight thing about me)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m picky about fragrance, so I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>(and that&#x27;s a big &amp;#34;however&amp;#34;), I&#x27;ve used this spray a half dozen times since my first less-than-stellar experience with it, and I&#x27;m retiring it.  </li>
            <li>Although at first use, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be working as well, hours later my hair is still held in place without the similar \\&quot;spikiness\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Hold it farther away from your hair than you normally would because the spray &amp;#34;velocity&amp;#34; is pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, and it&#x27;s light enough to comb through.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more but this large size can seems like it will last a while, and only a small amount is needed per daily use.</li>
            <li>My fine hair looks thick with this spray and a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>But I soldiered on and fixed it up, then held the hair spray further (doggonit</li>
            <li>The Christophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray has a stronger hold than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Cristophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray, 10 Ounce&lt;</li>
            <li>Two Extra Hold Hair Spray, 11 Ounce]] which is normally under $5 at my local store.  </li>
            <li>It was difficult to get a styling brush through my hair, BUT once styled it did have body and more control than normal and held a style longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, sticky, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It held ok but not great.</li>
            <li>Of course, her arms aren&#x27;t long enough to really do that, but that gives us something else to tease my tiny mom about anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was out of my usual Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play Harder -</li>
            <li>I have thin hair that has several flyways and I like to give my straight bob a nice spray to tame them and hold my style in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s an individual thing, but my humble opinion is that it&#x27;s just too heavy.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I was a bit startled at how stiff it felt at first, but seemed to soften up as the day went on</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, naturally-curly hair, but I only really wanted the hold for the area framing my face, and although I absolutely want a maximum hold there, I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>ADDS VOLUME TO THIN FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles with any hairspray, but this one holds well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much hairspray - just a little bit at a time.</li>

            <li> Cristophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray is a great product and works well.  </li>
            <li> But the hair spray itself works well and is worth checking out as an alternative to the Sebastian Shaper.</li>
            <li> Glad to find a new product I really like and works well!</li>
            <li> Next day hair was fine and easy to style.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice treat to compare with a little bit higher end hairspray</li>
            <li> This hairspray works just fine in keeping my hairstyle in check but there are a few negatives that I think kind of outweigh the positives.</li>
            <li> It has a medium hold, not stiff, yet you can brush it through your hair, even the next day with good results.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the odor.  </li>

            <li> Came out better the second time.  </li>
            <li> Much later in the day, it loosened up a bit and felt more</li>
            <li> This hairspray has great, long lasting hold without making my hair look like it&#x27;s coated in hair product or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> When I want a more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; tousled bob, I use a large curling wand to put big waves sporadically through my hair and I finish it off with this Cristophe hairspray.</li>
            <li> because it provides very good hold since my hair is very straight and difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> First of all and maybe most important, is that the hairspray leaves your hair with that crunchy, slightly hard feeling.</li>
            <li> It really comes out strong and suddenly.  </li>
            <li> My hair now keeps its curl much longer.</li>
            <li> It sort of worked, but the spray dries really fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I much prefer Sebastian Shaper.</li>
            <li> I expected it too be so much better.</li>
            <li> This hair spary really works</li>
            <li> It sprays out in quick strong bursts and took me a few shots to corral it to where I needed it.</li>
            <li> My hair went flat pretty quick.</li>
            <li> am surprised that some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the scent, because I have a pretty keen sniffer and didn&#x27;t pick up anything bothersome at all in the smell.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s classic spray, but I like this much more.  </li>
            <li> spray is a little more forceful than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> This is a little bit more than I normally spend on hair spray, I normally go with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use Diamond Shine normally and thought to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, love the smell, not sticky in our humid weather and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried Cristophe Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray and was immediately thrilled to find that the spray is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d stick with a product that costs 3X what my normal brand runs, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and strong holding power of the Christophe Hair Spray!</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a bit sticky, but once brushed</li>
            <li> After finally getting the front just the way I wanted it, I went to spray it and blew the whole thing apart!  </li>
            <li> So I was pretty leery of using a spray-type hair spray since I didn&#x27;t think I could get a similar hold.  </li>
            <li> This spray is stiff when you first use is, but the stiffness quickly goes away while the hold stays with you.  </li>
            <li> This has a floral scent that is a little too strong for my liking but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell of the hairspray is a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Big fan - this is a much higher-end hair spray than I would normally consider buying, but what a difference.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint was the powerful blasting from the can itself when you spray it, but that&#x27;s easy to fix by holding it further/farther (grammar police, I apologize).  </li>
            <li> they tend to be too perfumed and/or heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair and this works very well at holding my style in place, whether it be a simple spritz to my bangs for a casual weekend excursion or a more elaborate up do for formal events.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The haispray leaves hair shiny and not stiff.</li>
            <li> Hair kept it&#x27;s style throughout the day but still felt soft at the end.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something to control my fly-away, partly gray, naturally curly, medium length hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I will use Cristophe Professional.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I was surprised at the quality of the Suave spray since I am a bit of a product snob when it comes to hair care.</li>
            <li> have the straightest hair (the only straight thing about me)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m picky about fragrance, so I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> (and that&#x27;s a big &amp;#34;however&amp;#34;), I&#x27;ve used this spray a half dozen times since my first less-than-stellar experience with it, and I&#x27;m retiring it.  </li>
            <li> Although at first use, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be working as well, hours later my hair is still held in place without the similar \\&quot;spikiness\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Hold it farther away from your hair than you normally would because the spray &amp;#34;velocity&amp;#34; is pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, and it&#x27;s light enough to comb through.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more but this large size can seems like it will last a while, and only a small amount is needed per daily use.</li>
            <li> My fine hair looks thick with this spray and a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> But I soldiered on and fixed it up, then held the hair spray further (doggonit</li>

            <li> It was difficult to get a styling brush through my hair, BUT once styled it did have body and more control than normal and held a style longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, sticky, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It held ok but not great.</li>
            <li> Of course, her arms aren&#x27;t long enough to really do that, but that gives us something else to tease my tiny mom about anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> In fact, I was a bit startled at how stiff it felt at first, but seemed to soften up as the day went on</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally-curly hair, but I only really wanted the hold for the area framing my face, and although I absolutely want a maximum hold there, I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of this hair spray.  </li>

            <li> I have thin fine hair, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles with any hairspray, but this one holds well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much hairspray - just a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> But this particular \\&quot;touchable\\&quot; spray does give me the same results as the more expensive lines (other Suave products are not nearly as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I wear my hair sleek and straight, it really helps tame flyaways and this spray also holds an updo firmly in place without feeling like a helmet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to give it a shot, but I&#x27;m wondering how long it will last without clogging up since it&#x27;s pretty thick in the bottle.  </li>

            <li> I finished blow-drying and styling and gave it a spritz and was pleasantly surprised that it held the style in place - firm but yet not sticky or goopy.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair when it was dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flexible enough to work with your hair after you&#x27;ve sprayed it, yet it&#x27;s firm enough to hold your style when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and heavy.</li>
            <li> passed it on to my mother, who has thin, straight hair, on the shorter side.  </li>

            <li> Still this one leave my hair crunchy and with a lot of nodes</li>
            <li> Best hairspray for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and heavy. I curl my hair every morning, and by lunch time the curls are all flat! I have tried all kinds of different hair sprays with the same results. I tried Cristophe Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray and was immediately thrilled to find that the spray is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and does not weigh down my hair. It is a light mist with a strong hold.  My hair now keeps its curl much longer. It is nice to find a product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  ADDS VOLUME TO THIN FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I love that there are UV protectors that protect against sun damage and color fading.  Hair kept it&#x27;s style throughout the day but still felt soft at the end.  In fact, I was a bit startled at how stiff it felt at first, but seemed to soften up as the day went on and I handled my hair.  It did not feel brittle and was easy to comb through at night.  Next day hair was fine and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I am no longer hopeless - this stuff does the trick.  My fine hair looks thick with this spray and a blow dryer.  Love all the Christophe products.</li>
            <li> This hairspray will effectively hold it - whatever your style. It has a pleasant fragrance, and the aerosol is perfect for not messing up your hair or making it wet. It dries very fast, and keeps your style just right for many hours. It does kind of leave a sticky residue on my walls and floor after repeated use in the bathroom (especially if I do not use the exhaust fan), so that is a bit of a concern. But otherwise the hairspray itself does great! Seems to last a very long time too! This is a nice big can. Great product all around. :)</li>
            <li> Cristophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray is a great product and works well.  I have thin hair that has several flyways and I like to give my straight bob a nice spray to tame them and hold my style in place.  This does an excellent job.  This is a little bit more than I normally spend on hair spray, I normally go with [[ASIN:B000UWDF0A Tresemme Tres Two Extra Hold Hair Spray, 11 Ounce]] which is normally under $5 at my local store.  This was a very nice treat to compare with a little bit higher end hairspray and I did like it as it was a great finishing spray.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I wanted something to control my fly-away, partly gray, naturally curly, medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;First think I noticed was a &amp;#34;rattler ball&amp;#34; inside the can like spray paint uses to stir the paint.  hmmm.  I&#x27;ve never seen this before in hair-spray, so already I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;lacquer.&amp;#34;  It says to spray it on while damp which I did. It doesn&#x27;t spray very wide so I got strips of spray.  The first thing I noticed was the odor.  Not really a fragrance, an odor and not that pleasant to my nose.  It was difficult to get a styling brush through my hair, BUT once styled it did have body and more control than normal and held a style longer.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I tried spraying my hands and running them through my hair.  It sort of worked, but the spray dries really fast so I had to do it more than once to distribute it.  At first it&#x27;s a bit sticky, but once brushed it&#x27;s okay.  Again, more body and control than usual.&lt;br /&gt;The I tried it on my hair when it was dry.  The spray pattern is really narrow so I got streaks of spray.  While it did hold, it seemed stiff and not fun to touch.  Also my hair looked duller with it than without it.  I&#x27;m still going to give it a shot, but I&#x27;m wondering how long it will last without clogging up since it&#x27;s pretty thick in the bottle.  We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;Minus two stars for dulling, sticky and odor.  BUT, like I said it did hold better than most products on my hair if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re going for, go for it.</li>
            <li> I use hairspray every day - some days, more than once, so I am VERY particular about the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the brands I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cristophe version reminds me all too well of my days in the &#x27;80s when I used Final Net. It&#x27;s heavy, sticky, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair so the hairspray I use cannot add any more weight or sticky crunchiness to my &#x27;do.  This one does both so I will reserve it for the next 80s dress up party I get invited to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better bet - Big Sexy Hair - Spray &amp; Play .[[ASIN:B0017DI8QM Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play Hair Spray Regular by Sexy Hair for Unisex - 10 Ounce Hair Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: Tried it again - I was out of my usual Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play Harder - it&#x27;s even worse than I remembered, and it smells horrible. Overpowered my cologne all day.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has a good amount of hold without making my hair feel crunch or tangled.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair spray.  I use overall just to keep my hair in place.  It&#x27;s definitely not crunchy or sticky, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is a little more forceful than I prefer.  It really comes out strong and suddenly.  I prefer a bit more of a lighter mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good choice.</li>
            <li> Hold it farther away from your hair than you normally would because the spray &amp;#34;velocity&amp;#34; is pretty harsh.

In a hurry at the time, I didn&#x27;t appreciate having to re-do my re-do, especially since it was harder to style with the sort of sticky-weight of the hair spray.  But I soldiered on and fixed it up, then held the hair spray further (doggonit, is it farther or further?) away to spray this time.  I also held the button for just a short burst, so as not to overload it.  Came out better the second time.  That being said, I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it for a few hours, not exactly crunchy but still weighted-down and a tad sticky.  Much later in the day, it loosened up a bit and felt more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the scent, because I have a pretty keen sniffer and didn&#x27;t pick up anything bothersome at all in the smell.  HOWEVER (and that&#x27;s a big &amp;#34;however&amp;#34;), I&#x27;ve used this spray a half dozen times since my first less-than-stellar experience with it, and I&#x27;m retiring it.

            <li> The Christophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray has a stronger hold than what I&#x27;m used to. It sprays out in quick strong bursts and took me a few shots to corral it to where I needed it. At first my hair felt a little crunchy, but that wore off after about half an hour and my hair is now holding to the style nicely. This has a floral scent that is a little too strong for my liking but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It isn&#x27;t my favorite hairspray, probably because of the scent and the fact that I can feel it in my hair. I much prefer Sebastian Shaper. UPDATE: After using this for a couple of weeks I need to tell you that it leaves a horrible coating over my entire bathroom. I think perhaps going outside to spray this is what I&#x27;m going to have to do from now on.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Christophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray free to try and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using hair spray for about 20 years, but I have strictly used the pump bottles such as [[ASIN:B001KYQLTE Suave Max Level 8 Hold Hair Spray]] because it provides very good hold since my hair is very straight and difficult to style.  Although my hair always stays where I want it, I&#x27;m typically left with very stiff and spiky hair throughout the day which my spouse and kids continually tease me about.  So I was pretty leery of using a spray-type hair spray since I didn&#x27;t think I could get a similar hold.  Although at first use, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be working as well, hours later my hair is still held in place without the similar \\&quot;spikiness\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d stick with a product that costs 3X what my normal brand runs, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and strong holding power of the Christophe Hair Spray!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Sebastian Hair sprays because all others made my scalp itch and flake.  Now I will use Cristophe Professional.  It has a medium hold, not stiff, yet you can brush it through your hair, even the next day with good results.  I have thin fine hair, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles with any hairspray, but this one holds well.  I prefer unscented, but the scent on this hairspray is not offensive.  I have used it for both styling and as a finishing spray with good results.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have tried and continue to try just about every hair spray out there in search of the perfect balance of hold and value. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Elnet and the Sebastian line seem to be the current go-to sprays in the salon industry so I was excited to give the Cristophe Shaping spray a try to compare.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is good - comparable to the Sebastian Shaper spray at a slightly more economical price. I have long, color treated hair and this works very well at holding my style in place, whether it be a simple spritz to my bangs for a casual weekend excursion or a more elaborate up do for formal events.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this the same as both the Elnet and Sebastian Shaper so you can save a few dollars with the Cristophe.&lt;br /&gt;As a more economical alternative, though, I would check out the Suave Professionals Touchable Finish Extra Hold here on Amazon (I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere locally). It has the same ingredients as the Cristophe and Sebastian for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004DBU95I Suave Professionals Hair Spray, Aerosol, Touchable Finish, Extra Hold, 9.4Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was surprised at the quality of the Suave spray since I am a bit of a product snob when it comes to hair care. But this particular \\&quot;touchable\\&quot; spray does give me the same results as the more expensive lines (other Suave products are not nearly as good).&lt;br /&gt;While I like the Cristophe (and Sebastian and Elnet), I don&#x27;t find the product to be so superior to justify the difference in price. But the hair spray itself works well and is worth checking out as an alternative to the Sebastian Shaper.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has great, long lasting hold without making my hair look like it&#x27;s coated in hair product or feel crunchy. I&#x27;ve started to use this spray whenever I put my hair up (since I have short hair, I need a lot of help keeping it in place) and it stays in whatever style all day long.</li>
            <li> I had such an issue for so long...a fruitless search of all things spraying hair that I had all but given up. I didnt want Aqua Net, I actually like my hair to move and to be touched...but I didnt want my style to fall out and nothing hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the straightest hair (the only straight thing about me) and I do curl it often and needed something to hold the curl. Cristophe to the rescue. Easy to use, you shoot it and spray...der. IT HOLDS! it also smells really good. I can go out, dance all night, wind in the hair, honeys running their hands through it...and its all good.</li>
            <li> Great product, not sticky, greasy or gooie on the hair. Keeps the hair together without making it stiff. I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with hairsprays...they tend to be too perfumed and/or heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Big fan - this is a much higher-end hair spray than I would normally consider buying, but what a difference. When they talk about &amp;#34;soft hold&amp;#34;, THEY MEAN IT. No sticky. No tacky. No visible residue. No overly-strong hairspray smells. This may be voodoo. I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is mediocre. I expected it too be so much better. I compare it to any store brand I have bought. I use Diamond Shine normally and thought to give this a try. It leaves your hair a sticky mess which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it didn&#x27;t look wet and sticky. I like a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t ever make my hair look like it has hairspray. This one failed. It held ok but not great. My hair went flat pretty quick. I will not be switching any time soon.</li>
            <li> This provides nice body to my long fine hair; I flip my head over, shake my stuff while misting evenly.  Keep your arm a good distance away from where you want it because it comes out forcefully.  I step into our walk-in shower to spray to avoid it laying a fine crust on my sink area.  I am impressed at the holding power, it is great at roots for lift and for updos that mean business.</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray a lot. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with spraying it where I want it. It has a nice clean fragrance and I&#x27;m picky about fragrance, so I was pleasantly surprised.  My hair held its shape and it didn&#x27;t feel stiff or tacky.  I don&#x27;t use much hairspray - just a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> Cristophe Professional Ultimate Shaping Hair Spray, 10 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this hair spray to help my mom, whom I care for, when I take her out. She’s 95 and has thinning hair so she needed something with strong hold but wouldn’t bunch up her remaining hair. This seems to have worked to her liking. First the scent wasn’t overpowering so, she liked that right away. It sprayed her hair with a strong spray and covered quickly. It did the hold part reasonably quickly and she set her hair to what she likes. It seems to have done the job well and is mom approved. She’s very happy.</li>
            <li> I never tried this hair spray before but it appealed to me when searching on line for the shampoo by Christophe (which I fortunately found)!. This hair spary really works - I use it more as a finishing spray vs. shaping but it works well! I finished blow-drying and styling and gave it a spritz and was pleasantly surprised that it held the style in place - firm but yet not sticky or goopy. I like this lots - wonder if it comes in a small, travel size? I&#x27;ll be back for more but this large size can seems like it will last a while, and only a small amount is needed per daily use. Glad to find a new product I really like and works well!</li>
            <li> The haispray leaves hair shiny and not stiff.</li>
            <li> I use just a little hair spray every day.  This spray is stiff when you first use is, but the stiffness quickly goes away while the hold stays with you.  This makes it easier to comb through your hair later. It doesn&#x27;t look like you have hair spray, yet your hair stays where you put it.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray!  You can no longer find at Walgreens or CVS, my mom is addicted to this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, love the smell, not sticky in our humid weather and last a long time. A good every day spray.</li>
            <li> My hairstyle is a shoulder length bob and I often use beach spray to create a tousled deconstructed look. When I want a more \\&quot;polished\\&quot; tousled bob, I use a large curling wand to put big waves sporadically through my hair and I finish it off with this Cristophe hairspray. I love this hair spray! It&#x27;s flexible enough to work with your hair after you&#x27;ve sprayed it, yet it&#x27;s firm enough to hold your style when you&#x27;re finished. When I wear my hair sleek and straight, it really helps tame flyaways and this spray also holds an updo firmly in place without feeling like a helmet. This product also works great as a texturizing spray and it smells lovely! This hairspray works perfectly for my various hair styles and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this hairspray.  I previously used Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s classic spray, but I like this much more.  It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, and it&#x27;s light enough to comb through.  At the same time, after a day helping in a classroom with lots of wind, my hair was in great shape.  It holds tight without that crunchy and stiff hairspray-glue feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big like!</li>
            <li> It works so good I love it. It holds my curls perfectly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy</li>
            <li> This hairspray works just fine in keeping my hairstyle in check but there are a few negatives that I think kind of outweigh the positives. First of all and maybe most important, is that the hairspray leaves your hair with that crunchy, slightly hard feeling. That&#x27;s nice if no one is going to touch your hair or you don&#x27;t mind having that crunchy feeling. Or if you have a particularly complicated hairstyle that requires that. But it&#x27;s not really fun to run your fingers through your hair. Also, the smell of the hairspray is a little strong for my taste. Hairspray isn&#x27;t meant to be used as a perfume and I don&#x27;t want people to smell my hair before I come into the room. Also if your hair happens to get a little wet from rain, the smell is reactivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this hairspray works fine in holding your hair in place but I just don&#x27;t see myself using any more than just this one can.</li>
            <li> you want dandruff looking hair ? use this !! i do not like it it make my hair sticky with wihte residue !</li>
