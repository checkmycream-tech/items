            <li> Nice to find these online since it seems difficult to find these in stores these days.  </li>
            <li> I may buy another dozen while I can and hope they have a long shelf</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll order this as long as you can supply it.</li>
            <li> Long lasting protection and a non greasy, non messy application.  </li>
            <li> Getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a difficult time finding it in stores lately though, so I&#x27;m really glad that I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Solution I found with this being discontinued,  is to use other scented speed stick anti perspirants.</li>
            <li> All other kinds cause a rash.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores as of late and it&#x27;s the only stuff my husband says works.</li>
            <li> Just wish the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> I also wish the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I can&#x27;t find it in stores like CVS/VONS/Walmart and others anymore.</li>
            <li> I ordered this late on a Friday and was at door step Monday morning.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these in bulk because I get tired of having to purchase them at the store. .</li>
            <li> When I was using Gillette, I started to smell bad after 8-10 hours, and I couldn&#x27;t understand why until I tried Speed Stick.</li>
            <li> but the price is outrageous.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great price for hard to find deodorant.</li>
            <li> Amazon was a source for this hard-to-find discounted deodorant. Was a good product to use for reactions I would get using other deodorants.  Solution I found with this being discontinued,  is to use other scented speed stick anti perspirants.</li>
            <li> I am complete now that i have my favorite deodorant... Thanks</li>
            <li> I prefer this Speed Stick because it clicks when you turn the knob.  Four clicks and I have it.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores so I bought a dozen from Amazon.  I may buy another dozen while I can and hope they have a long shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t help with how good it works.  It works good enough for me.  I haven&#x27;t used anything else for years.</li>
            <li> $600.00 for a pack of 6?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, Old Spice</li>
            <li> I purchased these in bulk because I get tired of having to purchase them at the store. . .or running out.  It arrived on time, as pictured.  No concerns.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for 15 years. I have tried others but this works best for me.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> Nice to find these online since it seems difficult to find these in stores these days.  Work well and last a month or so; no issues.</li>
            <li> Great deal in the six pack and it is a great product that can sometimes be hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant, but its no longer available lovally. If you love this oroduct, i highly recommend you get it here!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for a while now, but we can not find it anywhere in our area.  Mennan makes a 24/7  gel now and it doesn&#x27;t work as well according to him.  So I&#x27;ll order this as long as you can supply it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for so long, it caught me off guard when I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Glad I found it here.  The smell is great and not over powering.  My wife loves the combo of this deodorant and the axe phoenix body spray.</li>
            <li> This is the only antiperspirant I can use and not allergic to. I have not been able to find in any store. Look on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and of course I could find it.</li>
            <li> Happy that I was able to find this Speed Stick but the price is outrageous.</li>
            <li> Arrived just fine and on time.  We got this because it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite and he heard they were going to stop making it.  Now, he has PLENTY!!</li>
            <li> Great price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I can&#x27;t find it in stores like CVS/VONS/Walmart and others anymore. It looks like only the non-gel version is available in stores, but the gel version is pretty scare. Anyway, this product doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on t-shirts, and it smells great.

            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this in my area so I have to order it online, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Not always available at my grocery, and usually I&#x27;ve waited until it&#x27;s gone or almost gone before I even look for it. It&#x27;s the only one I like so it&#x27;s frustrating to have to go one more place (or more) and I probably forget for two more days (using up travel deodorant in meanwhile) so this works! It&#x27;s cheaper and easier</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores as of late and it&#x27;s the only stuff my husband says works.</li>

            <li> Great price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This was my boyfriends favorite. Its a shame they discontinued it. I also wish the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Long lasting protection and a non greasy, non messy application.  Good value.</li>
            <li> It is the stuff I can buy in the store but cheaper. I&#x27;ve used it for several years. It feels good going on and has only a light aroma.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband can use. All other kinds cause a rash. I was having trouble finding it in stores, so I&#x27;m very thankful I found it on Amazon. I use it myself because I&#x27;ve found it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;It always ships on time and as stated.</li>
