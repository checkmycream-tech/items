            <li>Points meet appropriately and stays good and functional for years.</li>
            <li>but these are effective.  </li>
            <li>recommend for professional designers and the seller is excellent.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I think they had better review their manufacturing and capabilities processes on this item.</li>
            <li>It works best when you get as close to the root of the hair as possible.</li>
            <li>Grabs fine hairs.</li>
            <li>The sheath is a nice addition that is not common with most tweezers that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It is a fine, pointy tipped tweezer as opposed to others that claim to be fine, but are not.  </li>
            <li>really cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many tweezers without success because they won&#x27;t grip</li>
            <li>One of the best tools out there for getting small slivers or ticks out..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp, lol</li>
            <li>These are very sharp and great on accuracy for splinters also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good in my opinion , but it&#x27;s the only one</li>
            <li>Bought these for my wife and she states that they are Cheaply made, bends easy, very dissappointed with the quality of these tweezers, but especially because she expects a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Great tweezer for small price.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these fine tip tweezers.</li>
            <li>They do a much better job then standard tweezers.</li>
            <li>I love them and will never buy a different pair.</li>
            <li>The point is sharp and the safety cap comes in handy.</li>
            <li>I certainly will buy again when I need</li>
            <li>It grips the hair very well - both fine and coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The fine tip of this tweezer enables you to get small hairs easily.  </li>
            <li>they grasp very well</li>
            <li>Use them from the side rather than straight on.  </li>
            <li>Performs better than other tweezers I tried before.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like the point, but after using them a few times I can say that they work much better for me.</li>
            <li>The tip is very small, so you can be precise (on the flip side, you have to be pretty precise to grab what you need).  </li>
            <li>I mainly got this to use for a all around tool.  </li>
            <li>Like for jewelry making, sewing, crafts and possible first aid use for splinter removal.  </li>
            <li>I lost my last one and had to replace it and got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>So much space for a simple review.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to get the small hairs or hairs just breaking thru the skin with these.</li>
            <li>I just know the first one was amazing and the second was useless unless you managed to get the hair in one tiny spot and then tweeze it.</li>

            <li> Also, if the tweezer legs are too hard from the heat treating operation, too much force can actually cause to tips to flay open and they will not function properly.</li>
            <li> I have had tweezerman tweezers which are $20 and flat head tweezers.  </li>
            <li> This review is really unnecessarily long.</li>
            <li> They were not bad but it always was difficult to remove short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> They are super sharp and have a thin point.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are made of two steel legs welded at one end and ground flat at the other end where the tweezing pads come together.</li>
            <li> The only improvement would be a little sheath (like it used to come with).</li>
            <li> Point is dangerous in a makeup case without better protection than the little plastic tip you get with it.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are lightweight and longer than expected...</li>
            <li> so be careful about grabbing skin.</li>
            <li> they are sharp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a tweezer that will get those tiny, thin hairs on the face and finally, this is it!  </li>
            <li> they get the smallest, thinnest hair to the thick coarse ones.</li>
            <li> I also like the little silicone cover for the tip</li>
            <li> I purchased them to replace my expensive Tweezerman ones and I actually prefer these now.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard to hold either.</li>
            <li> To compensate a secondary operation can be used to force the weldment to come into alignment.</li>
            <li> but since point is so small it was very hard to grasp any hairs.</li>
            <li> These actually grip my thick and thin hairs without cutting them.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> When is a Tweezer not a good Tweezer?</li>
            <li> However, this type of alignment is never perfect.</li>
            <li> or I was sent the wrong one.</li>
            <li> and I have never had a bad experience with them.</li>
            <li> but it couldn&#x27;t pull anything, returned it. :(</li>

            <li> Great gripping.  Nice tip</li>
            <li> The best tweezer for me ever.  I have had tweezerman tweezers which are $20 and flat head tweezers.  The fine tip of this tweezer enables you to get small hairs easily.  Does the job and cheaper on amazon than at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> I mainly got this to use for a all around tool.  Like for jewelry making, sewing, crafts and possible first aid use for splinter removal.  Did use it to remove embedded goose feathers stuck in a mattress bed pad, worked great.  Did try it to remove facial hair - but since point is so small it was very hard to grasp any hairs.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are lightweight and longer than expected...they grasp very well and I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned. It is so easy to get the small hairs or hairs just breaking thru the skin with these. I would definately recommend these. I also like the little silicone cover for the tip so I dont jab myself when getting them out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she states that they are Cheaply made, bends easy, very dissappointed with the quality of these tweezers, but especially because she expects a lot more.  Do not waste your money on these fine tip tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have been using these tweezers for over 5 years and I have never had a bad experience with them. They do a much better job then standard tweezers. I lost my last one and had to replace it and got exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> One of the best tools out there for getting small slivers or ticks out..The best quality I have come across..</li>
            <li> I went through several tweezers before finding these.  The tip is very small, so you can be precise (on the flip side, you have to be pretty precise to grab what you need).  It grips the hair very well - both fine and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Great tweezer for small price. Grabs fine hairs. Points meet appropriately and stays good and functional for years. The only improvement would be a little sheath (like it used to come with). Point is dangerous in a makeup case without better protection than the little plastic tip you get with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing tweezer! That good for eyebrow designer like me!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for professional designers and the seller is excellent. I certainly will buy again when I need</li>
            <li> It was pointed like I wanted but it couldn&#x27;t pull anything, returned it. :(</li>
            <li> This review is really unnecessarily long. It works. Still use it. Don&#x27;t know what else to say. So much space for a simple review.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these tweezers! really cheap and i got mine in 5 days! they get the smallest, thinnest hair to the thick coarse ones. they are sharp so be careful about grabbing skin. i recommend these if you are considering buying them :D</li>
            <li> These are perfect. I love them and will never buy a different pair. They are pointed and have a great grip. They aren&#x27;t hard to hold either.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are perfect for plucking all types of hair. The sheath is a nice addition that is not common with most tweezers that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> When is a Tweezer not a good Tweezer? I would say: when it doesn&#x27;t tweeze. This thing can&#x27;t pull or grasp a hair of any diameter. The hair just slips through the tweezing pads. The problem is that the tips don&#x27;t come together when you close the tweezer. Tweezers are made of two steel legs welded at one end and ground flat at the other end where the tweezing pads come together. If the pads are misaligned at the welding operation they are going to be out of alignment at the grinding operation. The result is a defective unit. To compensate a secondary operation can be used to force the weldment to come into alignment. However, this type of alignment is never perfect. Also, if the tweezer legs are too hard from the heat treating operation, too much force can actually cause to tips to flay open and they will not function properly. I think they had better review their manufacturing and capabilities processes on this item.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp, lol but you can see that from the picture. It works best when you get as close to the root of the hair as possible. It&#x27;s pretty good in my opinion , but it&#x27;s the only one I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;beware: I ordered another one and it wasn&#x27;t pointy at all and maybe it&#x27;s defective or I was sent the wrong one. I don&#x27;t know I just know the first one was amazing and the second was useless unless you managed to get the hair in one tiny spot and then tweeze it. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who still pluck instead of waxing... These are very sharp and great on accuracy for splinters also</li>
            <li> These are great. They are super sharp and have a thin point. I use them at a slant for my eyebrows. I purchased them to replace my expensive Tweezerman ones and I actually prefer these now. At first I didn&#x27;t like the point, but after using them a few times I can say that they work much better for me.</li>
            <li> I owned number of tweezers. They were not bad but it always was difficult to remove short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;That problem does not exist anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a tweezer that will get those tiny, thin hairs on the face and finally, this is it!  It is a fine, pointy tipped tweezer as opposed to others that claim to be fine, but are not.  This one works great and I&#x27;ll be sticking withit.</li>
            <li> Being Lebanese, I have lots of plucking to do lol.  These actually grip my thick and thin hairs without cutting them.  I&#x27;ve tried many tweezers without success because they won&#x27;t grip but these do the trick.</li>
            <li> Good quality tweezers. The point is sharp and the safety cap comes in handy. Performs better than other tweezers I tried before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably regret that wish...but these are effective.  Use them from the side rather than straight on.  They find hairs i can&#x27;t even feel and they don&#x27;t damage the skin.</li>
