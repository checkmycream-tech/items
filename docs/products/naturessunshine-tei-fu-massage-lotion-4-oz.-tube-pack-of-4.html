            <li> This cream I really like because it helps me with my joints, Sometimes they hurt a whole bunch so I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> . Works wonders for my back and shoulder;  plan on using it as long as it&#x27;s available.  I love it.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. The description is enough in order to know if you want to buy it. Arrived just on time. Thank you</li>
            <li> I always buy it because it release my back pain.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t bitched about it, so I assuming it must be a flawless product.  I&#x27;m pretty good about reading this kind of thing...</li>
            <li> The best there is. No questions. I keep buying more.</li>
            <li> I liked it, although it&#x27;s strong smell will clear your sinuses. I use it on inflamed muscles I get from muscle spasms, just before bed. It relaxes me.</li>
            <li> Really, a great all purpose pain lotion! Good for sore, achy muscles, excellent when used for arthritic joint pain, to relieve sinus congestion and  headache or even on the chest for winter coughs.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for several years on his back.  It works great and eases his pain.  It has a very strong eucalyptus smell but you get used to it and I actually like it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  As a massage therapist also use for clients.  They claim to get more relief from Tei fu.</li>
            <li> I Love the product and need to order more. But don&#x27;t know if I will cause I got double charged and it took a week to straighten it out</li>
            <li> A friend had me try this and I absolutely loved everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;A gentle fragrance and warm tingling.  A little goes a long way! Try it!&lt;br /&gt;You will love it!</li>
            <li> My massage therapist used this on me.  I was pleasantly surprised at the pain relief it gave me.  I have used it ever since.  I rub it on and within a 1/2 hour I am pain free.  I have back, shoulder and knee pain.  I also have sensitive skin and I have no irritation when I use this product.  I had been using Traumeel but have found this to be much better.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t just massage cream; I put it on insect bites, too</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this to us and my husband &amp; I love it.  It had an odor (but it goes away) so you have to put it on early in the morning...way before you are ready to go out.  But it relieves the pain and that is what is important.  It did what it was suppose to do.  If you have pain that you can not get relief from, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Product very soothing for muscle aches.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  It has helped my husband who has RA for sore hands and fingers. Swollen knees and my aching back.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Its comparable to Tiger Balm and it relieves aches and pains all over the body. Sensitive skin may need to be rinsed to prevent irritation</li>
            <li> I use this product for my sciatic pain down both legs.  I have found many pharmaceutical drugs not working well enough for the pain.  However, I found this product at a local herb shop and the lady their told me to give it a try.  Obviously I tried it and found it to work the best of all yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has not tried a topical pain reliever should try this product.  My only problem with it is that it is too strong of a smell.  I work in a field that strong scents on your body can cause problems, so I do not wear it at work often.  If I do I usually wash it off after a few minutes being on my skin.  I still get relief even after washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, DO NOT--I MEAN DO NOT--put this product anywhere you don&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation on your skin. Also, do not apply after a shower because the water and open pores of your skin will allow the oils to drive in deeper.</li>
            <li> I found this productin an herb shop many years ago. As a sports massage therapist I need something that works really well with my athletes.  This is one of the best I have found yet.  Forget biofreeze, tiger balm or any of those others.  This really deep penetrates and gives a really good icy hot feel to the area.  Caution...make sure to wash hands really well after use and if used on legs be careful pulling pants up and down.</li>
            <li> Better than Icy Hot and was exactly what it advertised. I recommend this product to everyone in my family and to my friends.</li>
            <li> I feel like Tei-Fu cream not only eases the pain and smells great, but it helps to heal those minor strains/sprains in muscles.</li>
            <li> I have used Tei Fu for over 10 years now and love the quality of the product. I use it to help relieve muscle soreness and aches. It also can help relieve tension and migraine headaches.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my back at all nor moms legs. Maybe due to the pain coming from our bones instead of muscle pain. I use the oil for sinus problems and it works great. Maybe this would work for that also</li>
            <li> This product works very well on what hurts you  it works fast to keep the pain at bay ,so I would recommend  it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is AWESOME!  It was the right product, at a great price and was delivered as promised!! I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist, I use Tei fu on my self, clients, family members and friends. Highly recommend. Great for over working your muscles.</li>
            <li> Tei Fu Massage is an excellent product.  I actually order it for a friend. She has restless leg syndrome and uses Tei Fu to calm her legs.  Best product for body aches and pains..</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - my beauty operator first told me about it and now i have told several others about it.  My shoulders get tired from being bent over my hand work and the tei-fu is great, especially just before I go to bed.  I also use it on my hands after I have spent hours crocheting hats for our troops or making them survival bracelets.  I would recommend this for anyone who has a little, or even a lot, of discomfort anywhere in their body.  It also smells good!</li>
