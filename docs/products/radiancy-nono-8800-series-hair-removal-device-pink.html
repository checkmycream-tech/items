    <ol>
            <li>Not at all impressed, please save yourself the money and don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>This morning I asked my best friend if she noticed any change in the density of the hair on my lip and chin.</li>
            <li>*temporary slowing of hair growth at best.</li>
            <li>i must say i am very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>But I just got mine in the mail and used it on my leg and it worked great!</li>
            <li>The best advice I can give you is afterwards apply Vaseline!</li>
            <li>The best advice I can give you is afterwards apply Vaseline!</li>
            <li>And customer service was awesome today!</li>
            <li>And customer service was awesome today!</li>
            <li>tips I&#x27;d like to note for best reuslts...</li>
            <li>though awesome, it&#x27;s  working.</li>
            <li>Ever since using No No by Radiancy it has been perfect!</li>
            <li>Great invention!</li>
            <li>It removes hair great, but like the directions tell you - it is a process!</li>
            <li>But it is GREAT for the face!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for spring and summer and lets face it</li>
            <li>Happy plucking!</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>This is the best invention in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>so i should have been the perfect person for it to work on.</li>
            <li>If you have the time and patients and you fully understand this is a process, you will be very happy with the end results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone can contact an overseas manufacturing company, buy a product that is made inferior to it&#x27;s competition, advertise it on TV as the best product in it&#x27;s class, or the best thing since slice bread,  and make millions on s&amp;h charges.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t EVER think this product would eliminate hair re-growth, but was hopeful it might be an excellent alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li>The No-No hair removal tool is the best painless way to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;The unit (comes with a charger) moves across your skin</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>it sounded like the perfect device.</li>
            <li>aside from those problem areas, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>works best on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it was WONDERFUL on my arms and hands.</li>
            <li>NO came up with a wonderful product</li>
            <li>The NoNo is the best thing that ever happened to me.</li>
            <li>If there were a no star rating would be best!</li>
            <li>Just perfect.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my arms, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>A razor is still the best thing to use, not this.  </li>
            <li>But excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Also in all honesty their buffers are not the greatest they are done after 1 or 2</li>
            <li>PLUS you need to purchase additional &#x27;electro heads&#x27; to get the best results.</li>
            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>soothing cream is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I am so thankful for this amazing product!!</li>
            <li>In the infomercial, those beautiful ladies just slide the device once or twice on their arms and legs, and they&#x27;re done with perfect results.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and found that even on the lightest setting, it burned my skin.</li>
            <li>if there were results at all to comment about, even if it wasn&#x27;t ideal results, but again, the device wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>Incredibly time consuming and</li>
            <li>will recommend Amazon, they are a great company and provide excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly turned off by the idea of lazer surgery, but eventually got this as a gift for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have incredibly hairy arms</li>
            <li>I gave it a good try, followed all directions, but Nair is my preferred treatment for legs -- cheaper too!  </li>
            <li>Good call!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product.</li>
            <li>You may as well  throw your money out the window, it doesn&#x27;t even work on fine hair!!!</li>
            <li>This was a gift from my husband, and I am happy, happy ,happy.</li>
            <li>i must say the customer service is great.</li>
            <li>and i am happy with my results.ey</li>

            <li>I followed the instructions and its been working great for me since I received it on</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still waiting for the great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that they even do that.  </li>
            <li>It worked great  ....</li>
            <li>Great ad campaign that sucked me in.</li>
            <li>Every times use it it causes great pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The No No is a great product.</li>
            <li>My mum is enthralled by the TV ad for this product and keeps saying &#x27;I think that would be great&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I honestly have to say that the no no hair removal system is the best item that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great replacement for shaving/tweezing</li>
            <li>But I have tried it according to the instructions for about 3 weeks now, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>It is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Im still happy with the results on my bikini area even though the hair is coarser here.  </li>
            <li>If it was so great, they&#x27;d sell it in stores.</li>
            <li>I am not at all happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I think it is great for find hair.</li>
            <li>Great, works as promised</li>
            <li>Great product works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I think it works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;They did a write up on it in Consumer Reports that said it wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;They did a write up on it in Consumer Reports that said it wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s appearance is great</li>
            <li>Very nice set, has everything in it.</li>
            <li>The customer service rep was very nice, even though she tried to get me to keep it longer and keep trying.  </li>
            <li>The marketing is effective, &amp;#34;Not a laser!</li>
            <li>she has used many barbaric ways to remove hair but this is the easiest and best</li>
            <li>the best part is that I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it ,the best  Device to ever get!!!Just</li>
            <li>Thankfully for me, my hair is the perfect type for tv products because I have never had issues with most tv products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Someday someone will find a painless, effective method of permanent or semi-permanent hair removal, but the No!No! does not work for me.</li>
            <li>:psexy sleek appearance. :p</li>
            <li>Do NOT use this product anywhere near the pubic region!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, that&#x27;s the best part.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling it works best on fine</li>
            <li>It did remove some of the lighter ones but mostly it burned me in couple spots and didnt do a very good job on removing the hairs</li>
            <li>It did not work most of the time and when it did it wasn&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li>and when i returnd the unit, the tips were still in good working order.  </li>
            <li>and when i returnd the unit, the tips were still in good working order.  </li>
            <li>did not have a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Based on the manuals description of a \\&quot;good wire\\&quot;, the wire looks good</li>
            <li>Based on the manuals description of a \\&quot;good wire\\&quot;, the wire looks good</li>
            <li>It really is good quality.</li>
            <li>It really is good quality.</li>
            <li>through Amazon who I&#x27;ve always had good service from.  </li>
            <li>No may be a good choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even close to a good shave.</li>
            <li>lots of good reviews on that</li>
            <li>All i wanted was good hair removal, shaving did not work for me at all; and</li>
            <li>it was even on the home shopping network, and people were calling in saying how they loved the product..</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and fair haired.</li>
            <li>But according to the unit, the heads are still good and do not need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>and I have also done a fair amount of research on these TV products, and</li>
            <li>annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a good customer and followed the directions for use for about 1.5 months.  </li>
            <li>The service was good but the product was not.</li>
            <li>We received the package on time which is good.</li>
            <li>Looks good on TV like everything else.  </li>
            <li>I am a good customer of Amazon and have been exstremely&lt;br /&gt;satisfied until this.</li>
            <li>Its good because I can do it at lunch sitting in my car.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think I can recycle it, maybe I&#x27;ll keep it as a reminder that if it&#x27;s too good to be true...it is.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I thought it would be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I can do just as good of a job with a razor</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re not as good as the ads make out.</li>
            <li>and she says it does not work as good as the commercisls say it does.</li>
            <li>Almost everyone who has given the NoNo a good review, 4/5 stars, have not bought the product here.</li>
            <li>But something, anything would be good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a well used razor.</li>
            <li>and I have always loved it.</li>
            <li>Wish I could say something good about it, but if you have hair issues this is not the answer.</li>
            <li>Good luck, I warned you.</li>
            <li>This did not do a good job on my course hair.</li>
            <li>good news</li>
            <li>Its true!!!</li>
            <li>I like to feel clean shaven at all times so a razor or hair removal cream works best for me.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible invention as so many people know who have battled unwanted hair for so many years, plus we can use it in the privacy of our own home!</li>
            <li>The results have been great and my man loves that I always have a smooth body!</li>
            <li>but I am happy that hopefully by summer I&#x27;ll be hair free and saving myself time in the shower so I can hit the beach!</li>
            <li>So...if I could win one, then I would try it:)</li>
            <li>Electrolysis isn&#x27;t perfect either, but has a better batting-average for many in terms of permanent hair reduction, especially on light hairs (which the laser cannot adequately address).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>Much better!</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic - won&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love my no!no!  </li>
            <li>I love this NO!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>more like yes!yes!</li>
            <li>and I still had to tweeze most of the chin hair off!  </li>
            <li>a man!&lt;br /&gt;I love my &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Unit works great easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is too much money to part with on the off chance you may lose maybe 10 hairs !!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;you can really smell when it is working,, doing its job and burning off the hair !!!!!</li>
            <li>This product is great for virgin and fine hair.se the highest setting on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>This product is great for virgin and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Sounded like a great product and it had a free return policy if I did not like the product.  </li>
            <li>but once you use it and it smooths out they work amazingly in conjunction with the NO NO.</li>
            <li>No! will never give you any kind of permanent or even helpful result.</li>
            <li>No! will never give you any kind of permanent or even helpful result.</li>
            <li>in law discovered that it does work (kind of)</li>
            <li>Series Deluxe Hair Removal Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It kind of varies with me.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star to be honest.  </li>
            <li>the No No! I was thrilled to see it and couldn&#x27;t wait to order one.</li>
            <li>So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number.</li>
            <li>Representatives will not divulge that kind of information.</li>
            <li>and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I gave it an honest try.  </li>
            <li>I am loving my no no hair removal system....</li>
            <li>I began to see great results, I have a lot of body hair and facial hair (for a girl) and this has been awesome.</li>
            <li>nice friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was a gift, and they liked it.</li>
            <li>I have no way to contact any kind of customer service or support.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all effective at all.  </li>
            <li>I really gave it the best effort I could</li>
            <li>I used to see good and convincing reviews on TV</li>
            <li>and it is still good for a lot more uses.</li>
            <li>The device gets warm, smells like it&#x27;s burning the hair...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes it very nicely leaving a nice smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>While it does seem to remove maybe 80-90% of the hair on my arms, which is a success for me!!!</li>
            <li>Yeah, hoped for a good product, sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Should have know it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>I was told that this product would give me great, not to mention quick, results.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to travel with...</li>
            <li>and it’s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>No Pain just a very light warm</li>
            <li>&quot; colored, fairly dense, if fine hair.</li>
            <li>does not even do a good job on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My skin is VERY fair, so it shows really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WhenI telephoned No No for a refund I was greeted by a pleasant, friendly voice but this changed somewhat when I told her the No No was rubbish</li>
            <li>it would work perfectly as advertised, however the price point is probably more than a bit high to sell for that</li>
            <li>but so far, i am impressed</li>
            <li>but so far, i am impressed</li>
            <li>I am still in my 90 day trial but so far it works and great!</li>
            <li>(Although I currently own about 8 (yes 8) devices that claim to remove all hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am satisfied, because it is effective at removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, there is a much more cost effective solution out there.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an effective home use hair removal system and for the first time  I am truly happy.</li>
            <li>System\\&quot; which is REAL laser hair removal you can do at home and is much more effective!!</li>
            <li>I brought this for my wife and she has been very happy with how easy it works and that the results are real.</li>
            <li>I bought it as I have very fine hair along my jawline which I wanted to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine peach fuzz on my face, this was why I wanted the No</li>
            <li>The hair does not come offf as easy as the commercials say they do !</li>
            <li>I have used one before and it breaks me out - so what I have found successful is to do a treatment and then wash with a mild soap, then moisturize.</li>
            <li>I strongly urge anyone not to buy this product - it&#x27;s a NO!</li>
            <li>It takes many, many, many passes with the No!No!</li>
            <li>I thought it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is just a reminder that when something sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li>If it looks too good to be true.....</li>
            <li>Also, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I notice very smooth and even baby like skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought some real junk off the TV over the years and had some true nightmares with customer services of those products trying to get a refund, so I have a good knowledge of this!!!</li>
            <li>It sounded so fantastic and convincing!</li>
            <li>huge mistake!</li>
            <li>Another gem in an outstanding series.</li>
            <li>I have never been so pleased with a hair removal product.</li>
            <li>I would be more okay</li>
            <li>I thought surely someone is going to help me)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tweeze any more and I feel it is better.</li>
            <li>However, we wanted to give it more time and kept using it for a week.</li>
            <li>I see it more on TV since its coming Christmas..</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to anyone that has to get rid of hair all the time and find themselves not being able to wear what they want to that day because they forgot to shave.</li>
            <li>is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of face, this may not be the best thing for people with a lot of facial hair.</li>
            <li>SO JUST ONE MORE SCAM&lt;</li>
            <li>You can get better results from masking tape.</li>
            <li>The NoNo is cute, painless, and will get rid of hair.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.  </li>

            <li>I purchased this product,at a higher price than I liked, and it didn&#x27;t work from day one!</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;ll be as pleased with the results as I have been since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Never was I asked if I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I started on my forearms before using on my face to make sure I knew what I was doing.</li>
            <li>are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  </li>
            <li>So, do some models break more than others?</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li>How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>

            <li>sure it burned some hair</li>
            <li>Sincerely Debra Wolfgang</li>
            <li>sounds like i can use my machete and still remove more hair than this unit.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I read the reviews before I made a purchase.</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>I wish I had never started using this as there is no way out now because there is so much more hair growing than when I started using this.  </li>
            <li>love it and reccommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>It says it doesn&#x27;t create stubble, but it sure DOES.</li>
            <li>thinking  any help is better  than  nothing.</li>
            <li>You would get better results from a .99 cent bic lighter.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I have helped out so many people with my post, from having to experience what I did with that company.</li>
            <li>I am just glad that I am out of that situation.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I have helped out so many people with my post, from having to experience what I did with that company.</li>
            <li>I am just glad that I am out of that situation.</li>
            <li>I should have been more pro-active.  </li>
            <li>Love the buffing pads too&amp; the Smooyhing lotion.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT:))))</li>
            <li>It did take most of the hair off my legs, so</li>
            <li>I will let you know if it works ok.  </li>
            <li>For the money THIS is a much better option.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, investigate old-fashioned electrolysis.  </li>
            <li>It is safe on darker skin.</li>
            <li>I am glad I went ahead and purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I gave up and bought an epilator which works much better.</li>
            <li>Be SURE TO READ the description on Amazon with this NONO.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please save your money, find a laser hair removal place and go there, most of them offer payment options.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker and more stubborn.  </li>
            <li>I used it more than recommended and nothing.</li>
            <li>a razor does a better job</li>
            <li>I do use it every 4 to 6 weeks as it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>works on my face but have never been able to get it work on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I love using it on my arms and legs</li>
            <li>I guess it is okay under arms and on legs if you don&#x27;t care about stubble, but if you do forget buying this.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>The longer I have done it the better results I get.  </li>
            <li>I really love this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when you do it sincerely works.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I can see that I better work overtime</li>
            <li>I am sure that you get it.</li>
            <li>You will be better off running a pencil over the area because no hair will disappear.</li>
            <li>My sex life went from healthy to non existent.</li>
            <li>My confidence is gone and my lack of sexual activity has caused me to be a nightmare to be around.</li>
            <li>Believe me you;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>I thought they knew better,.</li>
            <li>this is my conclusion; MOST TV products (which I call the $19.95 TV Scams) are junk, just like this.</li>
            <li>I checked to make sure she was using it correctly</li>
            <li>how many times you go over the area.</li>
            <li>I was talked into ordering MORE blades and to keep trying.  </li>
            <li>Regarding the No No, be sure you understand what IS</li>
            <li>You do need to be able to deal with the smell of burning hair.</li>
            <li>but I am looking to it and getting much better.</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughters and they love it.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on Lasher /or Wax treatments you will be better off.</li>
            <li>ask if the $1500 - $2500 neighborhood spa quality gear would be a better investment.</li>
            <li>but if you think you&#x27;re going to have silky smooth legs.... forget about it !  </li>
            <li>If you are debating on purchasing this product, check out Radiancy on BBB and it will make you NOT want it :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li>and I got the runaround so many times that I had to threaten a supervisor with reporting them to the BBB to get my refund.</li>
            <li>Also everytime I asked a question he would just say your gonna love it, blah blah and would avoid the question</li>
            <li>Crappy product, crappy return policy, and crappy sales department!gave it more of a chance</li>
            <li>but it is certainly better than getting burnt.</li>
            <li>how many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all in all its OK.  </li>
            <li>If you try this product do not keep for the recomended time to try or you will not be able to return.&lt;br /&gt;Jeff</li>
            <li>reputable company the delivers a quality product would EVER create a return policy like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I went through the checkout process it NEVER said anything about more</li>
            <li>I tried using for 10 months would be better and quicker running a razor over my legs.</li>
            <li>When they say &amp;#34;Imagine being able to go weeks without shaving&amp;#34; they should say &amp;#34;Imagine because the reality will not match&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The box it came in would probably do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you may have to explore the vagaries of the credit card company you&#x27;ve chosen to use, but hey, it&#x27;s going to be a lot more reliable/reasonable than the product&#x27;s representatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll bet it works in the case of many products, too:  </li>
            <li>and I have way more hairs than when I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was pleased.</li>
            <li>They should add \\&quot; more than 12 weeks, in perpetuity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>After many years of fighting hair removal from areas that I didn&#x27;t want there to be.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I am not at all satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>I do not even think about them any more...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This device was more like a torture device than a healthcare/beauty</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe a fellow user on this site can clue me in.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m just waving a magic wand across my hair.</li>
            <li>Well, I am so pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>Most med spas offer discounts and financing</li>
            <li>This may be one of the most over -rated items</li>
            <li>so Im quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>so I called to make sure that I didn&#x27;t order the No No</li>
            <li>You will get better results and save a ton of money.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how in the world they were able to have off some guys hair on his arm in 3 swipes</li>
            <li>, figured I just needed to work it more.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied...</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Better results.</li>
            <li>So glad I checked the reviews I dont have $300 too</li>
            <li>can still see peach fuzz and have gone over it so many times that my face feels burned.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this product unless you just love frustration.  </li>
            <li>Ok - I admit it.  </li>
            <li>Why so many infomercials?</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to be able to quit shaving and because I&#x27;m not overly tolerant of pain</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I mostly leave them alone.</li>
            <li>They look amazingly better than they did when I started.</li>
            <li>feel okay.</li>
            <li>They look amazingly better than they did when I started.</li>
            <li>feel okay.</li>
            <li>Most of the chin hair stayed on my chin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way cheaper in the end and works a lot better.  </li>
            <li>it seems ok</li>
            <li>I called after about 3 mo. of use, and, they kept telling me it didn&#x27;t work on my legs because I had to replace the tips more often.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps trimmed 20% more.</li>
            <li>It looked magical, like something a magical wizard  might use in a Harry Potter movie</li>
            <li>So I decided it was time to put this magical laser beam wonder to the test.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most cats are dicks IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you already have the misfortune of owning one, join me in complaining to the FCC and the better business bureau.</li>
            <li>am so glad to get to rate it because it has ben on my mind what i should</li>
            <li>Told her to read some reviews and let me know for sure if she still wanted it.</li>
            <li>When it is working, I love it.</li>
            <li>and she said sure.</li>
            <li>Able to return</li>
            <li>My Mom owns the no no hair series and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>and it gets it better then</li>
            <li>and she says that it works better than razors for her</li>
            <li>and this works much better and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to an epilator I do like this item better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, while buffing or shaving over the top.</li>
            <li>Could be a better product for the money.</li>
            <li>I can say I&#x27;m not 100% pleased.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>None of the panelists said they’d want to buy the device, though some described it as “cute.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, it took forever!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get my</li>
            <li>I did everything I was suppose to do, and had been very excited when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I was kind of excited, i said what the hey</li>
            <li>After much practice I have been able to use it fairly successfully on my face, although, it does not get it as close to the skin as I would like.</li>
            <li>I made my mom buy this for me with hopes that it would be a miracle worker, and though it was pretty good, im</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been kind of full on the arms.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Serves me right for falling for something that seemed too good to be true!  </li>
            <li>I purchased my No No for use on some fine facial hair and have had wonderful response.</li>
            <li>was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li>was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li>I tried this out, because the infomercial made it seem so easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the process leaves the treated area smooth!  </li>
            <li>I get fantastic results every time - VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I get fantastic results every time - VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Removes fine hair OK, but will not do anything to course hair.....</li>
            <li>Have done two sessions on my face and am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I used my device so carefully and still have it in perfect working condition, don&#x27;t know what to do with it now!</li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>I am just buying replacement tips now, and if you really want a good deal on those you can get them on ebay 3 for 15.</li>
            <li>I am just buying replacement tips now, and if you really want a good deal on those you can get them on ebay 3 for 15.</li>
            <li>good, and since it&#x27;s wireless, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of people I was very hopeful and I gave it a fair shot</li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to write a review, but I wanted to get the word out in my own way.  </li>
            <li>It worked fairly well on my arms and face where the hair is much fairer and finer...</li>
            <li>Ya right!!</li>
            <li>Thought the claims on this product were too good to be true, and I was right.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t believe the ads, but it is all true!  </li>
            <li>However, I found their Customer Service to be about the best as any other Customer Service Dep&#x27;t I&#x27;ve dealt with.  </li>
            <li>You need to give it the full trial period like anything else to know if it works for you or not!</li>
            <li>I like the original better</li>
            <li>I think that I spend 50 dollars easily though on waxing, razors, and shaving creams</li>
            <li>I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy.</li>
            <li>So easy.  </li>
            <li>was and that is the buffer wears out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up so easily, this method does work quite well.</li>
            <li>sure you clean the device after using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions are easy to follow, comes with two sets of heads</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall,this is a good product and will work if you are dilligent and follow the directions, and if you are realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li>Overall,this is a good product and will work if you are dilligent and follow the directions, and if you are realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li>I strongly don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest saving your money and go another route.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed the directions - the burned hair smell is strong, but after 2 months 90% of the hair is still there.</li>
            <li>-Thought I was waiting to be sure I got the full refund</li>
            <li>If they had a product that was effective they would not shy away from saying so.</li>
            <li>First indication all might not be well is reading word for word NoNo&#x27;s own poop!&lt;br /&gt;Busy</li>
            <li>and I liked it at first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of like when you first learned to shave your legs with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s best on light skin with dark hair.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my face and arms and the hair is now fine.  </li>
            <li>Keep your money, you can buy the best shaver for less.</li>
            <li>daughter has really fine blond hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave a fine stubble which one must buff with the pad to achieve</li>
            <li>my daughter, whom I purchased it for says she loves it and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>That should have worked out fine.</li>
            <li>basically cost me $25 to try out a incredibly time consuming product that I knew I didn&#x27;t want the minute I unpacked it and read the full story about it - it&#x27;s quite different than the story they tell on tv.</li>
            <li>So if you have fine hair,this will work for you but if not,then I wouldn&#x27;t advise trying it.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to recommend this fine product to a friend.</li>
            <li>you use it one because your hair is less and thinner and two because you&#x27;ve learned the perfect speed</li>
            <li>By fine</li>
            <li>Another plus is that makeup looks nicer as there isn&#x27;t any fine hair for makeup to cling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it will cut/burn/trim any fine hair on the legs and thighs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had this device been sold to trim peach fuzz or fine hair</li>
            <li>I live somewhere warm and have two kids, so the longer I can go between shaves, the more time I have to enjoy my coffee in the AM!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So even though I don&#x27;t usually fall for \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; hypes, I bought the No No! I knew I&#x27;d not be able to return it because I knew it would take me longer than most to get the stubborn hairs off my face.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>company is  using deception to get you money and is  a HUGE RIP OFF.</li>
            <li>Plugged it in got light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the almost $300.00 price, more like $3...</li>
            <li>oh and they tell you it comes with a free case valued at $50</li>
            <li>(I tried laser treatment and those bolts of light stung.)</li>
            <li>Like I said before, one application is not going to leave you hair free.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the smell is not unbearable.</li>
            <li>Fortunately this issue was resolved after one call but the fact that a collection notice was generated was unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>Vaseline works wonders and I wake up with a smooth and even complexion.</li>
            <li>Vaseline works wonders and I wake up with a smooth and even complexion.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on his back yet, but I do believe it will work great</li>
            <li>Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no.</li>
            <li>I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...</li>
            <li>but it was the buffer that removed hairs and made my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased 2 packs of replacement tips on a buy one get one free offer</li>
            <li>I waited my 45 days and then called to get my free shipping label to return the product.  </li>
            <li>I am completely happy with it&#x27;s progress and it has only been 3 weeks...</li>
            <li>I was happy when I came back from Thanksgivivg that it was in my mailbox.  </li>
            <li>It works great for facial hair, but the legs take forever.</li>
            <li>I notice the result is like a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that there are still companies out there trying to make money off people selling products that do nothing, and it&#x27;s not like this is a cheap product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never did I have smooth legs or anything else smooth for that matter.</li>
            <li>It does not give you smooth results if you use it once.  </li>
            <li>My neck and face are virtually fur free.</li>
            <li>I have smooth nick-free skin.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the treatment level goes to the highest setting on its own, no matter how gently I glide it over my face.  </li>
            <li>and I find the equipment won&#x27;t hold a charge and the laser light doesn&#x27;t come on with either head....</li>
            <li>My review will sound a lot like the others on here.  </li>
            <li>no E-mail was available where I could verify it was received.</li>
            <li>how important hair removal is to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>My mom got the free trial and it doesn&#x27;t even work at all.</li>
            <li>She has not used a razor in over 2 years and she has silky smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I would give it a -5 stars if this option was available.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, you have to do it two or three times in one area to achieve the smooth result.</li>
            <li>light and love&lt;</li>
            <li>The buffing thing takes the hair off and makes the skin feel smooth...</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone for honest reviews.  </li>
            <li>I never achieved the smooth, hairless skin promised in the commercials, and I have used it for a year now.</li>
            <li>That would just make more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>advice is therefore don&#x27;t buy one, unless you are happy to pay £200 per 13 months, if necessary.</li>
            <li>My stomach is now smooth and hairless and my chest is getting there</li>
            <li>I followed their instructions to use it twice a week on the area (a lot of light blond hair on my face--hormonal) for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Replaced thermicon and they are noy cheap.</li>
            <li>however it might be faster to lightly singe your unwanted&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs as often as I used to, but if I want to be stubble free and smooth, I do.  </li>
            <li>and it would come with free shipping and everything</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it; nothing has been invented yet that will get your skin as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li>However, they said if I wanted to buy another charger they gave me a free shipping discount.</li>
            <li>You need advanced technology to remove hair not this mickey mouse product.  </li>
            <li>make a great Christmas present</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple weeks now and haven&#x27;t used a razor at all, if you follow the instructions properly and use it correctly it works great.</li>
            <li>It was so encouraging to me to have a smooth hairless face.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth glide on that area either.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I had more success with the prescription Vaniqa (approx.</li>
            <li>The machine itself was really cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I used to use smooth away all the time instead of a razor before they stopped selling them in stores in my area.</li>
            <li>the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li>I got it two weeksago and the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li>so I will never be hair free.</li>
            <li>It seems like it works because you smell the hair burning and see a light pulse which makes it seem like its getting deeper</li>
            <li>Great item fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>The buffing pads are only good for ONE use - I used them more than once</li>
            <li>The buffing pads are only good for ONE use - I used them more than once</li>
            <li>Good ole fashioned waxing on a regular basis works a hundred times better.</li>
            <li>It worked really good on soft hairs</li>
            <li>But so far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure i was doing it right.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m hoping that someday it will rid me of most of the hair, but right now, I could still shave my legs (and sometimes do, depending on where I&#x27;m going/what I&#x27;m wearing).  </li>
            <li>But on longer flat areas it works great.</li>
            <li>I loved it at first, but have had a great deal of trouble with it.</li>
            <li>i used the tips i got with the first one for many hours</li>
            <li>i used the tips i got with the first one for many hours</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find a product that guaranteed hair removal.</li>
            <li>If you have the time, the investment is worth it!</li>
            <li>I am getting excited to see what happens in another month.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order the nono......</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this hair removal device for a gift...</li>
            <li>My unit was NOT user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my NoNo Pro.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I tried my nono today for the first time,and I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>First of all they should tell you there are additional costs for more of the pads, lotion, and the replacement heads</li>
            <li>Also, I saw nothing in the ads that it would take 45-60 days to see significant results.  </li>
            <li>The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty.</li>
            <li>At first did not like it - after useing it 2weeks,&lt;br /&gt;Learn how it works, love it</li>
            <li>I returned mine and they shorted me $12.95 for the original shipping.  </li>
            <li>It was the newer version of 5-0 not the original with Jack Lord.</li>
            <li>Will know better after the first six weeks is up</li>
            <li>It takes longer when you are first learning to use and it gets quicker the more</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own will not slow your hair growth.</li>
            <li>The area is clean, and you either use the buffer or scrub the area after.</li>
            <li>When my hair started growing back it was thicker and more abundant than before.</li>
            <li>Clean the blade wire often - use the brush or blow it out with your breath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Go to a real spa laser place, most have January and Feb. specials ,like buy underarms, get bikini area free.....</li>
            <li>My arms stay clean for a month.</li>
            <li>My arms stay clean for a month.</li>
            <li>ladies, even in fall and winter you really want to feel that smooth sexy \\&quot;just shaved\\&quot; feeling on your legs.</li>
            <li>Just use it, charge it, clean it, change tips.  </li>
            <li>I am really thinking of a product lawsuit as i have spent lots of money and time trying to recover my once before flawless skin.</li>
            <li>it took over an hour to get to &#x27;almost clean shaven &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li>I prepared my face the way the demo said, clean, no moisturizer, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the smell of burnt hair isn&#x27;t pleasant, but unwanted facial hair is.  </li>
            <li>Have not been able to get any positive results with it.  </li>
            <li>It works ok on fine hair which is why they advertise it mainly on your arms</li>
            <li>I asked if there was a certain hair type it works better for</li>
            <li>He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...</li>
            <li>This device is an out right scam!</li>
            <li>The main draw for me was that it&#x27;s pain free, and I would just love not to have to go waxing anymore.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for about 2 months as they say it takes over 45 days to see the full effects.</li>
            <li>I even told them I would be reporting them to Better Business, that really made them hang up..</li>
            <li>: They tell you you&#x27;ll get a full refund on your purchase</li>
            <li>a full refund&lt;br /&gt;SCAM 4</li>
            <li>This time I PAID IN FULL because I received a coupon via e-mail for a reduced price if paid in full.</li>
            <li>so my word isn&#x27;t good enough.  </li>
            <li>and, although I got burned many times, I kept trying because I really wanted it to do what they advertise.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had paid more attention to the reviews because if I had my time over, I would never have begun using the product.  </li>
            <li>She said I would not be entitled to my full money refund.</li>
            <li>That was the quote from a Nono call centre person when I rang to return the Nono with their 60 day full refund time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not to mention the free trial ends prior to the time they actually suggest you use it to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off going out to get a real laser treatment than buy this.</li>
            <li>I still have a face full of hair.</li>
            <li>But I have adjusted how fast I move it over my skin, so that the highest treatment level seems to be okay for my skin.</li>
            <li>No No provided, they received the return package in about 5 days, and my full refund was credited to my account 5 days after they received the return.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a full two months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying it because it&#x27;s true and it works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought some real junk off the TV over the years and had some true nightmares with customer services of those products trying to get a refund, so I have a good knowledge of this!!!me to the conclusion that most of these TV sold products are sold ONLY for the shipping &amp; handling charges as a profit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying it because it&#x27;s true and it works for me.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to keep it for a minimum of 45 days, but return it by 60 days after delivery in order to get a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a full two months</li>
            <li>The manufacture claims no part, &amp;#34;HSN&amp;#34;  although nice on the phone dismissed&lt;br /&gt;any refund and told me to call &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;  directly.</li>
            <li>So, I suppose initially, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Thanks for all your outstanding service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do some research and find a good quality product that actually works.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t get a full refund.</li>
            <li>I demanded a refund and they did not even refund me the full amount.</li>
            <li>The BBB is full of complaints.</li>
            <li>I know there are a lot of negative reviews out there, but my wife says it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>IS TRUE.</li>
            <li>so you get a full refund.</li>
            <li>And be warned, do you all know that its full price is $264</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;m going to get my full return price either.</li>
            <li>It smells like burnt hair when you use it and good luck trying to remove any hair without wearing the area out with multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of heat when using the product, and my skin feel tingly for a good ten minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do as good as the so-called customers who try it out on the commercial  </li>
            <li>love the feeling of the heat from the wire on my skin - very soothing and relaxing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful</li>
            <li>Full refund</li>
            <li>It took forever to get my refund though, so I called Discover, and within 3 days of that call, I had a full refund.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many times I have walked around all day with burn marks on my face thanks to this thing.</li>
            <li>is so much faster and so much better.</li>
            <li>Their buffer was only good for one use on my legs, face, underarms and it already wasn&#x27;t working as well after doing my legs before I even did anything else.</li>
            <li>You will much happier and have a lot more money in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will much happier and have a lot more money in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so far it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Both the hair and pro series use the same tips so if you own this one and want to upgrade to the pro you don&#x27;t have to buy more tips right away.</li>
            <li>i called the first time, the customer service person STRONGLY recommends that you use the lotion (which is formulated to also help stop/slow hair growth).</li>
            <li>But that skin is completely hair free and very smooth.</li>
            <li>simple, effective, painless, and quick!</li>
            <li>it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the device because it was working on the fine hair on my face that bothered me so very much.</li>
            <li>It most certainly does not feel like a fresh wax.  </li>
            <li>The buffer worked the first time I used it and got most of the stubble off ,but hasn&#x27;t worked very much since.</li>
            <li>the device was only able to cut the top - about 1/3 - of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i waited because the older model was corded</li>
            <li>First of all, as with many info - mercial type products, it is not going to work exactly how you see on TV.</li>
            <li>They want a quick fix like with waxing or whatever.</li>
            <li>They want a quick fix like with waxing or whatever.</li>
            <li>faster, easier, and  virtually pain free, but I&#x27;m smooth for a much longer time then I had shaved or waxed</li>
            <li>Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn.</li>
            <li>One quick swipe and your done?</li>
            <li>I have been doing it for a few years now and it seems to me that if a product gets good reviews on Amazon by Amazon&#x27;s Members, I am always satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been doing it for a few years now and it seems to me that if a product gets good reviews on Amazon by Amazon&#x27;s Members, I am always satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad case for so many people who really just want to know a product works and is worth buying.  </li>
            <li>looked like a mild floor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li>No scarring, quick.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a couple of years ago &amp; it did &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; hairs away in an adequate manner.  </li>
            <li>company thrives on the unsuspecting buyers that don&#x27;t research the product -- and getting a resolution through a product return and refund can quickly become a nightmare with one roadblock after another.</li>
            <li>Have had no problems, wife and daughters love it, would highly recomend.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>a couple days ago, and the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right after using it the first time, my wife confirmed the product didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product only works on very fine fuss hair, it doesn&#x27;t work on corse arm or leg hair, or anywhere else with strong hair.  </li>
            <li>I spent $20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s having successful electrolysis treatments for removal of body hair.</li>
            <li>I spent $20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s having successful electrolysis treatments for removal of body hair.</li>
            <li>It would only singe the very top of it.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
            <li>I am amazed at the results I achieved on the very first try.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at the results I achieved on the very first try.</li>
            <li>So after trying it for a month and talking to friends that love it, I called and they sent me a new tip.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer recommended I buy more tips (the ones I had on the machine were new)</li>
            <li>explained to him how my husband&#x27;s family tragically experienced 4 deaths in the previous two weeks, thus I had been out of the state and missed the return deadline</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I loved it &amp; by day 2 I had already done my entire bikini line.  </li>
            <li>for anyone that wants to purchase this - check out the Better Business Bureau website first.</li>
            <li>first, I want to thank all the reviewers who have taken the time to review the product and save me loads of money and angst!  </li>
            <li>At first the customer service rep was friendly and concerned</li>
            <li>this was a gift and at first she was excited, but after using it for over a month it didnt meet her expectations at all.</li>
            <li>i think the old ones were something like $25.00 each, but the new ones are like 3 for $25, and customer service told me that they have a club, where if you sign up you can get tips, a buffer and the lotion for $29.00, which is a good deal considering the lotion sell for almost $50.00 by itself.  </li>
            <li>i think the old ones were something like $25.00 each, but the new ones are like 3 for $25, and customer service told me that they have a club, where if you sign up you can get tips, a buffer and the lotion for $29.00, which is a good deal considering the lotion sell for almost $50.00 by itself.  </li>
            <li>This works, but like most products it takes effort, and you have to have a certain type of hair and use it a certain type of way in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>I have not had much luck with any hair that is not so fine like on my thighs or arms.  </li>
            <li>It burns fine hair very close to and at the skin line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for fine facial hair, but not for legs.</li>
            <li>If you, or someone you know, gets in close to your face after using this on fine hair the feeling is soft and smooth skin, nothing else.</li>
            <li>so they flash it real fast and then flash something like, &amp;#34;results</li>
            <li>so they flash it real fast and then flash something like, &amp;#34;results</li>
            <li>Literally, a waste of time and money and a great source of frustration.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you look for a med spa that can give you pain free real results.</li>
            <li>you really want results, then go get a Brazilian wax or just stick to a $.99 razor blade and cheap shaving cream..</li>
            <li>so I got the smooth away kit from amazon (actually when you get it it is called silky smooth but is listed as smooth away)</li>
            <li>I was literally surprised to see the commercials and comments of people whose hair is magically burned away or whatever they claim happens.</li>
            <li>it was such a good investment and saved me so much money waxing and shaving....</li>
            <li>I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the money or hassle.</li>
            <li>Not in a way that&#x27;s actually useful.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are clear on the number of days that you MUST KEEP the NoNo before you can return it for a refund&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>The nono is a useful devise in the war on unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think after I complete 6 weeks, they will be smooth and fabulous.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I think after I complete 6 weeks, they will be smooth and fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I will update if I ever get success.</li>
            <li>So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>If it continues to work this well then the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it once you start using it.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the amount of money they charge for it?</li>
            <li>I did read the directions, but, as they say, a pic is worth a thousand words</li>
            <li>It does take time but is worth the time.  </li>
            <li>I have had it almost a year and have not had much success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and I can only speak about my own experience.</li>
            <li>I purchased the item because I wanted to get rid of facial hair and it would also be nice not to have to shave my legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be THRILLED with such a result.</li>
            <li>No product is worth buying if they treat their customers like that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d imagine the company investors and owners laugh all the way to the bank -- with no shame whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>I had carefully saved everything (packaging, box, etc.) and kept everything in good condition</li>
            <li>Would not suggest anybody spend this kind of money on something that don&#x27;t last any longer than the warreny</li>
            <li>me, it was well worth the purchase price and time involved.</li>
            <li>but no one wants to pay that much for a product and not be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>She and her parents tried the product and felt it to be not at all useful.  </li>
            <li>on my legs for quite some time - over 6 months worth of time.</li>
            <li>rarely get burned.</li>
            <li>The first couple times I thought, \\&quot;cool, this is gonna work!\\</li>
            <li>It takes far longer to use than a razor and the results are nothing more than a scorched hair smell.  </li>
            <li>After reading about refund disasters, their so-called &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; and most importantly the TRUTH about this product performance as opposed to their advertising and marketing hype, I am definitely declaring NO!</li>
            <li>They just instruct you make sure the blue light stays on while gliding.</li>
            <li>, these areas have never been so hair free or smooth; not even professional waxing accomplishes this.</li>
            <li>This is false advertisement at its best.</li>
            <li>easy to use and effective in dark hairs.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>so ask about that before you commit and also do your research on the med spa before you plop down a ton of money, remember not all lasers are built equal and the more the laser costs the safer and more effective the treatment will be.</li>
            <li>Those who have reviewed the NoNo poorly have reviewed many items on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware!!!</li>
            <li>concept good but product extremely lacking.  </li>
            <li>Remember the old saying &amp;#34; if it sounds to good to be true it probably is&amp;#34;  This definitely applies to this product.</li>
            <li>On the other hand I have tried some infomercial products with surprising results.</li>
            <li>Right now, I am using it about 2x&#x27;s a week on areas that are hairier (legs, underarms).</li>
            <li>Returned item right away.</li>
            <li>(Surprise surprise, right?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li>just right it will  not remove hair.</li>
            <li>Then I went right at it and started using it.</li>
            <li>so of course I wasn&#x27;t going to learn it right away.</li>
            <li>It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get close enough,perhaps if set right it might work.  </li>
            <li>The unit broke right after the warranty period was up.  </li>
            <li>The hair is not removed right away</li>
            <li>I am going to call my credit card company right now and dispute the charges,</li>
            <li>The hair has to be just the right length for it to work and even then its hit and miss.</li>
            <li>She did not use it right away until she could read the instructions.</li>
            <li>A LOT FOR WORK AND THROW IT RIGHT IN MY CARRY ON.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the nono for 15 months, it quit working right.</li>
            <li>The heat passes right over the bumps with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t holding it just right, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it right before you have company coming - everyone will wonder about the stench in your home - not</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t burn it right away.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re usually right about these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re usually right about these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
            <li>The springs appeared to have the right tension and pitch.</li>
            <li>If I was getting ready for a hot date, I would probably use Nair or something to be truly hair free.</li>
            <li>If I was getting ready for a hot date, I would probably use Nair or something to be truly hair free.</li>
            <li>Especially since they will charge you the full price before you can return it and you will not be able to get a refund for the 45-60 days plus</li>
            <li>Especially since they will charge you the full price before you can return it and you will not be able to get a refund for the 45-60 days plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product works for less than one in four users that leave feedback and many more wind up with burned skin.</li>
            <li>think I am going to report them to Attorney General&#x27;s office and Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>think I am going to report them to Attorney General&#x27;s office and Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>I have fair hair on my legs and it did not do anything but burn the hair down temporarily into stubble.</li>
            <li>It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
            <li>buying for peach fuzz (very baby fine hair) - then the No-No may have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;If buying for very course hair - not going to work.</li>
            <li>Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will take off very fine hair but this still comes back.</li>
            <li>hair is very fine and blonde..</li>
            <li>I charged the little guy for the 5 hours required, and started on my legs and to be honest that sparking sound scared me</li>
            <li>I have certainly changed my mind!</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered right from the NoNo website...but wanted to put a review on Amazon because of the volume of customers that shop on here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A BIG waste of money, Norelco body groomer works excellent!</li>
            <li>With laser hair removal I use laser light in the 810nm wave legnth which is red light.</li>
            <li>It is not as easy to use as instructed, but thus far I am liking it.  </li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t burn out your tip as quickly by having to use it so much just to do it.</li>
            <li>At this point I have no illusions that my fine hair will go away or that I will be able to repurpose my my pretty pink tweezers into a framed artwork piece on antique beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember if it sounds too good to be true it usually is.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before I bought the product, they sounded very compelling actually, so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I would appreciate it very much.  </li>
            <li>The seller approved return and credited my account within a very reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>I saw the commercials for the &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;,,, and boy do they sound convincing,,, I was thinking of buying 2 of them for my daughter and my wife for Christmas,,, I will find other options now that I have read these posts....</li>
            <li>He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it never entirely gets the skin clean and hair free.</li>
            <li>Works great on legs, but the face is hard.</li>
            <li>I used my wife&#x27;s no no pro IV (most powerful model requires a large outside  240 volt diesel generator)  </li>
            <li>You are supposed to avoid lip area, but is kind of hard to do since it fills up that whole space from under nose to top of lip.  </li>
            <li>I had to hold it at the exact angle it wanted, move it at the exact speed, the exact pressure, and it seemed to turn itself off as it neared denser areas of hair</li>
            <li>it gets hot, sparks and smells like burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Eventually we returned the product, and hopefully the \\&quot;money back guaranteed\\&quot; will work better than the product itself - still waiting for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a \\&quot;Hair Removal Device\\&quot; is pretty misleading as it doesn&#x27;t remove anything.</li>
            <li>I can tell you from first hand experience that this is an outright lie.</li>
            <li>You are consistent and dilligent.</li>
            <li>On the bikini line (which I dont shave as often as legs and underarms), I noticed a change with the first application.</li>
            <li>They charged my first installment of $112&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I know the results are supposed to be better and last longer over a prolonged use..</li>
            <li>and after 60 days if you aren&#x27;t satisfied you can get your money back</li>
            <li>exactly as I had been instructed and waited for my refund.</li>
            <li>It works better on facial hair than on leg hair.</li>
            <li>I got my first NoNo about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>THANKS RADIANCY!</li>
            <li>and IF I see that my hair is not growing back after continued use for a couple of months I will be the most vocal proponent of this device on the planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I do it outside or make sure my husband isn&#x27;t home, then shower and lotion.</li>
            <li>- I do it outside or make sure my husband isn&#x27;t home, then shower and lotion.</li>
            <li>that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00.</li>
            <li>(Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.)</li>
            <li>so just be aware...</li>
            <li>Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m GLAD amazon refunded me, a month later.</li>
            <li>Imagine how much money this company is raking in by selling No!</li>
            <li>I am very grateful for everyone who has taken the time to post their comments to let the rest of us know what a crappy product the No!</li>
            <li>My sister in law said to read the reviews first...</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t remove hair the first time</li>
            <li>The first  time  </li>
            <li>you get a hot wire that burns the hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the nono exactly as it said to do so in the instructions.</li>
            <li>It clearly says that when you use the buffer you have smooth hairless skin for a while</li>
            <li>You however must use this product consistently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off just shaving them daily.</li>
            <li>I have thick, dark, fast growing hair on my legs, so I was impressed that it did get most of it.  </li>
            <li>I foolishly purchased this product without first checking the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Eventually i gave up and told myself that it was my first time</li>
            <li>and you have to be consistent with using it.</li>
            <li>and you are supposed to do it 3 times a week for the first six weeks.</li>
            <li>The hair did grow back alot more than I started with.</li>
            <li>Now I go to a real spa to have laser hair removed,that works, worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>I have watched two family members go through the agony (yes, real pain!)</li>
            <li>It only permanently reduces ~ 5-20% hair each time--and believe me, it&#x27;s closer to 5% for most).  </li>
            <li>After first problem that I thought I had, it was operator error</li>
            <li>This thing really works!  </li>
            <li>The first time, he made suggestions and gave me another 10 days of use.</li>
            <li>I got the first NoNo that came out.</li>
            <li>Burned myself the first time I used it, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>have come to the conclusion that most of these TV sold products are sold ONLY for the shipping &amp; handling charges as a profit.</li>
            <li>99% of the people in those TV commercials that seem to be regular people who have bought the product, used it and are satisfied with it, ARE PAID ACTORS.</li>
            <li>99% of the people in those TV commercials that seem to be regular people who have bought the product, used it and are satisfied with it, ARE PAID ACTORS.</li>
            <li>&quot; I used it exactly as directed, to the letter, and it did lessen the density of hair on my legs, but it never got rid of all of it.</li>
            <li>exactly what is advertised: a hair removal product --</li>
            <li>sadly not.</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li>I have used so many different types of hair removal products, laser, wax and electrolysis.</li>
            <li>I was told to wait 10 days and call back to see if they were satisfied...........</li>
            <li>I used the nono exactly as it said to do so in the instructions.</li>
            <li>It clearly says that when you use the buffer you have smooth hairless skin for a while</li>
            <li>At first the No No hair removal system worked.  </li>
            <li>First of all when I ordered this product from the nono website I received 2 confirmation emails</li>
            <li>The kid I talked to said it was his first day and lied to me about the shipping time frame and tried to talk me into cancelling my order and ordering from him.</li>
            <li>I think if the hair would have all been gone after 3-5 swipes in the same section I would have gave it more of a chance</li>
            <li>Not only does it not work the No No burnt her top lip</li>
            <li>watched multiple reviews in YouTube and read reviews on Amazon, and still most reviews were positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>Has used exactly as suggested/</li>
            <li>and first it said it came to my house</li>
            <li>Every time I see the add in TV it gives me headache, so much lie!</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL Trying to keep the thing on is the biggest issue I had.</li>
            <li>I purchased the No!No when it was first introduced on the market.  </li>
            <li>Was able to get my money back with no issues though.</li>
            <li>is it because I have coarser facial hair than most.</li>
            <li>At first these Velvet Touch pads irritated my skin quite a lot</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>nono does take your hair away but it comes back 10 x more</li>
            <li>The first time I used the no</li>
            <li>For some reason I was charged more than the initial invoice.</li>
            <li>JUST IS A VERY LUCRATIVE GIMMICK!</li>
            <li>Very suspicious!</li>
            <li>and they are gone at the first sign of them.  </li>
            <li>I tested it on the back of my hand and it seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li>and if this thing caused burns on others than it most likely will on me...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s exactly the length on the instructions.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Hair grows in cycles that last about a month so with each treatment I am able to kill between 15 to 20 % of your hair.</li>
            <li>After the first month&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li>I brought nono and the first 40 days</li>
            <li>and sure enough they had placed the order.</li>
            <li>and you are just paying the first installlment, the first time you pay, although you would think that you paid the whole price!  </li>
            <li>Wish I had sent it back, but I kept thinking I just needed to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I should have check the reviews first before I bought it.</li>
            <li>I thought I really found an answer to waxing and shaving!</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li>After the initial $90 payment, there were 2 more $90 charges to be taken afterward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hot wire that cuts hair off at the surface, if it even manages to get through the hair itself.</li>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>First, it did not remove the hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to sell it and get some of my money back.  </li>
            <li>Which is exactly what the instructions and commercials say.</li>
            <li>The first iteration the smell of burnt hair is noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure Linda is one of those &amp;#34; preppers&amp;#34;, but I can&#x27;t actually prove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son Donald saw them and enjoyed them immensely.</li>
            <li>What possessed u to think that u can remove hair with a Blue LED light!?</li>
            <li>and I am able to see the final results.</li>
            <li>item was unusable after first use, would not turn on or off.  </li>
            <li>, I followed their directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>if it will help with the thick peach fuzz on my face and neck (my epilator works great</li>
            <li>but it really hurts!).  </li>
            <li>Now I use the pro series and I have to say I like it better than the hair series because I have some coarse hair on my chin</li>
            <li>The pro series has two tips the one like the hair only it has better control</li>
            <li>With these combined tools along with an arsenal of facial and body cleansers, exfoliants, creams, lotions, oils and butters I am able to get asexy sleek appearance.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Works OK, but not as simple as the advertisement.</li>
            <li>Make 3 more passes on the same area.</li>
            <li>I returned it and am hopeful I am able to get my money back.</li>
            <li>I am not tweezing nearly as much as I was before no!</li>
            <li>I went over these areas several times over and never was able to remove all the hair even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>The customer service is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I  was hoping this supposedly new one was better than the old one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My recommendation to anyone who wants to buy a TV product is to first check the CUSTOMER REVIEWS right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My recommendation to anyone who wants to buy a TV product is to first check the CUSTOMER REVIEWS right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i was greatly surprised to see that as i used it more and more i did not have to do any other hair removal.  </li>
            <li>… I originally bought it to remove the odd hairs on my chin but because of the size of the head I ended up with even more hairs…</li>
            <li>Also when I used it the hair on my leg was kind of long, normally I shave them every day</li>
            <li>I did burn myself many times during my first use and it made me fear my no no for a long time.</li>
            <li>First of all I was willing to go through the process and really give it a go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their description of rivals made me suspicious so turned to Amazon, to whom many thanks, and read several reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou Amazon.  </li>
            <li>also used it on the shoulders &amp; back of my furry italian husband with good results.</li>
            <li>Do this until it is smooth, you may need to wipe away the dried skin and hair off the buffer and where you are doing so that it works better and faster.</li>
            <li>Should have known that if it sounds to good to be true it is no good.</li>
            <li>One reviewer said that it feels like pressing a hot curling iron against your skin, and it certainly does feel that way when it burns.</li>
            <li>willing to sell me a new one tho!!</li>
            <li>When used every other day it helps to create a fine pallet for makeup and smooth place for tender touches and kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt less stubble doing it this way, but is is more because the hair that is removed with the No!No! wasn&#x27;t stubble type hair</li>
            <li>Mine constantly blinked the light at me--which was supposed to be an indicator that I wasn&#x27;t holding it right, or I needed to go faster or slower.  </li>
            <li>No because her No No Hair was having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li>the NoNo was painless, I decided to \\&quot;practice patience\\&quot; - a statement that I have read over and over again in all positive reviews.</li>
            <li>positive comment about</li>
            <li>No it doesn&#x27;t remove hair but it does remove most of my peach fuzz that was getting too long</li>
            <li>Enthusiastically I bought the device straight from their web site on the 60 day trial period and used it consistently for over 3 months.</li>
            <li>I waited too long and wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li>I was so interested in no no; I felt I just absolutely had to have one.</li>
            <li>I bought this product straight from their website, I tried to be patient and give it a try, but IT DOESN&#x27;T REALLY WORK!  </li>
            <li>You also have to move Nono pretty fast otherwise</li>
            <li>Most are still as long as ever.  </li>
            <li>It would have been a full time job to complete the functions advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes fine hair, both light and dark.</li>
            <li>my arms are still about 95% hair free and the hair that is coming back is a lot softer, but then again there isn&#x27;t very much of it there to judge yet.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the no-no system after years of shaving and using other products that burned my skin and weren&#x27;t very effective at hair removal, as the hair just grew back.</li>
            <li>infomercial makes it look so easy and simple to use, but when you receive it the directions even tell you its going to take time to get used to ( I ordeded to save time)</li>
            <li>anyone is complaining about the ineffectiveness of the NoNo device it is surely because they are not using it correctly... if the blue light is constant, the humming sound is constant and the air smells like burning hair...</li>
            <li>Does a good enough job but takes sooooooo long (1/2 hour per leg).</li>
            <li>One good thing I can say is that the battery seems to last a long time on one charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of every single hair on my arms, but it has reduced the hair to a place that I may shave every two weeks at the most.</li>
            <li>Why I ordered it anyway is purely a mystery.</li>
            <li>I called customer service to ask for a large tip replacement.  </li>
            <li>My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The large attachment malfunctioned.</li>
            <li>No one needs to be lied to and you certainly will be if you do business with these folks.  </li>
            <li>On my legs it has worked in certain areas, but I have had to do it again and again</li>
            <li>It had to be faxed to a certain number and</li>
            <li>Make certain to re-enforce</li>
            <li>They showed a man with hairy arms removing a  large amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I had to set up an account, and then it gave me discounts off certain items that I knew I could find elsewhere for cheaper...</li>
            <li>large adapter&lt;br /&gt;Turn</li>
            <li>after the NO NO debacle so I went to the hardware store and purchased a large decorative plate hanger.</li>
            <li>I did not understand your question please resubmit a new one!!</li>
            <li>frequently it gets stuck in the on position and gets very hot</li>
            <li>It would take me hours, plural, per sitting to get any kind of result on a tiny area, and that was my first and only \\&quot;successful\\&quot; attempt.</li>
            <li>We purchased this product and it was put to use for weeks by my wife to no results, I left many emails to the company to find out they do not answer them, although this is from a contact page on their web site, I then contacted support, I was told I could not ask for refund right away as I had to continue trying the product for the major part of the trial period.</li>
            <li>I think that it MIGHT if you have fine hair, but my hair is medium to coarse.  </li>
            <li>Even with fine hair you have to go over several times and still doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>i know it was only working because it was FINE</li>
            <li>I only use the NONO on my face it works fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s No!No!&amp;#34; The TV commercial makes it look and sound like such an easy solution to long-term hair removal that will make your life easier.</li>
            <li>Works fine now that useage is regular.</li>
            <li>It does not remove hair, even fine hair, like advertised, especially if you are of Hispanic descent.  </li>
            <li>The buffer is like an extra fine sandpaper and it doesn&#x27;t hurt If you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor</li>
            <li>You have to keep the no no on a pretty steady pace when you sweep an area or it will not work.</li>
            <li>i ordered the nono and did not have very high expectations as you never know what you are going to get.  </li>
            <li>They make it sound magical, therefore I knew that actual results could never live up to their claims.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well for that fine peach fuzz on the sides of your face and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>If you only have a little hair I bet it works great.</li>
            <li>So I really had very high hopes for this product to work.</li>

            <li>READ THE SUPER SMALL FINE PRINT THAT FLASHES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN FOR 2 SECONDS!</li>
            <li>(already too much time )</li>
            <li>as i began to use it, it started sparking and all i could smell was burning hair( who wants to smell that).</li>
            <li>It really works as all the commercials says it does...</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use it in private parts, and on surfaces that aren&#x27;t smooth, or the glow wire could burn through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolute Scam.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t really noticeable.  </li>
            <li>too much work</li>
            <li>but I couldnt keep up with the appointments because they cost too much:</li>
            <li>The buffing is absolutely gentle.  </li>
            <li>So does it really work?</li>
            <li>Like I said before, the hair has to be a bit gown out for it to really work and who want&#x27;s to wait until they look like a sasquatch until they can do anything about unwanted hair?</li>
            <li>The directions say you shouldnt let the hair get much longer than stubble length.</li>
            <li>After still not seeing any real results I gave it a break to grow in to get an idea of progress and let my skin take a break.</li>
            <li>Thanks, son.....</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t log the usage, as I just keep it charged up and may use it at night while sitting at the desk, may use it on a Saturday morning, when checking my email.</li>
            <li>I really feel taken.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as fast as getting laser treatments, but, I can put in the time and effort to save the bucks.  </li>
            <li>Doctors said it was hormones and nothing I could really do about it</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance and found that my Baby Philosophy lotion works very well.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li>but the product was absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li>and i charger it overnight.what a pice a junk the blue light would not stay on.</li>
            <li>The hair is not removing very well at all.  </li>
            <li>thanks for the reviews.</li>
            <li>I have to use the buffer vigorously to get the skin smooth and then moisturise, but the hair just comes back, thicker each time.  </li>
            <li>and IT REALLY</li>
            <li>I have been through the whole gamut of trying to solve this HAIRY issue of mine.</li>
            <li>She has some darker hairs and this really takes care of them.</li>
            <li>I wish I had saved  my money for real  laser removal.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but, it tooks SO MUCH time and effort to do so, with threats of sueing them, and raising my voice.</li>
            <li>It was a very daunting experience.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but, it tooks SO MUCH time and effort to do so, with threats of sueing them, and raising my voice.</li>
            <li>It was a very daunting experience.</li>
            <li>and I could never get a close enough smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like using nare etc..</li>
            <li>it cost too much money to buy and it doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment of whether or not something is broke or malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li>It works very will</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical about spending this much money on a hair removal product but the laser hair removal I was paying for was breaking the bank</li>
            <li>I really did not want to shave ...</li>
            <li>The red light kept coming on</li>
            <li>think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens</li>
            <li>Skin becomes very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would really like to try this product</li>
            <li>The whole reason these products are sold over the TV and not in stores like Home Depot, Sears or Walmart is because the scammers who sell these pieces of junk are after the Shipping &amp; Handling</li>
            <li>sell you a product for 19.95 + 12.99 s&amp;h, and I give you a second unit for free + 12.99 s&amp;h.</li>
            <li>EVEN IF EVERY BUYER RETURNS THEIR PRODUCT, I will have still made $12,784,000 on that second s&amp;h for the free unit.</li>
            <li>Not quite as fast as the commercials will lead you to believe.</li>
            <li>I still use my nono, but it really dosen&#x27;t work like they say.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>I really dislike being taken advantage of.</li>
            <li>So put your $300.00 toward real lazar treatments.</li>
            <li>How I wish laser had been available back then.</li>
            <li>How I wish laser had been available back then.</li>
            <li>Laser treatment is the only thing that works, if you have the money the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to any one it cost way to much</li>
            <li>It is growing in much slower.</li>
            <li>The hair on my arms is growing in much lighter and finer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At the beginning of October I noticed that the blue light was on continually</li>
            <li>THIS MUCH</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving my legs is much safer, quicker, and I like the no pain of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>have been sent back by people trying them for the free trial period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was really a turn off</li>
            <li>Used one and did not see any real effect to continue use.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair eventually does regrow but is much finer and easier to remove.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receving this</li>
            <li>Thanks to the NO NO</li>
            <li>My real problem is their customer service.</li>
            <li>Its very dissapointing considering how much it cost.</li>
            <li>It left me smelling like burnt skin and also when I used it, I was told it is pain free,</li>
            <li>She saw the ad on tv and was really exited about it.</li>
            <li>but I just think if people knew the whole return policy they would think twice about the trial.</li>
            <li>but I just think if people knew the whole return policy they would think twice about the trial.</li>
            <li>a pain to use, and makes the whole room smell like burnt hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>If you still want to buy find someone that alreay used it and ask if it really works.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t seem to do what it claimed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing</li>
            <li>I kept trying, but didn&#x27;t see enough of a difference to be worth more than 200 bucks and constant abrasions and scabs.</li>
            <li>This is what I had been doing for a year already, but they didn&#x27;t really care about my dilemma, and just blew me off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very to everything from soaps to razor types.</li>
            <li>The commercial didn&#x27;t mention the sound the thing makes or the burning flesh smell.  </li>
            <li>It is VERY noisy.  </li>
            <li>Its promising result was not so promising.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the performance of my No</li>
            <li>so I was really hoping it would work.  </li>
            <li>I was very patient as I waited for results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has never broken or stopped working.</li>
            <li>, I considered purchasing one, but, of course, you can&#x27;t tell much from trying a friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I bought this item in 2012 and have not seen much results.</li>
            <li>I tried the nono on my arms,and now they are hair free,they were very hairy.</li>
            <li>No-no absolutely refuses to help.</li>
            <li>it really</li>
            <li>From the beginning, it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>and I still had stubble because the nono didn&#x27;t get rid of the whole length of each hair and</li>
            <li>I purchased nono straight from their website</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely zilch.</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t expect fast results.</li>
            <li>I have had many clients that have used nono and have had absolutely no difference in hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>I also started using the prescription cream, &amp;#34;Vaniqa&amp;#34; which really reduced the hairs on my chin &amp; face.  </li>
            <li>They said it would take up to 6 months before you started to really see the results.  </li>
            <li>He responded, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t really care if you&#x27;re getting frustrated.&amp;#34; I hung up.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work, and was convinced it would.  </li>
            <li>Your hair regrowth will definitely diminish, but it comes at the cost of never having smooth skin.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m really going to watch my credit card for the rest of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really, really need to never order anything off TV again.</li>
            <li>The tip would get stuck in the up position with the red light on.  </li>
            <li>this is much too labor intensive for the money.  </li>
            <li>After speaking with a very polite nono representative, however, he informed me that I missed the 60 day return deadline by 7 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and all I accomplished was giving myself a headache.</li>
            <li>I bought this off HSN and tried it immediately, it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>, the whole unit doesn&#x27;t glide anymore and therefore does not even work anymore.</li>
            <li>Not so much on the face.</li>
            <li>tooo much money for this.</li>
            <li>The red light keeps coming on</li>
            <li>Very upset with this.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY enthused about it thinking it would be the thing for me.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to not have any facial hair issues.</li>
            <li>I bought this a year ago and it really does not work at all...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I can already see about  50% of my hair not returning and by spring, I shouldn&#x27;t have to use it much at all except for touch ups.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fast as she was expecting to remove hair, but it functions as promised.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many hours I spent using it</li>
            <li>Its a simple $2.37 kids toy that emits a light..</li>
            <li>My niece bought the newer Pro model and it seems to be working for her, so maybe it really depends on your hair type.  </li>
            <li>This really is the modern day version of snake oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So when I used it, the blue light kept on switching on and off.</li>
            <li>My mom after trying out my pro with her tips wants to upgrade to the pro.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll know what you are doing, if you haven&#x27;t the videos don&#x27;t really explain it too well</li>
            <li>and it will go so much faster</li>
            <li>and my hair is already softer and not growing in as fast as when I was using tweezers and</li>
            <li>I have smooth legs but occasional &amp;#</li>
            <li>No!No! is what it is.. a really close hair trimmer by electrical wire.</li>
            <li>Thanks again...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.  </li>
            <li>I really gotta learn how to say no.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>As I ready it to make another pass, I notice that the No</li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied with this product .</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me fast.</li>
            <li>While it hurts as to be expected, these areas have never been so hair free or smooth; not even professional waxing accomplishes this.</li>
            <li>back to my old epilady trio hair remover and sugar wax for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Laser may be a better option but have not tried because of skin discoloration being reported.</li>
            <li>She thought it&#x27;d be a good way to delicately deal with the embarrassing issue.</li>
            <li>Go waste your own $300 and find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife is not stupid and only had the No No on its lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>So at 2:45 this afternoon I called back again as suggested to make sure that the order was canceled and this young lady told me that they already shipped the product.</li>
            <li>in conjunction with the Tria laser (which I also own), using the No No to keep the appearance of my arms nice and perhaps weakening future hair growth while keeping the hair short enough to use the Tria laser properly.</li>

            <li>So this product looked really good, and I couldn&#x27;t find any negative reviews, but didn&#x27;t think to look here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used a dematologist with a new chilled laser that has removed a great number of my sort of light/sort of dark facial hair.</li>

            <li>me warn you- STEER CLEAR!!!</li>
            <li>i usually no no sitting on the bed watching tv and since it burns the hair away, there are no little hairs to clean up.  </li>
            <li>, wife could not get the hang of how to use it at first, then I tried, the blue laser light came on and I almost evacuated my bowels, it scared it nearly out of me!  </li>

            <li>If this $200-$300 product is so good, why does miss clairol (who has ALWAYS seen and ALWAYS wondered) have to keep going over and over the same skin to get results, as do the other what-evers that are  trying to sell??&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li>The product is made of cheap light metal and the small amount of blue light they claim is laser?  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s been 4 weeks, my arms appear hair free, my legs, well, I shaved 4 days ago after using my NONO for 2 weeks on them, they feel smooth - maybe a little peach fuzz, but nothing like it use to!</li>

            <li>It takes some time, and must be done slowly (not every day) but it works!</li>
            <li>so I better get the hair off my other arm.</li>
            <li>From bleach to wax to tweezing, sugaring and many other gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better than every other day.</li>

            <li>How many other companies let you use a product then return it for another, over and over?  </li>
            <li>After about 4 months the unit began sounding different than it originally did.  </li>
            <li>have not yet given it a chance in many other places.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days (only on my cheeks, chin and neck), I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my 3 day trial.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no damn way I&#x27;m paying an extra $35 a month just to watch the original.</li>
            <li>let other family members use they just love it.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all!</li>
            <li>In the past I have spent a lot in beauty salons that used the Epi-Light system... and it was very good...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any over buffing redness, I only had to go over it a couple times with the silky smooth instead of the normal 15 times when I don&#x27;t use the no</li>
            <li>tired it on my arms, and it did a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It did not do a good job on dark coarse hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li>i love how the lotion smells, but i only use it if i have to cool down a certain area.</li>
            <li>i love how the lotion smells, but i only use it if i have to cool down a certain area.</li>
            <li>bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
            <li>My first NoNo was ordered using the payment plan but when I received the item it was clearly a used NoNo</li>
            <li>For me, the price was ok but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve gone back to tweezing hair around my lips, and I don&#x27;t expect full hair removal.</li>
            <li>Complete and utter rubbish, please be warned and stay well clear lovely people.</li>
            <li>but they advertise that they will give a full refund plus the cost to ship back.</li>
            <li>turned the power to FULL BLAST and went to work on the facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been occasionally burned, not badly, but I can deal with that</li>
            <li>I have fine natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Only works on soft fine hair.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, it removed some hair but it didn&#x27;t even get rid of it down to the skin like shaving does.</li>
            <li>At first it was just warm to the touch then after just a few seconds; it got down right painfully hot.</li>
            <li>and they said I needed to get new \\&quot;blades\\&quot; so I did as instructed (not cheep!).  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get my new charger in the mail!</li>
            <li>Using the after treatment cream was definitely helpful after the first time use of the No No.  I can now honestly say that my facial hair isn&#x27;t the only feature I see when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>you have to buy a whole new</li>
            <li>buy a new one but no refunds or reasonable exchanges.</li>
            <li>As you look down at your leg there is a lot of long new growth that it just will not remove and, I am very fair and blonde.  </li>
            <li>Product died right after warranty even though barely used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to change my mind between now and 45 days, and I suspect there&#x27;s more hidden scam to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They still owe me about $50.00 to my mind, but when I enquired they more or less told me to go whistle for it.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but not super.  </li>
            <li>A razor does a better job, for $298 less than this piece of electronic garbage.</li>
            <li>I found I got better hair removal using my razor and it took less time.  </li>
            <li>As an aside, I find it interesting that you can contact only by phone; their website will only sell you a nono</li>
            <li>It takes forever to do and the hair grows back really quickly afterwards.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son always tells me how much of a difference he can tell in my arms, or as he tells me, I don&#x27;t like like a Gorilla now, haha.</li>
            <li>And then there&#x27;s the thought that some electrologists intentionally kept the current too low so that I would keep returning for more treatments.  </li>

            <li>I tried this, and while I was lucky to get my money back easier than some</li>
            <li>but hair does come back quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for a friend of mine who is of east indian decent.  </li>
            <li>I bought my NONO mainly for my face.  </li>
            <li>We were lucky to get our money back.  </li>
            <li>I USED THE CLASSIC ONE FOR A WHILE</li>
            <li>and then the red light went on and it completely stopped.  </li>
            <li>main worries</li>
            <li>This just a way for some backward, crooked scam artist to get quick money.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this at all for this particular body area</li>
            <li>and then it grows back because the No!No! beam is only &amp;#34;burning off&amp;#34; the very top portion of the hair, just above the skin.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all my family &amp; friends as they can see the difference it has made for me.</li>
            <li>wonder why the Shipping and handling charges are so high?</li>
            <li>and those S&amp;H charges are always way way high.</li>
            <li>No on to high a setting.  </li>
            <li>the product it self so highly touted by itself.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to a friend…</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying the nono before spending thousands on laser removal.</li>
            <li>I had no expectations of this product, just high hopes that it would take care of the stubborn hairs growing on my chin and the peach fuzz on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>The wire just burns the hair really high to avoid skin damage.</li>
            <li>stated in some of the other reviews, I too experienced problems with customer service and it took a few calls to resolve the problems.</li>
            <li>After a month, I tried what other users suggested, just using it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I must mention that any time I called, the reps were extra pushy to sell me extras, but I declined due to the fact that I wanted to make sure it worked first.  </li>
            <li>I call the number, sit on hold while being held hostage listening to their advertisements and then get disconnected.**DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>and it took all the hairs off, plus my face feels so soft!!</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your time!!</li>
            <li>Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>It does melt off your hair (at first you&#x27;ll have to wipe away little balls of charred, melted hair that drop out of the device as you use it) but doesn&#x27;t result in smooth skin.</li>
            <li>it is kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>In other words, it does a decent job at removing baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on an occasional tough facial hair and is spotty at best on legs and thighs.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I have not broken out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I have not broken out.</li>
            <li>would absolutely not recommend this product, frankly, even if it was free.</li>
            <li>No device and my Tria laser will result in permanently hair free arms sometime in the next few months.use it) but doesn&#x27;t result in smooth skin.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of finding a cheap spring like I did which was really no hassle at all, go with the REM spring.</li>

            <li>i decided that since i could send it back if i wanted to, i would use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>On average for me, it takes one time in one direction, one time in the opposite, and then one more time in the first direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will not see smooth skin the first few times you use the NO NO.</li>
            <li>The whole thing became hot to touch and it was constantly emitting its laser rays/&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used it for hair removal on the back and neck with much success.  </li>
            <li>It gives burning smell which is normal according to the manual.</li>
            <li>I strictly followed the regime of rolling No!no Hair Removal, by small areas and repeatedly on the same area many more times when the hair grows back.</li>
            <li>The first time I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all, but the second time I was amazed at how much hair had disappeared.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a duh</li>
            <li>waited over 3 weeks to give it a good try not happy with results.</li>
            <li>I did, I kept it for a few months, but found out very quickly that this does absolutely nothing for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Italian, with super sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li>I saw a commercial for this and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>After that work I have to tweeze the rest and it comes right back.  </li>
            <li>Just remember, if you slack off, the hair will come right back.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it</li>

            <li>after you finish buffing with the other one.s with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li>When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li>Got it and found it to be cheap feeling and the case was pretty flimsy and not a perfect fit as you would think.</li>
            <li>One month after purchasing the new NoNo (three months after receiving notification that the returned NoNo had been received by the company), I received a notice from a COLLECTION AGENCY.</li>
            <li>and why don&#x27;t I let him send me a new nono?  </li>
            <li>When I received the new blades I installed one and guess what?  </li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one that did work.</li>
            <li>and you may have to purchase new thermo tips after the one year.  </li>
            <li>but they sent me a new one anyway.  </li>
            <li>so I changed to a new tip and that solved the problem.  </li>
            <li>and it did come in a new unopened box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and as I live abroad I had to wait for a friend to get it for me</li>
            <li>I called the company to ask what needed to be done, and was told that I needed new heads, inserts, or whatever they call those things you place on the end of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll live with razor bumps.</li>
            <li>it was still new on the market</li>
            <li>I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li>it was still new on the market</li>
            <li>I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li>I had craved this gadget since it cost about 400.00 dollars and when it came down a little in price and had that remarkable 60 day satisfaction guarantee, i made the sacrifice, and bought the darn thing.  </li>
            <li>It does work on fine hairs, but it&#x27;s not worth the money knowing it holds maybe a 5 min charge tops.  </li>
            <li>a HUGE NoNo!&lt;br /&gt;It removes some hairs and leaves others, and it needs to be passed over and over on the same facial spots.  </li>
            <li>Albert came back on and said \\&quot;no supervisor is available at this time, call back, but I am going to do you a favor and send you the return</li>
            <li>Albert came back on and said \\&quot;no supervisor is available at this time, call back, but I am going to do you a favor and send you the return</li>
            <li>Advertise the product, give a second unit for free, and just charge shipping &amp; handling charges for the second unit...</li>
            <li>several tries many times it would not remove them.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product but it quit working all of a sudden after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>Plus it is not painful at all, and my first few experiences with an epilator gave me tears.</li>
            <li>Well...it did it pretty much every single time I used it.  </li>
            <li>WELL CLEAR!</li>
            <li>Clearly, using this product is a no-no!</li>
            <li>the first one i got started acting up, and i called customer service</li>
            <li>Just burns the hair and leaves pretty big stubble.</li>
            <li>The commercial is very deceptive!</li>
            <li>Do not waste you money!</li>
            <li>Does NOT work..just a red hot wire that burns hair off and skin around knees and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>First it was set too low and it chattered no matter what I tried and would immediately break the wire, then it quit working.</li>
            <li>Only interested in removing chin and moustache hair.</li>
            <li>First, I did not order this from Amazon, I ordered from the nono site so that I could get the money back</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully every second day for the first 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>I have light stin and dark hair</li>
            <li>It does take a long time but worth it.</li>
            <li>I started to place my order because the email I got after backing out the first time said it was only $89.00</li>
            <li>I bought the No No specifically for my upper lip, but followed all the directions and tried it on my arm first.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  </li>
            <li>Yet, the facial hair is my biggest concern and the reason why I bought this unit in the first place.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does on the commercial.</li>
            <li>After the first couple days, I no longer need to open the windows and air out the house after using the No No device.</li>
            <li>So I used it religiously for 3 months, exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>But after first use, subsequent uses don&#x27;t produce the odor.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your time or money!</li>
            <li>did not even function properly the first use.</li>
            <li>it didnt work after the first week and left marks when i did use it</li>
            <li>There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li>There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li>Nearly 2 years of use have taught me that the No!No! does remove hair, but not as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not lazy</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re face with a red hot peice of metal...</li>
            <li>I waited past the 30 days hoping it would get better or would even work</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same as shaving.</li>
            <li>When you see the infomercials and see the smiley, hairless models using the unit and there is a constant blue light; especially as they move so easily over the knee--that&#x27;s not real.  </li>
            <li>No No, I run my hand down my leg expecting baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>run my hand down the side of my leg once again hoping for baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>run my hand down the side of my leg once again hoping for baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Depending on how fast your hair grows, all people are different, you will see the hair come right back.</li>
            <li>The trust in our new relationship completely gone, I never took my eyes off of it.</li>
            <li>(hair is moderately fine, not coarse, but about 1/2in to an inch long, no joke!).</li>
            <li>If you have any grey chin hair forget it, it just runs right over it.  </li>
            <li>unless you don&#x27;t use it right and go over one spot, or linger too long in one spot - then you will burn your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But i guess as long as the blue light is going its working.</li>
            <li>The hairs come back fine, (yes your hair does grow back), and are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Some of the hair is growing slower, but still growing, and most of the dark chin hairs are still growing back.  </li>
            <li>I thought my hair might be too short so after the two months, I waited until the weather was cool enough to go without shaving my legs and didn&#x27;t shave them, my underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to see the overwhelming reviews warning people away from this very expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li>First pass complete, I start the next section.</li>
            <li>Also, the buffing really dried out the skin on my legs badly, no matter how gently I did it.</li>
            <li>The large tip never worked, but I was able to use the small tip and do my chin and upper arm.  </li>
            <li>positive reviews are obviously paid reviewer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s this thin wire that gets hot as all hell and only comes down to the skin when you&#x27;re holding it at the right angle, speed, pressure, spinning counter clock wise while sprinkling fairy dust on your head and sucking on eye of newt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheaper, not as much hassle, and you get the exact same effect.</li>
            <li>2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear.</li>
            <li>I cannot review yet the long term effects, but for someone who&#x27;s had serious problems with excessive hair (and not to mention the fact that I have dark course hair to begin with), I am thrilled that something worked this good on my first try with it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t maybe use it long enough to really test it out right.</li>
            <li>The product works on very fine baby hair but anything courser is a complete failure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Device didn&#x27;t stay on, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>Pure and simple!  </li>
            <li>The guy in the commercial must have shaved his arm because that Nono certainly did not.</li>
            <li>This product is a SCAM, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li>So you can only use the product on high because it doesn&#x27;t mater what setting you put it on - it always switches to high after one stroke.</li>
            <li>Did not work and looked cheap not original</li>
            <li>but now my legs are smooth with little hair.  </li>
            <li>It left more hair than it took off and took forever to get a little off my legs.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to get one little area close to being &amp;#34;hair-free.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t been able to get the thing to work on my facial hair</li>
            <li>I am more than a little pissed and I feel as it I have been scammed I even talked to a supervisor and got the same story that they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it and that it was going to be charged to my CC.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I was able to actually watch the little indicator move itself from level 1 to level 3.</li>
            <li>It works a little better on upper arms as far as the regrowth</li>
            <li>I bought the NoNo and it was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>This has been a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>a huge waste of money and pain also.</li>
            <li>I stopped by the No No booth in our local mall and the person there was completely useless, telling me they had never heard of this before and every one else they had sold it to had great results.  </li>
            <li>Basically it only partially works on smooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it does not have clear instructions neither within the box or in the website.</li>
            <li>The leg hair was definitely softer, but never did get the smooth leg I expected.</li>
            <li>The law says that if they are paid actors, it must be made clear in the ad</li>
            <li>The law says that if they are paid actors, it must be made clear in the ad</li>
            <li>clearly does not work like the commercials suggest.</li>
            <li>but once I made it clear that I no longer wanted it, her attitude became antagonistic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But when I saw on YouTube how to use it, it was clear.</li>
            <li>instructions are a clear as mud.</li>
            <li>Was surprised to see blades to shave off the hair.  </li>
            <li>I tested this on my very Caucasian skin (no marks, scars, freckles, open skin, etc.), on my wrist/forearm with visible but \\&quot;sandy\\</li>
            <li>Do Not Waste Your Money.</li>
            <li>let me start by saying i have been thinking about buying this for a few years now and when i saw the infomercial to try it free for 2 months, i couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>and I both saw the NoNo infomercial at the same time and were both really eager to try it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the no!no! hair removal system directly from them.</li>
            <li>It also did not remove hair very well for the short time that it was functional.</li>
            <li>Not \\&quot;fire burn\\&quot;, more of \\&quot;melted burned\\&quot; but at least it is painless.</li>
            <li>It takes about 45 minutes to completely go over my legs and I am not hairy</li>
            <li>and I do NOT have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I plan to go back to using hair removal creams (much easier &amp; cheaper)</li>
            <li>and I do NOT have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I plan to go back to using hair removal creams (much easier &amp; cheaper)</li>
            <li>Eventually Amazon put the whole thing back on me because, after 3 months of waiting, I had lost track of the mailing confirmation number, so Amazon told me they could not prove I had returned the item and could not make the company return my money.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to return the whole thing back because it was not working.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gets stuck in the on position frequently despite maintenance.</li>
            <li>Even my husband has asked if I could use the No No on his very hairy back.  </li>
            <li>and I found a young lady for which the product had worked</li>
            <li>Just burned the hait and not even completely off.  </li>
            <li>It took about 6 - 30 minutes sessions (total for both arms) to really get a \\&quot;no hair\\&quot; apparearance.</li>
            <li>*  WOW</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day since the day it was delivered and so far, not one hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li>but it is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>and I ended up going to a professional to get laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>It died completely  2 times.</li>
            <li>Strange as the address of the warehouse is in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for return label 5 weeks from first try..</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money like I did.  </li>
            <li>I completely regret buying the no no.</li>
            <li>You really won&#x27;t see lasting results until about the 6th week</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Please help me, I am 84 years old and do not know what to do.</li>
            <li>Only thing different is the buzzing noise it makes doesn&#x27;t sound the same as it used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too young to have hairs growing on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take that long to use, and the hair takes so long to show back up again!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think that when you get this you ( we) should be informed that there is going to be this BIG COST!</li>
            <li>but I developed a severe case of jock itch as a result of the damaged skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased directly from the website.</li>
            <li>I actually went straight through the website and ordered.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s by far the biggest scam</li>
            <li>My daughter purchased the NoNo directly from the company.</li>
            <li>If the professional doesn&#x27;t yes they are lying to</li>
            <li>This is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>Well I have the date marked on my calander and November 10th</li>
            <li>Well I have the date marked on my calander and November 10th</li>
            <li>Please DO NOT waste your money on this piece of rubbish.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the No No does not work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I got mine and didn&#x27;t try it until after I had it for 4 months because I am extremely busy</li>
            <li>SO hair removal takes so much longer than simply running a razor ONCE over the area!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on the No-No.</li>
            <li>I am not seeing a difference so far.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>now that is professional..</li>
            <li>No girl or woman wants facial hair.</li>
            <li>far as quality, I&#x27;ve had this product for going on 3 years</li>
            <li>I would give this product 0 star rating if I could complete a review with that choice.</li>
            <li>So far, it has  not removed ANY hair.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR</li>
            <li>Nearly $300</li>
            <li>just pulled the old Louisville slugger out of the basement that I haven&#x27;t used since 1991.</li>
            <li>I was planning to try to save up money for it, but after reading the reviews here, I will not waste time or money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin (I have eczema)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely baffled.</li>
            <li>This is a complete junk.</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and have bought nearly every product ever made to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>so I though I would have no trouble returning it.</li>
            <li>the hair just doesn&#x27;t melt away completely, it burns off the tip of the hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, my skin feels smoother, and the hair is gradually lightening from my skin.</li>
            <li>So far it is doing what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks</li>
            <li>If I could rate it appropriately it would get a negative 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ll do the 6 weeks they recommend then</li>
            <li>I really want my money back.</li>
            <li>Do not waste ur time with this product.</li>
            <li>If you need your hair removed go to a professional LASER place and do it that way.  </li>
            <li>After I use the NoNo, which really doesn&#x27;t work, the hair grows back twice as much; now I am left with hair on my face, that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it arrived in the product box</li>
            <li>I bought this product because nothing (laser, old time electrolysis, waxing, sugaring, you name it)has ever worked on me before.</li>
            <li>and I also have to shave after that because it couldn&#x27;t remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li>and I have just as much hair on my chin and upper lip that I had a year ago, and</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t think mine is particularly coarse.  </li>
            <li>There ought to be a class action against this thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble returning it, though.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised their is no class action suit against this company.  </li>
            <li>I got the no no about two weeks ago and have had no luck with it thus far.</li>
            <li>The CD ROM was tiny that was kinda unusual.</li>
            <li>customer service told me it&#x27;s a sealed unit and carnt be fixed</li>
            <li>but it is not growing back as fast</li>
            <li>Go over it a few times and your legs will be smooth.</li>
            <li>and if you do it too much your skin will be red</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li>No took far longer than shaving—up to 25 minutes per leg.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s your first time using it, hold it at a 90 degree angle with the roller facing you, do not allow it to sit in one spot for too long.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every day and so far my skin can take it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the out of the box quality is hokey, it has the weight and feel of a 50.00 item, not one that cost nearly 300.00.</li>
            <li>I was able to get some of the facial hair off, but after burning myself a few times I stopped and will try again tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>It was difficult to obtain a good result.  </li>
            <li>First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry.</li>
            <li>My NONO&#x27;s little o&#x27;ring that runs the roller had come off (probably user error)and customer service said they would send a new one out right away and have the old one picked up at no cost to me!</li>
            <li>My NONO&#x27;s little o&#x27;ring that runs the roller had come off (probably user error)and customer service said they would send a new one out right away and have the old one picked up at no cost to me!</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T waste your money  so that you are not disappointed as I am.</li>
            <li>This was the 3rd NoNo.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered before from NoNo on a trial period before paying and both of the first units came in old boxes and had obviously been used.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>First I could not agree more about poor customer service, they would not honor money back...</li>
            <li>and  I debated before buying due to the price; however, I thought if it worked it would be worth the money.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is beyond fine, don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it on my legs and arms, I thought it didn&#x27;t work because much of the coarser hair in some areas would not rub off with the smoother.</li>
            <li>but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg.</li>
            <li>The first went back to HSN because I thought the same as everyone else.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine as directed for the first month, starting with short stubble and then using it 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>First, the instructions are not that helpful, and the CD included does not give you a visual representation on how to use the product, it is merely a digital version of the written user manuel, which is lacking.  </li>
            <li>reminds me exactly of that male enhancement product,,&amp;#34;ageless male&amp;#34;,, yet another rip off company,,, they got sued,,, I got paid back,,, but they are still advertising and selling their bogus product (snake Oil)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First day Nono trimmed only about 70% of it leaving the stubs of different length- from 2mm to 10mm.</li>
            <li>On my face no less.</li>
            <li>I will have to go over the area with a shave, but the hair seems to be growing back slower and that was my main goal-</li>
            <li>i have a home waxing kit that works fine, but if you&#x27;ve ever tried waxing the back of your legs, you&#x27;ll understand what a mess that can be.  </li>
            <li>Before, even right after shaving, they still felt somewhat scratchy around my knees and other areas.</li>
            <li>Overall, if I could send it back for a full refund, I would; the advertising is very misleading and the product is definitely not worth the cost.</li>
            <li>For almost the same price, I highly recommend the \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n Flash and Go Permanent Hair Removal</li>
            <li>One major issue I have with this product is that it does hurt- a lot!</li>
            <li>I used the product, got the burning hair and slight smoke affect, but NEVER saw hair actually be removed to leave me with a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>If you have areas that you have shaved repeatedly for a long time, the hair will be much tougher.</li>
            <li>I tried several times, it doesn&#x27;t remove coarse hair, or really any hair as far as that goes.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with things that you wont use AND the adapters they say to use for the face and body are so cheap and small and plastic and to replace them</li>
            <li>If you had almost no hair to remove, then this might be okay, but to attempt to remove what I would consider as normal hair growth, it is not worth the time and trouble that would be required using this</li>
            <li>Their company directed me on how to return the product for a full refund (by the way, this is NOT a cheap purchase).  </li>
            <li>i bought it a few years ago and tried it the full time, with the 90 day warranty</li>
            <li>Being a hairy man I have tried waxes and creams and well as just plain ol&#x27; shaving always the hair comes back very quickly.</li>
            <li>ever the little things u use to shave wear off way quick and u can&#x27;t just buy them</li>
            <li>The first thing I found irritating is that it&#x27;s not as easy to operate as they make it seem on the commercial.</li>
            <li>The regular pro works great for me, but for my friend has thick dark coarse hair on her legs, almost like a mans beard on her legs</li>
            <li>It removed most of the hair but not entirely, some areas are hard to reach.</li>
            <li>I live in a very rural area where that&#x27;s not an option, so I will continue to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now depending on the person they may get new hair growth in treated areas for the rest of their life and may have to come back from year to year for a touch up session.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I sent it back and received a new one.</li>
            <li>but they will only accept new buyers once they have your money... forget it.</li>
            <li>If it works for you great, but I was so unhappy with it that I thought it may be valuable info to some people with similar issues.</li>
            <li>It is actually growing back much thicker than before too.</li>
            <li>Having read through most of the negative feedback here, I still decided to buy the product because they also offered the 60 days money back</li>
            <li>The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned.</li>
            <li>(yes, it zapped those long hairs), but after the first time, it Removed hair to stubble only...would go over the same area again and again, but</li>
            <li>Do not suggest to use on legs instead of shaving, in addition to shaving, it works well since not as much hair grows back next time.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight sting when using but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>As I spent near 350.00 I was not just ready to give up.</li>
            <li>After much frustration, I did not use for some time and now it is acting up and not working properly.</li>
            <li>At least they have a money back guaruntee but make sure you follow all the rules like I did</li>
            <li>Assuming they would at least be able to repair the machine I contacted customer service only to hear that since it&#x27;s been over a year all they can do is SELL ME ANOTHER ONE!!!</li>
            <li>No device and my Tria laser will result in permanently hair free arms sometime in the next few months.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be going along smoothly for a few strokes and then it is like it hits your skin with extra force, leaving burn marks in the shape of the wire.</li>
            <li>When we remembered that we needed to call back, it was too late and we were gladly told that we exceeded the warranty period.</li>
            <li>I used the No-No every single day, 7 days a week for close to 11 months straight.  </li>
            <li>It then burns the hair, but even after making several passes over the same area, hardly any hair was gone (and that was very very fine hair).  </li>
            <li>Yes if you have patience to wait for the results, and you are willing to use other methods of hair removal while using this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing major.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because either the product is so inferior that the buyers for the major stores rejected it, or it&#x27;s being sold on TV for the s&amp;h scam.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because either the product is so inferior that the buyers for the major stores rejected it, or it&#x27;s being sold on TV for the s&amp;h scam.</li>
            <li>Right at 90 days the small tip broke and a month later the large one broke.  </li>
            <li>It quickly became apparent that this was a waste of $300.</li>
            <li>anyway a few exciting days later a package comes in the mail with our new NoNo.</li>
            <li>Its worth far less than the actual cost</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this product for over a year but didn&#x27;t know if it was worth the price, but I heard about other people getting their money back with the trial and</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face because if you want to use it on your legs it takes way too long.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face because if you want to use it on your legs it takes way too long.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest the pro 5 series the hair is good for thinner and less coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I might (and I say might) see a little difference but not $300.00 worth.</li>
            <li>After three months, I can now see that within another few months, the hair that was initially too course to rub off with the smoother, will be fine enough that it will.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with high hopes, and even called to return it and get my money back when I was still having to use it daily after 60 days.  </li>
            <li>Even with extensive buffing, there is little or no actual smooth, hair-free skin.</li>
            <li>Even with extensive buffing, there is little or no actual smooth, hair-free skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really had problems with facial hair until entering \\&quot;peri-menopause\\&quot;; the product works \\&quot;just Okay\\&quot; for facial hair, but I have to use it daily, almost like a shaver, to remove fine facial hormone-induced hair.  </li>
            <li>tried it on the peachfuzz on the face and kept at it (remember the tip would not stay down for more than a couple of seconds) and it did take a little of the fuzz off (got the burning smell).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people who got this product and the general consensus is that it is piece of junk.</li>
            <li>will also be contacting my state attorney general consumer affairs division.  </li>
            <li>When I shave I get bumps and scars and general ickiness</li>
            <li>I want to be clear that the hair is burned and smells as such.</li>
            <li>The box was sealed only with some clear tape.</li>
            <li>so far maybe about 20% of the hair is coming back on my legs, but not in all areas.  </li>
            <li>same result complete wast of money</li>
            <li>After watching the frequent NO-NO commercials for well over a year, I decided to give it a try, especially when the warranty appeared to be fool-proof.</li>
            <li>I think of myself as a careful consumer, but feel very duped into buying a product that doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time.</li>
            <li>could smell the burning but barely any hair was removed.</li>
            <li>I spent hours trying to get this to work correctly, and all I accomplished was burning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It especially burns around the mouth, no matter how I angle it or how far away from the lips I try to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be used in sensitive areas such as bikini lines without pain.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Guess not, they&#x27;re too busy screwing the public!</li>
            <li>when I called to ship it back all I got was accusations I was using it incorrectly, and refferred to a s person that just instructed me on what directions already said.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I simply put on the TV and went back and forth between the two products as much as I could the last week.</li>
            <li>have blonde hair naturally,  so it isn&#x27;t course&lt;</li>
            <li>When you use it on the upper lip it zaps the skin in the middle because of the contour of the lip and this product also burns the skin if you use it in the same place too much, which you will have to do because it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.</li>
            <li>have an old one that worked for three years before having the same problem.</li>
            <li>The only way to get the smell of burnt hair out of your house is to completely air it out</li>
            <li>About 8 months ago, the device stopped charging completely &amp; would work for only about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>, she tried it and it did barely anything about the hair.</li>
            <li>I used it daily for a couple of months until it broke completely.</li>
            <li>Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]]</li>
            <li>My hair growth has barely lessened.</li>
            <li>It should be taken off the market and there should be a class action suit to get people their money back.  </li>
            <li>My feeling is there are SO MANY negative reviews that you ALL can&#x27;t be wrong. :-)</li>
            <li>I have only used it on my face and neck so far</li>
            <li>I have had some facial hair since early adulthood</li>
            <li>the thick, dark stubble appears again within hours of using it and it is becoming very distressing.</li>
            <li>bottom line, i am stuck with product that doesn&#x27;t work, and i see how they make their money is hoping people will try it for the full 60 days so they can tell them they are past their return time, leaving them stuck with the product and out of pocket cost..</li>
            <li>They jipped me about $8 which I didn&#x27;t bother calling about because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble</li>
            <li>Over three quarters of all buyers/users report poor (or no) results -- and most seek a return and refund.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a couple of times to get the feel of it and to move it smoothly and slowly</li>
            <li>It works like it says it does, BUT it is an EXTREMELY slow process and it doesn&#x27;t get it as smoothly as a razor.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the end to those little black whiskers and peach fuzz around my face and my love trail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one.</li>
            <li>and then later was told that a new replacement was being shipped to me ( red flag for fraud</li>
            <li>but we have basic cable and it only has the new version.</li>
            <li>With paid actors, a script full of outright lies and from a company with no sense of right and wrong, once they have your money you are of no value to them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not a quick fix, but after going to the electrolysis for years and not seeing a marked improvement this has really been a blessing and would encourage anyone to purchse one.</li>
            <li>It has this tiny roller that has to be pressed down the right amount while rolling it over your skin, where ever you choose to use this thing.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, however after about a year, or less say 6 months, there was a noticeable improvement in the reduction of hair around my face, specifically the nape of my neck, and sideburns.</li>
            <li>If you find someone that is willing to treat your hair for way less then others, remember lasers can burn, scar, and permanently discolor your skin if not used by a trained professional.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>but I only did it every other day for the first week &amp; havent seen any regrowth at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li>I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product, just to find out if doesn&#x27;t work, maybe for other people but not me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The other day I pulled the thing out of the box and got it ready.</li>
            <li>It not actually having lasting effects, and my sweet gifter who made the $300 investment wasted her money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then go.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than shaving with a razor but it lasts longer than a razor and your legs feel smoother and not only does it grow slower the more you use it, as long as you use the lotion with capi slow, your hair gets softer as it goes.</li>
            <li>And the cover is a bit loose, but we&#x27;ve already sent one back for always switching to high from low -- and the new one does the same.</li>
            <li>A little bit of the hair was burnt [and we could smell the burn] but the hair was still very very visible.</li>
            <li>I used it one night around my lip area, and woke up with a huge cold sore, wasn&#x27;t fun to get rid of.</li>
            <li>While this product may work for the occasional blond chest hair it clearly is incapable  of removing any coarse hair at all.</li>
            <li>As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as it looks cheap, is expensive, breaks easily and is a waste of time when you can just go ahead on hair</li>
            <li>In the early stages there were times that it would make my upper lip burn or be red afterwards.</li>
            <li>In the early stages there were times that it would make my upper lip burn or be red afterwards.</li>
            <li>Well the young lady that answered the phone at 8:15 said that I would have to call back later today as the order hadn&#x27;t yet showed in their system.</li>
            <li>It simply does not work despite following the directions completely.  </li>
            <li>the only advantage to spending the money on one is that you&#x27;ll be included in what will inevitably become a class action lawsuit for one reason or another.  </li>
            <li>I paid about $100 when I first ordered and was not told that this was just a down payment and the that it actually costs $300.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face exactly as directed; the little chopper heads cut my skin and it looked as though I had fallen and skinned my chin on something.</li>
            <li>The actual device doesn&#x27;t do much at all, certainly not what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>Tried it on my arms, first, because that hair is less coarse-</li>
            <li>I finally interrupted her instructions after the 3rd time and clearly stated to her that I DID NOT like the product and wanted to exercise the money back guarantee, please provide me with RMA #</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to get the job done and if you&#x27;re not careful you can burn yourself on sensitive areas such as your face.</li>
            <li>30 times (you are supposed to go over it four times to achieve the same look and feel as waxing) and could barely tell the difference from where I had not used it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this no no pink one, used two times and the rubber broke, cannot get my money back</li>
            <li>Apparently people who use this product only have one hair to remove.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt catch stubble hair which is primarily the main reason to even get something so outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li>i know this is a major purchase, so i will continue to give updates, good and bad, in case anyone is on the fence about buying one.  </li>
            <li>i know this is a major purchase, so i will continue to give updates, good and bad, in case anyone is on the fence about buying one.  </li>
            <li>It does burn the hair, if you use it for long enough but it doesn&#x27;t burn it right down so instead of hair you have singed stubble.</li>
            <li>, yes it burns the hair down and also can burn your sensitive skin!!!  </li>
            <li>In fact, there are so many negative reviews that I cannot possibly read them all due to time.</li>
            <li>, I started using it on my husband&#x27;s face due to his facial hair growing so thick and covering most of his face.</li>
            <li>If used too much in one spot, it can cause slight burns.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Two months later I contacted Amazon who apparently tried to get my money back.  </li>
            <li>The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li>Motor and light went on and off unpredictably and little, if any, hair was removed.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it for a while now, and  i do notice a tiny bit of difference, but i feel that you need to use it for a very long periods of time to show its complete effect.</li>
            <li>I left the rating at 2 stars because I can&#x27;t really comment on its effectiveness since I gave up after a month and half.</li>
            <li>I have very course black chest hair and had tried several products to get rid of it and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 3 weeks now and I am noticing the hair coming in more sporadically and less thick.</li>
            <li>The claims about hair free in few weeks are simply not true.</li>
            <li>At no time did my unit have a \\&quot;blue guide\\&quot; light and despite several tries and passes on the same small area no hair was removed.  </li>
            <li>has very soft not much hair, and he also did it for several times a day, for several day.</li>
            <li>to use the buffer properly press lightly and go small circular motions in a straight line up and down for like legs or side to side for like the jaw line on your face, then go back in the opposite direction rotating in the opposite direction as well so if you were going clockwise down your leg from the knee to the ankle you would go counter clockwise up your leg from the ankle to the knee.</li>
            <li>With a little time, determination and reasonable expectation, I have found this to be nothing short of a miracle.</li>
            <li>works!\\&quot; Then I was brave and tried it on my face, it was hard to get around the edges, and it did burn a little when i&#x27;d go to slow, but not enough to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li>Also it is very time consuming and hard to use on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>As such I have dark hair in places that I would rather not, such as the shadow on my upper lip that started to become obvious around junior high school.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and it was about 50/50 good vrs bad.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Not at all impressed, please save yourself the money and don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> This morning I asked my best friend if she noticed any change in the density of the hair on my lip and chin.</li>
            <li> *temporary slowing of hair growth at best.</li>
            <li> i must say i am very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> But I just got mine in the mail and used it on my leg and it worked great!</li>
            <li> The best advice I can give you is afterwards apply Vaseline!</li>

            <li> And customer service was awesome today!</li>
            <li> tips I&#x27;d like to note for best reuslts...</li>
            <li> though awesome, it&#x27;s  working.</li>
            <li> Ever since using No No by Radiancy it has been perfect!</li>
            <li> Great invention!</li>
            <li> It removes hair great, but like the directions tell you - it is a process!</li>
            <li> But it is GREAT for the face!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for spring and summer and lets face it</li>
            <li> Happy plucking!</li>
            <li> Perfect</li>
            <li> This is the best invention in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> so i should have been the perfect person for it to work on.</li>
            <li> If you have the time and patients and you fully understand this is a process, you will be very happy with the end results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone can contact an overseas manufacturing company, buy a product that is made inferior to it&#x27;s competition, advertise it on TV as the best product in it&#x27;s class, or the best thing since slice bread,  and make millions on s&amp;h charges.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t EVER think this product would eliminate hair re-growth, but was hopeful it might be an excellent alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> The No-No hair removal tool is the best painless way to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;The unit (comes with a charger) moves across your skin</li>
            <li> and I was so impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S AWESOME.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT!!  </li>
            <li> it sounded like the perfect device.</li>
            <li> aside from those problem areas, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> works best on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Oh, it was WONDERFUL on my arms and hands.</li>
            <li> NO came up with a wonderful product</li>
            <li> The NoNo is the best thing that ever happened to me.</li>
            <li> If there were a no star rating would be best!</li>
            <li> Just perfect.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my arms, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> A razor is still the best thing to use, not this.  </li>
            <li> But excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Also in all honesty their buffers are not the greatest they are done after 1 or 2</li>
            <li> PLUS you need to purchase additional &#x27;electro heads&#x27; to get the best results.</li>
            <li> LOL!</li>
            <li> soothing cream is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this amazing product!!</li>
            <li> In the infomercial, those beautiful ladies just slide the device once or twice on their arms and legs, and they&#x27;re done with perfect results.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and found that even on the lightest setting, it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> if there were results at all to comment about, even if it wasn&#x27;t ideal results, but again, the device wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Incredibly time consuming and</li>
            <li> will recommend Amazon, they are a great company and provide excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly turned off by the idea of lazer surgery, but eventually got this as a gift for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have incredibly hairy arms</li>
            <li> I gave it a good try, followed all directions, but Nair is my preferred treatment for legs -- cheaper too!  </li>
            <li> Good call!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product.</li>
            <li> You may as well  throw your money out the window, it doesn&#x27;t even work on fine hair!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my husband, and I am happy, happy ,happy.</li>
            <li> i must say the customer service is great.</li>
            <li> and i am happy with my results.ey</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m still waiting for the great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that they even do that.  </li>
            <li> It worked great  ....</li>
            <li> Great ad campaign that sucked me in.</li>
            <li> Every times use it it causes great pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The No No is a great product.</li>
            <li> My mum is enthralled by the TV ad for this product and keeps saying &#x27;I think that would be great&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say that the no no hair removal system is the best item that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great replacement for shaving/tweezing</li>
            <li> But I have tried it according to the instructions for about 3 weeks now, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> It is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Im still happy with the results on my bikini area even though the hair is coarser here.  </li>
            <li> If it was so great, they&#x27;d sell it in stores.</li>
            <li> I am not at all happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> I think it is great for find hair.</li>
            <li> Great, works as promised</li>
            <li> Great product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I think it works great</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;They did a write up on it in Consumer Reports that said it wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;They did a write up on it in Consumer Reports that said it wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s appearance is great</li>
            <li> Very nice set, has everything in it.</li>
            <li> The customer service rep was very nice, even though she tried to get me to keep it longer and keep trying.  </li>
            <li> The marketing is effective, &amp;#34;Not a laser!</li>
            <li> she has used many barbaric ways to remove hair but this is the easiest and best</li>
            <li> the best part is that I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it ,the best  Device to ever get!!!Just</li>
            <li> Thankfully for me, my hair is the perfect type for tv products because I have never had issues with most tv products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someday someone will find a painless, effective method of permanent or semi-permanent hair removal, but the No!No! does not work for me.</li>
            <li> :psexy sleek appearance. :p</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this product anywhere near the pubic region!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, that&#x27;s the best part.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling it works best on fine</li>
            <li> It did remove some of the lighter ones but mostly it burned me in couple spots and didnt do a very good job on removing the hairs</li>
            <li> It did not work most of the time and when it did it wasn&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li> and when i returnd the unit, the tips were still in good working order.  </li>
            <li> and when i returnd the unit, the tips were still in good working order.  </li>
            <li> did not have a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Based on the manuals description of a \\&quot;good wire\\&quot;, the wire looks good</li>
            <li> Based on the manuals description of a \\&quot;good wire\\&quot;, the wire looks good</li>
            <li> It really is good quality.</li>
            <li> It really is good quality.</li>
            <li> through Amazon who I&#x27;ve always had good service from.  </li>
            <li> No may be a good choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even close to a good shave.</li>
            <li> lots of good reviews on that</li>
            <li> All i wanted was good hair removal, shaving did not work for me at all; and</li>
            <li> it was even on the home shopping network, and people were calling in saying how they loved the product..</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and fair haired.</li>
            <li> But according to the unit, the heads are still good and do not need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> and I have also done a fair amount of research on these TV products, and</li>
            <li> annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a good customer and followed the directions for use for about 1.5 months.  </li>
            <li> The service was good but the product was not.</li>
            <li> We received the package on time which is good.</li>
            <li> Looks good on TV like everything else.  </li>
            <li> I am a good customer of Amazon and have been exstremely&lt;br /&gt;satisfied until this.</li>
            <li> Its good because I can do it at lunch sitting in my car.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think I can recycle it, maybe I&#x27;ll keep it as a reminder that if it&#x27;s too good to be true...it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought it would be good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I can do just as good of a job with a razor</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re not as good as the ads make out.</li>
            <li> and she says it does not work as good as the commercisls say it does.</li>
            <li> Almost everyone who has given the NoNo a good review, 4/5 stars, have not bought the product here.</li>
            <li> But something, anything would be good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a well used razor.</li>
            <li> and I have always loved it.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say something good about it, but if you have hair issues this is not the answer.</li>
            <li> Good luck, I warned you.</li>
            <li> This did not do a good job on my course hair.</li>
            <li> good news</li>
            <li> Its true!!!</li>
            <li> I like to feel clean shaven at all times so a razor or hair removal cream works best for me.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible invention as so many people know who have battled unwanted hair for so many years, plus we can use it in the privacy of our own home!</li>
            <li> The results have been great and my man loves that I always have a smooth body!</li>
            <li> but I am happy that hopefully by summer I&#x27;ll be hair free and saving myself time in the shower so I can hit the beach!</li>
            <li> So...if I could win one, then I would try it:)</li>
            <li> Electrolysis isn&#x27;t perfect either, but has a better batting-average for many in terms of permanent hair reduction, especially on light hairs (which the laser cannot adequately address).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> Much better!</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic - won&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love my no!no!  </li>
            <li> I love this NO!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> more like yes!yes!</li>
            <li> and I still had to tweeze most of the chin hair off!  </li>
            <li> a man!&lt;br /&gt;I love my &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Unit works great easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is too much money to part with on the off chance you may lose maybe 10 hairs !!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;you can really smell when it is working,, doing its job and burning off the hair !!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for virgin and fine hair.se the highest setting on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> This product is great for virgin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> Sounded like a great product and it had a free return policy if I did not like the product.  </li>
            <li> but once you use it and it smooths out they work amazingly in conjunction with the NO NO.</li>
            <li> No! will never give you any kind of permanent or even helpful result.</li>
            <li> No! will never give you any kind of permanent or even helpful result.</li>
            <li> in law discovered that it does work (kind of)</li>
            <li> Series Deluxe Hair Removal Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It kind of varies with me.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star to be honest.  </li>
            <li> the No No! I was thrilled to see it and couldn&#x27;t wait to order one.</li>
            <li> So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number.</li>
            <li> Representatives will not divulge that kind of information.</li>
            <li> and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I gave it an honest try.  </li>
            <li> I am loving my no no hair removal system....</li>
            <li> I began to see great results, I have a lot of body hair and facial hair (for a girl) and this has been awesome.</li>
            <li> nice friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was a gift, and they liked it.</li>
            <li> I have no way to contact any kind of customer service or support.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all effective at all.  </li>
            <li> I really gave it the best effort I could</li>
            <li> I used to see good and convincing reviews on TV</li>
            <li> and it is still good for a lot more uses.</li>
            <li> The device gets warm, smells like it&#x27;s burning the hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes it very nicely leaving a nice smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> While it does seem to remove maybe 80-90% of the hair on my arms, which is a success for me!!!</li>
            <li> Yeah, hoped for a good product, sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Should have know it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I was told that this product would give me great, not to mention quick, results.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to travel with...</li>
            <li> and it’s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> No Pain just a very light warm</li>
            <li> &quot; colored, fairly dense, if fine hair.</li>
            <li> does not even do a good job on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin is VERY fair, so it shows really quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WhenI telephoned No No for a refund I was greeted by a pleasant, friendly voice but this changed somewhat when I told her the No No was rubbish</li>
            <li> it would work perfectly as advertised, however the price point is probably more than a bit high to sell for that</li>
            <li> but so far, i am impressed</li>
            <li> but so far, i am impressed</li>
            <li> I am still in my 90 day trial but so far it works and great!</li>
            <li> (Although I currently own about 8 (yes 8) devices that claim to remove all hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am satisfied, because it is effective at removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , there is a much more cost effective solution out there.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an effective home use hair removal system and for the first time  I am truly happy.</li>
            <li> System\\&quot; which is REAL laser hair removal you can do at home and is much more effective!!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my wife and she has been very happy with how easy it works and that the results are real.</li>
            <li> I bought it as I have very fine hair along my jawline which I wanted to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine peach fuzz on my face, this was why I wanted the No</li>
            <li> The hair does not come offf as easy as the commercials say they do !</li>
            <li> I have used one before and it breaks me out - so what I have found successful is to do a treatment and then wash with a mild soap, then moisturize.</li>
            <li> I strongly urge anyone not to buy this product - it&#x27;s a NO!</li>
            <li> It takes many, many, many passes with the No!No!</li>
            <li> I thought it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I guess this is just a reminder that when something sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li> If it looks too good to be true.....</li>
            <li> Also, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I notice very smooth and even baby like skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some real junk off the TV over the years and had some true nightmares with customer services of those products trying to get a refund, so I have a good knowledge of this!!!</li>
            <li> It sounded so fantastic and convincing!</li>
            <li> huge mistake!</li>
            <li> Another gem in an outstanding series.</li>
            <li> I have never been so pleased with a hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I would be more okay</li>
            <li> I thought surely someone is going to help me)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tweeze any more and I feel it is better.</li>
            <li> However, we wanted to give it more time and kept using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I see it more on TV since its coming Christmas..</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone that has to get rid of hair all the time and find themselves not being able to wear what they want to that day because they forgot to shave.</li>
            <li> is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of face, this may not be the best thing for people with a lot of facial hair.</li>
            <li> SO JUST ONE MORE SCAM&lt;</li>
            <li> You can get better results from masking tape.</li>
            <li> The NoNo is cute, painless, and will get rid of hair.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> You should be able to find them at the top of the page under the product image.</li>
            <li> waited more than two weeks</li>
            <li> , you took my money in April and after so many iterations, I still don&#x27;t have any working nono in my possession, it is not my fault your colleague did not record our conversation in the system.  </li>
            <li> They are running a fraudulent business and taking advantage of innocent citizens.n to the tapes and find out what he promised you</li>
            <li> They are running a fraudulent business and taking advantage of innocent citizens.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product,at a higher price than I liked, and it didn&#x27;t work from day one!</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;ll be as pleased with the results as I have been since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Never was I asked if I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I started on my forearms before using on my face to make sure I knew what I was doing.</li>
            <li> are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  </li>
            <li> So, do some models break more than others?</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>
            <li> sure it burned some hair</li>
            <li> Sincerely Debra Wolfgang</li>
            <li> sounds like i can use my machete and still remove more hair than this unit.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I read the reviews before I made a purchase.</li>
            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never started using this as there is no way out now because there is so much more hair growing than when I started using this.  </li>
            <li> love it and reccommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It says it doesn&#x27;t create stubble, but it sure DOES.</li>
            <li> thinking  any help is better  than  nothing.</li>
            <li> You would get better results from a .99 cent bic lighter.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I have helped out so many people with my post, from having to experience what I did with that company.</li>
            <li> I am just glad that I am out of that situation.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I have helped out so many people with my post, from having to experience what I did with that company.</li>
            <li> I am just glad that I am out of that situation.</li>
            <li> I should have been more pro-active.  </li>
            <li> Love the buffing pads too&amp; the Smooyhing lotion.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT:))))</li>
            <li> It did take most of the hair off my legs, so</li>
            <li> I will let you know if it works ok.  </li>
            <li> For the money THIS is a much better option.</li>
            <li> Or better yet, investigate old-fashioned electrolysis.  </li>
            <li> It is safe on darker skin.</li>
            <li> I am glad I went ahead and purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I gave up and bought an epilator which works much better.</li>
            <li> Be SURE TO READ the description on Amazon with this NONO.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please save your money, find a laser hair removal place and go there, most of them offer payment options.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker and more stubborn.  </li>
            <li> I used it more than recommended and nothing.</li>
            <li> a razor does a better job</li>
            <li> I do use it every 4 to 6 weeks as it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> works on my face but have never been able to get it work on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I love using it on my arms and legs</li>
            <li> I guess it is okay under arms and on legs if you don&#x27;t care about stubble, but if you do forget buying this.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> The longer I have done it the better results I get.  </li>
            <li> I really love this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when you do it sincerely works.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I can see that I better work overtime</li>
            <li> I am sure that you get it.</li>
            <li> You will be better off running a pencil over the area because no hair will disappear.</li>
            <li> My sex life went from healthy to non existent.</li>
            <li> My confidence is gone and my lack of sexual activity has caused me to be a nightmare to be around.</li>
            <li> Believe me you;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> I thought they knew better,.</li>
            <li> this is my conclusion; MOST TV products (which I call the $19.95 TV Scams) are junk, just like this.</li>
            <li> I checked to make sure she was using it correctly</li>
            <li> how many times you go over the area.</li>
            <li> I was talked into ordering MORE blades and to keep trying.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the No No, be sure you understand what IS</li>
            <li> You do need to be able to deal with the smell of burning hair.</li>
            <li> but I am looking to it and getting much better.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters and they love it.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on Lasher /or Wax treatments you will be better off.</li>
            <li> ask if the $1500 - $2500 neighborhood spa quality gear would be a better investment.</li>
            <li> but if you think you&#x27;re going to have silky smooth legs.... forget about it !  </li>
            <li> If you are debating on purchasing this product, check out Radiancy on BBB and it will make you NOT want it :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> and I got the runaround so many times that I had to threaten a supervisor with reporting them to the BBB to get my refund.</li>
            <li> Also everytime I asked a question he would just say your gonna love it, blah blah and would avoid the question</li>
            <li> Crappy product, crappy return policy, and crappy sales department!gave it more of a chance</li>
            <li> but it is certainly better than getting burnt.</li>
            <li> how many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all in all its OK.  </li>
            <li> If you try this product do not keep for the recomended time to try or you will not be able to return.&lt;br /&gt;Jeff</li>
            <li> reputable company the delivers a quality product would EVER create a return policy like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I went through the checkout process it NEVER said anything about more</li>
            <li> I tried using for 10 months would be better and quicker running a razor over my legs.</li>
            <li> When they say &amp;#34;Imagine being able to go weeks without shaving&amp;#34; they should say &amp;#34;Imagine because the reality will not match&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box it came in would probably do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you may have to explore the vagaries of the credit card company you&#x27;ve chosen to use, but hey, it&#x27;s going to be a lot more reliable/reasonable than the product&#x27;s representatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll bet it works in the case of many products, too:  </li>
            <li> and I have way more hairs than when I started.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was pleased.</li>
            <li> They should add \\&quot; more than 12 weeks, in perpetuity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After many years of fighting hair removal from areas that I didn&#x27;t want there to be.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I am not at all satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> I do not even think about them any more...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This device was more like a torture device than a healthcare/beauty</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe a fellow user on this site can clue me in.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m just waving a magic wand across my hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I am so pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> Most med spas offer discounts and financing</li>
            <li> This may be one of the most over -rated items</li>
            <li> so Im quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> so I called to make sure that I didn&#x27;t order the No No</li>
            <li> You will get better results and save a ton of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how in the world they were able to have off some guys hair on his arm in 3 swipes</li>
            <li> , figured I just needed to work it more.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied...</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Better results.</li>
            <li> So glad I checked the reviews I dont have $300 too</li>
            <li> can still see peach fuzz and have gone over it so many times that my face feels burned.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you just love frustration.  </li>
            <li> Ok - I admit it.  </li>
            <li> Why so many infomercials?</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to be able to quit shaving and because I&#x27;m not overly tolerant of pain</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I mostly leave them alone.</li>
            <li> They look amazingly better than they did when I started.</li>
            <li> feel okay.</li>
            <li> They look amazingly better than they did when I started.</li>
            <li> feel okay.</li>
            <li> Most of the chin hair stayed on my chin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper in the end and works a lot better.  </li>
            <li> it seems ok</li>
            <li> I called after about 3 mo. of use, and, they kept telling me it didn&#x27;t work on my legs because I had to replace the tips more often.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps trimmed 20% more.</li>
            <li> It looked magical, like something a magical wizard  might use in a Harry Potter movie</li>
            <li> So I decided it was time to put this magical laser beam wonder to the test.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most cats are dicks IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you already have the misfortune of owning one, join me in complaining to the FCC and the better business bureau.</li>
            <li> am so glad to get to rate it because it has ben on my mind what i should</li>
            <li> Told her to read some reviews and let me know for sure if she still wanted it.</li>
            <li> When it is working, I love it.</li>
            <li> and she said sure.</li>
            <li> Able to return</li>
            <li> My Mom owns the no no hair series and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> and it gets it better then</li>
            <li> and she says that it works better than razors for her</li>
            <li> and this works much better and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to an epilator I do like this item better.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, while buffing or shaving over the top.</li>
            <li> Could be a better product for the money.</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;m not 100% pleased.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> None of the panelists said they’d want to buy the device, though some described it as “cute.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it, it took forever!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my</li>
            <li> I did everything I was suppose to do, and had been very excited when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was kind of excited, i said what the hey</li>
            <li> After much practice I have been able to use it fairly successfully on my face, although, it does not get it as close to the skin as I would like.</li>
            <li> I made my mom buy this for me with hopes that it would be a miracle worker, and though it was pretty good, im</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been kind of full on the arms.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Serves me right for falling for something that seemed too good to be true!  </li>
            <li> I purchased my No No for use on some fine facial hair and have had wonderful response.</li>
            <li> was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li> was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li> I tried this out, because the infomercial made it seem so easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the process leaves the treated area smooth!  </li>
            <li> I get fantastic results every time - VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I get fantastic results every time - VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Removes fine hair OK, but will not do anything to course hair.....</li>
            <li> Have done two sessions on my face and am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I used my device so carefully and still have it in perfect working condition, don&#x27;t know what to do with it now!</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> I am just buying replacement tips now, and if you really want a good deal on those you can get them on ebay 3 for 15.</li>
            <li> I am just buying replacement tips now, and if you really want a good deal on those you can get them on ebay 3 for 15.</li>
            <li> good, and since it&#x27;s wireless, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of people I was very hopeful and I gave it a fair shot</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write a review, but I wanted to get the word out in my own way.  </li>
            <li> It worked fairly well on my arms and face where the hair is much fairer and finer...</li>
            <li> Ya right!!</li>
            <li> Thought the claims on this product were too good to be true, and I was right.  </li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t believe the ads, but it is all true!  </li>
            <li> However, I found their Customer Service to be about the best as any other Customer Service Dep&#x27;t I&#x27;ve dealt with.  </li>
            <li> You need to give it the full trial period like anything else to know if it works for you or not!</li>
            <li> I like the original better</li>
            <li> I think that I spend 50 dollars easily though on waxing, razors, and shaving creams</li>
            <li> I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy.</li>
            <li> So easy.  </li>
            <li> was and that is the buffer wears out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up so easily, this method does work quite well.</li>
            <li> sure you clean the device after using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions are easy to follow, comes with two sets of heads</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall,this is a good product and will work if you are dilligent and follow the directions, and if you are realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li> Overall,this is a good product and will work if you are dilligent and follow the directions, and if you are realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li> I strongly don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest saving your money and go another route.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the directions - the burned hair smell is strong, but after 2 months 90% of the hair is still there.</li>
            <li> -Thought I was waiting to be sure I got the full refund</li>
            <li> If they had a product that was effective they would not shy away from saying so.</li>
            <li> First indication all might not be well is reading word for word NoNo&#x27;s own poop!&lt;br /&gt;Busy</li>
            <li> and I liked it at first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of like when you first learned to shave your legs with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s best on light skin with dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my face and arms and the hair is now fine.  </li>
            <li> Keep your money, you can buy the best shaver for less.</li>
            <li> daughter has really fine blond hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave a fine stubble which one must buff with the pad to achieve</li>
            <li> my daughter, whom I purchased it for says she loves it and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> That should have worked out fine.</li>
            <li> basically cost me $25 to try out a incredibly time consuming product that I knew I didn&#x27;t want the minute I unpacked it and read the full story about it - it&#x27;s quite different than the story they tell on tv.</li>
            <li> So if you have fine hair,this will work for you but if not,then I wouldn&#x27;t advise trying it.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to recommend this fine product to a friend.</li>
            <li> you use it one because your hair is less and thinner and two because you&#x27;ve learned the perfect speed</li>
            <li> By fine</li>
            <li> Another plus is that makeup looks nicer as there isn&#x27;t any fine hair for makeup to cling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it will cut/burn/trim any fine hair on the legs and thighs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had this device been sold to trim peach fuzz or fine hair</li>
            <li> I live somewhere warm and have two kids, so the longer I can go between shaves, the more time I have to enjoy my coffee in the AM!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So even though I don&#x27;t usually fall for \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; hypes, I bought the No No! I knew I&#x27;d not be able to return it because I knew it would take me longer than most to get the stubborn hairs off my face.</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> company is  using deception to get you money and is  a HUGE RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in got light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the almost $300.00 price, more like $3...</li>
            <li> oh and they tell you it comes with a free case valued at $50</li>
            <li> (I tried laser treatment and those bolts of light stung.)</li>
            <li> Like I said before, one application is not going to leave you hair free.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the smell is not unbearable.</li>
            <li> Fortunately this issue was resolved after one call but the fact that a collection notice was generated was unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> Vaseline works wonders and I wake up with a smooth and even complexion.</li>
            <li> Vaseline works wonders and I wake up with a smooth and even complexion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on his back yet, but I do believe it will work great</li>
            <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no.</li>
            <li> I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...</li>
            <li> but it was the buffer that removed hairs and made my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased 2 packs of replacement tips on a buy one get one free offer</li>
            <li> I waited my 45 days and then called to get my free shipping label to return the product.  </li>
            <li> I am completely happy with it&#x27;s progress and it has only been 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> I was happy when I came back from Thanksgivivg that it was in my mailbox.  </li>
            <li> It works great for facial hair, but the legs take forever.</li>
            <li> I notice the result is like a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that there are still companies out there trying to make money off people selling products that do nothing, and it&#x27;s not like this is a cheap product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never did I have smooth legs or anything else smooth for that matter.</li>
            <li> It does not give you smooth results if you use it once.  </li>
            <li> My neck and face are virtually fur free.</li>
            <li> I have smooth nick-free skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the treatment level goes to the highest setting on its own, no matter how gently I glide it over my face.  </li>
            <li> and I find the equipment won&#x27;t hold a charge and the laser light doesn&#x27;t come on with either head....</li>
            <li> My review will sound a lot like the others on here.  </li>
            <li> no E-mail was available where I could verify it was received.</li>
            <li> how important hair removal is to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> My mom got the free trial and it doesn&#x27;t even work at all.</li>
            <li> She has not used a razor in over 2 years and she has silky smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I would give it a -5 stars if this option was available.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you have to do it two or three times in one area to achieve the smooth result.</li>
            <li> light and love&lt;</li>
            <li> The buffing thing takes the hair off and makes the skin feel smooth...</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone for honest reviews.  </li>
            <li> I never achieved the smooth, hairless skin promised in the commercials, and I have used it for a year now.</li>
            <li> That would just make more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> advice is therefore don&#x27;t buy one, unless you are happy to pay £200 per 13 months, if necessary.</li>
            <li> My stomach is now smooth and hairless and my chest is getting there</li>
            <li> I followed their instructions to use it twice a week on the area (a lot of light blond hair on my face--hormonal) for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Replaced thermicon and they are noy cheap.</li>
            <li> however it might be faster to lightly singe your unwanted&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs as often as I used to, but if I want to be stubble free and smooth, I do.  </li>
            <li> and it would come with free shipping and everything</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it; nothing has been invented yet that will get your skin as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li> However, they said if I wanted to buy another charger they gave me a free shipping discount.</li>
            <li> You need advanced technology to remove hair not this mickey mouse product.  </li>
            <li> make a great Christmas present</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and haven&#x27;t used a razor at all, if you follow the instructions properly and use it correctly it works great.</li>
            <li> It was so encouraging to me to have a smooth hairless face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth glide on that area either.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I had more success with the prescription Vaniqa (approx.</li>
            <li> The machine itself was really cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I used to use smooth away all the time instead of a razor before they stopped selling them in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li> I got it two weeksago and the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li> so I will never be hair free.</li>
            <li> It seems like it works because you smell the hair burning and see a light pulse which makes it seem like its getting deeper</li>
            <li> Great item fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> The buffing pads are only good for ONE use - I used them more than once</li>
            <li> The buffing pads are only good for ONE use - I used them more than once</li>
            <li> Good ole fashioned waxing on a regular basis works a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> It worked really good on soft hairs</li>
            <li> But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure i was doing it right.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m hoping that someday it will rid me of most of the hair, but right now, I could still shave my legs (and sometimes do, depending on where I&#x27;m going/what I&#x27;m wearing).  </li>
            <li> But on longer flat areas it works great.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but have had a great deal of trouble with it.</li>
            <li> i used the tips i got with the first one for many hours</li>
            <li> i used the tips i got with the first one for many hours</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find a product that guaranteed hair removal.</li>
            <li> If you have the time, the investment is worth it!</li>
            <li> I am getting excited to see what happens in another month.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order the nono......</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this hair removal device for a gift...</li>
            <li> My unit was NOT user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my NoNo Pro.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I tried my nono today for the first time,and I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> First of all they should tell you there are additional costs for more of the pads, lotion, and the replacement heads</li>
            <li> Also, I saw nothing in the ads that it would take 45-60 days to see significant results.  </li>
            <li> The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty.</li>
            <li> At first did not like it - after useing it 2weeks,&lt;br /&gt;Learn how it works, love it</li>
            <li> I returned mine and they shorted me $12.95 for the original shipping.  </li>
            <li> It was the newer version of 5-0 not the original with Jack Lord.</li>
            <li> Will know better after the first six weeks is up</li>
            <li> It takes longer when you are first learning to use and it gets quicker the more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own will not slow your hair growth.</li>
            <li> The area is clean, and you either use the buffer or scrub the area after.</li>
            <li> When my hair started growing back it was thicker and more abundant than before.</li>
            <li> Clean the blade wire often - use the brush or blow it out with your breath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go to a real spa laser place, most have January and Feb. specials ,like buy underarms, get bikini area free.....</li>
            <li> My arms stay clean for a month.</li>
            <li> My arms stay clean for a month.</li>
            <li> ladies, even in fall and winter you really want to feel that smooth sexy \\&quot;just shaved\\&quot; feeling on your legs.</li>
            <li> Just use it, charge it, clean it, change tips.  </li>
            <li> I am really thinking of a product lawsuit as i have spent lots of money and time trying to recover my once before flawless skin.</li>
            <li> it took over an hour to get to &#x27;almost clean shaven &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li> I prepared my face the way the demo said, clean, no moisturizer, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the smell of burnt hair isn&#x27;t pleasant, but unwanted facial hair is.  </li>
            <li> Have not been able to get any positive results with it.  </li>
            <li> It works ok on fine hair which is why they advertise it mainly on your arms</li>
            <li> I asked if there was a certain hair type it works better for</li>
            <li> He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...</li>
            <li> This device is an out right scam!</li>
            <li> The main draw for me was that it&#x27;s pain free, and I would just love not to have to go waxing anymore.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about 2 months as they say it takes over 45 days to see the full effects.</li>
            <li> I even told them I would be reporting them to Better Business, that really made them hang up..</li>
            <li> : They tell you you&#x27;ll get a full refund on your purchase</li>
            <li> a full refund&lt;br /&gt;SCAM 4</li>
            <li> This time I PAID IN FULL because I received a coupon via e-mail for a reduced price if paid in full.</li>
            <li> so my word isn&#x27;t good enough.  </li>
            <li> and, although I got burned many times, I kept trying because I really wanted it to do what they advertise.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had paid more attention to the reviews because if I had my time over, I would never have begun using the product.  </li>
            <li> She said I would not be entitled to my full money refund.</li>
            <li> That was the quote from a Nono call centre person when I rang to return the Nono with their 60 day full refund time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not to mention the free trial ends prior to the time they actually suggest you use it to get the best results.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off going out to get a real laser treatment than buy this.</li>
            <li> I still have a face full of hair.</li>
            <li> But I have adjusted how fast I move it over my skin, so that the highest treatment level seems to be okay for my skin.</li>
            <li> No No provided, they received the return package in about 5 days, and my full refund was credited to my account 5 days after they received the return.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a full two months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying it because it&#x27;s true and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some real junk off the TV over the years and had some true nightmares with customer services of those products trying to get a refund, so I have a good knowledge of this!!!me to the conclusion that most of these TV sold products are sold ONLY for the shipping &amp; handling charges as a profit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying it because it&#x27;s true and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to keep it for a minimum of 45 days, but return it by 60 days after delivery in order to get a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a full two months</li>
            <li> The manufacture claims no part, &amp;#34;HSN&amp;#34;  although nice on the phone dismissed&lt;br /&gt;any refund and told me to call &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;  directly.</li>
            <li> So, I suppose initially, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Thanks for all your outstanding service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do some research and find a good quality product that actually works.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t get a full refund.</li>
            <li> I demanded a refund and they did not even refund me the full amount.</li>
            <li> The BBB is full of complaints.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of negative reviews out there, but my wife says it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> IS TRUE.</li>
            <li> so you get a full refund.</li>
            <li> And be warned, do you all know that its full price is $264</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;m going to get my full return price either.</li>
            <li> It smells like burnt hair when you use it and good luck trying to remove any hair without wearing the area out with multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of heat when using the product, and my skin feel tingly for a good ten minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do as good as the so-called customers who try it out on the commercial  </li>
            <li> love the feeling of the heat from the wire on my skin - very soothing and relaxing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful</li>
            <li> Full refund</li>
            <li> It took forever to get my refund though, so I called Discover, and within 3 days of that call, I had a full refund.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many times I have walked around all day with burn marks on my face thanks to this thing.</li>
            <li> is so much faster and so much better.</li>
            <li> Their buffer was only good for one use on my legs, face, underarms and it already wasn&#x27;t working as well after doing my legs before I even did anything else.</li>
            <li> You will much happier and have a lot more money in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will much happier and have a lot more money in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so far it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Both the hair and pro series use the same tips so if you own this one and want to upgrade to the pro you don&#x27;t have to buy more tips right away.</li>
            <li> i called the first time, the customer service person STRONGLY recommends that you use the lotion (which is formulated to also help stop/slow hair growth).</li>
            <li> But that skin is completely hair free and very smooth.</li>
            <li> simple, effective, painless, and quick!</li>
            <li> it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the device because it was working on the fine hair on my face that bothered me so very much.</li>
            <li> It most certainly does not feel like a fresh wax.  </li>
            <li> The buffer worked the first time I used it and got most of the stubble off ,but hasn&#x27;t worked very much since.</li>
            <li> the device was only able to cut the top - about 1/3 - of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i waited because the older model was corded</li>
            <li> First of all, as with many info - mercial type products, it is not going to work exactly how you see on TV.</li>
            <li> They want a quick fix like with waxing or whatever.</li>
            <li> They want a quick fix like with waxing or whatever.</li>
            <li> faster, easier, and  virtually pain free, but I&#x27;m smooth for a much longer time then I had shaved or waxed</li>
            <li> Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn.</li>
            <li> One quick swipe and your done?</li>
            <li> I have been doing it for a few years now and it seems to me that if a product gets good reviews on Amazon by Amazon&#x27;s Members, I am always satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been doing it for a few years now and it seems to me that if a product gets good reviews on Amazon by Amazon&#x27;s Members, I am always satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad case for so many people who really just want to know a product works and is worth buying.  </li>
            <li> looked like a mild floor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> No scarring, quick.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago &amp; it did &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; hairs away in an adequate manner.  </li>
            <li> company thrives on the unsuspecting buyers that don&#x27;t research the product -- and getting a resolution through a product return and refund can quickly become a nightmare with one roadblock after another.</li>
            <li> Have had no problems, wife and daughters love it, would highly recomend.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> a couple days ago, and the very first time I used it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right after using it the first time, my wife confirmed the product didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product only works on very fine fuss hair, it doesn&#x27;t work on corse arm or leg hair, or anywhere else with strong hair.  </li>
            <li> I spent $20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s having successful electrolysis treatments for removal of body hair.</li>
            <li> I spent $20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s having successful electrolysis treatments for removal of body hair.</li>
            <li> It would only singe the very top of it.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the results I achieved on the very first try.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the results I achieved on the very first try.</li>
            <li> So after trying it for a month and talking to friends that love it, I called and they sent me a new tip.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommended I buy more tips (the ones I had on the machine were new)</li>
            <li> explained to him how my husband&#x27;s family tragically experienced 4 deaths in the previous two weeks, thus I had been out of the state and missed the return deadline</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I loved it &amp; by day 2 I had already done my entire bikini line.  </li>
            <li> for anyone that wants to purchase this - check out the Better Business Bureau website first.</li>
            <li> first, I want to thank all the reviewers who have taken the time to review the product and save me loads of money and angst!  </li>
            <li> At first the customer service rep was friendly and concerned</li>
            <li> this was a gift and at first she was excited, but after using it for over a month it didnt meet her expectations at all.</li>
            <li> i think the old ones were something like $25.00 each, but the new ones are like 3 for $25, and customer service told me that they have a club, where if you sign up you can get tips, a buffer and the lotion for $29.00, which is a good deal considering the lotion sell for almost $50.00 by itself.  </li>

            <li> This works, but like most products it takes effort, and you have to have a certain type of hair and use it a certain type of way in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have not had much luck with any hair that is not so fine like on my thighs or arms.  </li>
            <li> It burns fine hair very close to and at the skin line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for fine facial hair, but not for legs.</li>
            <li> If you, or someone you know, gets in close to your face after using this on fine hair the feeling is soft and smooth skin, nothing else.</li>
            <li> so they flash it real fast and then flash something like, &amp;#34;results</li>
            <li> so they flash it real fast and then flash something like, &amp;#34;results</li>
            <li> Literally, a waste of time and money and a great source of frustration.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you look for a med spa that can give you pain free real results.</li>
            <li> you really want results, then go get a Brazilian wax or just stick to a $.99 razor blade and cheap shaving cream..</li>
            <li> so I got the smooth away kit from amazon (actually when you get it it is called silky smooth but is listed as smooth away)</li>
            <li> I was literally surprised to see the commercials and comments of people whose hair is magically burned away or whatever they claim happens.</li>
            <li> it was such a good investment and saved me so much money waxing and shaving....</li>
            <li> I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the money or hassle.</li>
            <li> Not in a way that&#x27;s actually useful.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are clear on the number of days that you MUST KEEP the NoNo before you can return it for a refund&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> The nono is a useful devise in the war on unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think after I complete 6 weeks, they will be smooth and fabulous.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I think after I complete 6 weeks, they will be smooth and fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I will update if I ever get success.</li>
            <li> So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> If it continues to work this well then the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it once you start using it.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the amount of money they charge for it?</li>
            <li> I did read the directions, but, as they say, a pic is worth a thousand words</li>
            <li> It does take time but is worth the time.  </li>
            <li> I have had it almost a year and have not had much success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and I can only speak about my own experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item because I wanted to get rid of facial hair and it would also be nice not to have to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be THRILLED with such a result.</li>
            <li> No product is worth buying if they treat their customers like that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d imagine the company investors and owners laugh all the way to the bank -- with no shame whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I had carefully saved everything (packaging, box, etc.) and kept everything in good condition</li>
            <li> Would not suggest anybody spend this kind of money on something that don&#x27;t last any longer than the warreny</li>
            <li> me, it was well worth the purchase price and time involved.</li>
            <li> but no one wants to pay that much for a product and not be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> She and her parents tried the product and felt it to be not at all useful.  </li>
            <li> on my legs for quite some time - over 6 months worth of time.</li>
            <li> rarely get burned.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I thought, \\&quot;cool, this is gonna work!\\</li>
            <li> It takes far longer to use than a razor and the results are nothing more than a scorched hair smell.  </li>
            <li> After reading about refund disasters, their so-called &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; and most importantly the TRUTH about this product performance as opposed to their advertising and marketing hype, I am definitely declaring NO!</li>
            <li> They just instruct you make sure the blue light stays on while gliding.</li>
            <li> , these areas have never been so hair free or smooth; not even professional waxing accomplishes this.</li>
            <li> This is false advertisement at its best.</li>
            <li> easy to use and effective in dark hairs.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> so ask about that before you commit and also do your research on the med spa before you plop down a ton of money, remember not all lasers are built equal and the more the laser costs the safer and more effective the treatment will be.</li>
            <li> Those who have reviewed the NoNo poorly have reviewed many items on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware!!!</li>
            <li> concept good but product extremely lacking.  </li>
            <li> Remember the old saying &amp;#34; if it sounds to good to be true it probably is&amp;#34;  This definitely applies to this product.</li>
            <li> On the other hand I have tried some infomercial products with surprising results.</li>
            <li> Right now, I am using it about 2x&#x27;s a week on areas that are hairier (legs, underarms).</li>
            <li> Returned item right away.</li>
            <li> (Surprise surprise, right?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li> just right it will  not remove hair.</li>
            <li> Then I went right at it and started using it.</li>
            <li> so of course I wasn&#x27;t going to learn it right away.</li>
            <li> It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get close enough,perhaps if set right it might work.  </li>
            <li> The unit broke right after the warranty period was up.  </li>
            <li> The hair is not removed right away</li>
            <li> I am going to call my credit card company right now and dispute the charges,</li>
            <li> The hair has to be just the right length for it to work and even then its hit and miss.</li>
            <li> She did not use it right away until she could read the instructions.</li>
            <li> A LOT FOR WORK AND THROW IT RIGHT IN MY CARRY ON.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the nono for 15 months, it quit working right.</li>
            <li> The heat passes right over the bumps with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t holding it just right, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it right before you have company coming - everyone will wonder about the stench in your home - not</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t burn it right away.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re usually right about these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re usually right about these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
            <li> The springs appeared to have the right tension and pitch.</li>
            <li> If I was getting ready for a hot date, I would probably use Nair or something to be truly hair free.</li>
            <li> If I was getting ready for a hot date, I would probably use Nair or something to be truly hair free.</li>
            <li> Especially since they will charge you the full price before you can return it and you will not be able to get a refund for the 45-60 days plus</li>
            <li> Especially since they will charge you the full price before you can return it and you will not be able to get a refund for the 45-60 days plus</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product works for less than one in four users that leave feedback and many more wind up with burned skin.</li>
            <li> think I am going to report them to Attorney General&#x27;s office and Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li> think I am going to report them to Attorney General&#x27;s office and Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li> I have fair hair on my legs and it did not do anything but burn the hair down temporarily into stubble.</li>
            <li> It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
            <li> buying for peach fuzz (very baby fine hair) - then the No-No may have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;If buying for very course hair - not going to work.</li>
            <li> Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take off very fine hair but this still comes back.</li>
            <li> hair is very fine and blonde..</li>
            <li> I charged the little guy for the 5 hours required, and started on my legs and to be honest that sparking sound scared me</li>
            <li> I have certainly changed my mind!</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered right from the NoNo website...but wanted to put a review on Amazon because of the volume of customers that shop on here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A BIG waste of money, Norelco body groomer works excellent!</li>
            <li> With laser hair removal I use laser light in the 810nm wave legnth which is red light.</li>
            <li> It is not as easy to use as instructed, but thus far I am liking it.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t burn out your tip as quickly by having to use it so much just to do it.</li>
            <li> At this point I have no illusions that my fine hair will go away or that I will be able to repurpose my my pretty pink tweezers into a framed artwork piece on antique beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember if it sounds too good to be true it usually is.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before I bought the product, they sounded very compelling actually, so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate it very much.  </li>
            <li> The seller approved return and credited my account within a very reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> I saw the commercials for the &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;,,, and boy do they sound convincing,,, I was thinking of buying 2 of them for my daughter and my wife for Christmas,,, I will find other options now that I have read these posts....</li>
            <li> He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it never entirely gets the skin clean and hair free.</li>
            <li> Works great on legs, but the face is hard.</li>
            <li> I used my wife&#x27;s no no pro IV (most powerful model requires a large outside  240 volt diesel generator)  </li>
            <li> You are supposed to avoid lip area, but is kind of hard to do since it fills up that whole space from under nose to top of lip.  </li>
            <li> I had to hold it at the exact angle it wanted, move it at the exact speed, the exact pressure, and it seemed to turn itself off as it neared denser areas of hair</li>
            <li> it gets hot, sparks and smells like burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Eventually we returned the product, and hopefully the \\&quot;money back guaranteed\\&quot; will work better than the product itself - still waiting for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a \\&quot;Hair Removal Device\\&quot; is pretty misleading as it doesn&#x27;t remove anything.</li>
            <li> I can tell you from first hand experience that this is an outright lie.</li>
            <li> You are consistent and dilligent.</li>
            <li> On the bikini line (which I dont shave as often as legs and underarms), I noticed a change with the first application.</li>
            <li> They charged my first installment of $112&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I know the results are supposed to be better and last longer over a prolonged use..</li>
            <li> and after 60 days if you aren&#x27;t satisfied you can get your money back</li>
            <li> exactly as I had been instructed and waited for my refund.</li>
            <li> It works better on facial hair than on leg hair.</li>
            <li> I got my first NoNo about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> THANKS RADIANCY!</li>
            <li> and IF I see that my hair is not growing back after continued use for a couple of months I will be the most vocal proponent of this device on the planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I do it outside or make sure my husband isn&#x27;t home, then shower and lotion.</li>
            <li> - I do it outside or make sure my husband isn&#x27;t home, then shower and lotion.</li>
            <li> that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00.</li>
            <li> (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.)</li>
            <li> so just be aware...</li>
            <li> Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m GLAD amazon refunded me, a month later.</li>
            <li> Imagine how much money this company is raking in by selling No!</li>
            <li> I am very grateful for everyone who has taken the time to post their comments to let the rest of us know what a crappy product the No!</li>
            <li> My sister in law said to read the reviews first...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove hair the first time</li>
            <li> The first  time  </li>
            <li> you get a hot wire that burns the hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the nono exactly as it said to do so in the instructions.</li>
            <li> It clearly says that when you use the buffer you have smooth hairless skin for a while</li>
            <li> You however must use this product consistently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off just shaving them daily.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, fast growing hair on my legs, so I was impressed that it did get most of it.  </li>
            <li> I foolishly purchased this product without first checking the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Eventually i gave up and told myself that it was my first time</li>
            <li> and you have to be consistent with using it.</li>
            <li> and you are supposed to do it 3 times a week for the first six weeks.</li>
            <li> The hair did grow back alot more than I started with.</li>
            <li> Now I go to a real spa to have laser hair removed,that works, worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> I have watched two family members go through the agony (yes, real pain!)</li>
            <li> It only permanently reduces ~ 5-20% hair each time--and believe me, it&#x27;s closer to 5% for most).  </li>
            <li> After first problem that I thought I had, it was operator error</li>
            <li> This thing really works!  </li>
            <li> The first time, he made suggestions and gave me another 10 days of use.</li>
            <li> I got the first NoNo that came out.</li>
            <li> Burned myself the first time I used it, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> have come to the conclusion that most of these TV sold products are sold ONLY for the shipping &amp; handling charges as a profit.</li>
            <li> 99% of the people in those TV commercials that seem to be regular people who have bought the product, used it and are satisfied with it, ARE PAID ACTORS.</li>
            <li> 99% of the people in those TV commercials that seem to be regular people who have bought the product, used it and are satisfied with it, ARE PAID ACTORS.</li>
            <li> &quot; I used it exactly as directed, to the letter, and it did lessen the density of hair on my legs, but it never got rid of all of it.</li>
            <li> exactly what is advertised: a hair removal product --</li>
            <li> sadly not.</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used so many different types of hair removal products, laser, wax and electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I was told to wait 10 days and call back to see if they were satisfied...........</li>
            <li> I used the nono exactly as it said to do so in the instructions.</li>
            <li> It clearly says that when you use the buffer you have smooth hairless skin for a while</li>
            <li> At first the No No hair removal system worked.  </li>
            <li> First of all when I ordered this product from the nono website I received 2 confirmation emails</li>
            <li> The kid I talked to said it was his first day and lied to me about the shipping time frame and tried to talk me into cancelling my order and ordering from him.</li>
            <li> I think if the hair would have all been gone after 3-5 swipes in the same section I would have gave it more of a chance</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work the No No burnt her top lip</li>
            <li> watched multiple reviews in YouTube and read reviews on Amazon, and still most reviews were positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li> Has used exactly as suggested/</li>
            <li> and first it said it came to my house</li>
            <li> Every time I see the add in TV it gives me headache, so much lie!</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL Trying to keep the thing on is the biggest issue I had.</li>
            <li> I purchased the No!No when it was first introduced on the market.  </li>
            <li> Was able to get my money back with no issues though.</li>
            <li> is it because I have coarser facial hair than most.</li>
            <li> At first these Velvet Touch pads irritated my skin quite a lot</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> nono does take your hair away but it comes back 10 x more</li>
            <li> The first time I used the no</li>
            <li> For some reason I was charged more than the initial invoice.</li>
            <li> JUST IS A VERY LUCRATIVE GIMMICK!</li>
            <li> Very suspicious!</li>
            <li> and they are gone at the first sign of them.  </li>
            <li> I tested it on the back of my hand and it seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li> and if this thing caused burns on others than it most likely will on me...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s exactly the length on the instructions.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hair grows in cycles that last about a month so with each treatment I am able to kill between 15 to 20 % of your hair.</li>
            <li> After the first month&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li> I brought nono and the first 40 days</li>
            <li> and sure enough they had placed the order.</li>
            <li> and you are just paying the first installlment, the first time you pay, although you would think that you paid the whole price!  </li>
            <li> Wish I had sent it back, but I kept thinking I just needed to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I should have check the reviews first before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I thought I really found an answer to waxing and shaving!</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> After the initial $90 payment, there were 2 more $90 charges to be taken afterward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hot wire that cuts hair off at the surface, if it even manages to get through the hair itself.</li>
            <li> First</li>
            <li> First, it did not remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> I was able to sell it and get some of my money back.  </li>
            <li> Which is exactly what the instructions and commercials say.</li>
            <li> The first iteration the smell of burnt hair is noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure Linda is one of those &amp;#34; preppers&amp;#34;, but I can&#x27;t actually prove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son Donald saw them and enjoyed them immensely.</li>
            <li> What possessed u to think that u can remove hair with a Blue LED light!?</li>
            <li> and I am able to see the final results.</li>
            <li> item was unusable after first use, would not turn on or off.  </li>
            <li> , I followed their directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> if it will help with the thick peach fuzz on my face and neck (my epilator works great</li>
            <li> but it really hurts!).  </li>
            <li> Now I use the pro series and I have to say I like it better than the hair series because I have some coarse hair on my chin</li>
            <li> The pro series has two tips the one like the hair only it has better control</li>
            <li> With these combined tools along with an arsenal of facial and body cleansers, exfoliants, creams, lotions, oils and butters I am able to get asexy sleek appearance.</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Works OK, but not as simple as the advertisement.</li>
            <li> Make 3 more passes on the same area.</li>
            <li> I returned it and am hopeful I am able to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I am not tweezing nearly as much as I was before no!</li>
            <li> I went over these areas several times over and never was able to remove all the hair even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> The customer service is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I  was hoping this supposedly new one was better than the old one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My recommendation to anyone who wants to buy a TV product is to first check the CUSTOMER REVIEWS right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My recommendation to anyone who wants to buy a TV product is to first check the CUSTOMER REVIEWS right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i was greatly surprised to see that as i used it more and more i did not have to do any other hair removal.  </li>
            <li> … I originally bought it to remove the odd hairs on my chin but because of the size of the head I ended up with even more hairs…</li>
            <li> Also when I used it the hair on my leg was kind of long, normally I shave them every day</li>
            <li> I did burn myself many times during my first use and it made me fear my no no for a long time.</li>
            <li> First of all I was willing to go through the process and really give it a go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their description of rivals made me suspicious so turned to Amazon, to whom many thanks, and read several reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou Amazon.  </li>
            <li> also used it on the shoulders &amp; back of my furry italian husband with good results.</li>
            <li> Do this until it is smooth, you may need to wipe away the dried skin and hair off the buffer and where you are doing so that it works better and faster.</li>
            <li> Should have known that if it sounds to good to be true it is no good.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said that it feels like pressing a hot curling iron against your skin, and it certainly does feel that way when it burns.</li>
            <li> willing to sell me a new one tho!!</li>
            <li> When used every other day it helps to create a fine pallet for makeup and smooth place for tender touches and kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt less stubble doing it this way, but is is more because the hair that is removed with the No!No! wasn&#x27;t stubble type hair</li>
            <li> Mine constantly blinked the light at me--which was supposed to be an indicator that I wasn&#x27;t holding it right, or I needed to go faster or slower.  </li>
            <li> No because her No No Hair was having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li> the NoNo was painless, I decided to \\&quot;practice patience\\&quot; - a statement that I have read over and over again in all positive reviews.</li>
            <li> positive comment about</li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t remove hair but it does remove most of my peach fuzz that was getting too long</li>
            <li> Enthusiastically I bought the device straight from their web site on the 60 day trial period and used it consistently for over 3 months.</li>
            <li> I waited too long and wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li> I was so interested in no no; I felt I just absolutely had to have one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product straight from their website, I tried to be patient and give it a try, but IT DOESN&#x27;T REALLY WORK!  </li>
            <li> You also have to move Nono pretty fast otherwise</li>
            <li> Most are still as long as ever.  </li>
            <li> It would have been a full time job to complete the functions advertised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes fine hair, both light and dark.</li>
            <li> my arms are still about 95% hair free and the hair that is coming back is a lot softer, but then again there isn&#x27;t very much of it there to judge yet.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the no-no system after years of shaving and using other products that burned my skin and weren&#x27;t very effective at hair removal, as the hair just grew back.</li>
            <li> infomercial makes it look so easy and simple to use, but when you receive it the directions even tell you its going to take time to get used to ( I ordeded to save time)</li>
            <li> anyone is complaining about the ineffectiveness of the NoNo device it is surely because they are not using it correctly... if the blue light is constant, the humming sound is constant and the air smells like burning hair...</li>
            <li> Does a good enough job but takes sooooooo long (1/2 hour per leg).</li>
            <li> One good thing I can say is that the battery seems to last a long time on one charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of every single hair on my arms, but it has reduced the hair to a place that I may shave every two weeks at the most.</li>
            <li> Why I ordered it anyway is purely a mystery.</li>
            <li> I called customer service to ask for a large tip replacement.  </li>
            <li> My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The large attachment malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> No one needs to be lied to and you certainly will be if you do business with these folks.  </li>
            <li> On my legs it has worked in certain areas, but I have had to do it again and again</li>
            <li> It had to be faxed to a certain number and</li>
            <li> Make certain to re-enforce</li>
            <li> They showed a man with hairy arms removing a  large amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I had to set up an account, and then it gave me discounts off certain items that I knew I could find elsewhere for cheaper...</li>
            <li> large adapter&lt;br /&gt;Turn</li>
            <li> after the NO NO debacle so I went to the hardware store and purchased a large decorative plate hanger.</li>
            <li> I did not understand your question please resubmit a new one!!</li>
            <li> frequently it gets stuck in the on position and gets very hot</li>
            <li> It would take me hours, plural, per sitting to get any kind of result on a tiny area, and that was my first and only \\&quot;successful\\&quot; attempt.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product and it was put to use for weeks by my wife to no results, I left many emails to the company to find out they do not answer them, although this is from a contact page on their web site, I then contacted support, I was told I could not ask for refund right away as I had to continue trying the product for the major part of the trial period.</li>
            <li> I think that it MIGHT if you have fine hair, but my hair is medium to coarse.  </li>
            <li> Even with fine hair you have to go over several times and still doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> i know it was only working because it was FINE</li>
            <li> I only use the NONO on my face it works fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s No!No!&amp;#34; The TV commercial makes it look and sound like such an easy solution to long-term hair removal that will make your life easier.</li>
            <li> Works fine now that useage is regular.</li>
            <li> It does not remove hair, even fine hair, like advertised, especially if you are of Hispanic descent.  </li>
            <li> The buffer is like an extra fine sandpaper and it doesn&#x27;t hurt If you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor</li>
            <li> You have to keep the no no on a pretty steady pace when you sweep an area or it will not work.</li>
            <li> i ordered the nono and did not have very high expectations as you never know what you are going to get.  </li>
            <li> They make it sound magical, therefore I knew that actual results could never live up to their claims.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well for that fine peach fuzz on the sides of your face and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> If you only have a little hair I bet it works great.</li>
            <li> So I really had very high hopes for this product to work.</li>
            <li> READ THE SUPER SMALL FINE PRINT THAT FLASHES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN FOR 2 SECONDS!</li>
            <li> READ THE SUPER SMALL FINE PRINT THAT FLASHES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN FOR 2 SECONDS!</li>
            <li> (already too much time )</li>
            <li> as i began to use it, it started sparking and all i could smell was burning hair( who wants to smell that).</li>
            <li> It really works as all the commercials says it does...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use it in private parts, and on surfaces that aren&#x27;t smooth, or the glow wire could burn through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolute Scam.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t really noticeable.  </li>
            <li> too much work</li>
            <li> but I couldnt keep up with the appointments because they cost too much:</li>
            <li> The buffing is absolutely gentle.  </li>
            <li> So does it really work?</li>
            <li> Like I said before, the hair has to be a bit gown out for it to really work and who want&#x27;s to wait until they look like a sasquatch until they can do anything about unwanted hair?</li>
            <li> The directions say you shouldnt let the hair get much longer than stubble length.</li>
            <li> After still not seeing any real results I gave it a break to grow in to get an idea of progress and let my skin take a break.</li>
            <li> Thanks, son.....</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t log the usage, as I just keep it charged up and may use it at night while sitting at the desk, may use it on a Saturday morning, when checking my email.</li>
            <li> I really feel taken.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as fast as getting laser treatments, but, I can put in the time and effort to save the bucks.  </li>
            <li> Doctors said it was hormones and nothing I could really do about it</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance and found that my Baby Philosophy lotion works very well.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li> but the product was absolute garbage.  </li>
            <li> and i charger it overnight.what a pice a junk the blue light would not stay on.</li>
            <li> The hair is not removing very well at all.  </li>
            <li> thanks for the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have to use the buffer vigorously to get the skin smooth and then moisturise, but the hair just comes back, thicker each time.  </li>
            <li> and IT REALLY</li>
            <li> I have been through the whole gamut of trying to solve this HAIRY issue of mine.</li>
            <li> She has some darker hairs and this really takes care of them.</li>
            <li> I wish I had saved  my money for real  laser removal.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but, it tooks SO MUCH time and effort to do so, with threats of sueing them, and raising my voice.</li>
            <li> It was a very daunting experience.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but, it tooks SO MUCH time and effort to do so, with threats of sueing them, and raising my voice.</li>
            <li> It was a very daunting experience.</li>
            <li> and I could never get a close enough smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like using nare etc..</li>
            <li> it cost too much money to buy and it doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment of whether or not something is broke or malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li> It works very will</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about spending this much money on a hair removal product but the laser hair removal I was paying for was breaking the bank</li>
            <li> I really did not want to shave ...</li>
            <li> The red light kept coming on</li>
            <li> think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens</li>
            <li> Skin becomes very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would really like to try this product</li>
            <li> The whole reason these products are sold over the TV and not in stores like Home Depot, Sears or Walmart is because the scammers who sell these pieces of junk are after the Shipping &amp; Handling</li>
            <li> sell you a product for 19.95 + 12.99 s&amp;h, and I give you a second unit for free + 12.99 s&amp;h.</li>
            <li> EVEN IF EVERY BUYER RETURNS THEIR PRODUCT, I will have still made $12,784,000 on that second s&amp;h for the free unit.</li>
            <li> Not quite as fast as the commercials will lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> I still use my nono, but it really dosen&#x27;t work like they say.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> I really dislike being taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> So put your $300.00 toward real lazar treatments.</li>
            <li> How I wish laser had been available back then.</li>
            <li> How I wish laser had been available back then.</li>
            <li> Laser treatment is the only thing that works, if you have the money the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to any one it cost way to much</li>
            <li> It is growing in much slower.</li>
            <li> The hair on my arms is growing in much lighter and finer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At the beginning of October I noticed that the blue light was on continually</li>
            <li> THIS MUCH</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving my legs is much safer, quicker, and I like the no pain of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> have been sent back by people trying them for the free trial period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was really a turn off</li>
            <li> Used one and did not see any real effect to continue use.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair eventually does regrow but is much finer and easier to remove.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receving this</li>
            <li> Thanks to the NO NO</li>
            <li> My real problem is their customer service.</li>
            <li> Its very dissapointing considering how much it cost.</li>
            <li> It left me smelling like burnt skin and also when I used it, I was told it is pain free,</li>
            <li> She saw the ad on tv and was really exited about it.</li>
            <li> but I just think if people knew the whole return policy they would think twice about the trial.</li>
            <li> but I just think if people knew the whole return policy they would think twice about the trial.</li>
            <li> a pain to use, and makes the whole room smell like burnt hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> If you still want to buy find someone that alreay used it and ask if it really works.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t seem to do what it claimed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> I kept trying, but didn&#x27;t see enough of a difference to be worth more than 200 bucks and constant abrasions and scabs.</li>
            <li> This is what I had been doing for a year already, but they didn&#x27;t really care about my dilemma, and just blew me off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very to everything from soaps to razor types.</li>
            <li> The commercial didn&#x27;t mention the sound the thing makes or the burning flesh smell.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY noisy.  </li>
            <li> Its promising result was not so promising.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the performance of my No</li>
            <li> so I was really hoping it would work.  </li>
            <li> I was very patient as I waited for results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has never broken or stopped working.</li>
            <li> , I considered purchasing one, but, of course, you can&#x27;t tell much from trying a friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in 2012 and have not seen much results.</li>
            <li> I tried the nono on my arms,and now they are hair free,they were very hairy.</li>
            <li> No-no absolutely refuses to help.</li>
            <li> it really</li>
            <li> From the beginning, it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> and I still had stubble because the nono didn&#x27;t get rid of the whole length of each hair and</li>
            <li> I purchased nono straight from their website</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely zilch.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t expect fast results.</li>
            <li> I have had many clients that have used nono and have had absolutely no difference in hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> I also started using the prescription cream, &amp;#34;Vaniqa&amp;#34; which really reduced the hairs on my chin &amp; face.  </li>
            <li> They said it would take up to 6 months before you started to really see the results.  </li>
            <li> He responded, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t really care if you&#x27;re getting frustrated.&amp;#34; I hung up.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, and was convinced it would.  </li>
            <li> Your hair regrowth will definitely diminish, but it comes at the cost of never having smooth skin.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m really going to watch my credit card for the rest of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, really, really need to never order anything off TV again.</li>
            <li> The tip would get stuck in the up position with the red light on.  </li>
            <li> this is much too labor intensive for the money.  </li>
            <li> After speaking with a very polite nono representative, however, he informed me that I missed the 60 day return deadline by 7 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and all I accomplished was giving myself a headache.</li>
            <li> I bought this off HSN and tried it immediately, it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> , the whole unit doesn&#x27;t glide anymore and therefore does not even work anymore.</li>
            <li> Not so much on the face.</li>
            <li> tooo much money for this.</li>
            <li> The red light keeps coming on</li>
            <li> Very upset with this.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY enthused about it thinking it would be the thing for me.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to not have any facial hair issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago and it really does not work at all...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I can already see about  50% of my hair not returning and by spring, I shouldn&#x27;t have to use it much at all except for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fast as she was expecting to remove hair, but it functions as promised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many hours I spent using it</li>
            <li> Its a simple $2.37 kids toy that emits a light..</li>
            <li> My niece bought the newer Pro model and it seems to be working for her, so maybe it really depends on your hair type.  </li>
            <li> This really is the modern day version of snake oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So when I used it, the blue light kept on switching on and off.</li>
            <li> My mom after trying out my pro with her tips wants to upgrade to the pro.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll know what you are doing, if you haven&#x27;t the videos don&#x27;t really explain it too well</li>
            <li> and it will go so much faster</li>
            <li> and my hair is already softer and not growing in as fast as when I was using tweezers and</li>
            <li> I have smooth legs but occasional &amp;#</li>
            <li> No!No! is what it is.. a really close hair trimmer by electrical wire.</li>
            <li> Thanks again...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.  </li>
            <li> I really gotta learn how to say no.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> As I ready it to make another pass, I notice that the No</li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with this product .</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me fast.</li>
            <li> While it hurts as to be expected, these areas have never been so hair free or smooth; not even professional waxing accomplishes this.</li>
            <li> back to my old epilady trio hair remover and sugar wax for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Laser may be a better option but have not tried because of skin discoloration being reported.</li>
            <li> She thought it&#x27;d be a good way to delicately deal with the embarrassing issue.</li>
            <li> Go waste your own $300 and find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife is not stupid and only had the No No on its lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> So at 2:45 this afternoon I called back again as suggested to make sure that the order was canceled and this young lady told me that they already shipped the product.</li>
            <li> in conjunction with the Tria laser (which I also own), using the No No to keep the appearance of my arms nice and perhaps weakening future hair growth while keeping the hair short enough to use the Tria laser properly.</li>

            <li> So this product looked really good, and I couldn&#x27;t find any negative reviews, but didn&#x27;t think to look here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used a dematologist with a new chilled laser that has removed a great number of my sort of light/sort of dark facial hair.</li>

            <li> me warn you- STEER CLEAR!!!</li>
            <li> i usually no no sitting on the bed watching tv and since it burns the hair away, there are no little hairs to clean up.  </li>
            <li> , wife could not get the hang of how to use it at first, then I tried, the blue laser light came on and I almost evacuated my bowels, it scared it nearly out of me!  </li>
            <li> you live in az and are interested in laser hair removal</li>
            <li> Talk to a professional and ask the right questions.</li>
            <li> Wait for the right offers to come up.</li>
            <li> If this $200-$300 product is so good, why does miss clairol (who has ALWAYS seen and ALWAYS wondered) have to keep going over and over the same skin to get results, as do the other what-evers that are  trying to sell??&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li> The product is made of cheap light metal and the small amount of blue light they claim is laser?  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s been 4 weeks, my arms appear hair free, my legs, well, I shaved 4 days ago after using my NONO for 2 weeks on them, they feel smooth - maybe a little peach fuzz, but nothing like it use to!</li>

            <li> It takes some time, and must be done slowly (not every day) but it works!</li>
            <li> so I better get the hair off my other arm.</li>
            <li> From bleach to wax to tweezing, sugaring and many other gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Better than every other day.</li>
            <li> Better than every other day.</li>
            <li> How many other companies let you use a product then return it for another, over and over?  </li>
            <li> After about 4 months the unit began sounding different than it originally did.  </li>
            <li> have not yet given it a chance in many other places.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days (only on my cheeks, chin and neck), I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my 3 day trial.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no damn way I&#x27;m paying an extra $35 a month just to watch the original.</li>
            <li> let other family members use they just love it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all!</li>
            <li> In the past I have spent a lot in beauty salons that used the Epi-Light system... and it was very good...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any over buffing redness, I only had to go over it a couple times with the silky smooth instead of the normal 15 times when I don&#x27;t use the no</li>
            <li> tired it on my arms, and it did a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It did not do a good job on dark coarse hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> i love how the lotion smells, but i only use it if i have to cool down a certain area.</li>
            <li> i love how the lotion smells, but i only use it if i have to cool down a certain area.</li>
            <li> bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
            <li> My first NoNo was ordered using the payment plan but when I received the item it was clearly a used NoNo</li>
            <li> For me, the price was ok but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve gone back to tweezing hair around my lips, and I don&#x27;t expect full hair removal.</li>
            <li> Complete and utter rubbish, please be warned and stay well clear lovely people.</li>
            <li> but they advertise that they will give a full refund plus the cost to ship back.</li>
            <li> turned the power to FULL BLAST and went to work on the facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been occasionally burned, not badly, but I can deal with that</li>
            <li> I have fine natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Only works on soft fine hair.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it removed some hair but it didn&#x27;t even get rid of it down to the skin like shaving does.</li>
            <li> At first it was just warm to the touch then after just a few seconds; it got down right painfully hot.</li>
            <li> and they said I needed to get new \\&quot;blades\\&quot; so I did as instructed (not cheep!).  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get my new charger in the mail!</li>
            <li> Using the after treatment cream was definitely helpful after the first time use of the No No.  I can now honestly say that my facial hair isn&#x27;t the only feature I see when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> you have to buy a whole new</li>
            <li> buy a new one but no refunds or reasonable exchanges.</li>
            <li> As you look down at your leg there is a lot of long new growth that it just will not remove and, I am very fair and blonde.  </li>
            <li> Product died right after warranty even though barely used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to change my mind between now and 45 days, and I suspect there&#x27;s more hidden scam to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They still owe me about $50.00 to my mind, but when I enquired they more or less told me to go whistle for it.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but not super.  </li>
            <li> A razor does a better job, for $298 less than this piece of electronic garbage.</li>
            <li> I found I got better hair removal using my razor and it took less time.  </li>
            <li> As an aside, I find it interesting that you can contact only by phone; their website will only sell you a nono</li>
            <li> It takes forever to do and the hair grows back really quickly afterwards.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son always tells me how much of a difference he can tell in my arms, or as he tells me, I don&#x27;t like like a Gorilla now, haha.</li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s the thought that some electrologists intentionally kept the current too low so that I would keep returning for more treatments.  </li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s the thought that some electrologists intentionally kept the current too low so that I would keep returning for more treatments.  </li>
            <li> I tried this, and while I was lucky to get my money back easier than some</li>
            <li> but hair does come back quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a friend of mine who is of east indian decent.  </li>
            <li> I bought my NONO mainly for my face.  </li>
            <li> We were lucky to get our money back.  </li>
            <li> I USED THE CLASSIC ONE FOR A WHILE</li>
            <li> and then the red light went on and it completely stopped.  </li>
            <li> main worries</li>
            <li> This just a way for some backward, crooked scam artist to get quick money.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this at all for this particular body area</li>
            <li> and then it grows back because the No!No! beam is only &amp;#34;burning off&amp;#34; the very top portion of the hair, just above the skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all my family &amp; friends as they can see the difference it has made for me.</li>
            <li> wonder why the Shipping and handling charges are so high?</li>
            <li> and those S&amp;H charges are always way way high.</li>
            <li> No on to high a setting.  </li>
            <li> the product it self so highly touted by itself.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to a friend…</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying the nono before spending thousands on laser removal.</li>
            <li> I had no expectations of this product, just high hopes that it would take care of the stubborn hairs growing on my chin and the peach fuzz on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The wire just burns the hair really high to avoid skin damage.</li>
            <li> stated in some of the other reviews, I too experienced problems with customer service and it took a few calls to resolve the problems.</li>
            <li> After a month, I tried what other users suggested, just using it more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I must mention that any time I called, the reps were extra pushy to sell me extras, but I declined due to the fact that I wanted to make sure it worked first.  </li>
            <li> I call the number, sit on hold while being held hostage listening to their advertisements and then get disconnected.**DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> and it took all the hairs off, plus my face feels so soft!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your time!!</li>
            <li> Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> It does melt off your hair (at first you&#x27;ll have to wipe away little balls of charred, melted hair that drop out of the device as you use it) but doesn&#x27;t result in smooth skin.</li>
            <li> it is kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> In other words, it does a decent job at removing baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on an occasional tough facial hair and is spotty at best on legs and thighs.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I have not broken out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I have not broken out.</li>
            <li> would absolutely not recommend this product, frankly, even if it was free.</li>
            <li> No device and my Tria laser will result in permanently hair free arms sometime in the next few months.use it) but doesn&#x27;t result in smooth skin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of finding a cheap spring like I did which was really no hassle at all, go with the REM spring.</li>

            <li> i decided that since i could send it back if i wanted to, i would use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> On average for me, it takes one time in one direction, one time in the opposite, and then one more time in the first direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not see smooth skin the first few times you use the NO NO.</li>
            <li> The whole thing became hot to touch and it was constantly emitting its laser rays/&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it for hair removal on the back and neck with much success.  </li>
            <li> It gives burning smell which is normal according to the manual.</li>
            <li> I strictly followed the regime of rolling No!no Hair Removal, by small areas and repeatedly on the same area many more times when the hair grows back.</li>
            <li> The first time I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all, but the second time I was amazed at how much hair had disappeared.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a duh</li>
            <li> waited over 3 weeks to give it a good try not happy with results.</li>
            <li> I did, I kept it for a few months, but found out very quickly that this does absolutely nothing for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Italian, with super sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for this and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> After that work I have to tweeze the rest and it comes right back.  </li>
            <li> Just remember, if you slack off, the hair will come right back.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it</li>

            <li> after you finish buffing with the other one.s with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li> When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li> Got it and found it to be cheap feeling and the case was pretty flimsy and not a perfect fit as you would think.</li>
            <li> One month after purchasing the new NoNo (three months after receiving notification that the returned NoNo had been received by the company), I received a notice from a COLLECTION AGENCY.</li>
            <li> and why don&#x27;t I let him send me a new nono?  </li>
            <li> When I received the new blades I installed one and guess what?  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one that did work.</li>
            <li> and you may have to purchase new thermo tips after the one year.  </li>
            <li> but they sent me a new one anyway.  </li>
            <li> so I changed to a new tip and that solved the problem.  </li>
            <li> and it did come in a new unopened box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and as I live abroad I had to wait for a friend to get it for me</li>
            <li> I called the company to ask what needed to be done, and was told that I needed new heads, inserts, or whatever they call those things you place on the end of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll live with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> it was still new on the market</li>
            <li> I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li> it was still new on the market</li>
            <li> I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li> I had craved this gadget since it cost about 400.00 dollars and when it came down a little in price and had that remarkable 60 day satisfaction guarantee, i made the sacrifice, and bought the darn thing.  </li>
            <li> It does work on fine hairs, but it&#x27;s not worth the money knowing it holds maybe a 5 min charge tops.  </li>
            <li> a HUGE NoNo!&lt;br /&gt;It removes some hairs and leaves others, and it needs to be passed over and over on the same facial spots.  </li>
            <li> Albert came back on and said \\&quot;no supervisor is available at this time, call back, but I am going to do you a favor and send you the return</li>
            <li> Albert came back on and said \\&quot;no supervisor is available at this time, call back, but I am going to do you a favor and send you the return</li>
            <li> Advertise the product, give a second unit for free, and just charge shipping &amp; handling charges for the second unit...</li>
            <li> several tries many times it would not remove them.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product but it quit working all of a sudden after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Plus it is not painful at all, and my first few experiences with an epilator gave me tears.</li>
            <li> Well...it did it pretty much every single time I used it.  </li>
            <li> WELL CLEAR!</li>
            <li> Clearly, using this product is a no-no!</li>
            <li> the first one i got started acting up, and i called customer service</li>
            <li> Just burns the hair and leaves pretty big stubble.</li>
            <li> The commercial is very deceptive!</li>
            <li> Do not waste you money!</li>
            <li> Does NOT work..just a red hot wire that burns hair off and skin around knees and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> First it was set too low and it chattered no matter what I tried and would immediately break the wire, then it quit working.</li>
            <li> Only interested in removing chin and moustache hair.</li>
            <li> First, I did not order this from Amazon, I ordered from the nono site so that I could get the money back</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully every second day for the first 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> I have light stin and dark hair</li>
            <li> It does take a long time but worth it.</li>
            <li> I started to place my order because the email I got after backing out the first time said it was only $89.00</li>
            <li> I bought the No No specifically for my upper lip, but followed all the directions and tried it on my arm first.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  </li>
            <li> Yet, the facial hair is my biggest concern and the reason why I bought this unit in the first place.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does on the commercial.</li>
            <li> After the first couple days, I no longer need to open the windows and air out the house after using the No No device.</li>
            <li> So I used it religiously for 3 months, exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> But after first use, subsequent uses don&#x27;t produce the odor.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> did not even function properly the first use.</li>
            <li> it didnt work after the first week and left marks when i did use it</li>
            <li> There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li> There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li> Nearly 2 years of use have taught me that the No!No! does remove hair, but not as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not lazy</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re face with a red hot peice of metal...</li>
            <li> I waited past the 30 days hoping it would get better or would even work</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as shaving.</li>
            <li> When you see the infomercials and see the smiley, hairless models using the unit and there is a constant blue light; especially as they move so easily over the knee--that&#x27;s not real.  </li>
            <li> No No, I run my hand down my leg expecting baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> run my hand down the side of my leg once again hoping for baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> run my hand down the side of my leg once again hoping for baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Depending on how fast your hair grows, all people are different, you will see the hair come right back.</li>
            <li> The trust in our new relationship completely gone, I never took my eyes off of it.</li>
            <li> (hair is moderately fine, not coarse, but about 1/2in to an inch long, no joke!).</li>
            <li> If you have any grey chin hair forget it, it just runs right over it.  </li>
            <li> unless you don&#x27;t use it right and go over one spot, or linger too long in one spot - then you will burn your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But i guess as long as the blue light is going its working.</li>
            <li> The hairs come back fine, (yes your hair does grow back), and are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Some of the hair is growing slower, but still growing, and most of the dark chin hairs are still growing back.  </li>
            <li> I thought my hair might be too short so after the two months, I waited until the weather was cool enough to go without shaving my legs and didn&#x27;t shave them, my underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to see the overwhelming reviews warning people away from this very expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li> First pass complete, I start the next section.</li>
            <li> Also, the buffing really dried out the skin on my legs badly, no matter how gently I did it.</li>
            <li> The large tip never worked, but I was able to use the small tip and do my chin and upper arm.  </li>
            <li> positive reviews are obviously paid reviewer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this thin wire that gets hot as all hell and only comes down to the skin when you&#x27;re holding it at the right angle, speed, pressure, spinning counter clock wise while sprinkling fairy dust on your head and sucking on eye of newt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cheaper, not as much hassle, and you get the exact same effect.</li>
            <li> 2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear.</li>
            <li> I cannot review yet the long term effects, but for someone who&#x27;s had serious problems with excessive hair (and not to mention the fact that I have dark course hair to begin with), I am thrilled that something worked this good on my first try with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t maybe use it long enough to really test it out right.</li>
            <li> The product works on very fine baby hair but anything courser is a complete failure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Device didn&#x27;t stay on, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Pure and simple!  </li>
            <li> The guy in the commercial must have shaved his arm because that Nono certainly did not.</li>
            <li> This product is a SCAM, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li> So you can only use the product on high because it doesn&#x27;t mater what setting you put it on - it always switches to high after one stroke.</li>
            <li> Did not work and looked cheap not original</li>
            <li> but now my legs are smooth with little hair.  </li>
            <li> It left more hair than it took off and took forever to get a little off my legs.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to get one little area close to being &amp;#34;hair-free.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t been able to get the thing to work on my facial hair</li>
            <li> I am more than a little pissed and I feel as it I have been scammed I even talked to a supervisor and got the same story that they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it and that it was going to be charged to my CC.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I was able to actually watch the little indicator move itself from level 1 to level 3.</li>
            <li> It works a little better on upper arms as far as the regrowth</li>
            <li> I bought the NoNo and it was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> This has been a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> a huge waste of money and pain also.</li>
            <li> I stopped by the No No booth in our local mall and the person there was completely useless, telling me they had never heard of this before and every one else they had sold it to had great results.  </li>
            <li> Basically it only partially works on smooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, it does not have clear instructions neither within the box or in the website.</li>
            <li> The leg hair was definitely softer, but never did get the smooth leg I expected.</li>
            <li> The law says that if they are paid actors, it must be made clear in the ad</li>
            <li> The law says that if they are paid actors, it must be made clear in the ad</li>
            <li> clearly does not work like the commercials suggest.</li>
            <li> but once I made it clear that I no longer wanted it, her attitude became antagonistic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when I saw on YouTube how to use it, it was clear.</li>
            <li> instructions are a clear as mud.</li>
            <li> Was surprised to see blades to shave off the hair.  </li>
            <li> I tested this on my very Caucasian skin (no marks, scars, freckles, open skin, etc.), on my wrist/forearm with visible but \\&quot;sandy\\</li>
            <li> Do Not Waste Your Money.</li>
            <li> let me start by saying i have been thinking about buying this for a few years now and when i saw the infomercial to try it free for 2 months, i couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li> and I both saw the NoNo infomercial at the same time and were both really eager to try it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I ordered the no!no! hair removal system directly from them.</li>
            <li> It also did not remove hair very well for the short time that it was functional.</li>
            <li> Not \\&quot;fire burn\\&quot;, more of \\&quot;melted burned\\&quot; but at least it is painless.</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 minutes to completely go over my legs and I am not hairy</li>
            <li> and I do NOT have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I plan to go back to using hair removal creams (much easier &amp; cheaper)</li>
            <li> and I do NOT have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I plan to go back to using hair removal creams (much easier &amp; cheaper)</li>
            <li> Eventually Amazon put the whole thing back on me because, after 3 months of waiting, I had lost track of the mailing confirmation number, so Amazon told me they could not prove I had returned the item and could not make the company return my money.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to return the whole thing back because it was not working.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gets stuck in the on position frequently despite maintenance.</li>
            <li> Even my husband has asked if I could use the No No on his very hairy back.  </li>
            <li> and I found a young lady for which the product had worked</li>
            <li> Just burned the hait and not even completely off.  </li>
            <li> It took about 6 - 30 minutes sessions (total for both arms) to really get a \\&quot;no hair\\&quot; apparearance.</li>
            <li> *  WOW</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day since the day it was delivered and so far, not one hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li> but it is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> and I ended up going to a professional to get laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> It died completely  2 times.</li>
            <li> Strange as the address of the warehouse is in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for return label 5 weeks from first try..</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money like I did.  </li>
            <li> I completely regret buying the no no.</li>
            <li> You really won&#x27;t see lasting results until about the 6th week</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Please help me, I am 84 years old and do not know what to do.</li>
            <li> Only thing different is the buzzing noise it makes doesn&#x27;t sound the same as it used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too young to have hairs growing on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take that long to use, and the hair takes so long to show back up again!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really think that when you get this you ( we) should be informed that there is going to be this BIG COST!</li>
            <li> but I developed a severe case of jock itch as a result of the damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased directly from the website.</li>
            <li> I actually went straight through the website and ordered.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s by far the biggest scam</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased the NoNo directly from the company.</li>
            <li> If the professional doesn&#x27;t yes they are lying to</li>
            <li> This is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> Well I have the date marked on my calander and November 10th</li>
            <li> Well I have the date marked on my calander and November 10th</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT waste your money on this piece of rubbish.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the No No does not work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I got mine and didn&#x27;t try it until after I had it for 4 months because I am extremely busy</li>
            <li> SO hair removal takes so much longer than simply running a razor ONCE over the area!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on the No-No.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing a difference so far.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> now that is professional..</li>
            <li> No girl or woman wants facial hair.</li>
            <li> far as quality, I&#x27;ve had this product for going on 3 years</li>
            <li> I would give this product 0 star rating if I could complete a review with that choice.</li>
            <li> So far, it has  not removed ANY hair.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR</li>
            <li> Nearly $300</li>
            <li> just pulled the old Louisville slugger out of the basement that I haven&#x27;t used since 1991.</li>
            <li> I was planning to try to save up money for it, but after reading the reviews here, I will not waste time or money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin (I have eczema)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely baffled.</li>
            <li> This is a complete junk.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have bought nearly every product ever made to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> so I though I would have no trouble returning it.</li>
            <li> the hair just doesn&#x27;t melt away completely, it burns off the tip of the hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, my skin feels smoother, and the hair is gradually lightening from my skin.</li>
            <li> So far it is doing what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks</li>
            <li> If I could rate it appropriately it would get a negative 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ll do the 6 weeks they recommend then</li>
            <li> I really want my money back.</li>
            <li> Do not waste ur time with this product.</li>
            <li> If you need your hair removed go to a professional LASER place and do it that way.  </li>
            <li> After I use the NoNo, which really doesn&#x27;t work, the hair grows back twice as much; now I am left with hair on my face, that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it arrived in the product box</li>
            <li> I bought this product because nothing (laser, old time electrolysis, waxing, sugaring, you name it)has ever worked on me before.</li>
            <li> and I also have to shave after that because it couldn&#x27;t remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li> and I have just as much hair on my chin and upper lip that I had a year ago, and</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t think mine is particularly coarse.  </li>
            <li> There ought to be a class action against this thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble returning it, though.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised their is no class action suit against this company.  </li>
            <li> I got the no no about two weeks ago and have had no luck with it thus far.</li>
            <li> The CD ROM was tiny that was kinda unusual.</li>
            <li> customer service told me it&#x27;s a sealed unit and carnt be fixed</li>
            <li> but it is not growing back as fast</li>
            <li> Go over it a few times and your legs will be smooth.</li>
            <li> and if you do it too much your skin will be red</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li> No took far longer than shaving—up to 25 minutes per leg.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s your first time using it, hold it at a 90 degree angle with the roller facing you, do not allow it to sit in one spot for too long.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day and so far my skin can take it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the out of the box quality is hokey, it has the weight and feel of a 50.00 item, not one that cost nearly 300.00.</li>
            <li> I was able to get some of the facial hair off, but after burning myself a few times I stopped and will try again tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to obtain a good result.  </li>
            <li> First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry.</li>
            <li> My NONO&#x27;s little o&#x27;ring that runs the roller had come off (probably user error)and customer service said they would send a new one out right away and have the old one picked up at no cost to me!</li>
            <li> My NONO&#x27;s little o&#x27;ring that runs the roller had come off (probably user error)and customer service said they would send a new one out right away and have the old one picked up at no cost to me!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money  so that you are not disappointed as I am.</li>
            <li> This was the 3rd NoNo.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered before from NoNo on a trial period before paying and both of the first units came in old boxes and had obviously been used.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> First I could not agree more about poor customer service, they would not honor money back...</li>
            <li> and  I debated before buying due to the price; however, I thought if it worked it would be worth the money.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is beyond fine, don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it on my legs and arms, I thought it didn&#x27;t work because much of the coarser hair in some areas would not rub off with the smoother.</li>
            <li> but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg.</li>
            <li> The first went back to HSN because I thought the same as everyone else.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine as directed for the first month, starting with short stubble and then using it 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> First, the instructions are not that helpful, and the CD included does not give you a visual representation on how to use the product, it is merely a digital version of the written user manuel, which is lacking.  </li>
            <li> reminds me exactly of that male enhancement product,,&amp;#34;ageless male&amp;#34;,, yet another rip off company,,, they got sued,,, I got paid back,,, but they are still advertising and selling their bogus product (snake Oil)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First day Nono trimmed only about 70% of it leaving the stubs of different length- from 2mm to 10mm.</li>
            <li> On my face no less.</li>
            <li> I will have to go over the area with a shave, but the hair seems to be growing back slower and that was my main goal-</li>
            <li> i have a home waxing kit that works fine, but if you&#x27;ve ever tried waxing the back of your legs, you&#x27;ll understand what a mess that can be.  </li>
            <li> Before, even right after shaving, they still felt somewhat scratchy around my knees and other areas.</li>
            <li> Overall, if I could send it back for a full refund, I would; the advertising is very misleading and the product is definitely not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> For almost the same price, I highly recommend the \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n Flash and Go Permanent Hair Removal</li>
            <li> One major issue I have with this product is that it does hurt- a lot!</li>
            <li> I used the product, got the burning hair and slight smoke affect, but NEVER saw hair actually be removed to leave me with a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> If you have areas that you have shaved repeatedly for a long time, the hair will be much tougher.</li>
            <li> I tried several times, it doesn&#x27;t remove coarse hair, or really any hair as far as that goes.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with things that you wont use AND the adapters they say to use for the face and body are so cheap and small and plastic and to replace them</li>
            <li> If you had almost no hair to remove, then this might be okay, but to attempt to remove what I would consider as normal hair growth, it is not worth the time and trouble that would be required using this</li>
            <li> Their company directed me on how to return the product for a full refund (by the way, this is NOT a cheap purchase).  </li>
            <li> i bought it a few years ago and tried it the full time, with the 90 day warranty</li>
            <li> Being a hairy man I have tried waxes and creams and well as just plain ol&#x27; shaving always the hair comes back very quickly.</li>
            <li> ever the little things u use to shave wear off way quick and u can&#x27;t just buy them</li>
            <li> The first thing I found irritating is that it&#x27;s not as easy to operate as they make it seem on the commercial.</li>
            <li> The regular pro works great for me, but for my friend has thick dark coarse hair on her legs, almost like a mans beard on her legs</li>
            <li> It removed most of the hair but not entirely, some areas are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> I live in a very rural area where that&#x27;s not an option, so I will continue to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now depending on the person they may get new hair growth in treated areas for the rest of their life and may have to come back from year to year for a touch up session.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I sent it back and received a new one.</li>
            <li> but they will only accept new buyers once they have your money... forget it.</li>
            <li> If it works for you great, but I was so unhappy with it that I thought it may be valuable info to some people with similar issues.</li>
            <li> It is actually growing back much thicker than before too.</li>
            <li> Having read through most of the negative feedback here, I still decided to buy the product because they also offered the 60 days money back</li>
            <li> The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned.</li>
            <li> (yes, it zapped those long hairs), but after the first time, it Removed hair to stubble only...would go over the same area again and again, but</li>
            <li> Do not suggest to use on legs instead of shaving, in addition to shaving, it works well since not as much hair grows back next time.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight sting when using but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> As I spent near 350.00 I was not just ready to give up.</li>
            <li> After much frustration, I did not use for some time and now it is acting up and not working properly.</li>
            <li> At least they have a money back guaruntee but make sure you follow all the rules like I did</li>
            <li> Assuming they would at least be able to repair the machine I contacted customer service only to hear that since it&#x27;s been over a year all they can do is SELL ME ANOTHER ONE!!!</li>
            <li> No device and my Tria laser will result in permanently hair free arms sometime in the next few months.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be going along smoothly for a few strokes and then it is like it hits your skin with extra force, leaving burn marks in the shape of the wire.</li>
            <li> When we remembered that we needed to call back, it was too late and we were gladly told that we exceeded the warranty period.</li>
            <li> I used the No-No every single day, 7 days a week for close to 11 months straight.  </li>
            <li> It then burns the hair, but even after making several passes over the same area, hardly any hair was gone (and that was very very fine hair).  </li>
            <li> Yes if you have patience to wait for the results, and you are willing to use other methods of hair removal while using this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing major.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because either the product is so inferior that the buyers for the major stores rejected it, or it&#x27;s being sold on TV for the s&amp;h scam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because either the product is so inferior that the buyers for the major stores rejected it, or it&#x27;s being sold on TV for the s&amp;h scam.</li>
            <li> Right at 90 days the small tip broke and a month later the large one broke.  </li>
            <li> It quickly became apparent that this was a waste of $300.</li>
            <li> anyway a few exciting days later a package comes in the mail with our new NoNo.</li>
            <li> Its worth far less than the actual cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about this product for over a year but didn&#x27;t know if it was worth the price, but I heard about other people getting their money back with the trial and</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face because if you want to use it on your legs it takes way too long.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face because if you want to use it on your legs it takes way too long.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest the pro 5 series the hair is good for thinner and less coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I might (and I say might) see a little difference but not $300.00 worth.</li>
            <li> After three months, I can now see that within another few months, the hair that was initially too course to rub off with the smoother, will be fine enough that it will.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with high hopes, and even called to return it and get my money back when I was still having to use it daily after 60 days.  </li>
            <li> Even with extensive buffing, there is little or no actual smooth, hair-free skin.</li>
            <li> Even with extensive buffing, there is little or no actual smooth, hair-free skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had problems with facial hair until entering \\&quot;peri-menopause\\&quot;; the product works \\&quot;just Okay\\&quot; for facial hair, but I have to use it daily, almost like a shaver, to remove fine facial hormone-induced hair.  </li>
            <li> tried it on the peachfuzz on the face and kept at it (remember the tip would not stay down for more than a couple of seconds) and it did take a little of the fuzz off (got the burning smell).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people who got this product and the general consensus is that it is piece of junk.</li>
            <li> will also be contacting my state attorney general consumer affairs division.  </li>
            <li> When I shave I get bumps and scars and general ickiness</li>
            <li> I want to be clear that the hair is burned and smells as such.</li>
            <li> The box was sealed only with some clear tape.</li>
            <li> so far maybe about 20% of the hair is coming back on my legs, but not in all areas.  </li>
            <li> same result complete wast of money</li>
            <li> After watching the frequent NO-NO commercials for well over a year, I decided to give it a try, especially when the warranty appeared to be fool-proof.</li>
            <li> I think of myself as a careful consumer, but feel very duped into buying a product that doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time.</li>
            <li> could smell the burning but barely any hair was removed.</li>
            <li> I spent hours trying to get this to work correctly, and all I accomplished was burning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It especially burns around the mouth, no matter how I angle it or how far away from the lips I try to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used in sensitive areas such as bikini lines without pain.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Guess not, they&#x27;re too busy screwing the public!</li>
            <li> when I called to ship it back all I got was accusations I was using it incorrectly, and refferred to a s person that just instructed me on what directions already said.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I simply put on the TV and went back and forth between the two products as much as I could the last week.</li>
            <li> have blonde hair naturally,  so it isn&#x27;t course&lt;</li>
            <li> When you use it on the upper lip it zaps the skin in the middle because of the contour of the lip and this product also burns the skin if you use it in the same place too much, which you will have to do because it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.</li>
            <li> have an old one that worked for three years before having the same problem.</li>
            <li> The only way to get the smell of burnt hair out of your house is to completely air it out</li>
            <li> About 8 months ago, the device stopped charging completely &amp; would work for only about 2 minutes</li>
            <li> , she tried it and it did barely anything about the hair.</li>
            <li> I used it daily for a couple of months until it broke completely.</li>
            <li> Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]]</li>
            <li> My hair growth has barely lessened.</li>
            <li> It should be taken off the market and there should be a class action suit to get people their money back.  </li>
            <li> My feeling is there are SO MANY negative reviews that you ALL can&#x27;t be wrong. :-)</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my face and neck so far</li>
            <li> I have had some facial hair since early adulthood</li>
            <li> the thick, dark stubble appears again within hours of using it and it is becoming very distressing.</li>
            <li> bottom line, i am stuck with product that doesn&#x27;t work, and i see how they make their money is hoping people will try it for the full 60 days so they can tell them they are past their return time, leaving them stuck with the product and out of pocket cost..</li>
            <li> They jipped me about $8 which I didn&#x27;t bother calling about because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble</li>
            <li> Over three quarters of all buyers/users report poor (or no) results -- and most seek a return and refund.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a couple of times to get the feel of it and to move it smoothly and slowly</li>
            <li> It works like it says it does, BUT it is an EXTREMELY slow process and it doesn&#x27;t get it as smoothly as a razor.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the end to those little black whiskers and peach fuzz around my face and my love trail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one.</li>
            <li> and then later was told that a new replacement was being shipped to me ( red flag for fraud</li>
            <li> but we have basic cable and it only has the new version.</li>
            <li> With paid actors, a script full of outright lies and from a company with no sense of right and wrong, once they have your money you are of no value to them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not a quick fix, but after going to the electrolysis for years and not seeing a marked improvement this has really been a blessing and would encourage anyone to purchse one.</li>
            <li> It has this tiny roller that has to be pressed down the right amount while rolling it over your skin, where ever you choose to use this thing.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, however after about a year, or less say 6 months, there was a noticeable improvement in the reduction of hair around my face, specifically the nape of my neck, and sideburns.</li>
            <li> If you find someone that is willing to treat your hair for way less then others, remember lasers can burn, scar, and permanently discolor your skin if not used by a trained professional.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> but I only did it every other day for the first week &amp; havent seen any regrowth at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product, just to find out if doesn&#x27;t work, maybe for other people but not me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other day I pulled the thing out of the box and got it ready.</li>
            <li> It not actually having lasting effects, and my sweet gifter who made the $300 investment wasted her money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then go.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than shaving with a razor but it lasts longer than a razor and your legs feel smoother and not only does it grow slower the more you use it, as long as you use the lotion with capi slow, your hair gets softer as it goes.</li>
            <li> And the cover is a bit loose, but we&#x27;ve already sent one back for always switching to high from low -- and the new one does the same.</li>
            <li> A little bit of the hair was burnt [and we could smell the burn] but the hair was still very very visible.</li>
            <li> I used it one night around my lip area, and woke up with a huge cold sore, wasn&#x27;t fun to get rid of.</li>
            <li> While this product may work for the occasional blond chest hair it clearly is incapable  of removing any coarse hair at all.</li>
            <li> As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as it looks cheap, is expensive, breaks easily and is a waste of time when you can just go ahead on hair</li>
            <li> In the early stages there were times that it would make my upper lip burn or be red afterwards.</li>
            <li> In the early stages there were times that it would make my upper lip burn or be red afterwards.</li>
            <li> Well the young lady that answered the phone at 8:15 said that I would have to call back later today as the order hadn&#x27;t yet showed in their system.</li>
            <li> It simply does not work despite following the directions completely.  </li>
            <li> the only advantage to spending the money on one is that you&#x27;ll be included in what will inevitably become a class action lawsuit for one reason or another.  </li>
            <li> I paid about $100 when I first ordered and was not told that this was just a down payment and the that it actually costs $300.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face exactly as directed; the little chopper heads cut my skin and it looked as though I had fallen and skinned my chin on something.</li>
            <li> The actual device doesn&#x27;t do much at all, certainly not what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Tried it on my arms, first, because that hair is less coarse-</li>
            <li> I finally interrupted her instructions after the 3rd time and clearly stated to her that I DID NOT like the product and wanted to exercise the money back guarantee, please provide me with RMA #</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get the job done and if you&#x27;re not careful you can burn yourself on sensitive areas such as your face.</li>
            <li> 30 times (you are supposed to go over it four times to achieve the same look and feel as waxing) and could barely tell the difference from where I had not used it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this no no pink one, used two times and the rubber broke, cannot get my money back</li>
            <li> Apparently people who use this product only have one hair to remove.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt catch stubble hair which is primarily the main reason to even get something so outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> i know this is a major purchase, so i will continue to give updates, good and bad, in case anyone is on the fence about buying one.  </li>
            <li> i know this is a major purchase, so i will continue to give updates, good and bad, in case anyone is on the fence about buying one.  </li>
            <li> It does burn the hair, if you use it for long enough but it doesn&#x27;t burn it right down so instead of hair you have singed stubble.</li>
            <li> , yes it burns the hair down and also can burn your sensitive skin!!!  </li>
            <li> In fact, there are so many negative reviews that I cannot possibly read them all due to time.</li>
            <li> , I started using it on my husband&#x27;s face due to his facial hair growing so thick and covering most of his face.</li>
            <li> If used too much in one spot, it can cause slight burns.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Two months later I contacted Amazon who apparently tried to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li> Motor and light went on and off unpredictably and little, if any, hair was removed.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for a while now, and  i do notice a tiny bit of difference, but i feel that you need to use it for a very long periods of time to show its complete effect.</li>
            <li> I left the rating at 2 stars because I can&#x27;t really comment on its effectiveness since I gave up after a month and half.</li>
            <li> I have very course black chest hair and had tried several products to get rid of it and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 3 weeks now and I am noticing the hair coming in more sporadically and less thick.</li>
            <li> The claims about hair free in few weeks are simply not true.</li>
            <li> At no time did my unit have a \\&quot;blue guide\\&quot; light and despite several tries and passes on the same small area no hair was removed.  </li>
            <li> has very soft not much hair, and he also did it for several times a day, for several day.</li>
            <li> to use the buffer properly press lightly and go small circular motions in a straight line up and down for like legs or side to side for like the jaw line on your face, then go back in the opposite direction rotating in the opposite direction as well so if you were going clockwise down your leg from the knee to the ankle you would go counter clockwise up your leg from the ankle to the knee.</li>
            <li> With a little time, determination and reasonable expectation, I have found this to be nothing short of a miracle.</li>
            <li> works!\\&quot; Then I was brave and tried it on my face, it was hard to get around the edges, and it did burn a little when i&#x27;d go to slow, but not enough to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li> Also it is very time consuming and hard to use on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> As such I have dark hair in places that I would rather not, such as the shadow on my upper lip that started to become obvious around junior high school.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and it was about 50/50 good vrs bad.</li>
            <li> I feel that I have wasted $250, but it&#x27;s possible that I need to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li> I think real laser hair removal is more affordable and long lasting in the long run and at least you not dealing with rude customer service.</li>
            <li> , it is just slow going and not an overnight success.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because it is hard to get the right contact with the curves in the face.</li>
            <li> There is the REMOTE possibility that I may live long enough to see a permanent REDUCTION in hair growth after decades of \\&quot;controlled burns.\\</li>
            <li> This puts you right at the time that is too late to return for a refund.</li>
            <li> using the product for 30 days enough was enough i sent it back asking for my full refund under there try it for 60 days not happy send back guarantee to which i received a letter stating as it was sent back before 60 days i was not entitled to the refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy to use on the face - where I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> * I wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles from this product even if it remained on long enough to function, or a similar product that was less particular about its function.</li>
            <li> What I can tell you in all honesty is that after a few months of using fairly steady, I do forget a day or two now and then, but then go back and do my arms.</li>
            <li> It takes hours just to complete 1 leg let alone move on to the other.</li>
            <li> It turned on after charging and looked really nice but is useless!  </li>
            <li> Takes way to many passes, missing thick hair and takes to long to when doing mulpile area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and you are no longer going too fast so that it is not getting as much and having to go over it several time or going too slow and it stopping and having to start a little farther back</li>
            <li> However, there are very few positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and since menopause I&#x27;ve been bleaching, to my dismay, a lot of dark facial hair.  </li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have any real pain when using this product, I did receive some small burns, especially in my facial areas.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money if you want any coarse, dark hair gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> Long story short, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the hair on my legs and it finally stopped working yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Long and short of it is was told could not return product because I had not contacted company within 45 days to express displeasure with product(even though product is advertised as having 60 day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I have owned mine now for almost a year and have yet to find the time to actually sit down and complete a shave.</li>
            <li> I have bought at least 3 or 4 new sets of tips, and, it still doesn&#x27;t remove hair from my legs completely.  </li>
            <li> , mine is the black mens addition, not the pink, haha.</li>
            <li> Some hair in other areas didn&#x27;t rub off with the smoother either, but I noticed that after each use, the hair that does grow back, is much finer and there is less of it.</li>
            <li> Each area must be done in the beginning of the first 3 to 4 weeks at least 3 to 4 times in each session.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Just long enough for me to get the hang of using the No!No!</li>
            <li> The tips do last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I can tell this thing will last me a long time.</li>

            <li> and I can tell this thing will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This might be easier to use on FLAT areas like legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> the battery does not hold a charge for a long enough period of time.</li>
            <li> however long it takes for them to receive it and actually issue you the refund, so</li>
            <li> however long it takes for them to receive it and actually issue you the refund, so</li>
            <li> Unless your hair is long enough to be unsightly, this product DOES NOT work.</li>
            <li> Now i just have to wait and see how long it&#x27;ll take the hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> and they charged me a return fee because I didn&#x27;t try it long enough.</li>
            <li> claims to use a \\&quot;pulse of heat\\&quot; to remove hair for long lasting smoothness.</li>
            <li> it can work hotter without burning you, still work as well, get as close and last as long (unless it is a defective wire)</li>
            <li> Cartridges didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> company does not stand behind guarantee that after 60 days can return for full refund.</li>
            <li> A true rip-off.</li>
            <li> the 50 dollar case is a cheap gray little thing thats hard to zip..</li>
            <li> I mean, REALLY?!  </li>
            <li> that took  a little time to post the truth about this product and help hundreds of people NOT  to go through the painful process of getting their money back, but after reading all this histories, I refused to go through all the burocracy to get my money back, but thanks to all of you that have the courage to speak up For many of us and  saved us.</li>
            <li> the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely blown away by all the negative reviews I found on different forums and websites!!!</li>
            <li> far as the effectiveness, I have less hair, but still have hair.</li>
            <li> We expected lasting hair removal but have to use the NoNo one or two times a week because stubble comes back otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it takes, but so far, it is NOT worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After several months of use, the hair on my face, neck and arms is growing in just as fast and thick as ever.  </li>
            <li> you wonder why their commercials have no sound at all fromt he machine when it is in reality very loud.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, a little expensive, works a little too slow.</li>
            <li> I returned it almost immediately and have not received a single word back.</li>
            <li> Why such a limited warranty?</li>
            <li> Their onsite videos were positive and upbeat, ( duh, of course).</li>
            <li> I purchased one several months ago used regularly with no positive results</li>
            <li> Thats my reivew plain, simple and clear cut.</li>
            <li> The actual No No device was rattling around loose in the product box.</li>
            <li> I kept it thinking I was doing something wrong as most other women.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my No!No!last year and what I found is \\&quot;it does not removed curly hair that well in African American or other people of color.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the additional charge, but folks need to pay particular attention to their credit card statements.  </li>
            <li> I have a crazy 2 year old who doesn&#x27;t leave me much time for myself and this has totally cut down on the time it takes me to get ready.  </li>
            <li> Certainly nothing I would write a negative review about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the thing on level 1, hoist my hoof onto the edge of the tub , and I begin.&lt;br /&gt;The stench of burning hair begins to fill the bathroom, completely overpowering the little air freshener thingy from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my fine fuzzy hair, but now a month into it I would have thought I would have seen at least some small results.</li>
            <li> They were BRAND NEW, how were they not clean!</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic - won&#x27;t be without it!!g because it is not a quick hair removal process and wish they&#x27;d include at least one replacement blade for the money!   </li>
            <li> sure you are pressing down hard enough, but not too hard that you&#x27;ll burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled as I had read some bad accounts of their Customer Service not being up to par.</li>
            <li> If this product works I am doing something wrong or the time to spend is in days not hours with continuouse attempts to remove hair and buff for a smooth hairless effect.  </li>
            <li> tried many times it does not work, it is dangerous to use on your areas that you want to get rid of hair like your face and chest...</li>
            <li> It takes no time to go in and clear my arms up now in a few minutes, instead of 20 minutes or so......</li>
            <li> I have dark coarse chin and neck hair as well as upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> we tested&lt;br /&gt;Six female staffers who normally shave their legs at least three times a week let hair grow for a week.</li>
            <li> my rating long ago.</li>
            <li> If the hair is not completely gone today, give your skin a rest and try again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> BUT the hair has to be a bit long.</li>
            <li> will work for you, as long as:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> If the hair is too long, the hair will not burn off all the way.</li>
            <li> I figure that after I keep using this, if I stay on task will not take so long.</li>
            <li> So be extra careful when ordering this product...</li>
            <li> I tried laser treatment but was told it did not work on grey hair so continued with plucking the hairs - probably two or three times a week.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t long at all.</li>
            <li> and instead was told I waited too long</li>
            <li> I have had the pink NoNo for two years now, hair is still growing at same rate.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just go into the purchase with your eyes wide open!</li>
            <li> I bought this over the summer after watching infommercials the last couple years and being curious.  </li>
            <li> a day or two later than would be expected after shaving or using a depilatory.</li>
            <li> does not completely remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The no no was a complete waste of money (and a lot of money at that).</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t long at all.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I waited too long.  </li>
            <li> I am a Cancer survivor, and hair grows now like a monkey.</li>
            <li> It takes too long for the hair removal...</li>
            <li> and it burns you when it is removing long hair.</li>
            <li> even attempt to get a refund because I waited too long.</li>
            <li> Wish I had trusted the reviews before purchasing but had wanted this thing for so long.  </li>
            <li> tried it on my legs (one hair was an inch long)</li>
            <li> No matter how feminine one feels, having long hairs protruding on one&#x27;s chin made me feel like</li>
            <li> The nono recommends to start the procedure on 3mm long hair .</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I suspect it contributes to hair growth in the long run.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t take long to master</li>
            <li> really long hair doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> Finally....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not completely lost site of believing in permanent at home hair removal and</li>
            <li> I find that the NO NO lasts as long as an epilation treatment with zero pain.</li>
            <li> We will see how long it takes for the credit to hit my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is explained in the manual but I wanted to stress it in this review for those that do not read thoroughly because this \\&quot;effect\\&quot; is not clear in the infomercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> $90 for a tube and should last for about 3 months and not covered by medical insurance), which really does slow down the hair growing process if you use it faithfully, twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I even tried doing what the woman did in the commercial by taking it down my arm; nope, don&#x27;t know how they did it for the commercial</li>
            <li> It is very hard to do your upper lip and it does burn a little if the skin is not perfectly flat and in just the right position.</li>
            <li> Maybe you can find that info through other reviews, but in my experience I would HIGHLY advise everyone NOT to waste their time, money and energy.</li>
            <li> It took an additional 2 and a half months form where I left off on this post to recieve my money back.</li>
            <li> It just cut half of the hair off and left stubble, eventhough the hair was the proper length.</li>

            <li> It just cut half of the hair off and left stubble, eventhough the hair was the proper length.</li>
            <li> One reviewer gave one star because it only removed half his/her hair and left stubble.</li>
            <li> I have very hairy testicles... and the no no IV is no better than my no no pro... yo yo bro!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am on a limited budget, and have spent years fighting with unwanted facial hair, being beyond embarrassed to have anyone discover that I had this issue.  </li>
            <li> The other reason I was not pleased with this product was my whole house smelled like burnt hair.</li>
            <li> Not quite as long as the REM spring but similar in every other way.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old, so I&#x27;ll grant that my skin is not as tight as it used to be, but it&#x27;s not drooping!</li>
            <li> It left SO much little hairs, it was as if i just trimmed it really low.</li>
            <li> She was extremely patient and continued to use this for the last 10 months off and on.</li>
            <li> At this point she would rather wax or pay for more expensive hair removal if it wouldn&#x27;t make the hair growth darker &amp; thicker like the no no hair removal system did!</li>
            <li> When used in combination with other hair removal methods this actually does work.</li>
            <li> I only bought it due to a friends relation telling me they had got one and</li>
            <li> I find that it removes a little of my facial hair, but definitely not all.</li>
            <li> I have used it not many times, only for the areas above my upper and lower lip.</li>
            <li> and I did buy it a little bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> other piece of advice comes from a sage who counseled me in my younger years:  </li>
            <li> My sales representative took the extra step in asking this manager about my ability to return the product due to these circumstances.</li>
            <li> It looks like someone came at my chin with a sharp object and put several scratches in it!  </li>
            <li> or you can have patches of hair left but using the no no first then buffing</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for a very long time,  I can use it for a week and the battery is still up on it.</li>
            <li> I would go over and over an area and it simply singed off the occasional few hairs.</li>
            <li> it only takes a few minutes and my facial hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> you have to SLOWLY run it across every last hair and then buff that area to completely remove the hair.</li>
            <li> and there was no new unit.  </li>
            <li> and apparently they have a little amendment to their return policy....</li>
            <li> Limited warranty...</li>
            <li> I bought this product four years ago, and It didn&#x27;t remove a single hair, all you got was the smell of the hair being burnt..</li>
            <li> Some results, not one single hair</li>
            <li> and I have to use it every single day</li>
            <li> To date it hasn&#x27;t removed one single hair</li>
            <li> for its limited use along with my [[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ</li>
            <li> It comes off easily, is very difficult to put back on, and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t work (because the wheel is not spinning at the proper speed and sticking and cause you to burn yourself so it is suppose to shut off) and the red light will come on when the tip goes bad (or if there is another device issue).</li>

            <li> Customer service is absolutely terrible(they don&#x27;t care once you have their product), and the product is difficult to use especially on the chin and upper neck areas.</li>
            <li> I have used the No No on my face, on average, 5 days a week for the last 6 months, so I don&#x27;t feel too hopeful about permanent results.</li>
            <li> Laser treatments for permanent removal of only dark hairs; and</li>
            <li> Laser treatments for permanent removal of only dark hairs; and</li>
            <li> have really dark, coarse hair on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> but the effects are not great after the first use</li>
            <li> but the effects are not great after the first use  5.)</li>
            <li> It did not work AT ALL, and getting a full refund was extremely difficult.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to try taking care of my full on lumber jack beard and mustache, because laser is too expensive now.</li>
            <li> The first one was so poorly made that you couldn&#x27;t plug the charger into it.</li>
            <li> useless , customer service not helpfull , full of bull</li>
            <li> ( I apologize in advance to those of you who have ordered product and may loose out if they do close. )</li>
            <li> Remember, you&#x27;ll loose your shipping if returned before 45 days.  </li>
            <li> Big thumb down.</li>
            <li> Not only did it burn my skin down there</li>
            <li> Does nothing for slowing down the growrh pattern even after using for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my face red.  </li>
            <li> but the head (themicon tip) would jump up an down and would not \\&quot;glide\\&quot; as on the infomercial except in short spurts.  </li>
            <li> i though was a little strange as any later than 60 would be after there guarantee, what you suppose to do time it that they receive it on the 60th day for a refund or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was a bit afraid to order my No No Pro, because a lot of people complained they got the same bad customer service my mom did and very few people gave good rating on customer service, but I went ahead and did it anyway because I liked what I was seeing happen when with my mom using hers.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and only use it about every third day, and see very little impact.  </li>
            <li> I think they should at least provide a new tip.  </li>
            <li> The product does not work which makes this purchase not only a very expensive mistake but also a huge</li>
            <li> to get burned, and pretty much useless for the bigger hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair grew back much less and finer.&lt;br /&gt;(4)Adjust</li>
            <li> The thing only removed half of the hair.</li>
            <li> So, in total it took about 4 and half months.</li>
            <li> So, in total it took about 4 and half months.</li>
            <li> My arm hair looks smoother than the legs since my hair texture is less coarse.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting on the lower setting and increase slightly.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be easier - less ingrown hairs - smoother shave - last longer...?</li>
            <li> The thing only removed half of the hair.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Nair and received scarring burns, even following the directions.  </li>
            <li> When I phoned back to get the shipping label, I  was then told that I was one week past the 60 day warranty and now they wouldn&#x27;t take it back at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Last night after using it literally 3 times before, I got half of my arm done and the rubber band broke off.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work at all on my legs where the hair is quite coarse and black.</li>
            <li> Nor did it work on my underarms or bikini line where the hair is also coarse and black.</li>
            <li> so I took less than a fraction of a second to reposition it and, &amp;#34;HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL!</li>
            <li> It is much harder to get the timing of the stroke down on your face since the area is much smaller.</li>
            <li> It came with the pink device, a white charging cord, a wide comb and a slightly narrower comb, one round buffer, a little brush for cleaning the combs, a grey zip case for storing the device and components, and some sample lip and skin products (nowhere near the amount of stuff shown in the photo).</li>
            <li> I asked for this in pink and it came in black second</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically painless, just a little sting becuase it actually zaps the hair follice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically painless, just a little sting becuase it actually zaps the hair follice.</li>
            <li> It made my skin red and burned a little..</li>
            <li> After I kept using it, I had hundreds of tiny little bumps all over my chin area.</li>
            <li> I did have to try a little bit of my arms last night though.  </li>
            <li> and it breaks a little over a year later?</li>
            <li> short nono may work a little bit</li>
            <li> Long story short, the skin on my face IS taut due to a face lift a few years ago.</li>
            <li> with coarse dark hair on my arms, legs, and face, and since menopause, if I didn&#x27;t tweeze every day, I&#x27;d probably have a beard!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky though when using on curved parts of the body such as the face or knees.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has so many bad reviews here</li>
            <li> It is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The woman I spoke to was rude and laughed when I said I&#x27;d give them a bad online review.</li>
            <li> the costly &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34; and go for waxing (couldn&#x27;t be any more painful), or put it towards laser (which is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, BTW.  </li>
            <li> and when I did the whole thing went wild and dangerous.  </li>
            <li> He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company.</li>
            <li> this is the worst company for no no hair remover...plus the actress&#x27;s on their on getting paid top dollar to say that it really works on tv..</li>

            <li> I purchased it for a specific area but it is difficult to use and the smell of burnt hair was too much.  </li>
            <li> some hair was removed but not much, my leg was still stubby afterward and my skin was irritated..</li>
            <li> Big waste of time money and</li>
            <li> This product is no different except for the heavy price tag.</li>
            <li> I expected to see some hair removed but it isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> Some of the stubble will stay behind after you sweep the area and the buffer really does help get the hair off for me.&lt;br /&gt;(3</li>
            <li> : When you call to ask for refund instructions, the customer service tries to talk you out of it.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about customers who had trouble getting their money back, I ordered the No No!</li>
            <li> Hair Removal System, Model 8800, Pink 1 Ea]]</li>
            <li> Gosh, I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money I don&#x27;t have on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The device seems to work as expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the pink No NO 8800 model as I have been looking for a miracle hair removal system for my face for years.</li>
            <li> But it is not doing what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as expected</li>
            <li> I always had a lot if blonde hair on my face like my mom &amp; trouble areas on lip &amp; chin.</li>
            <li> The instructions do say you have to wait 4-6 weeks to see results, so I&#x27;m still expecting it to grow back normally a few times.  </li>
            <li> The worse part is that they don&#x27;t tell you how readily this product burns the skin.</li>
            <li> I have the pink cordless 8800 device.</li>
            <li> After careful consideration, I am trying this tool.</li>
            <li> And go over hairs in opposite directions of growth a few times.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I kept the two heads carefully cleaned</li>
            <li> I purchased my Pink 8800</li>
            <li> Oh yes, If you do lose a few hairs when you burn your skin,it&#x27;s back in days just like shaving.</li>
            <li> Was just as advertised and as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I pity my co workers and my family and and wouldn&#x27;t wish this punishment on anybody.</li>
            <li> This was such a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> JUST MINUS $300.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s really not)</li>
            <li> She and I have both used it, it is working as we expected.</li>
            <li> It burns your skin, along with a few hairs that leaves a stink in your&lt;br /&gt;nose as well as the entire house.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pink NO NO 8800 for my wife</li>
            <li> Even if use it regulary for 8 weeks the results are minimal</li>
            <li> I put it on just a few chin hairs several times a for the time advised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was defiitely NOT what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Rather than &#x27;pink&#x27;, can you make the color fuschia?</li>
            <li> and no, I didn&#x27;t buy the pink one</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time with repeated &amp;#34;applications&amp;#34; but still no results.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have those dark or noticable long hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the pink nono (model 8800) for 15 months.</li>
            <li> The laser has a cooled tip so only the hair follicles and stem cells are heated and killed, the cooled tip keeps the skin from burning.</li>
            <li> I felt that I spent a lot of money on it</li>
            <li> Series Hair Removal Device - Pink]]</li>
            <li> My nono quit within a month after the warranty went out so really never had a chance to see if it would work</li>
            <li> It zapped a few hairs, but without a second person to hold my skin taut, all it did was wrinkle up my skin.</li>
            <li> I spent 30 minutes trying to make it work</li>
            <li> It is  not at all what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Just spent 20 minutes trying to use it on my face....</li>
            <li> does not work as well as expected on face</li>
            <li> I purchased the NoNo in pink about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> After the two months that I tried the no no for, I saw absolutely NO reduction in hair regrowth as advertised.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to burn yourself when doing curvy areas.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> Although the product does take some of the hair off, it doesn&#x27;t remotely work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, you have to be extremely careful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because they only give 1 month to return it.</li>
            <li> I eventually gave up after a few weeks and waited for the 45-60 day guaranteed satisfaction or your money back to roll around and asked for a return RMA on Day 46.</li>
            <li> Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months.</li>
            <li> I closed the window and a few minutes later I got a email confirming my order</li>
            <li> because thin hair near my lip grew back, making me feel self-conscious.</li>
            <li> It removes the hair however it hasn&#x27;t proved it&#x27;s self on keeping the hair from growing back and hasn&#x27;t done so well at thick hair such as whiskers</li>
            <li> I have not received a single burn though, even though that seems to be the major complaint.  </li>
            <li> my friend, by the way, is not happy with hers, and is willing to sell it to me at half price.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday for a half hour on one leg for three week and it barely removed any hair.</li>
            <li> and I mean seriously DO NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This certainly is not as advertised on television and on the web.  </li>
            <li> Beware if you decide to give it a try, the burns are very odd, they don&#x27;t show up till the next day, but you feel the soreness immediately.</li>
            <li> I kept trying it because I wanted to be hair less, so I would spend a long time using it</li>
            <li> be prepared to use it in combination with a tweezer or other form of hair removal, this is only one tool in the arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buffer things do nothing, and the case is a waste since you can&#x27;t put the charge and the devise in it.</li>
            <li> but it just seemed ridiculous to go over the same spots countless times and still have hair there that the pad could wipe away either.</li>
            <li> but it just seemed ridiculous to go over the same spots countless times and still have hair there that the pad could wipe away either.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell when using is less than desirable which would be less of an issue if the product actually worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, they lock you into a tiny return schedule--unless you are REALLY organized and write all the dates down precisely on the calendar, you will wind up owning this terrible overpriced product even though you do not want</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m back to shaving my arms, which I don&#x27;t really like to do, and epilating my legs,which is painful,and if you use Dr. Numb is a long process.</li>
            <li> In other words I am out the $300 I spent on this garbage.</li>
            <li> , it split the skin open and left a thin sore about 1/2 inch long wherever I used it.  </li>
            <li> This is a flat out waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I gave up on this device now after using it regularly for over six months now, so tired of doing it without any short or long term results</li>
            <li> But after a few months of using it (only on my face) it began to malfunction and would only operate on the highest setting- which is a little too much for facial hair, but I am extremely hairy and desperate</li>
            <li> I figured why not, let&#x27;s give them a chance, it might have been a bad unit, so he said I will receive the new unit in 4-5 days and that I needed to put the old unit in the same box and return it...</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result.</li>
            <li> The only thing I cannot comment on is the long term effects of it and having the hair not come in as thick or as often over time.</li>
            <li> Just got off the phone with NoNo and am too angry to go into a long rant, but I really wanted to warn people about the slippery return policy.</li>
            <li> It only took a few to find out it didn&#x27;t work in the main places I needed to use it, and it left painful red marks behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which causes me to be extremely self conscience.</li>
            <li> I could overlook some of the other complaints reviewers have with this product.</li>
            <li> and then i started using it every other day.  </li>
            <li> and i returned the other one.  </li>
            <li> and i returned the other one.  </li>
            <li> All it did was singe the top of the stubble on the back of my neck, leaving me with a nasty burnt hair smell, and didn&#x27;t get rid of the hair at all (no matter how it was scrubbed later in the shower, or rubbed with the pad that comes with it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out on her arms, my sis-</li>
            <li> It even left a few burn marks on my sister in-law&#x27;s arms!</li>
            <li> With every other method I have used, I got a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With every other method I have used, I got a rash.    </li>
            <li> I forgot to lower the setting after using it on my legs and burned my lip in 3 spots a couple of cm&#x27;s from each other.</li>
            <li> Not much better on larger areas.  </li>
            <li> I went on youtbue to get feedback and some instruction from other folks who had purchased this product</li>
            <li> and a lotion that smells a bit like neet, nair or some other depilatory cream.</li>
            <li> What other product that costs $300.</li>
            <li> my legs and underarms every other day.  </li>
            <li> The instructions state to be careful with your face, and if it is uneven, you get hurt if you run over uneven spots (should not be used on scars, raised freckles and such).  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this and other products from TV commercials over the years</li>
            <li> MY PROFITS are still $9,784,000 and even after all the other costs of advertisements and the call in &amp; delivery services, I still made millions in profit on bogus shipping and handling charges...</li>
            <li> Small head stopped working almost immediately and all it and the larger head did was burn the hair off when it did anything at all.</li>
            <li> I dropped and damaged my No No last week and am not sure if I wish to replace it.</li>
            <li> No because I have purchased other products from T.V. after using this for a month</li>
            <li> but if you have coarse hair don&#x27;t waste yout time and money !</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any other products from this company again.</li>
            <li> If I had done so I would have not had time to cancel the other one as he said and I would have received 2.</li>
            <li> I still had the other 3/4 of my leg to do and the other one.</li>
            <li> but I am not willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> The one that came was the no no all by itself without a charger or any tips to it or any other information or accessories that are supposed to come with it.</li>
            <li> I  guess there are lots of other chumps out there who also want to try the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; hair remover.</li>
            <li> will not be a buyer, am not very hairy anyway!</li>
            <li> theory is that they make their money not from having a quality product but from people not sending it back in the small window of time they allow for returns because they keep holding out hoping that it will work.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A person will tell you everything you need to know about themselves in the first five minutes of talking to you.\\&quot;  this advice has worked for me without fail</li>
            <li> And when I hit longer hair it gives an abrupt shake and shuts off as if the device \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t like\\&quot; that.</li>
            <li> Not sure if a part needs to be replaced, but the company never got back in touch with me.  </li>
            <li> The stubble that it misses, and other hairs that remain, are softer after using the nono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item was ordered as a Christmas gift and the individual was not satisfied with the results, I am trying to return the item</li>
            <li> Absolutely not recommendable!</li>
            <li> As I said before, the hair on my chin is extremely course (like a guys).  </li>
            <li> I hope that I won&#x27;t have issues with getting my refund like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Bleaching is extremely itchy torture</li>
            <li> It burns off the hair but also the skin by extreme drying.  </li>
            <li> I use it about every other day.  </li>
            <li> This product is a total sham!  </li>
            <li> So running around with 3/4 of a leg done and the other one not touched at all</li>
            <li> So running around with 3/4 of a leg done and the other one not touched at all</li>
            <li> after you finish buffing with the other one.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that spending the time doing this every other day would result in cleaner legs and eventually shaving less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I continue to use it on my face every other day.</li>
            <li> &quot; I did it every other day, then had to go to every day.</li>
            <li> NoNo does not live up to its promise, I saw no significant difference even when using the unit every day.</li>
            <li> Needed to be very careful not to burn myself.  </li>
            <li> These days, very few people have an extra $268 to throw away including myself.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair is very thick and dark.</li>
            <li> i have burned myself a few times, but the burns are very minor.  </li>
            <li> but after a few minutes you don&#x27;t notice and it takes a very- VERY long time.</li>
            <li> some hair came off but left behind stubble, so i had to go back over it with</li>
            <li> It would have been expensive but still only a fraction of the cost of electrolysis that took nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> It would have been expensive but still only a fraction of the cost of electrolysis that took nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> so far getting my money back has been difficult...</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work, NO NO does not stand behind their money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> At least that way, the hair REALLY is gone for 3 or 4 weeks, and waxing DOES slow hair growth after a while.</li>
            <li> It seems to burn off about half the hair, leaving a rough stubble.</li>
            <li> I can easily afford little extravagances like no no and feel very sorry for those who find money tighter and buy this in the hope it works - IT DOES NOT  WORK!&lt;br /&gt;i have had mine for 3 months now and used it 3 times a day every day and was being patient like you are told to.</li>
            <li> It takes seconds to use the nono, it is painless but you can burn yourself if you go too slow or press hard, you dont need to press down though really at all.</li>
            <li> It takes seconds to use the nono, it is painless but you can burn yourself if you go too slow or press hard, you dont need to press down though really at all.</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t work as fast as they show on TV and secondly, it burns your skin and leaves this awful burning smell for a while.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth all of the money I spent on it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when I actually came home and used it, it was really hard to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had pretty bad unwanted facial hair since childhood.  </li>
            <li> but it is so not worth it.</li>
            <li> In reality, my wife slided it back and forth at least 10 times, but the device couldn&#x27;t create a closer shaving.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this thing really burned when I would use it on my face - scary.</li>
            <li> ; not worth the $ amount.</li>
            <li> The second I saw that a lot of the reviews were negative</li>
            <li> No scaring of course, but not worth the pain / effort.</li>
            <li> i followed all of the instructions, which are simple to follow and at first I thought my machine was defective, because IT WAS PAINFUL</li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s way expensive and isn&#x27;t really working for me, so in comes</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  </li>
            <li> This device is not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> just NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> If I could, I would return it and get my money back, but it is too late.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the No No to use on my arms but its so not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive and results were very dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Customer Service was rude and critical.  </li>
            <li> and I sent it back and got another one which seems to be set too high--too late to return.</li>
            <li> I do have dark hair</li>
            <li> (may at least seems smoother at grow back)- who knows.  </li>
            <li> The smell of burning hair is a definite negative for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They will not take it back until you have use it for at least 45 days, perhaps hoping you&#x27;ll forget and time</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t consider my leg hair to be any coarser than average.).</li>
            <li> The first one I received shocked me every time that I hit the button, so I sent that back, got a replacement (after 3 weeks) and went to use it on my nether regions.</li>
            <li> but I needed it for dark course</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arm hair which isn&#x27;t think just dark in color.</li>
            <li> it does not do as advertised and it is too late to send it back.  </li>
            <li> All in all...its not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Finally after 2 years at least, I threw the darn thing away.</li>
            <li> Customer service was rude and would not let me send back</li>
            <li> Please save your money not worth the money</li>
            <li> In the commercials, they show masses of dark hair falling off as the product is used.</li>
            <li> It is very costly and now I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I actually cried spending at least £200.</li>
            <li> these are cores dark hairs that have strength like a tooth brush bristle.</li>
            <li> It will not work on coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> It never removed the hair completely; it basically acted like a shaver but WORSE.</li>
            <li> biggest waste of money I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> did get a full refund which was very difficult.</li>
            <li> I bought the pink nono 3 years ago because I had a few hairs on my neck and chin.</li>
            <li> My mistake for not returning this $300 piece of crap is trying to be patient based on the info posted in the product website  that  some people may need more than 12 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I still have thick coarse hair growing on my lower chin and jaw</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> because I hate shaving every day :)</li>
            <li> You get the stroke down.</li>
            <li> They have this scam down to a science.</li>
            <li> I talked with \\&quot;Maria\\&quot; at NONO who gave me an RMA# to write down.  </li>
            <li> Over $300 down the drain!!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The down side was that I had to pay for the postage to return it.  </li>
            <li> They should be shut down by the BBB or the FCC.</li>
            <li> 452 customer reviews broke down like this:&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> In order to keep my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; and \\&quot;chin whiskers\\&quot; down, I have to use it 2 to 3 times per week.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe they haven&#x27;t been shut down.</li>
            <li> For the face I will have to hunt down somethings else, because the results, even after 7 months, are pitiful.</li>
            <li> Vaniqa doesn&#x27;t stop the hair from growing, but it slows it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> Plus the tips will bounce up and down and cause the filament to burn the skin.</li>
            <li> they wanted me to keep it 45 days,if i had, my chin hair would be down to my sholders.</li>
            <li> It is that wire that heats up and clicks down onto your skin as you run the device across your arm, etc.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had fallen face down on my chin and scraped it.  </li>
            <li> It would be cheaper to just run a lighter up and down my legs.  </li>
            <li> for it to burn the hair down, and it still does not get the majority of the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still there and the machine crashed down.</li>
            <li> well I forgot all about it , when I did eventually try again the therma part stuck down</li>
            <li> so well it takes longer to get to because the plate in front that is meant to lift the hair up so the wire can burn it ends up holding it down</li>
            <li> i have heard that when items grow in popularity, they sign contracts and the quality goes way down since they got their money</li>
            <li> I mentioned the bikini line, i literally mean outside of the line where my swimsuit would be.</li>
            <li> has not reviewed any other items on amazon!</li>
            <li> I mean baby hair like the hair on the upper lip and jawline that is like baby</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, not only was the product a failure for me, but my extenuating circumstances were not taken into the consideration they deserved upon attempting to return this product.</li>
            <li> So basically they know this product is junk and are hoping to get people to buy it and only leave a very small window of opportunity to return it in hopes they forget and get stuck with it.</li>

            <li> Rubbish , &#x27;burns&#x27; hair off unevenly leaving very rough stubble.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these both different models because I really needed a solution to my bad hair problems.</li>
            <li> I think that others that give a bad review have not used it enough to really rate it correctly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work but the only thing it succeeded at was putting me in a bad mood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about less than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> My problem is: The small Thermicon tip that came with it failed after first use.</li>
            <li> I personally will be sticking with my razor and shaving gel; its a lot less expensive, doesn&#x27;t burn me, doesn&#x27;t leave me stinking, and actually works.</li>
            <li> Instructions were less than helpful.</li>
            <li> Slightly burned my face</li>
            <li> Slightly burned my face</li>
            <li> Now it was working correctly but did not remove my black corse hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I travel for work and didn&#x27;t get home in time to send it back and get my money back.  </li>
            <li> and I did notice a slight \\&quot;zap\\&quot; and puff of smoke when it hit a thicker hair - positives in my opinion!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but instead we accepted a slight product discount and kept it.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for less than a month</li>
            <li> from an infomercial that kept repeating every half hour on Saturday mornings.</li>
            <li> had it for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Cost way less and can do it where ever and when ever I want to.</li>
            <li> And it takes less time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I slightly cinched the skin.</li>
            <li> Legs have 25 percent less hair and everything is finer in texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have black, stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> I have a scar there, so I accidentally got a slight burn.</li>
            <li> I refund you the cost of the units less the s&amp;h &#x3D;</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice less and less hair growing.  </li>
            <li> Burned out in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Seriously, three months later it arrived.</li>
            <li> then less and less often...</li>
            <li> ,T EVEN GIVE IT HALF A STAR</li>
            <li> Its not smooth like a waxing, but the hair regrowth is slow &amp; similar to waxing but without the ingrowing hairs &amp; pain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for the hidden side effects to pop up any day now.</li>
            <li> I have half a mind to call up and ask if I can trade for something else, but I doubt that they let me.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t deserve even a half a star</li>
            <li> I bought mine less than a year ago, and the elastic band on the head snapped already, which means</li>
            <li> For the results: Yes, I saw a slight difference on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> However, it was because of those reviews that I decided to send it back and pay the $15 shipping fee rather than make the next installment and have a difficult time recouping my money.</li>
            <li> The customer service she got was less then acceptable.</li>
            <li> The customer service she got was less then acceptable.</li>
            <li> never have seen less hair growth anywhere.</li>
            <li> The little bit it did take off was not worth all the time, burnt smell, burnt skin you have to go through to get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking using it for long term - it would be hard on your skin</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard</li>
            <li> It took me a little bit of practice to get the glide down</li>
            <li> I gave this two starts because it does actually reduce the hair in less time than tweezing (on my face) but it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and chin, it smells real bad and works on fine hair!!</li>
            <li> I got it back out and thought I would try it again still no good.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t cancel the maintenance mess which consists of  abrasive pads, thermicon tips.</li>
            <li> My wife has used product as suggested and is not satisfied with lack of expected results.</li>
            <li> It is not true.</li>
            <li> Not TOTALLY true.  </li>
            <li> No special science here</li>
            <li> Electrolysis for permanent removal of both pale and dark</li>
            <li> Electrolysis for permanent removal of both pale and dark</li>
            <li> I purchased the no no from their website and used it exactly as was stated but there has been absolutely no difference in the hair,  if anything it leaves you with stubble and makes it looks like you have a REALLY BAD SHAVE.</li>
            <li> It stinks too because it simply is burning the unwanted hair and it barely removes the hair even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of a half hour</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I can use the No!No! without shaving, but it definitely leaves stubble and I still have to pluck some thick hairs that won&#x27;t respond to the No!No!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then hair grows back thick and black and it won&#x27;t remove it after that!!  </li>
            <li> After using the NoNo for several months, I believe that the reason some people give it a bad review is because they have not used it long enough to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair might have lessened/slowed for a little while (all of a week, perhaps)</li>
            <li> a little disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they look like a little scratch that go away in a day or so</li>
            <li> , I would even let my hair grow out just a little bit, and I could smell burning hair, but it would do some spots but not others.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice Always glide off and lift off the skin.</li>
            <li> but I find it is a little under powered for dealing with hair on the face.</li>
            <li> there was also a little burning of the skin and some discoloration.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great little item.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of hair and the little hair it does remove does not stay gone for weeks.  </li>
            <li> does not work, I tried and tried but no hair was removed...not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> The part that removes the hair is a little plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; that clicks into the</li>
            <li> You will have stubble - a little prickly but basically invisible.</li>
            <li> You will have stubble - a little prickly but basically invisible.</li>
            <li> Now I can throw my little gadget in the garbage.</li>
            <li> the tip has a little wire that heats up and burns your hair</li>
            <li> My thumb slipped a little</li>
            <li> It feels like it will shatter into little pieces if it is ever dropped on like a tile floor for example.</li>
            <li> watched the REM how-to-video and used my little 79 cent spring to remove the hair from my lip and chin while watching TV and w/o a mirror.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use on your underarms as its hard to see and the nono is much easier to use on a flat surface instead of a curved one.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use on your underarms as its hard to see and the nono is much easier to use on a flat surface instead of a curved one.</li>
            <li> It might slow the growth a little but not much.</li>
            <li> Since using as directed at least 2xweekly it hardly ever grows back.</li>
            <li> Sorry all of you  had to find out the hard way but thanks for warning us.</li>
            <li> I kept trying the product thinking I would see even a little less hair, but I did not!  </li>
            <li> An Absolute NO NO, What a disappointing product.</li>
            <li> and it was dead.  </li>
            <li> This is the biggest waste of money EVER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my No No for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> But with the heavy price tag, I would recommend leaving this product on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money&gt;</li>
            <li> my legs are not smooth until after buffing&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> and, I will try to sell the NoNo at a garage sell.my legs are not smooth until after buffing  4.)</li>
            <li> : I still use the nono and after a few months I do notice my hair growing in thinner.</li>
            <li> I still use the nono and after a few months I do notice my hair growing in thinner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Used it everyday to see if it would work.  </li>
            <li> However, I suggest you expect to have trouble with the belt and keep your receipt so that you can get a replacement under the warrenty.</li>
            <li> I charged it for two nights and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all every time I would try to turn it on it showed it was dead</li>
            <li> $270.00 is not cheap.</li>
            <li> The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year</li>
            <li> The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year</li>
            <li> Not smooth at all.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it for almost a few months.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> To sum it up; WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> have to go through all that trouble..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> no deffo don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday sometimes twice a day and in 4 months saw no results.  </li>
            <li> As a few others have stated it does take time</li>
            <li> She said I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have had my NONO for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Keep your money in your wallet, these people are laughing all the way to the bank.&lt;br /&gt;For 400 bucks you can probably get a few laser treatments that will get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> NOTICE HOW FEW POSITIVES COMPARED TO NEGATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> If I had it to do all over again, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or my money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It is not a free return unless you return it between 45-60 days after you purchase the product.</li>
            <li> I sell 800,000 of these products over the course of a year with heavy advertisements.</li>
            <li> So I wasted $300.00.</li>
            <li> wait a few days before its to the correct length.</li>
            <li> also the company tries to trick you into saying you can&#x27;t return you called to late when u call on the 60 day return.</li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> At the end of the recommended time, there was no light on the front bar and the unit would not turn on.</li>
            <li> I see they changed the advertisement to &amp;#34;a few weeks&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;immediate results&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I would see results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is a big rip-off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work even close to what they show on TV.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product as I did.</li>
            <li> it sort of burnt up some hair, but not a smooth close finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I went round with stubble on my chin waiting for it to start to work.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is an expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought a no-no a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> SECONDLY, It burns the hair and your poor lip.</li>
            <li> Anyways, after a few weeks of 30-40 minute sessions of \\&quot;hair removal\\&quot; I decided that the no-no wasn&#x27;t working, so I tried to contact their customer service...</li>
            <li> Don,t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion don&#x27;t waste your money on NOno.  </li>
            <li> OMG I JUST GOT THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had trouble with the nono.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> ; Nothing!  Waste of time.</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t nono it everyday</li>
            <li> My NoNo was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few months it stopped getting the hair and my hair was getting thicker, stronger and blacker.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic, if it works at all one can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> Waste of $.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE IT ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK.</li>
            <li> And the NoNo left such a terrible burnt hair smell, which is what it really is doing.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes then the battery would go dead.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the results on the coarse hair on my lower legs, it always feels like they have a couple of days stubble.  </li>
            <li> they promised that since i was having trouble they would extend my time.</li>
            <li> Hair will probably come out of your head if you keep trying this for few</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I also am allergic to scents and the lotion is so heavily scented it gave me a headache every time I used it.</li>
            <li> a waste of money $ time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have a nono which was a gift, have tried it a few times and it sort of worked</li>
            <li> I am so upset I wasted this money because I paid the friend who bought this.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money; I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to use on soft areas, like cheeks, or around curves.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> you have thick hair, or a lot of hair, it may take a couple tries to get all the hair off.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> and I do not see any results after doing it a few times.</li>
            <li> it does not work waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your on this product, stay away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> As the demo states, if the hair doesn&#x27;t come off in 3-4 passes, wait a few minutes and go over it again.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, it does not work.  </li>
            <li> Take it from me, don&#x27;t waste your money!!!P.S.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.\\</li>
            <li> They said I could try the no no free for two months, but they started charging me before the two months was even up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money - try something else.</li>
            <li> Even worse they don&#x27;t want to take it back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money as I did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Does not work, waste of money.</li>
            <li> The buffer will just take off the burnt part of the hair if you go over it lightly once and leave you with annoying stubble.</li>
            <li> Never will I waste money on this again.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as smooth as when shaving.</li>
            <li> I push on.&lt;br /&gt;After a few passes with the</li>
            <li> The only thing worse than this device is the company&#x27;s customer service.  </li>
            <li> The scent this product leaves behind is revulting (burnt hair smell) and their pad of false hope is only present as a distraction.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money and spread the word.</li>
            <li> The NO NO will become a yard sale dollar item within just a few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The advertisement that you present on TV is false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I quit using mine a few months ago and the facial hair is WORSE than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> doing was turning the hair I was trying to get rid of black!  </li>
            <li> but he continued to ask me questions about my location and various other irrelevant inquiries.</li>
            <li> I expected at the very least a little less hair.</li>
            <li> And I have very pale skin and dark brown hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had to flat iron your hair, then you&#x27;ve smelled MUCH worse...</li>
            <li> This does not work on stiff hair on face or legs.</li>
            <li> have coarse dark hair in all the wrong places.</li>
            <li> the NO NO.  Easy to use,</li>
            <li> not sure yet, so far not impressed</li>
            <li> Saw very slight reduction of my hair growth rate</li>
            <li> It does leave a very slight burning but it is nothing compared to the irritation from tweezing.</li>
            <li> Stinks to high heaven when it does remove some of the hair.</li>
            <li> When they say not to allow it to sit in one spot for too long what they really mean is NEVER EVER stop moving it!</li>
            <li> Shocked to see so many negative reviews!!</li>
            <li> so of course I plunked down a weeks hard earned pay and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I burned my chin so badly that I had to wait a week before I used it again.  </li>
            <li> , that is the first bad grade I ever gave to a Amazon Product.</li>
            <li> My real complaint is that they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> We took pictures (no, you won’t find them on Instagram), then asked panelists to shave one leg as usual and use No No and its buffer on the other leg at least three times a week for six weeks.</li>
            <li> id not reduce the amount of hair, nor did it slow down the growth rate.  </li>
            <li> product IS SO BAD and DOES NOT WORK that I called back a week later to ask for refund</li>
            <li> Bad idea - definitely don&#x27;t buy this if you will be stuck with it and are likely to be one of the 98% for whom it did not work.</li>
            <li> just to visually see any removal, and the smell, my wife actually said I should stick to Nair as that didn&#x27;t smell as bad...</li>
            <li> It will be here in 7-10 days, then I send them back the bad one in the same box all paid for</li>
            <li> It will be here in 7-10 days, then I send them back the bad one in the same box all paid for</li>
            <li> I am sorry you all have had such trouble with the product and with their customer service/refunds...</li>
            <li> I does not effectively remove hair and it caused my skin to get red and puffy with repeated using it and still  leaves hair behind.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I wasted $300 that they WILL not give back.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item expecting to have at least slight results.  </li>
            <li> If you have lotion, etc on, it is going to burn onto your applicator tip (I found this out the hard way) and it will mess it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a 5 star rating because it is not a quick hair removal process and wish they&#x27;d include at least one replacement blade for the money!&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for burnt hair smell</li>
            <li> If you already have dry skin, no-no will make it much worse.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful that it would become permanent or at least less troublesome and that by working on my legs that even though the courser hair wasn&#x27;t being removed that perhaps it was being affected and would become finer and...</li>
            <li> my gosh this little @#$!</li>
            <li> The little buffer does not fix that either!</li>
            <li> I received my product in a little over a week and began using it as soon as I received it!  </li>
            <li> This is a horrid little gadget!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly unfortunate this product has such positive hype on commercials/brochures and in stores because it is complete CRAP and does not work!</li>
            <li> Also, if you dont hold the skin taught and try to use it, you may pinch you skin with it, which will leave a little scab (I found this out the hard way</li>
            <li> Like I said before, one application is not going to leave you hair free.ht and try to use it, you may pinch you skin with it, which will leave a little scab (I found this out the hard way too).    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not easy to use, you have to go very slow with it over your skin, and who has time to waste on a half an hour to an hour on your body when your trying to rush out the door to go to work...</li>
            <li> We bought this product expecting it to do at least a little of what they show in their advertisements and that is all it does.</li>
            <li> It worked a little using it at least 3 times a day sometime 4</li>
            <li> To get even VERY little hair off my chin it takes an hour.  </li>
            <li> Very little.</li>
            <li> and it did very little.</li>
            <li> and it took very little hair off.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your hard working money.. because it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your hard earned money on this.</li>
            <li> No No! better than shaving for my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure it will.</li>
            <li> They are not truthful about the results.  </li>
            <li> i am not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Ugh... Waste of money!</li>
            <li> No more epilating woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you may not like it and it is difficult to get your money back!</li>
            <li> , IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME, A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the lotion</li>
            <li> I tried on different part of my body and nothing i thinking if i have to go any slower ill be in my 90&#x27;s the time this thing would do anything.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few months and probably it&#x27;s too late for returning the product.</li>
            <li> it was past the 90 day warranty period and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of trying it, I just gave up; it was already too late for the warranty</li>
            <li> (i didn&#x27;t use the warranty because i thought i&#x27;d get the hang of it eventually, obviously i was wrong).</li>
            <li> Not completely satisfied considering the price.</li>
            <li> The refills are expensive and they don&#x27;t last either.</li>
            <li> Dont even waste your time!</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to operate on upper lip.</li>
            <li> I usually have to shave then</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work and I still have the same hair issues on my face and neck :(</li>
            <li> Have second one never opened and still in box, don&#x27;t want to give to someone if it is useless.</li>
            <li> Well another not satisfied customer.......</li>
            <li> but i found that it was expensive especially when converted to our currency(Trinidad).</li>
            <li> on no no website and funnily enough you are unable to leave customer reviews - not surprised.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So after giving it a try and realizing I am not satisfied with the product I call customer service</li>
            <li> So after giving it a try and realizing I am not satisfied with the product I call customer service</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> But I am not sure I got what she promised.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure they charged me the correct amount since they don&#x27;t give a reciept or detaield packing</li>
            <li> this point, I am not sure I would spend the $300 again.</li>
            <li> my husband tried it on a small patch of hair on his lower arm.&lt;br /&gt;he</li>
            <li> -No many times on my legs and underarms,</li>
            <li> 3 days past before I received a response, coincidentally @</li>
            <li> We are not able to locate an account for you in our system.</li>
            <li> I called the company again to see what could be done and was told I was doing it wrong, to only go over the skin once.  </li>
            <li> I hope they can sucker too few people into their till to stay in business.</li>
            <li> Since I was past the return it just sits in my closet collecting dust.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> I put it in the box and after paying well over $300.00 for it, i was told i am past my return period</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> My dad is Italian, so I got his unfortunate hairy gene -_-</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s case is small and neat.  </li>
            <li> But when using it on my chest, underarms or back it failed to do anything except make a smell of burnt hair.</li>
            <li> after a letter from my solicitors stating we were taking them to the small claims court they folded like a house of cards</li>
            <li> I also did my peach fuzz mustache which I dont usually bother with because my face isnt that hairy</li>
            <li> a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> In fact in the past 15 Years of begin on amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought this meant I would get cash back, but I was wrong...</li>
            <li> Totally useless product, returned for my money back.</li>
            <li> So not only will you have STUBBLES [lousy product]</li>
            <li> and i wasted my time, energy and money hoping it will work!</li>
            <li> until the wire has past</li>
            <li> If you can trim it before hand or shave a day or two before you use it so that your hair is no more than 1/4 inch</li>
            <li> Does not work and the little black rubber band on the unit has broken.  </li>
            <li> I have thick black hair!</li>
            <li> I mean crying</li>
            <li> I used for 2 months and the only thing it worked on was VERY thin hair.  </li>
            <li> given how false the other claims were.</li>
            <li> and you find you wasted so much time trying to believe in something that doesn&#x27;t work you feel stupid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would not even remove the thin thin hair on my inner arm.</li>
            <li> It will not work on stubble at all and is VERY painful, no matter where its used on the body, or how hard or light you press.</li>
            <li> That is a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Hard to use, does not work at all on small areas.  </li>
            <li> It is just hard to use in a small area.</li>
            <li> This is simply not an effective product and gets rid of very little hair.</li>
            <li> Could not get the whopping $300.00 cost refunded because I stupidly waited too long and called on the 61st day and was told refunds only after 60 days.</li>
            <li> the actors on the commercials have false hair and shaving off fake hair do NOT waste your 300 bucks seriously .</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service which is also useless to explain that the black rubber band which is needed to make this pricey little machine function needs to be replaced and slips off the blade</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after my wife read the instructions twice, it did not remove a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;She rechecked the instruction , insured the battery was fully charged still nothing.</li>
            <li> So, now I am left with a very expensive useless product, which is beyond the &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion?</li>
            <li> even tried it myself, pressed it hard on my skin while sliding it, but the thing just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It was too hard to use this on my legs all the time, I just gave up and shaved.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get around the curves on my face</li>
            <li> It was really hard to use in my opinion and it did not remove the hairs.</li>
            <li> Because of the way it works I have a hard time using it under my nose, around my chin because of how my chin is shaped and on my neck.</li>
            <li> a hard spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The nono isn&#x27;t hard to use</li>
            <li> It does not remove hardly any hair.</li>
            <li> and then you rub rather hard with the buffer to get some of the stubble off.  </li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t hardly touch mine.</li>
            <li> and I followed the directions and waited for results for at least a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cutting or burning hair is practically the same as shaving, so even if the device does stay on,</li>
            <li> Cutting or burning hair is practically the same as shaving, so even if the device does stay on,</li>
            <li> And, after 45 days of regular use I am extremely unhappy with results.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the least painful.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the least painful.</li>
            <li> but too late to return it.</li>
            <li> He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no.</li>
            <li> Information confusing on return</li>
            <li> This was the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought and it wasn&#x27;t cheap......</li>
            <li> My goal is to go hairless at least for a month.</li>
            <li> I wanted was information on how to get a replacement part and of course too late to return.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to send it back and never get my refund!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were somewhat rude and demanded I show proof that I paid for my product.</li>
            <li> I forgot to call before the 60 days I was 7 day late</li>
            <li> and they will not issue me a return label until I have had it for at least 45 days.</li>
            <li> and they will not issue me a return label until I have had it for at least 45 days.</li>
            <li> Customer service sucks and is pushy.</li>
            <li> Tried to return and was told we were too late to return the product.  </li>
            <li> Is there a negative star?</li>
            <li> I fell for the advertising - regardless of all the negative reviews - and I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It was an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> At least razors work.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my money back in tears by the disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a girl, so that was a big part of my awkward phase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , let me offer some advice: when purchasing questionable products with questionable success rates and questionable guarantees:  PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD, preferably AMEX.</li>
            <li> so thought at least if I posted here</li>
            <li> I, like others ignored negative reviews - paid $300</li>
            <li> I tried reading instructions but they got confusing</li>
            <li> I proceed to give a profanity-laden lecture about how rude I felt this was.</li>
            <li> Besides that I was getting desperate to treat the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the bleaching process since it&#x27;s time consuming and messy.  </li>
            <li> It tells you to go slow</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go that slow and get it to work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit approximately 4 months ago and it is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It works, but slowly.  </li>
            <li> I tried my underarms and it was just as slow.  </li>
            <li> On my face there were a couple of thick hairs that I kept going over</li>
            <li> Does not remove all of the hair, and doesn&#x27;t slow the growth of hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair</li>
            <li> but it is slow, takes time.</li>
            <li> I use it on the highest setting and run it slowly across my skin.</li>
            <li> and It would take hours to do legs because of how slow you have to go to get this to work and get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> And the biggest thing: I don&#x27;t believe it may slow the hair growth or remove it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go slow.</li>
            <li> Need to use slowly for maximum effect to ensure the hairs are being affected.</li>
            <li> If you go to slow, it burns your skin.</li>
            <li> Then you can rinse off your legs and put on your capi slow lotion</li>
            <li> and they complained that their hair was still thick and needed to use it every 3 days after 3 months.</li>
            <li> slow  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow</li>
            <li> It works, but slowly.</li>
            <li> The smell it leaves is awful and takes forever to remove the hair and when I mean forever I mean forever and doesn&#x27;t even leave the area smooth</li>
            <li> is a waste of plastic and not worth a penny of your hard earned money!!!</li>
            <li> The TV commercials are just plain false.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I am not very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> i think i was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t take all of the hair away and leave a smooth surface, but when you think about it, if the wire could get that close it would probably burn your skin really bad.  </li>
            <li> After several months I found that it is not a permanent removal system, so I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more epilating woohoo!  </li>
            <li> I mean 200 and something dollars for a product that does not work</li>
            <li> I mean 200 and something dollars for a product that does not work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!</li>
            <li> The biggest waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I had to use a razor for summer in the mean time</li>
            <li> Seems useless other places.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Searching all the paper work for an address or phone number was a failure.</li>
            <li> It was a bad experience and now I am 200 short with a janky piece of pink crap that looks like a female Star Trek device.</li>
            <li> I kept using it because at least the stubble didn&#x27;t look as bad as the full-length peach</li>
            <li> So I read the negative reviews after I tried this for about half an hour and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> If you have facial hair that you want gone, buy this one, All those others I tried were just a waste of my time and in some cases painful and irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to a laser in the sense that it&#x27;s very tedious ...</li>
            <li> personally think it&#x27;s too expensive, and useless.</li>
            <li> (seriously) I got a vm...</li>
            <li> He said the previous rep failed to note that in system.</li>
            <li> The No!no! is serious hair removal.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is a POS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> Seriously, they should  not be allowed to advertise and sell it.&lt;br /&gt;Lots</li>
            <li> This policy is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously, how ignorant is this country..?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t get the user guide to work on my DVD or CD players, so i used the little book as a guide.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this though I have wanted to for some time now because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive for what you get in the box</li>
            <li> The NoNo is quite expensive for producing little to no results.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try if for myself even after reading all of the bad reviews, but all of the bad reviews were right!</li>
            <li> Bad product,I returned it to him but don&#x27;t know if he got his money back</li>
            <li> Also when the company will not stand by its product or provide help when the customer is obviously having a bad experience with the product are not good signs.</li>
            <li> I was left with stress, anger, stubble and burn marks.</li>
            <li> I was left with stress, anger, stubble and burn marks.</li>
            <li> and I was completely frustrated with attempting to get it to work properly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want and expensive paperweight.  </li>
            <li> All I got out of this useless thing were a few burn marks on my face.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to do the lip because it is uneven surface.</li>
            <li> Their product sucks and their customer service is even worse.  </li>
            <li> It left painful blisters all over my legs.</li>
            <li> Not good for face because of curves and angles of face</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> My money was wasted I am so sorry I believed add.</li>
            <li> It is complete crap.</li>
            <li> My nono hair removal system which was very expensive and is 2 year old is useless at this point.</li>
            <li> I am so depressed and mad that I even spent the amount i did.  </li>
            <li> Do not spend your hard earned money on this bogus product!</li>
            <li> However, the reason that I purchased this was for the horrible thick ugly very course hair on my chin that I have to shave every single day or someone will notice it.  </li>
            <li> The belt is the weak link in the device.  </li>
            <li> until I seen all the negative reviews!</li>
            <li> I am saving up to have electrolysis treatments; at least I know the hair removal will be permanent!</li>
            <li> When I checked for my refund on my Visa, I was disappointed to see that I only received $90.00 refund.</li>
            <li> After reading her all the negative reviews, she has changed her tune!  </li>
            <li> We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the device.</li>
            <li> + tax - was so disappointed when it just left stubble.</li>
            <li> At least there&#x27;s no pain with the No!no!,</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that my mother was in a terrible car accident and sustained traumatic brain injury I have simply not had time to use the machine.  </li>
            <li> When I called with this complaint, they would not replace the tip and told me to use a razor!</li>
            <li> The smell of burning hair is pretty awful</li>
            <li> This product totally sucks so save your money, girls!  </li>
            <li> Even if you go over it multiple times as the literature suggests you will not remove the hair, it will get burned down to a dreadful stubble.</li>
            <li> Waste of money !!!</li>
            <li> By tips I mean the blade!</li>
            <li> a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Then when I finally did get it to work a little, I ended up with a nasty welt on my arm that took overnight to go away.</li>
            <li> this is an outrageously expensive product and hardly performs...</li>
            <li> it does leave a burnt hair smell, but i was expecting that, and it&#x27;s really not that bad.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> I could have just bought the buffer and I would have gotten the same results as this stupid piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated; i spent hours trying it over and over; taking breaks to give my irritated skin a break.</li>
            <li> I can run that stupid thing over the same area 3 and 4 times and the hairs are still there.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much my poor mother paid for it.</li>
            <li> I am exhausted.  </li>
            <li> no refunds on a poor product....</li>
            <li> have not experienced any pain, burns, rashes, or problems with the wires.</li>
            <li> According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> I would not expect a product intended to reduce unwanted hair to make the issue significantly worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the poor reviews.</li>
            <li> the advertisement on tv is all a bunch of bull crap... making people believe that this product works just to make you spend over two hundred dollars and plus tax and shipping and handling on this product and when it comes to adding up the total, it costs over three hundred dollars..</li>
            <li> Her hairs are quite thin and this device does nothing.</li>
            <li> a plucked chicken don&#x27;t waste your money  if the rollers get caught in your skin it burns you</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> Approximately, 95% of the hair was not removed even after repeated passes (recommended 4 passes), I performed 5-6 passes without burning or damaging my skin and the hair was still there.</li>
            <li> It is not a great product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not happy in Virginia.</li>
            <li> Alas, I ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF DOING LASER HAIR REMOVAL</li>
            <li> Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> (pun in there it seems)  is even worse.</li>
            <li> Crap item no money back</li>
            <li> There is no scientific proof behind this concept and no result.</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her</li>
            <li> and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her</li>
            <li> Instead of helping, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> but alas it did not.</li>
            <li> Their claims to \\&quot;try it\\&quot; are false.  </li>
            <li> with false claims&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> That company should stop advertising falsely that this is the be-all end-all to hair removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> believe they get allowance for so much false advertising.</li>
            <li> The claims they make on tv are false.  </li>
            <li> this is false addvertizing, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Is so expensive and is very difficult to use and the results are suppose to come in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product for the high price.  </li>
            <li> Read the other bad reviews for additional truth.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have done serious sleuthing to get permanent hair removal results.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have done serious sleuthing to get permanent hair removal results.  </li>
            <li> patches of hair just would not come out on my legs, the hair grew back and not sure if it was finer but still looks awful and have been looking for an answer ever since.  </li>
            <li> Also, its much less painful that waxing.</li>
            <li> Definetly my worst most stupid buy ever</li>
            <li> Shaving is, obviously, less painful but epilating lasts longer.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money I spent I am very, very unhappy.  </li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t be like me who wanted to prove other bad reviews wrong.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t be like me who wanted to prove other bad reviews wrong.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst product I have purchased in my 45 years!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Purchasing this product is by FAR one of the worst decisions I have ever made.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T FALL FOR THE FALSE ADVERTISING OR THE FAKE REVIEWS</li>
            <li> &quot; they provide afterwards because you might as well take a dull nail file to your skin, and c) customer service for this product is completely useless!</li>
            <li> Wished my wife had returned within the 30 or 60 days:( $390 dollars wasted.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The transaction with the seller was very unpleasant due to the unresponsiveness and lack of communication despite attempts by myself to contact them.  </li>
            <li> Bad customer service and the website sucks.</li>
            <li> Silly me...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not try this within the money-back period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a glorified child&#x27;s toy with blinking lights and fake settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , ill keep writing about it on a blog.&lt;br /&gt;Gooodluck to anyone who plans on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Replacement tips are extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of use the No-No stopped working as an elastic band on the roller head came out (without being broken!).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will have to deal with the loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( I was unable to flip the pics...</li>
            <li> Sorry no stars for me load of rubbish  just buy a buffer pad from pound shop rub it over the unwanted hair</li>
            <li> and write it off as an expensive lesson learned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so tedious and time consuming to remove the smallest finest hairs.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible and although it may seem like it&#x27;s working in the beginning, that&#x27;s basically the only results you will see.</li>
            <li> Ill return it.</li>
            <li> Ill return it.</li>
            <li> No-No failed to remove the hair</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what it doesn&#x27;t do well!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It was useless.</li>
            <li> am i doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Sorry, but would not recommend.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it does not work as well as they claim it does.  </li>
            <li> What a lousy product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, by the time my mother used it the trial period had expired.</li>
            <li> No is (unfortunately)</li>
            <li> If you remove hair below the skin surface i.e., by tweezing, waxing or using the No No, it merely APPEARS to \\&quot;grow slower.\\</li>
            <li> The burning hair smell is just AWFUL, also you have to go over the same spot for like 5 times, you still have stubbles not to meantion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, I find it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about</li>
            <li> It basically singes hair off, and there is a faint singed hair smell,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> does not work and having a horrible time getting my money back</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, nope.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t appeal to me and seemed complicated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, UPS did not pick up package as scheduled.</li>
            <li> All the TV ads must be fake.</li>
            <li> I lost interest when it didn&#x27;t perform as promised, and it has been an expensive lesson for me.</li>
            <li> Return process was difficult</li>
            <li> IF THIS APPLIANCE GOES WRONG AFTER THE YEAR&#x27;S WARRANTY EXPIRES, THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING IT REPAIRED, even if you are prepared to pay.</li>
            <li> This system sadly doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me because I tried lazar my Beard, and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Even though it was expensive, I had to have it.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, the 60 day return guarantee had expired so now I&#x27;m stuck with a useless product that I paid $300 for.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there was none.</li>
            <li> the buffer pad was nearly useless.</li>
            <li> Such a rip off , do not buy this for any reason at all , it&#x27;s a horrible product .</li>
            <li> are WRONG...</li>
            <li> Sorry for him.</li>
            <li> This was a expensive lesson I learned, I should of listened to all the reviews.</li>
            <li> My nono failed after four months, feeling it should have lasted longer then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too expensive for what it does.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> It was a expensive useless purchase.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong, I&#x27;m still skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult and time consuming to use</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I did not , and I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will keep trying, but not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Silly me didn&#x27;t read the details on the website.</li>
            <li> Why this product is so expensive, I have no clue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It also failed to work on the area I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> All of the pieces were not there, was unable to us</li>
            <li> I agree the sales staff is lousy.</li>
            <li> I only have one thing to say about this product --  WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is an expensive product</li>
            <li> He was shivering and he seemed kinda dazed</li>
            <li> Expensive and completely useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was told sorry we do not sell replacement bands.</li>
            <li> Number one, it is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s too expensive to get and find out it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I wasted £200 on this crap</li>
            <li> Even with the extended warrantee I was unable to get a refund.</li>
            <li> and the rep didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> and the rep didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> so the machine doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;skip\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t difficult to use..</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very possibly the worst product and sleaziest company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product even though I was skeptical....</li>
            <li> Sorry ladies keep on waxing, shaving.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and it does not work.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical.</li>
            <li> While I was both skeptical and hopeful this would be the holy grail of hair removal, I decided to take the plunge anyway and purchase one.</li>
            <li> very very very Poor unprofessional customer service, i tried to cancel the order like five min after I ordered it and as soon as i told them why i called</li>
            <li> They either are made over seas and of very poor quality or do not do what they are made to do.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hardly been used ,I was disappointed at the outcome</li>
            <li> I had to be the defiant person who reads all the reviews and says \\&quot;It can&#x27;t be that bad.\\&quot; Trust me; it is worse than bad.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, this device is very painful and will burn the skin and smells incredibly awful when it singes the hair off.</li>
            <li> i have a horrible dark bruise looking marking at the bottom of my chin.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a terrible rating due to the burns that I received from it upon the 1st use, the lack of level control which was advertised with the product, and the fact that it burned my skin but didn&#x27;t remove any hair during the process!  </li>
            <li> I would have given it a negative star if I could have!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been forced to buy a product before, let alone threatened with bad credit if I refused to pay for something that DOESN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product and wasted $200.  </li>
            <li> Quite unhappy.  </li>
            <li> Customer Service stinks....</li>
            <li> I was desperate for a hair removal system that worked.</li>
            <li> It has been a painful &amp; expensive struggle.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase the Nono because of the reviews I read, but I was desperate and saw that I could return it.  </li>
            <li> Crazy, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> It gave me a cold sore.</li>
            <li> a) it stinks like burning hair when you use it</li>
            <li> WASTE of your TIME and money equals worthless !!  </li>
            <li> My advice-don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this overpriced worthless piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I read the reviews after purchasing the no!no!.</li>
            <li> Now it sits on a shelf-pretty expensive dust collector!</li>
            <li> Absolutly useless and time consuming!</li>
            <li> The small cuts are still there, my chin looks horrible</li>
            <li> she just gets mad and gives up.</li>
            <li> she just gets mad and gives up.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> very disappointing useless piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> I guess because I was now stuck with the piece of crap, the foreign speaking woman thought she could be nasty to me.  </li>
            <li> If you buy, it would be hard to return and will experience horrible customer service</li>
            <li> but stinks so bad she will not longer use it.</li>
            <li> This thing stinks so bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get into (and keep) the correct position.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just a very expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> No No Machine very expensive and does not work.</li>
            <li> This was a very expensive item.</li>
            <li> We had a very unfortunate experience with this product and the company.</li>
            <li> They make the hoops you have to jump through impossible to achieve.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product before I read the reviews, Bad Idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew going in, that it would smell bad and it does.</li>
            <li> It does smell bad..</li>
            <li> called customer service to share my bad experience</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I can&#x27;t beleive that there are any bad reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> I read all the bad reviews on this thing but, decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> The burns are not as bad for me as I have seen some people say; they just leave some redness that goes away over night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why others think they have bad customer service.  </li>
            <li> but my boyfriend was complaining about how bad it smelled.</li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> it was still a shockingly bad bit of junk.</li>
            <li> I read all the bad reviews on this thing but, decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> Believe me it has a lot of bad reviews for a valid reason.</li>
            <li> cannot recommend it because it could also give you a bad burn.</li>
            <li> bad no use gadget.</li>
            <li> So as I said for me the No No was a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The burnt hair smell is kinda bad</li>
            <li> WELL all the bad reviews explains why the commercials are on day and night.</li>
            <li> I feel bad wasting $100 on this product and now it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom cabinet collecting dust.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that bad</li>
            <li> she just waits and if she gets bad customer service reps (every company has them</li>
            <li> she just waits and if she gets bad customer service reps (every company has them</li>
            <li> I think this product gets a lot of bad reviews because it is being compared to a razor.</li>
            <li> me, this was a bad investment.</li>
            <li> When I became frustrated that this product was not delivering I decided to contact customer service.  </li>
            <li> It does kinda trim ur hairs but it leaves a nasty smell behind and sometimes burns ur skin</li>
            <li> I consider this a nasty marketing trick to escape refunding unhappy customers, and anyone that having the bad luck who falls in that trap winds up loosing a sad 350$.</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS!!!!  </li>
            <li> Email to this : [...]  </li>

            <li> I have tried using it since April, as well as my sister, and we are very unhappy with the non-results.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!  </li>
            <li> This is a useless toy!!</li>
            <li> and I still had hair, how stupid it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a joke, all you get with the buffer pad is to remove the burnt hair on your face, that stupid cream that comes with it</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, watching the commercials (stupid, I know), I decided to try this.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought a used one from Ebay!  Plugged it in got light. Went back to it use next day and it was dead.  No return allowed. Was surprised to see blades to shave off the hair.  Directions saying to buff afterwords. Waste of money !!!&lt;br /&gt;Went back to my old epilady trio hair remover and sugar wax for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Laser may be a better option but have not tried because of skin discoloration being reported.</li>
            <li> Another gem in an outstanding series.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 NO  NO&#x27;s and received only one for $344. Quite unhappy.  The one I received is a gift and not opened.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest waste of money EVER. I bought it specifically for facial hair-after 6 months, all I have is burn marks and continued hair growth! Please save your money; invest in any hair remover than this one.  As an aside, I find it interesting that you can contact only by phone; their website will only sell you a nono, they will NOT provide you an address by phone!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about 2 months as they say it takes over 45 days to see the full effects. I bought it as I have very fine hair along my jawline which I wanted to get rid of. It does burn the hair, if you use it for long enough but it doesn&#x27;t burn it right down so instead of hair you have singed stubble. It takes forever to do and the hair grows back really quickly afterwards. It is actually growing back much thicker than before too. Not at all impressed, please save yourself the money and don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I purchased the NoNo thinking it would perminently remove hair. After several months I found that it is not a permanent removal system, so I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does it work on peach fuzz? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Can you use it on your face? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Can you use it on your eyebrows for shaping? No. You still have to tweeze or wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this specifically for bikini area. It does NOT work. It will not work on coarse thick hair. I have coarse leg hair as well and it simply did not work. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t work. Why I ordered it anyway is purely a mystery. Probably just the lingering hope that I would! I got my NoNo! a couple days ago, and the very first time I used it I saw a huge difference. I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like they say.  I still have to wax when done using the No No Hair Removal System.&lt;br /&gt;Have waited over 3 weeks to give it a good try not happy with results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my No No for a few weeks now. I started using it on one arm to get a feel for the devise. Once I&#x27;d mastered it I used it on my target area... my \\&quot;fuzzy face\\&quot;. Normally my hair is very thick and dark. Which causes me to be extremely self conscience. No-No has changed that dramatically. I have never been so pleased with a hair removal product. With a little time, determination and reasonable expectation, I have found this to be nothing short of a miracle. Also, its much less painful that waxing. This morning I asked my best friend if she noticed any change in the density of the hair on my lip and chin. She replied with a resounding YES!!! Silly me... now its summer and short sleeves are in order so I better get the hair off my other arm.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon; it was a gift so I don&#x27;t know how much my poor mother paid for it. Unfortunately I did not try this within the money-back period. Buying it anywhere, for anything over $5.00 is a SCAM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device didn&#x27;t stay on, pure and simple. It was the nitpickiest device ever. I had to hold it at the exact angle it wanted, move it at the exact speed, the exact pressure, and it seemed to turn itself off as it neared denser areas of hair - WTH? I&#x27;m talking about less than 10 seconds. Don&#x27;t even think about using this device on any curved part of your body - it shut off when I tried. It&#x27;s a glorified child&#x27;s toy with blinking lights and fake settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing burned, no hair removed, zapped, or cut in any way. I was literally surprised to see the commercials and comments of people whose hair is magically burned away or whatever they claim happens. Nothing of that sort happened for me. It didn&#x27;t matter what setting or tip I used even when fully charged. I tested this on my very Caucasian skin (no marks, scars, freckles, open skin, etc.), on my wrist/forearm with visible but \\&quot;sandy\\&quot; colored, fairly dense, if fine hair. I would be more okay if there were results at all to comment about, even if it wasn&#x27;t ideal results, but again, the device wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I did not misuse the product in any way and I followed the directions and waited for results for at least a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair might have lessened/slowed for a little while (all of a week, perhaps) but it is so not worth it. It would take me hours, plural, per sitting to get any kind of result on a tiny area, and that was my first and only \\&quot;successful\\&quot; attempt. So, it is **temporary slowing of hair growth at best.** I wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles from this product even if it remained on long enough to function, or a similar product that was less particular about its function. The buffing pad tore my skin up, made it flakey and unmanageable, and did not remove any hair either. The word \\&quot;Thermo\\&quot; means &#x27;heat,&#x27; so you are burning your hair (if the device even works). Cutting or burning hair is practically the same as shaving, so even if the device does stay on, No No! will never give you any kind of permanent or even helpful result. Also, WHY INCLUDE A BUFFER PAD? Put simply, this is a scam. I did not make any attempt to contact customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk to your dermatologist. I have used a dematologist with a new chilled laser that has removed a great number of my sort of light/sort of dark facial hair. It&#x27;s practically painless, just a little sting becuase it actually zaps the hair follice.

            <li> I am going to re-evaluate it is three months.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for this and ordered it right away.  I have a crazy 2 year old who doesn&#x27;t leave me much time for myself and this has totally cut down on the time it takes me to get ready.  I&#x27;ve been using my nono for 6 months now and I only have to use it every two weeks.  The results have been great and my man loves that I always have a smooth body!</li>
            <li> Great item fast shipping thanks AAA+</li>
            <li> This is the worst purchase and the biggest scam ever..... I ordered the product before I read the reviews, Bad Idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the almost $300.00 price, more like $3... oh and they tell you it comes with a free case valued at $50 OMG! what a JOke.. the 50 dollar case is a cheap gray little thing thats hard to zip.. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. doesnt do what it says it will do..&lt;br /&gt;2. some hair came off but left behind stubble, so i had to go back over it with a razor&lt;br /&gt;3. Fear of being serverly burned.. it gets hot, sparks and smells like burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. very very very Poor unprofessional customer service, i tried to cancel the order like five min after I ordered it and as soon as i told them why i called i was hung up on or told to call sales who told me to call customer service and back and forth.. that went on for about an hour ( I refused to give up I thought surely someone is going to help me) I even told them I would be reporting them to Better Business, that really made them hang up.. so I finally just gave up... waited for it to come in the mail then return it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in the mail today, i cannot tell a lie I was kind of excited, i said what the hey..maybe i should give it a try.. i charged it up... installed the blades... (already too much time ) as i began to use it, it started sparking and all i could smell was burning hair( who wants to smell that). some hair was removed but not much, my leg was still stubby afterward and my skin was irritated..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infomercial makes it look so easy and simple to use, but when you receive it the directions even tell you its going to take time to get used to ( I ordeded to save time) Big waste of time money and plus I feel like a fool..</li>
            <li> No matter which approach you take, I think all hair removal products are the same in that they all have their pros and cons. This product is no different except for the heavy price tag. The pitfall for me with this product is that you have to wait until some hair grows back to use it. I like to feel clean shaven at all times so a razor or hair removal cream works best for me. I could overlook some of the other complaints reviewers have with this product. I guess it depends on your needs and preferences. But with the heavy price tag, I would recommend leaving this product on the shelf.</li>
            <li> It really works as all the commercials says it does...I brought this for my wife and she has been very happy with how easy it works and that the results are real.</li>
            <li> I found No No! better than shaving for my face. No it doesn&#x27;t remove hair but it does remove most of my peach fuzz that was getting too long and I did not want to shave and get stubbles. So it does what I need it to do. And I do feel it reduces growth. And it may have stopped some of the thicker hair I got from tweezing. I don&#x27;t tweeze any more and I feel it is better.</li>
            <li> I bought this promotional package for my wife at the trynono website after watching the infomercial on TV. Having read through most of the negative feedback here, I still decided to buy the product because they also offered the 60 days money back guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after using it the first time, my wife confirmed the product didn&#x27;t work. However, we wanted to give it more time and kept using it for a week. And guess what? It still didn&#x27;t work. No surprise there. Eventually we returned the product, and hopefully the \\&quot;money back guaranteed\\&quot; will work better than the product itself - still waiting for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I said it didn&#x27;t work. In the infomercial, those beautiful ladies just slide the device once or twice on their arms and legs, and they&#x27;re done with perfect results. In reality, my wife slided it back and forth at least 10 times, but the device couldn&#x27;t create a closer shaving. A little bit of the hair was burnt [and we could smell the burn] but the hair was still very very visible. It looked like the device was only able to cut the top - about 1/3 - of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it myself, pressed it hard on my skin while sliding it, but the thing just didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m still a hairy man! Calling it a \\&quot;Hair Removal Device\\&quot; is pretty misleading as it doesn&#x27;t remove anything. Thinking about buying No!no!? No! No!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I could handle the burnt smell if it would have worked.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on corse hair. It was returned</li>
            <li> It relies on a glow wire in the machine, melting the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to get burned, and pretty much useless for the bigger hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it in private parts, and on surfaces that aren&#x27;t smooth, or the glow wire could burn through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had it cut in one of my birthmarks, and it hurted for a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think it&#x27;s too expensive, and useless. Get a hair removal cream! Much better!</li>
            <li> Do Not Waste Your Money. Absolute Scam.</li>
            <li> I have this model and tried it for a while then put it up after it didn&#x27;t work. I got it back out and thought I would try it again still no good. I bought this about 3 years ago and wished I would have sent it back. I have gone back to shaving. Its cheaper and it works. No!No! doesn&#x27;t. On TV you see the lady take it and put it on her husband&#x27;s arm and the hair is gone that is BS. I tried it on my arm to see if it worked and when it didn&#x27;t I thought this is going back. I never got around to sending it back so, now I am stuck with a piece of ____. Hope this helps someone else. I see it more on TV since its coming Christmas.. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I made my mom buy this for me with hopes that it would be a miracle worker, and though it was pretty good, im a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt; It definitely helped, but i still have to shave my legs because they were too stubbly, even after using the nono for what seemed to be hours.&lt;br /&gt;I tired it on my arms, and it did a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hairy tummy and it really didn&#x27;t do a good job. It left SO much little hairs, it was as if i just trimmed it really low. i used it on my neck area and stuff. It did alight.&lt;br /&gt;Im going to be making a blog to keep up with my results, so you should definitely try and find it. Email to this : [...]  so i can give you the link to my blog, though i havent made it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, if your legs are a really big issue, you should consider getting it. because after i use the nono and shave, my legs feel so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways, ill keep writing about it on a blog.&lt;br /&gt;Gooodluck to anyone who plans on purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> i ordered the nono and did not have very high expectations as you never know what you are going to get.  i was greatly surprised to see that as i used it more and more i did not have to do any other hair removal.  it was such a good investment and saved me so much money waxing and shaving.... i would recommend it to anyone that has to get rid of hair all the time and find themselves not being able to wear what they want to that day because they forgot to shave.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and tried it out yesterday. I ordered it off of an infomercial with Kassi Depaiva. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t get the user guide to work on my DVD or CD players, so i used the little book as a guide. I charged the little guy for the 5 hours required, and started on my legs and to be honest that sparking sound scared me and I wasn&#x27;t sure i was doing it right. But i guess as long as the blue light is going its working. I read a review where someone said it stank of \\&quot;burnt hair\\&quot; - um, well, it&#x27;s burning your hair, the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. When i used the buffer, it took all the hair off my leg, no joke!  I said, \\&quot;Oh my gosh this little @#$! works!\\&quot; Then I was brave and tried it on my face, it was hard to get around the edges, and it did burn a little when i&#x27;d go to slow, but not enough to make me stop using it. (I tried laser treatment and those bolts of light stung.) but I will continue to try and master this product and will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-27-15&lt;br /&gt;I meant to update this review and my rating long ago. Let me just say this thing really burned when I would use it on my face - scary. It was too hard to use this on my legs all the time, I just gave up and shaved.I left the rating at 2 stars because I can&#x27;t really comment on its effectiveness since I gave up after a month and half. Hope this helps someone. Not sure it will.</li>
            <li> let me start by saying i have been thinking about buying this for a few years now and when i saw the infomercial to try it free for 2 months, i couldn&#x27;t resist.  i&#x27;m glad i waited because the older model was corded and it looks much bigger than the 8800 model.  i received my no no on june 12.  after charging it for 5 hours i couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  it took me about 3 minutes to get the hang of it especially around curves.  it does leave a burnt hair smell, but i was expecting that, and it&#x27;s really not that bad.  i think i was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t take all of the hair away and leave a smooth surface, but when you think about it, if the wire could get that close it would probably burn your skin really bad.  i decided that since i could send it back if i wanted to, i would use it pretty much every day. well that lasted about 3 weeks and then i started using it every other day.  i must say i am very impressed with it.  i started seeing and feeling results last week.  i decided to put it away for 2 weeks and see what happens.  so far maybe about 20% of the hair is coming back on my legs, but not in all areas.  my arms are still about 95% hair free and the hair that is coming back is a lot softer, but then again there isn&#x27;t very much of it there to judge yet.  i&#x27;m doing this test to decide if i want to keep it or not.  i still have 3 weeks to decide if i&#x27;m going to keep it, but i think i am.  i have a home waxing kit that works fine, but if you&#x27;ve ever tried waxing the back of your legs, you&#x27;ll understand what a mess that can be.  i usually no no sitting on the bed watching tv and since it burns the hair away, there are no little hairs to clean up.  i have burned myself a few times, but the burns are very minor.  they are the width of the wire and they look like a little scratch that go away in a day or so and they aren&#x27;t really noticeable.  this is the second no no i have had.  the first one i got started acting up, and i called customer service and they told me they would send me another one in 5 to 7 days.  well i received it in 2 days and i returned the other one.  i must say the customer service is great. i read some reviews that mentioned the thermal tips.  i used the tips i got with the first one for many hours and when i returnd the unit, the tips were still in good working order.  the tips are also a lot cheaper now.  i think the old ones were something like $25.00 each, but the new ones are like 3 for $25, and customer service told me that they have a club, where if you sign up you can get tips, a buffer and the lotion for $29.00, which is a good deal considering the lotion sell for almost $50.00 by itself.  i love how the lotion smells, but i only use it if i have to cool down a certain area. i also did the back of the neck of a male friend and it took 3 weeks for the hair to start growing back.  so now once a month, he comes over to \\&quot;get his neck no no&#x27;d\\&quot;.  i know this is a major purchase, so i will continue to give updates, good and bad, in case anyone is on the fence about buying one.  but so far, i am impressed and i am happy with my results.ey told me they would send me another one in 5 to 7 days.  well i received it in 2 days and i returned the other one.  i must say the customer service is great. i read some reviews that mentioned the thermal tips.  i used the tips i got with the first one for many hours and when i returnd the unit, the tips were still in good working order.  the tips are also a lot cheaper now.  i think the old ones were something like $25.00 each, but the new ones are like 3 for $25, and customer service told me that they have a club, where if you sign up you can get tips, a buffer and the lotion for $29.00, which is a good deal considering the lotion sell for almost $50.00 by itself.  i love how the lotion smells, but i only use it if i have to cool down a certain area. i also did the back of the neck of a male friend and it took 3 weeks for the hair to start growing back.  so now once a month, he comes over to \\&quot;get his neck no no&#x27;d\\&quot;.  i know this is a major purchase, so i will continue to give updates, good and bad, in case anyone is on the fence about buying one.  but so far, i am impressed and i am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I bought this item expecting to have at least slight results.  They make it sound magical, therefore I knew that actual results could never live up to their claims.  And, after 45 days of regular use I am extremely unhappy with results.  I expected to see some hair removed but it isn&#x27;t the case.  The first time I used it I burned my chin so badly that I had to wait a week before I used it again.  I have used it 4 to 5 times a week. To get even VERY little hair off my chin it takes an hour.  After that work I have to tweeze the rest and it comes right back.  They are not truthful about the results.  Not even close!  PLEASE LISTEN TO ME:  Save your money!!!!!  I wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> i am not satisfied with the product.I am looking to return the product. too much work; not worth the $ amount.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money! It doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> In the past I have spent a lot in beauty salons that used the Epi-Light system... and it was very good... but I couldnt keep up with the appointments because they cost too much: between $100 and $200 every three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is complaining about the ineffectiveness of the NoNo device it is surely because they are not using it correctly... if the blue light is constant, the humming sound is constant and the air smells like burning hair... you&#x27;re doing it right!&lt;br /&gt;The soothing cream is very pleasant.  The buffing is absolutely gentle.  If the hair is not completely gone today, give your skin a rest and try again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I just bought the No!No! 8800. I knew going in, that it would smell bad and it does. My problem is: The small Thermicon tip that came with it failed after first use. It lasted about 20 to 30 minutes. Just long enough for me to get the hang of using the No!No!, then it burned out. I found out there&#x27;s no warranty on the tips, so I was out of luck. Replacement tips are extremely expensive. I suggest that anyone considering buying one should watch the reviews on YouTube. Would I buy one again? HELL NO!NO!</li>
            <li> My sister in-law and I both saw the NoNo infomercial at the same time and were both really eager to try it. Shortly after we saw the ad on TV we went online to read some of the customer reviews here on Amazon. The second I saw that a lot of the reviews were negative I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the money or hassle. My sister in-law however, was convinced it would somehow work for her and ordered it anyway. My sis in-law lives with me, so when her NoNo arrived I saw it as an opportunity to try it without taking the risk myself .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hairstyle that&#x27;s really short in the back and requires my neck to be shaved. I dislike having to shave it all the time, so I had her try the NoNo on the back of my neck. At first it was just warm to the touch then after just a few seconds; it got down right painfully hot. All it did was singe the top of the stubble on the back of my neck, leaving me with a nasty burnt hair smell, and didn&#x27;t get rid of the hair at all (no matter how it was scrubbed later in the shower, or rubbed with the pad that comes with it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out on her arms, my sis-in law discovered that it does work (kind of) BUT the hair has to be a bit long. It will not work on stubble at all and is VERY painful, no matter where its used on the body, or how hard or light you press. The infomercial claims the NoNo is painless. I can tell you from first hand experience that this is an outright lie. It feels like having a curling iron pressed against your skin. It even left a few burn marks on my sister in-law&#x27;s arms! So does it really work? Not in a way that&#x27;s actually useful. Like I said before, the hair has to be a bit gown out for it to really work and who want&#x27;s to wait until they look like a sasquatch until they can do anything about unwanted hair? I personally will be sticking with my razor and shaving gel; its a lot less expensive, doesn&#x27;t burn me, doesn&#x27;t leave me stinking, and actually works.</li>
            <li> After using the NoNo for several months, I believe that the reason some people give it a bad review is because they have not used it long enough to start seeing results. The first few times I used it on my legs and arms, I thought it didn&#x27;t work because much of the coarser hair in some areas would not rub off with the smoother. However, I immediately noticed that after use on my legs, I had the smoothest shave ever, even without any lotion. Before, even right after shaving, they still felt somewhat scratchy around my knees and other areas. Some hair in other areas didn&#x27;t rub off with the smoother either, but I noticed that after each use, the hair that does grow back, is much finer and there is less of it. After three months, I can now see that within another few months, the hair that was initially too course to rub off with the smoother, will be fine enough that it will. This is an incredible invention as so many people know who have battled unwanted hair for so many years, plus we can use it in the privacy of our own home! I am so thankful for this amazing product!!</li>
            <li> First of all, as with many info - mercial type products, it is not going to work exactly how you see on TV. It is not going to be one sweep on your leg and all of the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;This will work for you, as long as:&lt;br /&gt;(1) You get the stroke down. You have to keep the no no on a pretty steady pace when you sweep an area or it will not work. Also, it works for the hair that is growing in the opposite direction you are sweeping. So, you should go over an area in both directions to catch everything. On average for me, it takes one time in one direction, one time in the opposite, and then one more time in the first direction.&lt;br /&gt;(2) The area is clean, and you either use the buffer or scrub the area after. If you have lotion, etc on, it is going to burn onto your applicator tip (I found this out the hard way) and it will mess it up. The buffer does work for me. Some of the stubble will stay behind after you sweep the area and the buffer really does help get the hair off for me.&lt;br /&gt;(3) You are consistent and dilligent. The directions say you shouldnt let the hair get much longer than stubble length. If the hair is too long, the hair will not burn off all the way. Right now, I am using it about 2x&#x27;s a week on areas that are hairier (legs, underarms). And it does work. I have used it for about 3 weeks now and I am noticing the hair coming in more sporadically and less thick. On the bikini line (which I dont shave as often as legs and underarms), I noticed a change with the first application. The hair grew back much less and finer.&lt;br /&gt;(4)Adjust the setting for the area. If you have areas that you have shaved repeatedly for a long time, the hair will be much tougher. I use the maximum setting for legs and underarms. I use the lightest setting for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of face, this may not be the best thing for people with a lot of facial hair. It is much harder to get the timing of the stroke down on your face since the area is much smaller. Also, if you dont hold the skin taught and try to use it, you may pinch you skin with it, which will leave a little scab (I found this out the hard way too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used every hair removal technique under the sun (waxing, threading, electrolysis, plucking, laser) and this is by far the least painful. All you will feel is warmth as you sweep the area. I have sensitive skin, and I have not broken out. With every other method I have used, I got a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,this is a good product and will work if you are dilligent and follow the directions, and if you are realistic with your expectations. Like I said before, one application is not going to leave you hair free.ht and try to use it, you may pinch you skin with it, which will leave a little scab (I found this out the hard way too).

            <li> DO NOT order this product! Their claims to \\&quot;try it\\&quot; are false.  Here&#x27;s my story...&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the no!no! hair removal system directly from them. They charged my first installment of $112&lt;br /&gt;The product IS SO BAD and DOES NOT WORK that I called back a week later to ask for refund instructions.&lt;br /&gt;SCAM 1: They tell you you&#x27;ll get a full refund on your purchase&lt;br /&gt;SCAM 2: When you call to ask for refund instructions, the customer service tries to talk you out of it. I called THREE DIFFERENT TIMES and each one of the reps tried to talk me into keeping it.  NONE of them brought up the bogus return policy. YET.  They said things like \\&quot;keep using it for one week every day,\\&quot; \\&quot;it takes two weeks to see results\\&quot; and all kinds of crap.&lt;br /&gt;SCAM 3: Operator number 3 told me that if I still didn&#x27;t want it, to call back and ask for her extension and she would take off $50.  She said that I had 45 days to return it and still get a full refund&lt;br /&gt;SCAM 4: I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO TRY IT 45 DAYS! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  I called again and now the operator tells me the truth about their return policy.  YOU HAVE TO WAIT 45 days before you return it to get a refund. If you return it sooner, they make you pay shipping and handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my second payment is supposed to be October 1&lt;br /&gt;The 45 days aren&#x27;t up until October 22&lt;br /&gt;SO THEY&#x27;RE GOING TO CHARGE ME FOR A SECOND INSTALLMENT AND MAKE ME WAIT FOR 45 DAYS BEFORE THEY WILL CONSIDER REFUNDING MY MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to change my mind between now and 45 days, and I suspect there&#x27;s more hidden scam to come.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, I guess this should qualify as SCAM 5:&lt;br /&gt;I asked to speak to a supervisor and after being on hold for 15 minutes (seriously) I got a vm...I left my information and at the end of the vm it said \\&quot;your message was sent to an EXAMPLE supervisor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT THE HECK IS AN EXAMPLE SUPERVISOR!???? SO JUST ONE MORE SCAM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRODUCT.  DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT ORDER IT!  You can get better results from masking tape.</li>
            <li> Received my No!No!. Instructions were less than helpful. I have very fair skin and found that even on the lightest setting, it burned my skin. No scaring of course, but not worth the pain / effort.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! It was a hassle to even ask for a refund. When they finally told me they would refund me, I found out I have to pay for shipping.... back to ISREAL!  Worst product ever! Please don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t work how it&#x27;s advertised. Just burns the hair and leaves pretty big stubble. The little buffer does not fix that either! Ugh... Waste of money!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003U8GIB4 no!no! 8800 Series Deluxe Hair Removal Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a good experience with this product. After about two weeks of use the No-No stopped working as an elastic band on the roller head came out (without being broken!). It also did not remove hair very well for the short time that it was functional. I do not know if I received a defective product or if all No-NOs work this way.  What a waste of money&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I hope I can retrieve my money. What a bad experience! THIS IS INDEED A NO-NO!</li>
            <li> The NoNo is cute, painless, and will get rid of hair. I want to be clear that the hair is burned and smells as such. Fortunately the smell is not unbearable. Not \\&quot;fire burn\\&quot;, more of \\&quot;melted burned\\&quot; but at least it is painless. This is explained in the manual but I wanted to stress it in this review for those that do not read thoroughly because this \\&quot;effect\\&quot; is not clear in the infomercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in some of the other reviews, I too experienced problems with customer service and it took a few calls to resolve the problems. My first NoNo was ordered using the payment plan but when I received the item it was clearly a used NoNo so I returned it. There were no additional charges billed on my credit card but, they were supposed to send me a replacement. After two months of waiting for the replacement, customer service claimed something happened in the system and a replacement was not sent so, I ordered a second one. This time I PAID IN FULL because I received a coupon via e-mail for a reduced price if paid in full. One month after purchasing the new NoNo (three months after receiving notification that the returned NoNo had been received by the company), I received a notice from a COLLECTION AGENCY. Fortunately this issue was resolved after one call but the fact that a collection notice was generated was unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the NoNo was painless, I decided to \\&quot;practice patience\\&quot; - a statement that I have read over and over again in all positive reviews. I did not use the NoNo enough during the \\&quot;assigned timeframe\\&quot; so I chose to keep the NoNo after the 45 day deadline. I have had the NoNo now for 7 months and I am disappointed. Unfortunately I will have to deal with the loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Attractive&lt;br /&gt;2.) Painless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Guarantee has loop holes. Make sure you are clear on the number of days that you MUST KEEP the NoNo before you can return it for a refund&lt;br /&gt;2.) It takes about 45 minutes to completely go over my legs and I am not hairy&lt;br /&gt;3.) MUST BUFF - my legs are not smooth until after buffing&lt;br /&gt;4.) The buffing pads are only good for ONE use - I used them more than once but the effects are not great after the first use&lt;br /&gt;5.) Because of the time involved, I&#x27;ve only used the NoNo twice a month. Total of 14 times and it is already time to replace the thermodynamic wire. Based on the manuals description of a \\&quot;good wire\\&quot;, the wire looks good but I noticed that the hair is not burning well, even after going over the area multiple times&lt;br /&gt;6.) Slightly burned my face and I do NOT have sensitive skin so I only use on my legs &amp; arms&lt;br /&gt;7.) Pricy upkeep: approx $29 for 2 pads w/lotion and the hair removal tips are approx $25 (combo 2 tips and 1 pad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, using the NoNo for hair removal will be time intensive and costly because I will have to continuously replace the tip and stock up on buffer pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I wish I had returned the \\&quot;second\\&quot; NoNo too.  I plan to go back to using hair removal creams (much easier &amp; cheaper) and, I will try to sell the NoNo at a garage sell.my legs are not smooth until after buffing  4.)

            <li> I forgot to lower the setting after using it on my legs and burned my lip in 3 spots a couple of cm&#x27;s from each other. I hope to god it heals. Do not buy this product please!!!!!!</li>
            <li> AUGUST 16 2011 : Now I know the results are supposed to be better and last longer over a prolonged use.. But I just got mine in the mail and used it on my leg and it worked great! GRANTED. It does smell bad.. but after a few minutes you don&#x27;t notice and it takes a very- VERY long time. It took me 40 minutes to just get everything under the knee on one leg. But that skin is completely hair free and very smooth. I figure that after I keep using this, if I stay on task will not take so long. The main draw for me was that it&#x27;s pain free, and I would just love not to have to go waxing anymore. I only tried it on my arm and leg. It worked great there. But I&#x27;ve yet to see how it is on the face, underarms, and bikini area. I&#x27;ve read that you really only need to buy replacement thermicon tips like twice a year.. which is only 50 bucks. I think that I spend 50 dollars easily though on waxing, razors, and shaving creams so I think that buying replacement tips and a buffer is not a big commitment. They have a cream that comes with it for after use.. but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again. It made my skin red and burned a little.. although the second ingredient is alcohol but whatever. I bought it off of the no!no!&#x27;s trial website which is trynono(dot)com. So it&#x27;s three payments of 90 bucks or something like that and after 60 days if you aren&#x27;t satisfied you can get your money back but I don&#x27;t know if I will. The reason I wanted the nono was that I saw an informercial and the promise of no pain... well... I couldn&#x27;t resist. Just remember it does take time. Also I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s best on light skin with dark hair. And I have very pale skin and dark brown hair so it worked great for me. Also when I used it the hair on my leg was kind of long, normally I shave them every day but I hadn&#x27;t in about 5 days. I&#x27;ve been thinking about this product for over a year but didn&#x27;t know if it was worth the price, but I heard about other people getting their money back with the trial and I was like why not! No more epilating woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JANUARY 12 2012: I still use the nono and after a few months I do notice my hair growing in thinner. I mainly use it on my face because if you want to use it on your legs it takes way too long. I get fantastic results every time - VERY SMOOTH. It is very difficult to use on your underarms as its hard to see and the nono is much easier to use on a flat surface instead of a curved one. I am just buying replacement tips now, and if you really want a good deal on those you can get them on ebay 3 for 15. The tips do last a long time. It takes seconds to use the nono, it is painless but you can burn yourself if you go too slow or press hard, you dont need to press down though really at all. Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s not big deal. The only reason people don&#x27;t like this is that they aren&#x27;t patient with it. They want a quick fix like with waxing or whatever. But this is actually a lot cheaper than going out and waxing and I can tell this thing will last me a long time. It really is good quality. In the early stages there were times that it would make my upper lip burn or be red afterwards. The best advice I can give you is afterwards apply Vaseline! Vaseline works wonders and I wake up with a smooth and even complexion. I get too embarrassed going to get my ladystache waxed, and the nono takes away that anxiety plus I don&#x27;t always feel like going to the salon.s like why not! No more epilating woohoo!

            <li> does not work, do not buy. company does not stand behind guarantee that after 60 days can return for full refund. tonya from company offered no help or concerns for my attempt to return product that was not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago and I have to say I love it.  Since I&#x27;ve used it I no longer have to shave my legs and only nono once a week to touch up.  It took me a little bit of practice to get the glide down but I am happy that hopefully by summer I&#x27;ll be hair free and saving myself time in the shower so I can hit the beach!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about customers who had trouble getting their money back, I ordered the No No! through Amazon who I&#x27;ve always had good service from.  They sell the product through \\&quot;Beauty in Style\\&quot;.  I received the No No! and used it twice, both times burning my face which left scarring.  I contacted Amazon who put me in touch with \\&quot;Beauty in Style\\&quot;.  Their company directed me on how to return the product for a full refund (by the way, this is NOT a cheap purchase).  I returned the No No! exactly as I had been instructed and waited for my refund. Two months later I contacted Amazon who apparently tried to get my money back.  Eventually Amazon put the whole thing back on me because, after 3 months of waiting, I had lost track of the mailing confirmation number, so Amazon told me they could not prove I had returned the item and could not make the company return my money.  I lost $269 plus shipping costs!!!  So be extra careful when ordering this product...you may not like it and it is difficult to get your money back!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find a product that guaranteed hair removal. I thought this was the end to those little black whiskers and peach fuzz around my face and my love trail. Enthusiastically I bought the device straight from their web site on the 60 day trial period and used it consistently for over 3 months. After not seeing results after the 60 days I figured that my hair needs another 2 weeks, after all it does say on the web site that it takes 4-6 weeks to see initial results. Initial results! I SO wanted it to work and kept on using it and even started using it every day. After still not seeing any real results I gave it a break to grow in to get an idea of progress and let my skin take a break. When my hair started growing back it was thicker and more abundant than before. You can only imagine the stress! I have before and after pictures to prove it. I posted them under customer images. You should be able to find them at the top of the page under the product image. ( I was unable to flip the pics...)&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service to share my bad experience but they couldn&#x27;t do anything for me. I asked if there was a certain hair type it works better for but they couldn&#x27;t tell me that either. Maybe you can find that info through other reviews, but in my experience I would HIGHLY advise everyone NOT to waste their time, money and energy.</li>
            <li> Hace menos de un mes lo compre y el aparato no prende parece que se quemo la compa&amp;ntilde;&amp;iacute;a no devuelve el dinero yo no lo compre por Amazon si no en la pagina oficial de nono no gasten el dinero y tambien quema mucho la piel</li>
            <li> If this product works I am doing something wrong or the time to spend is in days not hours with continuouse attempts to remove hair and buff for a smooth hairless effect.  I am exhausted.  Customer service....no refunds on a poor product....with false claims&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li> The 1st package I received had a defective tip. So after trying it for a month and talking to friends that love it, I called and they sent me a new tip. Now it was working correctly but did not remove my black corse hair.</li>
            <li> NoNo does not live up to its promise, I saw no significant difference even when using the unit every day. My unit seems to be defective and will only work at the highest setting, which has caused burns to my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased the No-No for men to remove hair on my arms. I&#x27;ve always been kind of full on the arms. All I can say is do not expect a miracle with this system, doesn&#x27;t work that way!!! What I can tell you in all honesty is that after a few months of using fairly steady, I do forget a day or two now and then, but then go back and do my arms. After all this I can definitely tell a difference. My 16 year old son always tells me how much of a difference he can tell in my arms, or as he tells me, I don&#x27;t like like a Gorilla now, haha. Thanks, son.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of every single hair on my arms, but it has reduced the hair to a place that I may shave every two weeks at the most. I still use the No-No at least a few times a month now, maybe more. I really don&#x27;t log the usage, as I just keep it charged up and may use it at night while sitting at the desk, may use it on a Saturday morning, when checking my email. It kind of varies with me. But, it has made a big difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One must learn to be patient with this, it does take time and it will not remove 100% of the hair, IMO!! While it does seem to remove maybe 80-90% of the hair on my arms, which is a success for me!!! It takes no time to go in and clear my arms up now in a few minutes, instead of 20 minutes or so...... I use this, I shave if needed and i&#x27;m continuing on my quest. It is working and does seem to do the trick, it is just slow going and not an overnight success. If you are looking for that, well then.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, mine is the black mens addition, not the pink, haha.IT DOES WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the product in April, arrived in a week.  The large tip never worked, but I was able to use the small tip and do my chin and upper arm.  It left stubs and burned the hair, which came back ticker and darker.  I called customer service to ask for a large tip replacement.  I must mention that any time I called, the reps were extra pushy to sell me extras, but I declined due to the fact that I wanted to make sure it worked first.  When I got the tip replacement in the mail, tried it, but it continued to get red after 4-5 seconds, so I called them again.  I told customer service number ( the # on the paperwork was not answering, so I called the number on the web page - red flag for fraud.) I wanted to return the whole thing back because it was not working.  The rep said I have to wait 60 days to get my money back and why don&#x27;t I let him send me a new nono?  I figured why not, let&#x27;s give them a chance, it might have been a bad unit, so he said I will receive the new unit in 4-5 days and that I needed to put the old unit in the same box and return it...so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I waited more than two weeks and there was no new unit.  I called back and enquired about the status.  The rep whose name was Albert told me there was no record of any unit being shipped to me and if I wanted to return something I needed a RMA number and an address label.  I asked for it, but he said I disqualify for return because my purchase was over 60 days ago and that disqualified me from reimbursement.  I said \\&quot;well, it is over 60 days because I have been waiting for parts and then later was told that a new replacement was being shipped to me ( red flag for fraud again).\\&quot; He said the previous rep failed to note that in system. I told him, this is August now, you took my money in April and after so many iterations, I still don&#x27;t have any working nono in my possession, it is not my fault your colleague did not record our conversation in the system.  He said, &#x27;call in 5 days, we have to listen to the tapes and find out what he promised you and then we will meet his promise.\\&quot;  I asked for supervisor.  He put me on hold for 27 minutes, hoping I hang up, but I did not.  Albert came back on and said \\&quot;no supervisor is available at this time, call back, but I am going to do you a favor and send you the return label.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to report them to Attorney General&#x27;s office and Better Business Bureau.  They are running a fraudulent business and taking advantage of innocent citizens.n to the tapes and find out what he promised you and then we will meet his promise.\\&quot;  I asked for supervisor.

            <li> Customer service is absolutely terrible(they don&#x27;t care once you have their product), and the product is difficult to use especially on the chin and upper neck areas. All they(Customer Service) want is for an individual to purchase additional products.  They don&#x27;t want to hear your problem nor do they attempt to correct it.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL, IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME, A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT.  GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER IN LAW, MAYBE IT WILL WORK FOR HER.&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> We expected lasting hair removal but have to use the NoNo one or two times a week because stubble comes back otherwise.  It works better on facial hair than on leg hair. If used too much in one spot, it can cause slight burns.[[ASIN:B00383I8T6 No!no! Hair Removal System, Model 8800, Pink 1 Ea]]</li>
            <li> Do not care for it at all! Lost my shipping box, found it on day 63 but too late to return it. Gets stuck in the on position frequently despite maintenance. Stinks to high heaven when it does remove some of the hair. I bought it for lip, chin and cheeks and it is NOT painless like claimed. Can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ve sold so many when it&#x27;s an expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product,at a higher price than I liked, and it didn&#x27;t work from day one! It turned on after charging and looked really nice but is useless!  I returned it almost immediately and have not received a single word back. I contacted the company and was told twice it had not been received...... I didn&#x27;t send it registered so my word isn&#x27;t good enough.  Well, all I can add is Trust this at your peril.</li>
            <li> After seeing the No No demonstrated on Dr. Oz I decided to give it a try.  I am 64 years old and since menopause I&#x27;ve been bleaching, to my dismay, a lot of dark facial hair.  I was tired of the bleaching process since it&#x27;s time consuming and messy.  Yes, the smell of burnt hair isn&#x27;t pleasant, but unwanted facial hair is.  This isn&#x27;t an overnight result type of product and patience is definitely a plus if you want results.  Even my husband has asked if I could use the No No on his very hairy back.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on his back yet, but I do believe it will work great and he&#x27;ll be as pleased with the results as I have been since I started using it.  Using the after treatment cream was definitely helpful after the first time use of the No No.  I can now honestly say that my facial hair isn&#x27;t the only feature I see when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star to be honest.  What a waste of money.  Doesn&#x27;t remove anything.  Thought I&#x27;d try it on the bikini line.  Used it everyday to see if it would work.  Unfortunately I travel for work and didn&#x27;t get home in time to send it back and get my money back.  Gosh, I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money I don&#x27;t have on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.  I really feel taken.</li>
            <li> Hard to use, does not work at all on small areas.  Not much better on larger areas.  Awful and it hurts.</li>
            <li> Sorry no stars for me load of rubbish  just buy a buffer pad from pound shop rub it over the unwanted hair same result complete wast of money</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing the No-no. It doesn&#x27;t work! I just wanted to get rid of the peach fuzz on my face and I&#x27;m blond. Who ever that celebrity that did the commercial should be ashamed. The no-no does not work.</li>
            <li> The nono is a useful devise in the war on unwanted hair. easy to use and effective in dark hairs. the company stands by it&#x27;s product and resolves any problems..</li>
            <li> The device seems to work as expected.  It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as fast as getting laser treatments, but, I can put in the time and effort to save the bucks.  However, the biggest problem with the device is the tiny belt which connects the moving parts.  The belt is the weak link in the device.  It comes off easily, is very difficult to put back on, and breaks easily.  My belt broke after only a couple of months of using it 2-3 times a week  It could be that my belt was defective and you won&#x27;t experience this problem.  However, I suggest you expect to have trouble with the belt and keep your receipt so that you can get a replacement under the warrenty.</li>
            <li> I got my first NoNo about a year ago.  It wouldn&#x27;t stay on as I was running it across my skin so I called the company and they said I needed to get new \\&quot;blades\\&quot; so I did as instructed (not cheep!).  When I received the new blades I installed one and guess what?  Still didn&#x27;t work. I then called the company back and they said to return the NoNo (at my cost!) and they would look at it.  Well it was defective and they sent me a new one that did work. When it is not defective and working properly I did get results.  Well, now I am again dealing with the same issues of it \\&quot;not staying on\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve 90% decided to not return it (at my cost!!) and write it off as an expensive lesson learned. I just don&#x27;t have time to deal with the process needed to get the results I want with the company.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE NO NO GADGET OVER A YEAR AGO. I had craved this gadget since it cost about 400.00 dollars and when it came down a little in price and had that remarkable 60 day satisfaction guarantee, i made the sacrifice, and bought the darn thing.  i followed all of the instructions, which are simple to follow and at first I thought my machine was defective, because IT WAS PAINFUL AND IT TOOK NO HAIR AWAY.  The commercial is very deceptive! The infomercial, which I had watched over and over throughout the years, told a big fat lie.  I went on youtbue to get feedback and some instruction from other folks who had purchased this product and I found a young lady for which the product had worked but she said it took 2 months for the hair to get thinner and her not to have to use it for twice a week as she had been doing, so I tried it again. It did not work! My trial time was over and I didn&#x27;t cancel the maintenance mess which consists of  abrasive pads, thermicon tips. and a lotion that smells a bit like neet, nair or some other depilatory cream. That cost me another 70 or 80 dollars. I called customer service and was offered another package that wouldn&#x27;t come every 2 months, blah blah blah. Never was I asked if I was satisfied with my purchase. As a matter of fact I truly believe the rudeness of the customer service rep is just a distraction so I won&#x27;t complain about the NO! NO! WHICH IS ANOTHER THING I BOUGHT FROM TV AND I WON&#x27;T FALL FOR THAT AGAIN. THANKS RADIANCY! YOUR PRODUCT IS A NO GO!&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> I charged it for two nights and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all every time I would try to turn it on it showed it was dead</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  It was worthless.  Just burned the hait and not even completely off.  I should have read the reviews before I purchased.  Returned item right away.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pink No NO 8800 model as I have been looking for a miracle hair removal system for my face for years. I&#x27;ve had it lasered twice, still having problems. Doctors said it was hormones and nothing I could really do about it but laser - that&#x27;s way expensive and isn&#x27;t really working for me, so in comes the No No! I was thrilled to see it and couldn&#x27;t wait to order one. If it worked as it said, it would be the answer to my prayers. After ordering I read reviews and worried about making a mistake - I didn&#x27;t. Here are the keys to this item:&lt;br /&gt;1. Charge over night - don&#x27;t cheat on this one!&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes TIME and PATIENCE! You will not see smooth skin the first few times you use the NO NO. I started on my forearms before using on my face to make sure I knew what I was doing. It took about 6 - 30 minutes sessions (total for both arms) to really get a \\&quot;no hair\\&quot; apparearance. But it did work!&lt;br /&gt;3. For me, buffing with the crystalized buffer is a \\&quot;no no\\&quot;. I have used one before and it breaks me out - so what I have found successful is to do a treatment and then wash with a mild soap, then moisturize. You can find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;m not sure about the lotion - I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance and found that my Baby Philosophy lotion works very well.&lt;br /&gt;5. Have done two sessions on my face and am happy with the results so far. It took some practice to get around the chin and I did notice a slight \\&quot;zap\\&quot; and puff of smoke when it hit a thicker hair - positives in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;6. Clean the blade wire often - use the brush or blow it out with your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any pain, burns, rashes, or problems with the wires. I have used the product for almost 2 weeks - about 6 sessions on arms, 2 on legs and face, blade still working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF the product continues to work well and IF I see that my hair is not growing back after continued use for a couple of months I will be the most vocal proponent of this device on the planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a 5 star rating because it is not a quick hair removal process and wish they&#x27;d include at least one replacement blade for the money!&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for burnt hair smell - I do it outside or make sure my husband isn&#x27;t home, then shower and lotion. So far I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;**************************&lt;br /&gt;WOW - it&#x27;s been 4 weeks, my arms appear hair free, my legs, well, I shaved 4 days ago after using my NONO for 2 weeks on them, they feel smooth - maybe a little peach fuzz, but nothing like it use to! I think after I complete 6 weeks, they will be smooth and fabulous.  And customer service was awesome today! My NONO&#x27;s little o&#x27;ring that runs the roller had come off (probably user error)and customer service said they would send a new one out right away and have the old one picked up at no cost to me! This thing is fantastic - won&#x27;t be without it!!g because it is not a quick hair removal process and wish they&#x27;d include at least one replacement blade for the money!

            <li> Say no! to no! no! I wanted to try if for myself even after reading all of the bad reviews, but all of the bad reviews were right!</li>
            <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no. I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one. I wanted to purchase a no-no, but I had several questions (or concerns) that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00. I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s are some of the questions I asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months. (Is it strategically designed to &#x27;conveniently&#x27; malfunction after the 60-day guarantee expires??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Why such a limited warranty? $270.00 is not cheap. If it breaks after the 60-days guarantee, am I left with a $270.00 paperweight?  What will the company do to help its customers?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later and still no reply.  So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number. I didn&#x27;t catch his name, but his extension# is 39. He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  Or maybe, he was not allowed to answer them... His answers read like a script.  He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company. He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  In follow-up to the questions above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no. (Surprise surprise, right?) According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well...that was not my concern at all. I KNOW patience is required to see results. Actually, I believe it will do what it&#x27;s advertised to do.  My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the 60-days guarantee? He did offer some clarification on this. Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked. If you purchase the no-no after the 60-days guarantee is over, they now have EXTENDED the warranty to **2 YEARS**. If you get a replacement for a defective device, it does NOT reset the warranty clock. (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.) I brought this up to the customer service rep, and he says they don&#x27;t do this...so just be aware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. So, do some models break more than others? One reviewer called customer service for a 3rd no-no replacement. The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned. (hmm...so...is this an indication that there *is* an issue of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I shared this reviewer&#x27;s experience with the representative I was speaking to, and he doesn&#x27;t basically called this reviewer a LIAR. Representatives will not divulge that kind of information. Sure. As for the no-no for men and no-no for women, he said the only difference between the two are the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Limited warranty... the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject. He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...\\&quot;get 1 no-no today, get a second no-no for only $199.99...\\&quot; W-O-W. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I kept pressing my questions/concerns about AFTER the 2-year warranty. Customers can get as manyreplacements as needed during the 2-year warranty period, but if they keep receiving defective device that break in a matter of weeks/months, what happens then? Are we just SOL? The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My final question to him: \\&quot;If you (the customer service representative) review an account history of a customer, and you see that they have gone through multiple no-no replacements over a 2-year period (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\&quot; He didn&#x27;t reply yes or no, only that they cannot replace no-no&#x27;s after the 2-years are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Last thing I said to him before he hung up on me: It&#x27;s not that customers give up on your product, it&#x27;s your company that&#x27;s giving up on your customers.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer loyalty?  Doesn&#x27;t exist here.  They don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me. I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products. They know it will break over time. In fact, the representative (Mr. Extension #39)  mentioned that there are logged \\&quot;batches\\&quot; of no-no&#x27;s that are known to be defective. Something else to be aware of.  WILL YOU BE ONE OF THE UNLUCKY ONES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement. However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  Don&#x27;t invest in something that has a track record of breaking over short amount of time. How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits? Ask yourself these questions before you decide to buy. Think it over...seriously.replacements as needed during the 2-year warranty period, but if they keep receiving defective device that break in a matter of weeks/months, what happens then?

            <li> I know this wasn&#x27;t going to be a miracle. I understood you have to keep using it for weeks without losing faith. I&#x27;ve been using it every day since the day it was delivered and so far, not one hair has fallen out. Maybe it&#x27;s just my fine fuzzy hair, but now a month into it I would have thought I would have seen at least some small results. Nothing, nada...I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Supplier never delivered the item and never replied to any of my email! i&#x27;m GLAD amazon refunded me, a month later.</li>
            <li> I got my no no at another site, not via amazon but the product was absolute garbage.  I used it for 6 weeks, on my face, arms, legs, underarms, bikini area and, although I got burned many times, I kept trying because I really wanted it to do what they advertise.  The intensity level does not work, if you put it on the one bar, it changes immediately to three bars when you start using.  I changed the heads to see if that would help but it didn&#x27;t.  After six weeks, all my hair grew back everywhere.  It did not work at all.  Oh yeah sure it burned some hair but it was the buffer that removed hairs and made my legs smooth.  At the six week period the machine started to stutter very badly and so I returned it.  I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people who got this product and the general consensus is that it is piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday and i charger it overnight.what a pice a junk the blue light would not stay on.It tells you to go slow you can&#x27;t go that slow and get it to work. I tried on different part of my body and nothing i thinking if i have to go any slower ill be in my 90&#x27;s the time this thing would do anything.I was So hopeing this would work but its a waist of money and time.I did try it on different people and nothing .</li>
            <li> I keep trying to use it. But it is not doing what I expected it to do.  The hair is not removing very well at all.  It is ruff and stubbly.  Not smooth at all.  The smell of burning hair is not there like they said it would be.  I think I may have been given a damaged unit.  For the amount of money I spent I am very, very unhappy.  Sincerely Debra Wolfgang</li>
            <li> I bought this product, and it was like throwing my money in the trash. It didn&#x27;t work as described, I would even let my hair grow out just a little bit, and I could smell burning hair, but it would do some spots but not others. Would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My wife decided to get this to deal with unwanted hair on her neck. She thought it&#x27;d be a good way to delicately deal with the embarrassing issue. She was extremely patient and continued to use this for the last 10 months off and on. I would not expect a product intended to reduce unwanted hair to make the issue significantly worse. This device is not worth a penny. We should have sent it back when we had the chance but instead we accepted a slight product discount and kept it. At this point she would rather wax or pay for more expensive hair removal if it wouldn&#x27;t make the hair growth darker &amp; thicker like the no no hair removal system did!</li>
            <li> This product actually works.  I have been looking for an effective home use hair removal system and for the first time  I am truly happy. when using it and you smell the burn....it is working.  I have used it on my face and arms and the hair is now fine.  I have had this product for less than a month and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in January from Neiman Marcus, with hopes that it would work on my facial hair.  Using it 3 times weekly it still has not stopped the hair from growing nor has it thinned it out.  Last week the rubber washer popped out and it cannot be used anymore.  I have sent emails and tried calling but my emails are answered with \\&quot;we received your message and will respond soon, please call Cust Serv.\\&quot;.  I call the number, sit on hold while being held hostage listening to their advertisements and then get disconnected.**DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!**</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just still covered in hair but now it smells like well, burnt hair.</li>
            <li> thanks for the reviews. sounds like i can use my machete and still remove more hair than this unit. was thinking about buying it, but after seeing all the one stars. no no...</li>
            <li> Works great on legs, but the face is hard. If you don&#x27;t have the No-No angled just right it will  not remove hair. I also found that it automatically increases the heat levels which can hurt.</li>
            <li> I was so close to purchasing the No! No! from an infomercial that kept repeating every half hour on Saturday mornings. It sounded so fantastic and convincing! The infomercial doesn&#x27;t state a price for their product, so this prompted me to do some online investigating. I was absolutely blown away by all the negative reviews I found on different forums and websites!!! In fact, there are so many negative reviews that I cannot possibly read them all due to time. However, there are very few positive reviews. Imagine how much money this company is raking in by selling No! No! for about $300 each. I am very grateful for everyone who has taken the time to post their comments to let the rest of us know what a crappy product the No! No! is.  Thank you all for helping others from being scammed for what amounts to a high-priced inferior shaver. I am so glad I read the reviews before I made a purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 10, she has hairy knees thought No No may be a good choice. My sister in law said to read the reviews first...glad I did. We won&#x27;t be making a purchase....just NOT worth it. I am sorry you all have had such trouble with the product and with their customer service/refunds...THANK YOU for letting us know the No No is a BIG no no.</li>
            <li> Since reaching 50 I&#x27;ve had issues with facial hair that are probably hormone related.  I tried laser treatment but was told it did not work on grey hair so continued with plucking the hairs - probably two or three times a week.  I got the No No for Christmas 2012 and started using it that day.  Now eight months later I have to use it twice each day - the thick, dark stubble appears again within hours of using it and it is becoming very distressing. I have to use the buffer vigorously to get the skin smooth and then moisturise, but the hair just comes back, thicker each time.  I wish I had never started using this as there is no way out now because there is so much more hair growing than when I started using this.  I really wish I had paid more attention to the reviews because if I had my time over, I would never have begun using the product.  I stopped by the No No booth in our local mall and the person there was completely useless, telling me they had never heard of this before and every one else they had sold it to had great results.  I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else experiencing this so recommend you do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Did not work and looked cheap not original</li>
            <li> I recently received the No!no! as a gift and IT REALLY WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse dark hair in all the wrong places. I have been through the whole gamut of trying to solve this HAIRY issue of mine.From bleach to wax to tweezing, sugaring and many other gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried the epilady...OUCH!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I finally found something that works! The No!no! is serious hair removal. I followed the instructions and its been working great for me since I received it on Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and reccommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the No!no! faster, easier, and  virtually pain free, but I&#x27;m smooth for a much longer time then I had shaved or waxed (I consider that a bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two tips I&#x27;d like to note for best reuslts...&lt;br /&gt;1. You may need help with the underarms (to pull skin taut)&lt;br /&gt;2. I reccommend using the 3rd or highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I can&#x27;t beleive that there are any bad reviews about this product. I&#x27;m guessing that anyone who is saying it doesn&#x27;t work is experiencing \\&quot;operator error\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> No it does not hurt. It also doesn&#x27;t work. It quickly became apparent that this was a waste of $300. It&#x27;s so tedious and time consuming to remove the smallest finest hairs.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for Christmas and loves it. She has some darker hairs and this really takes care of them.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove hair the first time &amp; I had to go over it several times, &amp; then it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product. I thought it would be an answer to all my problems about the unwanted hair on my face but it is complete garbage. It never removed the hair completely; it basically acted like a shaver but WORSE. The buffer was the only thing that made the hair come off and I could have bought a buffer at the store for 5 bucks. I eventually started just using the buffer without using the no no and after using the buffer, the hair came off. I could have just bought the buffer and I would have gotten the same results as this stupid piece of garbage. I wasted so much money on this and I ended up going to a professional to get laser hair removal. This product is terrible and although it may seem like it&#x27;s working in the beginning, that&#x27;s basically the only results you will see. After I kept using it, I had hundreds of tiny little bumps all over my chin area. Not to mention that this thing will burn you and the intensity levels don&#x27;t do ANYTHING. It says it doesn&#x27;t create stubble, but it sure DOES. You are never going to find an at home machine that can properly PERMANENTLY reduce your hair; only professionals can do that.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected</li>
            <li> I am a hairy individual. I read reviews  for this after watching  an infomercial. I bought  it anyway thinking  any help is better  than  nothing. The first  time  I used it, I though awesome, it&#x27;s  working. But, the hair was prickly so I shaved afterward. I used this a lot! It died completely  2 times. I had to send it back. The second  time I was out of warranty. I wish I had saved  my money for real  laser removal.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from the nono website, it didn&#x27;t do a thing for any of my unwanted hair (maybe if it were only peach fuzz, which quite frankly, you could just bleach that periodically and be done with it!) I tried several times, it doesn&#x27;t remove coarse hair, or really any hair as far as that goes. It sat on my counter for the remainder of the 60 trial period and I am currently awaiting my money back-think we should leave it to the professionals. Wish I could give it 0 stars!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  You would get better results from a .99 cent bic lighter.  No special science here you get a hot wire that burns the hair.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Well, I decided to purchase the nono hair removal system because I wanted to get rid of unwanted hair. I read all the bad reviews on this thing but, decided to try it out for myself. If I didn&#x27;t like it I could return it and get my money back. Well I ordered the nono and I recieved it a week later. I used the nono exactly as it said to do so in the instructions. The thing only removed half of the hair. My hair was short it wasn&#x27;t long at all. I went over the area around 8 times and it still didn&#x27;t remove the hair. Then I thought maby the buffer will remove this. I used the buffer and still nothing. I had stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a week and the same thing. It clearly says that when you use the buffer you have smooth hairless skin for a while and this was never my case. So I decide to return the product. I call customer service. I tell them that I have not had any luck with this product and wish to return it. She tells me that I have to have it for 45 days with it or I can&#x27;t return it. So I wait 45 days. Then I call again and another representative tells me I have to return it in the 60 days. She said I would not be entitled to my full money refund. In a way I didn&#x27;t want to wait for the 60th day because if I forgot to call I would not get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call on the 58th day of my trial. Luckly it was another reprisentative and she gave me a order number and told me Ups would come by to pick up the package in 3-4 days. She also told me I would get my refund in 5-7 days. Ups comes in 3 days to pick up the package. He gives me a recipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wait 7 days to check my bank statment and see that I still have not recieved my money. I call again and they said they had to file a paper and I would recieve my money in 5-10 days. I wait 10 days and see that I havent recieved my refund (this was last week). I call and ask them why I havent recieved my money. The representative tells me that they think I don&#x27;t qualify for my refund and I tell her I do I called to return my package in my 58th day of my 60 day trial. She says that the company took the forms to their corporate office and that they are dealing with the situation. She says that I might recieve my money in a week. Its been a week and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone try this product. I really don&#x27;t. And don&#x27;t be like me who wanted to prove other bad reviews wrong. You think hey if it doesn&#x27;t work then Ill return it. But it is such a hassle to get your money back. Its been 2 months already and still no sign of my money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/30/12 I am glad that I have helped out so many people with my post, from having to experience what I did with that company. I wrote this post a while ago. I did eventually recieve my money back but, it tooks SO MUCH time and effort to do so, with threats of sueing them, and raising my voice. It took an additional 2 and a half months form where I left off on this post to recieve my money back. So, in total it took about 4 and half months. I was so angery at their customer service and how they would take advantage of people who are desparate to remove undesired hair. It was a very daunting experience. I mean 200 and something dollars for a product that does not work and then they don&#x27;t honor their return policy?! I am just glad that I am out of that situation. And for those claiming that I didn&#x27;t give it enough time. This machine did not remove the hair. It just cut half of the hair off and left stubble, eventhough the hair was the proper length. It never removed it not even with the buffer. The buffer had a similar material to a nail file. So, I have no idea how that would remove hair. The only thing the machine left was burn marks. On my upper lip and legs while, I had it on the LOWEST setting. So, I would not recommend this product. I was left with stress, anger, stubble and burn marks.I called to return my package in my 58th day of my 60 day trial. She says that the company took the forms to their corporate office and that they are dealing with the situation. She says that I might recieve my money in a week.

            <li> I have used this product off and on for three years now (every 2 days for several months at a time) on my legs.  Long story short, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the hair on my legs and it finally stopped working yesterday.  I think that it MIGHT if you have fine hair, but my hair is medium to coarse.  It id not reduce the amount of hair, nor did it slow down the growth rate.  My advise: save your money.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get the job done and if you&#x27;re not careful you can burn yourself on sensitive areas such as your face.</li>
            <li> Information confusing on return-Thought I was waiting to be sure I got the full refund and instead was told I waited too long so NO refund.  Very unhappy with this company.  Product was not for me and IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT, DON&#x27;T ORDER or you may end up stuck having paid $300 for something you can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for over a year now. At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, however after about a year, or less say 6 months, there was a noticeable improvement in the reduction of hair around my face, specifically the nape of my neck, and sideburns. The hairs come back fine, (yes your hair does grow back), and are barely noticeable. You however must use this product consistently. I used vitamin E cream to get rid of the hyperpigmentation (ethnic - black decent). When used in combination with other hair removal methods this actually does work. It takes some getting used to. Burned my chin once. Would I recommend. Yes if you have patience to wait for the results, and you are willing to use other methods of hair removal while using this product.</li>
            <li> My husband bought it for me and I tried it for almost a few months. I don&#x27;t see any results. Even with fine hair you have to go over several times and still doesn&#x27;t do the job.  The commercials are misleading. I tried it for a few months and probably it&#x27;s too late for returning the product. What a waste of money and time.  It&#x27;s not even close to a good shave. And it&#x27;s not a cheap product. Would I ever buy it again, never !!!!</li>
            <li> this product is garbage. I wouldnt tell anyone to buy this junk. had it for a year and a half. all it did was creat stubble and burn me. im trying the silk and flash by sephora next. lots of good reviews on that</li>
            <li> That was the quote from a Nono call centre person when I rang to return the Nono with their 60 day full refund time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then asked for a return number (which never arrived.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks later I called to find out what had happened to be told it can take up to a month to get the return number because it comes from the USA to Canada... Strange as the address of the warehouse is in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for return label 5 weeks from first try..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a scam to me. I will update if I ever get success.</li>
            <li> Do not order this item, I followed the directions as stated. I was amazed that the no no could burn my face and not burn the hair! When I called customer service to send it back the MAN on the phone told me I had to try it over several months to see the effects. I told him the effects would be my skin burned and I still had hair, how stupid it that! I would not recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> If I could, I would return it and get my money back, but it is too late.  Very disappointed with results.&lt;br /&gt;Nair is faster and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;With No No, hair just grows back the same as Nair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not Keith, I&#x27;m Linda.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the No No would help me with facial hair.  Short answer....it doesn&#x27;t.  I wanted to remove it but the customer service kept giving me pointers to the point it was past the 90 day warranty period and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I should have been more pro-active.  Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst product I have purchased in my 45 years!!!!!!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!  I would have given it a negative star if I could have!!!  Horrible!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money like I did.  This product does not work.  I kept trying the product thinking I would see even a little less hair, but I did not!  I also purchased 2 packs of replacement tips on a buy one get one free offer and they did not work.  When I inquired about them not working, they gave me some hoopla about cleaning the tips....They were BRAND NEW, how were they not clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. After two weeks using the NoNo she likes the way it works. I would buy another if the need arises</li>
            <li> I purchased the No No to use on my arms but its so not worth the money.  It removed most of the hair but not entirely, some areas are hard to reach. My forearms felt as if I shaved them 1-2 days later when the hair would start to grow back again it felt like stubble and I could never get a close enough smooth finish. I&#x27;m better off just shaving them daily. It works a little better on upper arms as far as the regrowth but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me like its guaranteed to. Not to mention the free trial ends prior to the time they actually suggest you use it to get the best results.  It&#x27;s been 8 months and I&#x27;m still waiting for the great results.</li>
            <li> Ever since using No No by Radiancy it has been perfect! I always had a lot if blonde hair on my face like my mom &amp; trouble areas on lip &amp; chin. Since using as directed at least 2xweekly it hardly ever grows back. Love the buffing pads too&amp; the Smooyhing lotion.I highly recommend this to all my family &amp; friends as they can see the difference it has made for me. LOVE IT:))))</li>
            <li> Removes fine hair OK, but will not do anything to course hair.....hair creates bumps under the skin and looks like you have blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointed in product.  Too expensive and results were very dissapointing.</li>
            <li> I just got my no!no! and so far it is pretty good.  It did take most of the hair off my legs, so now I&#x27;m waiting to see what the regrowth is like.  I have thick, dark, fast growing hair on my legs, so I was impressed that it did get most of it.  The instructions do say you have to wait 4-6 weeks to see results, so I&#x27;m still expecting it to grow back normally a few times.  It is hard to get around the curves on my face and I did burn myself a bit on my face, using the lowest setting.  I was able to get some of the facial hair off, but after burning myself a few times I stopped and will try again tomorrow.  The burns are not as bad for me as I have seen some people say; they just leave some redness that goes away over night.  I have never shaved my arms, so I&#x27;m nervous about using the no!no! on them until I see what the regrowth is like on my legs.  I did have to try a little bit of my arms last night though.  I can feel some stubble when I rub them today.  I&#x27;m hopeful for this product to do what it says over time!</li>
            <li> We bought this product expecting it to do at least a little of what they show in their advertisements and that is all it does. Very little. The product works on very fine baby hair but anything courser is a complete failure. Even if you go over it multiple times as the literature suggests you will not remove the hair, it will get burned down to a dreadful stubble. The worse part is that they don&#x27;t tell you how readily this product burns the skin. Beware if you decide to give it a try, the burns are very odd, they don&#x27;t show up till the next day, but you feel the soreness immediately.</li>
            <li> I foolishly purchased this product without first checking the reviews.  I gave it an honest try.  Basically it only partially works on smooth surfaces.  I tried to do under arms - impossible!  Needed to be very careful not to burn myself.  This device burns off the hair.  When I checked my credit card statement I found there was a charge for $104.89 in October (at time of purchase) and also I found an additional charge of $89.94 in November.  Not sure why the additional charge, but folks need to pay particular attention to their credit card statements.  I waited my 45 days and then called to get my free shipping label to return the product.  In my return box I informed them of the additional charge of $89.94.  I was all set to do battle with them, but to my surprise they refunded both charges.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!</li>
            <li> I think this is the wisest thing I have ever purchased!  I am completely happy with it&#x27;s progress and it has only been 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> Is so expensive and is very difficult to use and the results are suppose to come in a very long time. Additionally, it does not have clear instructions neither within the box or in the website. It does not explain how it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with some reservation, but thought it comes with a money back guarantee.  WRONG!!  The product did not work for me at all and I was completely frustrated with attempting to get it to work properly.  I contacted customer service to obtain an RMA # as indicated on their instruction sheet.  Customer Service was rude and critical.  The representative kept giving me instructions on how to use it and convince me that it was my fault the product wasn&#x27;t working as I must be using it incorrectly.  I finally interrupted her instructions after the 3rd time and clearly stated to her that I DID NOT like the product and wanted to exercise the money back guarantee, please provide me with RMA # so I could return product.  She refused stating, Why don&#x27;t you give it another try if you still don&#x27;t like it you can always call back.\\&quot;  At this point asked to speak with supervisor and was disconnected.  Called backon hold for 21 minutes 48 seconds before someone picked up.  Long and short of it is was told could not return product because I had not contacted company within 45 days to express displeasure with product(even though product is advertised as having 60 day money back guarantee.  Will be trying to seek relief through credit card company.  THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM!!  will also be contacting my state attorney general consumer affairs division.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I was happy when I came back from Thanksgivivg that it was in my mailbox.  I ordered it for a gift and had to mail it out of town. Thank you  I will let you know if it works ok.  After the holidays !!!</li>
            <li> An Absolute NO NO, What a disappointing product. Does not remove hair, just burns you and smells horrible. Do not waste you money!</li>
            <li> This was the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought and it wasn&#x27;t cheap......wish I could get a refund</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the poor reviews. I have Psoriasis and for years when I shave my legs they get all tore up and cut and bleed. I really don&#x27;t like using nare etc..I did waxing that worked but still took my skin sometimes and it is so time consuming. With their triple guarentee I decided to try it. I am still in my 90 day trial but so far it works and great! Does it stink? YES but like they said that means it is working. It&#x27;s burning your hair people what do you think it will smell like? I have not shaved in about a month. And at this point after a month and after using it 2 or 3 times a week I only use it now maybe once a week. I have had lazer hair removal on my upper lip and after a year it grew back. I was so ticked. For the money THIS is a much better option. Cost way less and can do it where ever and when ever I want to. To do all over hair removal at the Dr. would have cost thousands. Great invention!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So I bought the no no over 6 months ago and I did what it told me to do and charged it. Then I went right at it and started using it. It was really hard to use in my opinion and it did not remove the hairs. I was so frustrated; i spent hours trying it over and over; taking breaks to give my irritated skin a break. Eventually i gave up and told myself that it was my first time so of course I wasn&#x27;t going to learn it right away. I did burn myself many times during my first use and it made me fear my no no for a long time. As i tried and tried again, I found out that it works on my arms. It did not work on my armpits, legs, face, and plus the buffer did not work for me. After a few months of trying it, I just gave up; it was already too late for the warranty (i didn&#x27;t use the warranty because i thought i&#x27;d get the hang of it eventually, obviously i was wrong). To sum it up; WASTE OF MY MONEY. I completely regret buying the no no. All i wanted was good hair removal, shaving did not work for me at all; and no no was a big mistake. I guess the next step is to try epilators /:</li>
            <li> unfortunately I read the reviews after purchasing the no!no!. If I had I would not make the mistake of buying it. I does not work as it claims. I does not effectively remove hair and it caused my skin to get red and puffy with repeated using it and still  leaves hair behind. I am returning it and hope to get my money back .I think Amazon should pull  this item.</li>
            <li> This will TAKE TIME. It doesn&#x27;t transform your body overnight. It removes hair great, but like the directions tell you - it is a process! You really won&#x27;t see lasting results until about the 6th week and you have to be consistent with using it. It works great for facial hair, but the legs take forever. It will tell you on the directions that it could take up to 45 min to do each leg...and you are supposed to do it 3 times a week for the first six weeks. If you have the time, the investment is worth it!</li>
            <li> I used this for the alotted time and I scratched my face up. The hair did grow back alot more than I started with. It also did not burn all the hairs off so I had to tweezer them. I tryed to return it but they would not take it back. They adjusted the price for me to keep trying it. It does not work for me. I am within the return time but they refuse to take it back. I would not recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever bought. Used it faithfully as directed, for several months. Did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;No reduction in hair growth. Also, very cheaply made. Thermicon tip lasted a couple of weeks. The company doesn&#x27;t honor it&#x27;s money back guarantee. Don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> I bought this product four years ago, and It didn&#x27;t remove a single hair, all you got was the smell of the hair being burnt.. it cost a lot of money for this product and I was hoping it would do it&#x27;s job like it said on tv.. but it didn&#x27;t do it like it said it would.. I threw the product out, because I didn&#x27;t want to send it back have to go through all that trouble.. it&#x27;s the worst product on tv.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to any one. don&#x27;t waste your hard working money.. because it doesn&#x27;t work I tried it for a month and I didn&#x27;t see any results.. I rather shave my legs and face then use this product.. that buffer pad that comes with it it&#x27;s a joke, all you get with the buffer pad is to remove the burnt hair on your face, that stupid cream that comes with it, that&#x27;s a joke too.. it&#x27;s not easy to use, you have to go very slow with it over your skin, and who has time to waste on a half an hour to an hour on your body when your trying to rush out the door to go to work... it was even on the home shopping network, and people were calling in saying how they loved the product.. I called in on the home shopping net work saying this product doesn&#x27;t work.. they just get people to call in and give them a rating on this product, I would give this product a zero If I could. because It&#x27;s junk... this is called wasting time and money on this product.. I was so disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work.. so I&#x27;m telling every woman out their don&#x27;t buy this product.. it cost too much money to buy and it doesn&#x27;t work.. I&#x27;m not making that up because it doesn&#x27;t work.. it&#x27;s a waste of time and money the advertisement on tv is all a bunch of bull crap... making people believe that this product works just to make you spend over two hundred dollars and plus tax and shipping and handling on this product and when it comes to adding up the total, it costs over three hundred dollars.. those advertisements on tv is to get people to spend a lot of money on all these products that don&#x27;t work... this is the worst company for no no hair remover...plus the actress&#x27;s on their on getting paid top dollar to say that it really works on tv.. they should be ashamed of them selves because they know it doesn&#x27;t work...t work... this is the worst company for no no hair remover...plus the actress&#x27;s on their on getting paid top dollar to say that it really works on tv.. they should be ashamed of them selves because they know it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> After watching the frequent NO-NO commercials for well over a year, I decided to give it a try, especially when the warranty appeared to be fool-proof. After three months of following the instructions religiously, here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;1. Although initially, it appears to work (yes, it zapped those long hairs), but after the first time, it Removed hair to stubble only...would go over the same area again and again, but No-No failed to remove the hair completely.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not one, but both of my thermal tips have burned out. So, now I am left with a very expensive useless product, which is beyond the &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion? I think of myself as a careful consumer, but feel very duped into buying a product that doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time. What other product that costs $300. and is &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; after three months? DON&#x27;T waste your money  so that you are not disappointed as I am.</li>
            <li> I have had the pink NoNo for two years now, hair is still growing at same rate.  This product only works on very fine fuss hair, it doesn&#x27;t work on corse arm or leg hair, or anywhere else with strong hair.  I can only use this for my face, under the nose (it doesn&#x27;t even work on my chin hair).  It also takes along time to get the fuss off.  It smells.  I think it is alot of money for just a under the nose hair remover, but I do like it for that.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work..just a red hot wire that burns hair off and skin around knees and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;Used on my arms and legs. Hair grew back. Now I go to a real spa to have laser hair removed,that works, worth the time and money. The TRIA laser doesn&#x27;t work either. Go to a real spa laser place, most have January and Feb. specials ,like buy underarms, get bikini area free.....that&#x27;s how I got started.</li>
            <li> I have watched two family members go through the agony (yes, real pain!) and the humiliation (trying to return) with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has so many bad reviews here and elsewhere I don&#x27;t know how the company stays afloat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save the costly &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34; and go for waxing (couldn&#x27;t be any more painful), or put it towards laser (which is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, BTW.  I&#x27;m a nurse trained in hair reduction, and we don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;removal&amp;#34; for liability reasons. It only permanently reduces ~ 5-20% hair each time--and believe me, it&#x27;s closer to 5% for most).  Or better yet, investigate old-fashioned electrolysis.  Electrolysis isn&#x27;t perfect either, but has a better batting-average for many in terms of permanent hair reduction, especially on light hairs (which the laser cannot adequately address).</li>
            <li> I have the pink cordless 8800 device. It is safe on darker skin. So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try. A harvard dermatologist doc said never user laser on the face is you have tan skin.I have a lot of coarse wavy hair and Asian tan skin.. Waxing caused ingrowns and shaving would be a grind. After careful consideration, I am trying this tool. My goal is to go hairless at least for a month. Asking too much?&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;Week 1- I start on my arms and legs.First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry. I glide the device over my stubble. It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now. No PAIN!!! but a lot of burnt hair smell. Takes a little practice Always glide off and lift off the skin. Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn. Nothing major. And go over hairs in opposite directions of growth a few times.I notice the result is like a smooth shave. The tool burns the surface hair and weakens the hair root below. My arm hair looks smoother than the legs since my hair texture is less coarse. And it takes less time.&lt;br /&gt;**********************&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear. Still 3x a week and 1/2-1hr each session. Tried to do the chin but I slightly cinched the skin. The unit jumps around the chin area. I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy. Sticking to threading or my epicure/bellabe spring for my curves on the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 6 - need replacement cartridge. It finally broke. I bought a bunch. Legs have 25 percent less hair and everything is finer in texture. I am getting excited to see what happens in another month. I use a hair cream remover once in a while to remove what is left over when I have a event. I notice very smooth and even baby like skin. The hair is thinner and the hair folicals are smaller.I don&#x27;t recommend shaving the stragglers. It makes the hair coarser. And as the hair gets finer, the device works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I use the highest setting on my arms and legs. It does not get all hairs everytime. My arms stay clean for a month. My legs is about 4 days. Better than every other day. 25%reduction overall for me and patches are hairless for months. Used it on my teen daughter&#x27;s legs. Hair did not come back for a month. This product is great for virgin and fine hair.se the highest setting on my arms and legs. It does not get all hairs everytime. My arms stay clean for a month.

            <li> Been meaning to write this for a while no no deffo don&#x27;t waste your money. I would have to think about it even if I was offered this for £20.00. I bought 2 of these both different models because I really needed a solution to my bad hair problems. I only bought it due to a friends relation telling me they had got one and where initially made up with it only to find out later they had returned there&#x27;s as well. I ran it up my legs could smell the burning but barely any hair was removed. It is too much money to part with on the off chance you may lose maybe 10 hairs !!!!! I was so disappointed I thought I had found a solution to my hairiness but sorry girls they need to do a lot more research then maybe they might get £160 for this product.</li>
            <li> Wow. I was a little skeptical about buying this though I have wanted to for some time now because of the reviews.  I am glad I went ahead and purchased it.  It removed almost all the hair in the treatment area in one try.  I cannot review yet the long term effects, but for someone who&#x27;s had serious problems with excessive hair (and not to mention the fact that I have dark course hair to begin with), I am thrilled that something worked this good on my first try with it. If it continues to work this well then the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the No No and received it the end of August 2013 - I used it, but decided it was not what I wanted and wanted to return it. I called the phone number on the No No website and was told that I HAD to keep it longer. The Rep I spoke with basically told me that it was unreturnable unless I kept it close to 60 days. He said that I can call back and they would give me the information needed to return it. I do not want to keep it any longer and want to return it now - But, it seems I do not have that option. I feel like I have been taken and have no control over the return. I am wondering if this is a scam and they just do not want to give me a refund. Please help me, I am 84 years old and do not know what to do. What if I forget to call them back after the timeframe they gave me - then what happens.</li>
            <li> I bought the No No last October 2010. I used it until February 2011. It did not work! I gave up and bought an epilator which works much better. Don&#x27;t buy this product it does not work.</li>
            <li> My wife tried it and it didn&#x27;t work.  She said she can get the job done with twisters faster.  As soon as I find out how to return it, I will.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I received a faulty NO NO. First it was set too low and it chattered no matter what I tried and would immediately break the wire, then it quit working. I went through the  troubleshoot call and I sent it back and got another one which seems to be set too high--too late to return. It doesn&#x27;t get close enough,perhaps if set right it might work.  Where are the complaints on their page-- hmm--none I don&#x27;t believe it. Too expensive for what it doesn&#x27;t do well!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> The unit broke right after the warranty period was up.  There is no way to repair it.  It was useless.</li>
            <li> This certainly is not as advertised on television and on the web.  Followed all directions.  Only interested in removing chin and moustache hair. This might be easier to use on FLAT areas like legs and arms.  However, faces and necks are much more difficult because of all the curves.  Did not work at all and finally just gave up. Motor and light went on and off unpredictably and little, if any, hair was removed.  Wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before spending all that money.  Just sent it back and hope return guarantee will work.  Did not even think of looking at Amazon to find it.  Big mistake.  Don&#x27;t bother if you want to remove facial hair.  WARNING: Be SURE TO READ the description on Amazon with this NONO.  It states \\&quot;No Return on opened items.\\&quot;  WAIT! How can a person try this without opening the box?  Bad idea - definitely don&#x27;t buy this if you will be stuck with it and are likely to be one of the 98% for whom it did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> First, I did not order this from Amazon, I ordered from the nono site so that I could get the money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on a limited budget, and have spent years fighting with unwanted facial hair, being beyond embarrassed to have anyone discover that I had this issue.  My skin is VERY fair, so it shows really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The no no does not work as they say it will.  It&#x27;s very difficult to get into (and keep) the correct position.  It then burns the hair, but even after making several passes over the same area, hardly any hair was gone (and that was very very fine hair).  I spent hours trying to get this to work correctly, and all I accomplished was burning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money, find a laser hair removal place and go there, most of them offer payment options.  I live in a very rural area where that&#x27;s not an option, so I will continue to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have about a week left before my time is up and then I can send it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> If all you want to do is burn your hair out, just buy some lighters. Works about the same and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a defective lighter. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper, not as much hassle, and you get the exact same effect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit approximately 4 months ago and it is a waste of money.  Right at 90 days the small tip broke and a month later the large one broke.  It states that they should last a year and you may have to purchase new thermo tips after the one year.  I used it everyday sometimes twice a day and in 4 months saw no results.  I used this for my hair line.  I do have dark hair and I do believe that it may work if you have blond hair but for brunettes it does not work!  I did consider returning it before the deadline because I was not seeing results and then read that it may take 6 months to see results.  I should have returned it; lesson learned!</li>
            <li> My sister kept asking for one of these things so my family pitched in to get her one. Her hairs are quite thin and this device does nothing. Nothing at all! We all tried it, and we didn&#x27;t even notice 1 hair taken away! I cannot believe that there are still companies out there trying to make money off people selling products that do nothing, and it&#x27;s not like this is a cheap product. You&#x27;re better off going out to get a real laser treatment than buy this.</li>
            <li> The biggest waste of money!! Terrible customer service.  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I bought that piece of garbage!!!</li>
            <li> As a few others have stated it does take time but it does work.  I don&#x27;t understand why others think they have bad customer service.  It is one of the easiest companies to deal with.  If you have a question or even a problem you can&#x27;t solve call them.  They exchange it in a heart beat.  After first problem that I thought I had, it was operator error but they sent me a new one anyway.  I decided to add extended protection. I&#x27;m happy that they even do that.  How many other companies let you use a product then return it for another, over and over?  None that I can think of at the moment.  Follow the directions.  Now I just use it for leg maintenance and facial hair removal.  It is thicker and more stubborn.  Use it!!</li>
            <li> This product works very well for that fine peach fuzz on the sides of your face and upper lip.  I have not had much luck with any hair that is not so fine like on my thighs or arms.  But it is GREAT for the face!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it for a long time. I didn&#x27;t see a thing it did for me. Big waste of money. My daughter said let her try it and she has been trying it for 4 monthes. She said I wasted my money. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I used it more than recommended and nothing. I still have a face full of hair. Now I can&#x27;t get my money back</li>
            <li> it did remove some hair on my legs but not all. Customer Service stinks....The large attachment malfunctioned. I emailed customer service twice and never heard from them.&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was information on how to get a replacement part and of course too late to return.  a razor does a better job</li>
            <li> I have been using the NO!NO! for over a year. I find that it removes a little of my facial hair, but definitely not all. And despite the ad, it burns. It especially burns around the mouth, no matter how I angle it or how far away from the lips I try to go. It burns under the nose, and it burns my chin. I am about to make an appt. with my dermatologist to see what I can do about a burn bump that has been over my lip for quite some time. One reviewer said that it feels like pressing a hot curling iron against your skin, and it certainly does feel that way when it burns. I gave up using this on my legs, as it did nothing. I am fair skinned and fair haired. I don&#x27;t have black, stubborn hair. Still, it takes a lot of going over an area to get it to remove any hair. I don&#x27;t recommend the product. I do use it every 4 to 6 weeks as it&#x27;s better than nothing. But I&#x27;ve gone back to tweezing hair around my lips, and I don&#x27;t expect full hair removal.</li>
            <li> I bought the NoNo off their website to get the 60 day trial.  I used it faithfully every second day for the first 2-3 months.  The product does not remove your hair as they&#x27;d like you to believe in the infomercial.  It appears to rid you of some, but definitely not all and the buffer doesn&#x27;t pick up the slack.  I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and face and even tried my underarms.  It&#x27;s been 9 months since I bought and no, I didn&#x27;t return it.  I guess I&#x27;m hoping that someday it will rid me of most of the hair, but right now, I could still shave my legs (and sometimes do, depending on where I&#x27;m going/what I&#x27;m wearing).  After about 4 months the unit began sounding different than it originally did.  I have not yet addressed this w/NoNo, so I can&#x27;t really comment of whether or not something is broke or malfunctioning.  But according to the unit, the heads are still good and do not need to be replaced.  Only thing different is the buzzing noise it makes doesn&#x27;t sound the same as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s like anything else.  Buyer beware.  It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend if you believe the hype that you will be rid of hair \\&quot;overnight\\&quot;.  You will be disappointed.  But maybe it actually rids you of some hair (may at least seems smoother at grow back)- who knows.  But what have I got to lose by continuing to use it?  Not like I can return it now anyway.  Just go into the purchase with your eyes wide open!</li>
            <li> I used for 2 months and the only thing it worked on was VERY thin hair.  No where else.  I called them and of course I was using it incorrectly.  I decided to keep it and continue using it the way they suggested and nothing happened.  Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want and expensive paperweight.  I regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought this over the summer after watching infommercials the last couple years and being curious.  This thing barely holds a charge long enough to do anything.  It does work on fine hairs, but it&#x27;s not worth the money knowing it holds maybe a 5 min charge tops.  It&#x27;d take forever to do legs, arms, anywhere else that they advertise using it on and after attempting it I didn&#x27;t think it worked well on leg hair at all.  I do not recommend wasting the money until they tweak this product.</li>
            <li> works on my face but have never been able to get it work on my legs.  am i doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Not completely satisfied considering the price. Does a good enough job but takes sooooooo long (1/2 hour per leg). Looks easier in the commercials. One quick swipe and your done? Ya right!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. All I got out of this useless thing were a few burn marks on my face. It does not get rid of any hair.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of JUNK! Doesn&#x27;t work and doesn&#x27;t produce any lasting effects. Company would not let me return it until I kept it for 45 days-guess what after that amount of time I didn&#x27;t get back to them soon enough and couldn&#x27;t return it at all. Now it sits on a shelf-pretty expensive dust collector!</li>
            <li> This item is definitely a No!no!.  After 4 months the product malfunctioned and wouldn&#x27;t break the contact.  As a result, severe burns would occur.  I kept the two heads carefully cleaned but it no longer shuts off.  A total piece of junk! When the product was operational, it was not satisfactory in hair removal.  I would go over and over an area and it simply singed off the occasional few hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had my No!no! for just over two years now. It works very will but I find it is a little under powered for dealing with hair on the face. Because of the way it works I have a hard time using it under my nose, around my chin because of how my chin is shaped and on my neck. But on longer flat areas it works great. It is a little expensive for what you get in the box but it is worth it once you start using it.</li>
            <li> Incredibly time consuming and the battery does not hold a charge for a long enough period of time. Sorry, but would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde female, lazar hair removal won&#x27;t work for me.  I have had my NONO for a few years now.  I love using it on my arms and legs but it&#x27;s not easy to use on the face - where I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> This thing really works!  It is awesome!  So easy.  I just didn&#x27;t believe the ads, but it is all true!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Before I wanted to spend a fortune on this device, my friend offered me to take hers home with me and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;So I did, I kept it for a few months, but found out very quickly that this does absolutely nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;Never did I have smooth legs or anything else smooth for that matter. Keep your money in your wallet, these people are laughing all the way to the bank.&lt;br /&gt;For 400 bucks you can probably get a few laser treatments that will get rid of unwanted hair. Good ole fashioned waxing on a regular basis works a hundred times better. The nono is a piece of junk and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it even for 10 bucks. Big thumb down.</li>
            <li> Simply stated, the product does not work!  Hair is burnt off and stubble remains.  Keep your money, you can buy the best shaver for less. I gave it 2 months in hopes my patience would pay off. It didn&#x27;t. I guess it is okay under arms and on legs if you don&#x27;t care about stubble, but if you do forget buying this.</li>
            <li> If you use it as directed it will work.  It does not give you smooth results if you use it once.  I have used it twice weekly and there is no regrowth of treated hair.  I had to use a razor for summer in the mean time but now my legs are smooth with little hair.  My neck and face are virtually fur free.</li>
            <li> I opted to use the machine without the lotion, since the lotion contains know carcenogens (cancer causing agents).  The machine did not remove hair at all, which leads me to believe that results would come from the hair removal cream.  I tried to get a refund and could not get customer service to agree, so I am out $200.  Will never recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased my Pink 8800 No-No about three years ago. It has never worked. If you have any grey chin hair forget it, it just runs right over it.  I have a lot of very fine peach fuzz on my face, this was why I wanted the No No. It will chew at it if you spend an hour going over it. Oh yes, If you do lose a few hairs when you burn your skin,it&#x27;s back in days just like shaving. It never has done what is claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I keep it and keep trying? So I could write this review and tell people the truth. No one can say I didn&#x27;t do it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive reviews are obviously paid reviewer. NOTICE HOW FEW POSITIVES COMPARED TO NEGATIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa L Granal. I don&#x27;t care if you believe me or not. Go waste your own $300 and find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest waste of money I have ever spent. They should be ashamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maureen</li>
            <li> I love my no!no!  I have tried lot of different products over the years and none worked.  I was very sceptical about spending this much money on a hair removal product but the laser hair removal I was paying for was breaking the bank and it hurt!  So I took a shot and I am so glad that I did.  I no!no! my legs and underarms every other day.  You must be patient and follow the directions with this product. The longer I have done it the better results I get.  Just remember, if you slack off, the hair will come right back.  I hate to shave.  Everytime I do I nick myself.  with my no!no! I have smooth nick-free skin.  Perfect for spring and summer and lets face it ladies, even in fall and winter you really want to feel that smooth sexy \\&quot;just shaved\\&quot; feeling on your legs.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, watching the commercials (stupid, I know), I decided to try this.  I&#x27;m too young to have hairs growing on my face.  After following the directions, I still had to grab the razor in the shower or the tweezers.  The only thing that I noticed the no! no! doing was turning the hair I was trying to get rid of black!  The smell of burning hair is a definite negative for me.  I even tried doing what the woman did in the commercial by taking it down my arm; nope, don&#x27;t know how they did it for the commercial but it didn&#x27;t work on the arm either.  If I had it to do all over again, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or my money.  Happy plucking!</li>
            <li> I have had my No! No! about 3 months.  Some of the hair is growing slower, but still growing, and most of the dark chin hairs are still growing back.  It works, but slowly.  Not like they advertise.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions.  It does not remove hair.  My wife has tried it on her lips and legs, does not remove any hair.  Attempted to get my money back.  No response from No-No.  I think that is how they came up with the name.  No-No worky, no-no money back!</li>
            <li> Total piece of junk. Burned hair and skin but still had stubble. This is a scam. Save your money and buy a disposable razor!!</li>
            <li> I really love this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can really smell when it is working,, doing its job and burning off the hair !!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the no-no pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finer hair on my legs and upper lip. I DID see results on my legs, and one time on my lip. It is difficult to do the lip because it is uneven surface. The instructions state that you WILL smell something like burnt hair. I did.  The instructions state to be careful with your face, and if it is uneven, you get hurt if you run over uneven spots (should not be used on scars, raised freckles and such).  So the upper lip was  a hard spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RETURNED the No-No. Even though I was FINALLY seeing results on my legs...i know it was only working because it was FINE hair.&lt;br /&gt; I really did not want to shave ...so I tried under arms. I have a scar there, so I accidentally got a slight burn. The no-no did not work under my arms with thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I mentioned the bikini line, i literally mean outside of the line where my swimsuit would be. I would not use the no-no within the bikini line. IT did not work here either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returns: I called twice. The first time, he made suggestions and gave me another 10 days of use. The second call, no hassle, no problem. The company mailed me a UPS label and I shipped it back on their dime.  My $$ was returned within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;WHEN i called the first time, the customer service person STRONGLY recommends that you use the lotion (which is formulated to also help stop/slow hair growth). I did NOT use the lotion, i did not like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;If they lowered the price to under $50, i might try it again. For the $300 system is insane for a slow-working or not working product. They need to get it to work on course/thicker hair!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for them to get it upgraded.</li>
            <li> No!no! Was just as advertised and as I expected.  You do need to use it regularly but when you do it sincerely works.  I especially like it for my underarms.  Perfect</li>
            <li> I have used the no!no! for months now, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take that long to use, and the hair takes so long to show back up again!&lt;br /&gt;The video that comes with it helps relieve any fears you might have trying it too!</li>
            <li> I love this NO! NO! This is the best invention in my lifetime. I do have one problem though. When I purchased this I was not told that I would have to replace the tips every 2 - 3 months. I never imagined that it would be that soon. The red light kept coming on and then I called the 800 # to find that I had to replace them already. That was $50 and I was given a discount. It is like $60 something dollars. If I have to do that every couple months that is a lot of money to run a NO! NO! I love it but I can see that I better work overtime so I can pay for the tips. By tips I mean the blade! If that is what it is called. I am sure that you get it. I really think that when you get this you ( we) should be informed that there is going to be this BIG COST! Just figure it as $360 a year to run it. That is a lot of money to shave your body!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product as instructed and couldn&#x27;t tell ANY difference in hair growth. I expected at the very least a little less hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought the NoNo and it was a huge waste of money. The commercials on TV make it seem like the hair disappears immediately. That is not the case. You will be better off running a pencil over the area because no hair will disappear. The refills are expensive and they don&#x27;t last either. This hunk of junk is sitting in the drawer collecting dust. Use your money for a wax or laser treatment..</li>
            <li> It works well on peach fuzz hair.  I noticed that the treatment level goes to the highest setting on its own, no matter how gently I glide it over my face.  I considered returning it for this issue. But I have adjusted how fast I move it over my skin, so that the highest treatment level seems to be okay for my skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is a POS. Do not buy it. All it does is make the air around you stinky with the smell of burnt hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing basically burns your hair off with a wire. Yes, the wire has safety guides to keep you from hurting yoursef but because of those guides you can&#x27;t get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like it and tried it over and over but it never got a close enough shave and always left tons of hair behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg. So you have to replace those buffer pads all the time and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the \\&quot;thermocon tips?\\&quot; Those are the things with the wire that burns your hair off. They wear out and need to be replaced regularly--so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the product reviews before spending $250 bucks on a POS this weekend on HSN.</li>
            <li> I got the first NoNo that came out. It worked great  .... AND THEN it STOPPED WORKING !! I would NOT buy another because I contacted NoNo about it and never got a dang reply.</li>
            <li> I was hoping No No would work as seen on the tv ads, but regretfully it did not for me.  However, I found their Customer Service to be about the best as any other Customer Service Dep&#x27;t I&#x27;ve dealt with.  I waited until after the 45 days they require before returning and asking for a refund.  I used the UPS pre-paid label No No provided, they received the return package in about 5 days, and my full refund was credited to my account 5 days after they received the return.  I was thrilled as I had read some bad accounts of their Customer Service not being up to par.</li>
            <li> After watching the infomercial, I decided to make one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I have always struggled with uncontrollable hair growth in the pubic region. After years of razor burns and ingrown hairs, I decided to give the NONO a try. I wasn&#x27;t optimistic but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong!!! Do NOT use this product anywhere near the pubic region!!!!!!!!! Purchasing this product is by FAR one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Not only did it burn my skin down there but I developed a severe case of jock itch as a result of the damaged skin. My sex life went from healthy to non existent. My confidence is gone and my lack of sexual activity has caused me to be a nightmare to be around. I pity my co workers and my family and and wouldn&#x27;t wish this punishment on anybody. Karma will catch up with the makers of this product someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this will deter somebody from letting this product ruin their life.</li>
            <li> This was such a waste of time and money. First of all I was willing to go through the process and really give it a go. The nono burns your hair so not only did it stick up my house but my boyfriend was complaining about how bad it smelled. So nasty! I kept trying it because I wanted to be hair less, so I would spend a long time using it and still I was not hairless it didn&#x27;t work at all. I have light stin and dark hair so i should have been the perfect person for it to work on. I want to tell everyone this product sticks literally. Dont even waste your time!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order the nono......until I seen all the negative reviews! Now I am saying NO to the NONO!</li>
            <li> According to consumer reports reviews, The downside to the NONO is the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell of burnt hair but that will stop over time.&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair is not removed right away but it takes about 3 to 4 weeks to see results.&lt;br /&gt;3. It ttakes about 15 to 25 min per leg depending on the amount and coarseness of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. Each area must be done in the beginning of the first 3 to 4 weeks at least 3 to 4 times in each session.&lt;br /&gt;5. You must have patients with the process they guarantee it will work.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you are looking for instant results this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upside to purchasing the NONO&lt;br /&gt;1. 60 day money back Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair grows back 93% slower over time&lt;br /&gt;3. Skin becomes very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you have the time and patients and you fully understand this is a process, you will be very happy with the end results.&lt;br /&gt;5. No Pain just a very light warm feeling.&lt;br /&gt;6. 3 heat settings you control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really like to try this product but I am undecided and this is a lot of money to just waist.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this hair removal device for a gift...unfortunately it does not work as well as they claim it does.  Did not remove hair at all!</li>
            <li> good, and since it&#x27;s wireless, it&#x27;s very convenient. i&#x27;ve used it for a while now, and  i do notice a tiny bit of difference, but i feel that you need to use it for a very long periods of time to show its complete effect.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the product from this company. The customer service is terrible. Their clerk Karina at extension 545 even hung up on us. She would not give us corporate address, phone number and return label. Bottom line, do not buy. If you buy, it would be hard to return and will experience horrible customer service</li>
            <li> a waste of money!!! Doesn&#x27;t work on legs, armpits, and bikini. never did my face before but now after using nono, I have to remove hair around mouth all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest rip off of any company on the net.  Their product sucks and their customer service is even worse.  They promise you one thing when you order and then when you you try to get a refund the story changes and you&#x27;re out $300.  Save a lot of time and a lot of money and don&#x27;t order this product.  Believe me you;ll be glad you did.  No one needs to be lied to and you certainly will be if you do business with these folks.  You&#x27;ve been warned</li>
            <li> Wish I had returned it within the allotted time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the mixed reviews, but thought this product would work for me.  It&#x27;s OK for fine facial hair, but not for legs. Extremely difficult to operate on upper lip. Burned myself the first time I used it, even on the lowest setting.  I gave it a good try, followed all directions, but Nair is my preferred treatment for legs -- cheaper too!  I gave it a full two months.  The leg hair was definitely softer, but never did get the smooth leg I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all open the box, use it as directed hair was still left on my body no no no</li>
            <li> I hope no one buys this but I know they will, I did.  What a lousy product.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t even come close to what they advertise, if fact, I would say it stimulates hair growth, especially on the face.  Don&#x27;t buy, don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised. Does not remove any hair just makes the room your in smell like burnt hair but you don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Oh please please please don&#x27;t fall for this piece of junk. I did....all it does is &#x27;burn&#x27; your hair off&lt;br /&gt;(that&#x27;s the &#x27;patented thermicon technology&#x27; bs) when it works at ALL, and it doesn&#x27;t work 90%&lt;br /&gt;of the time (you have to go over and over and over the hairs, burning your skin in the process),&lt;br /&gt;and if you return it and try to get your money back? (even during their supposed &#x27;trial period&#x27;)?&lt;br /&gt;YOU DO NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK.&lt;br /&gt;I till have the receipt from the USPS from when I sent it back. And I NEVER got my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this company is still in business,. And that Amazon is selling this piece of junk!&lt;br /&gt;VERY VERY disappointed in Amazon. I thought they knew better,.</li>
            <li> I bought the nono after seeing the infomercial.  Sounded like a great product and it had a free return policy if I did not like the product.  I have tried the product 3 times and each time it was terrible.  I just called to try to return it and apparently they have a little amendment to their return policy....It is not a free return unless you return it between 45-60 days after you purchase the product. If I want to return it today, I would have to pay for the return postage.  I am going to call my credit card company right now and dispute the charges,</li>
            <li> I have purchased this and other products from TV commercials over the years and I have also done a fair amount of research on these TV products, and this is my conclusion; MOST TV products (which I call the $19.95 TV Scams) are junk, just like this. They either are made over seas and of very poor quality or do not do what they are made to do. The whole reason these products are sold over the TV and not in stores like Home Depot, Sears or Walmart is because the scammers who sell these pieces of junk are after the Shipping &amp; Handling Charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever wonder why the Shipping and handling charges are so high? They have this scam down to a science. Advertise the product, give a second unit for free, and just charge shipping &amp; handling charges for the second unit...and those S&amp;H charges are always way way high.Well it&#x27;s because that is the way they actually make their money. Now here is the scam and how it works..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sell you a product for 19.95 + 12.99 s&amp;h, and I give you a second unit for free + 12.99 s&amp;h. I have now gotten 25.98 in s&amp;h but I put both units in the same box and it only costs me about 10 bucks to send it to you. My profit on s&amp;h is 15.98. The product is junk and you return it. I refund you the cost of the units less the s&amp;h &#x3D; my profits are still 15.98 after everything and you are out 25.98 + the cost of shipping it back to me. I sell 800,000 of these products over the course of a year with heavy advertisements. EVEN IF EVERY BUYER RETURNS THEIR PRODUCT, I will have still made $12,784,000 on that second s&amp;h for the free unit. The products were produced overseas for a total cost of about $3.00 per unit total to my door. I had 1 million units made for a total cost of 3 mill. MY PROFITS are still $9,784,000 and even after all the other costs of advertisements and the call in &amp; delivery services, I still made millions in profit on bogus shipping and handling charges...that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called shipping &amp; &amp;#34;HANDLING&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to the conclusion that most of these TV sold products are sold ONLY for the shipping &amp; handling charges as a profit. Anyone can contact an overseas manufacturing company, buy a product that is made inferior to it&#x27;s competition, advertise it on TV as the best product in it&#x27;s class, or the best thing since slice bread,  and make millions on s&amp;h charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED BY ANY $19.95 TV SCAM PRODUCTS. If it&#x27;s not sold in a store there is a reason for that. It&#x27;s because either the product is so inferior that the buyers for the major stores rejected it, or it&#x27;s being sold on TV for the s&amp;h scam. 99% of the people in those TV commercials that seem to be regular people who have bought the product, used it and are satisfied with it, ARE PAID ACTORS. READ THE SUPER SMALL FINE PRINT THAT FLASHES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN FOR 2 SECONDS! The law says that if they are paid actors, it must be made clear in the ad so they flash it real fast and then flash something like, &amp;#34;results not typical&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation to anyone who wants to buy a TV product is to first check the CUSTOMER REVIEWS right here on Amazon. I have been doing it for a few years now and it seems to me that if a product gets good reviews on Amazon by Amazon&#x27;s Members, I am always satisfied with the purchase. I&#x27;m not saying this to promote this website in any way. I&#x27;m saying it because it&#x27;s true and it works for me. I&#x27;ve bought some real junk off the TV over the years and had some true nightmares with customer services of those products trying to get a refund, so I have a good knowledge of this!!!me to the conclusion that most of these TV sold products are sold ONLY for the shipping &amp; handling charges as a profit.

            <li> smells like burning hair  doesn&#x27;t work  you look like a plucked chicken don&#x27;t waste your money  if the rollers get caught in your skin it burns you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she tried several times to rid her hair with this system. It did not work. I checked to make sure she was using it correctly and she was. I tried it on myself and it did not work for me either. Unfortunately, by the time my mother used it the trial period had expired. So I wasted $300.00. I purchased directly from the website. This was the worst Christmas gift I ever purchased. It simply does not work after one session or twenty sessions.</li>
            <li> No stars. Great ad campaign that sucked me in. No No does not work. Small head stopped working almost immediately and all it and the larger head did was burn the hair off when it did anything at all. Not Comfortable and a real disappointment---especially for the big price tag.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my elderly mom and she couldn&#x27;t get it to work! So she lets me use it after the warranty is over and I find the equipment won&#x27;t hold a charge and the laser light doesn&#x27;t come on with either head....I got a defective piece of equipment! and now can&#x27;t get my money back or possibly exchange this one for one that is not defective. NO SATISFACTION! JUST MINUS $300. PLUS FOR THIS CRAP ITEM!</li>
            <li> I only use the NONO on my face it works fine&lt;br /&gt;however frequently it gets stuck in the on position and gets very hot&lt;br /&gt;I have to turn it off and on</li>
            <li> This product works, but is takes forever to shave your legs.  I tried my underarms and it was just as slow.  I find I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should, opting for a razor instead.  But, if I stay with it, I did see a difference in the hair coming back.  Patience just needs to be the key word.  Not quite as fast as the commercials will lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> I think the price of this product is outrageous. I would not buy it if I had it to do over. I still use my nono, but it really dosen&#x27;t work like they say. It is very hard to do your upper lip and it does burn a little if the skin is not perfectly flat and in just the right position. After much practice I have been able to use it fairly successfully on my face, although, it does not get it as close to the skin as I would like. It might slow the growth a little but not much. On my legs it has worked in certain areas, but I have had to do it again and again and it always misses a lot of hair. The hair has to be just the right length for it to work and even then its hit and miss. I usually have to shave then wait a few days before its to the correct length.</li>
            <li> My review will sound a lot like the others on here.  I did not buy this product through Amazon.  I actually went straight through the website and ordered.  I received my product in a little over a week and began using it as soon as I received it!  I watched videos, infomercials, and read all of the instructions--only to be disappointed!  I used the product, got the burning hair and slight smoke affect, but NEVER saw hair actually be removed to leave me with a smooth surface.  So, I tried the buffer pad--all that did was irritate my skin and leave me with annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a good customer and followed the directions for use for about 1.5 months.  When I became frustrated that this product was not delivering I decided to contact customer service.  I knew I had to keep it for a minimum of 45 days, but return it by 60 days after delivery in order to get a full refund.  I talked with \\&quot;Maria\\&quot; at NONO who gave me an RMA# to write down.  I was told that I should receive an email with a shipping label I would then write that number on.  That was on 9/23/13...never received.  I can imagine the pain this will be.  I&#x27;m afraid to send it back and never get my refund!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note:  My unit was NOT user friendly.  When you see the infomercials and see the smiley, hairless models using the unit and there is a constant blue light; especially as they move so easily over the knee--that&#x27;s not real.  Mine constantly blinked the light at me--which was supposed to be an indicator that I wasn&#x27;t holding it right, or I needed to go faster or slower.  Well...it did it pretty much every single time I used it.  Very temperamental!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad case for so many people who really just want to know a product works and is worth buying.  I really dislike being taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product over and over for a year it seems. Regret I didn&#x27;t try to return it. It does not work on facial hair no matter how you hold it or how many times you go over the area. A true rip-off. The BBB should get involved. BAD</li>
            <li> It should be renamed \\&quot;no pain - no hair removal.\\&quot; I used it exactly as directed, to the letter, and it did lessen the density of hair on my legs, but it never got rid of all of it. And if I stopped using it for the recommended 3x/week, the hair came back as dense as before. Also, the buffing really dried out the skin on my legs badly, no matter how gently I did it. Overall, does not work. I gave it a full two months and my results are as described above. Once I stopped using it 3x/week, the hair just grew back like I&#x27;d never used it.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for a hair removal system that worked. I have tried waxing for years, laser, bleaching, trimming with scissors, and shaving! I ordered this with high hopes, and even called to return it and get my money back when I was still having to use it daily after 60 days.  I was talked into ordering MORE blades and to keep trying.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work and I still have the same hair issues on my face and neck :(</li>
            <li> I purchased a No-No twice.  The first went back to HSN because I thought the same as everyone else.  It didn&#x27;t work.  Then I noticed the hair actually was not coming back in spots, so I went back to HSN and purchased another.  It DOES work.  It takes time.  I had a spot that it was not working on.  I cleaned the tip and kept trying.  Then I realized I had another set of tips so I changed to a new tip and that solved the problem.  Yes, you smell the hair burning.  What would make anyone think you wouldn&#x27;t??  Yes, you buff away the crystalized hair.  Why wouldn&#x27;t you want to!!?  Yes, use it often.  I give myself breaks between treatments so what is going to grow back, will, then use it again.  You&#x27;ll notice less and less hair growing.  I&#x27;m almost to the point of passing this one to my daughter with a supply of tips.  Come on people!!!!!  Just use it, charge it, clean it, change tips.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer.  Geez!!!!!!!!  Why all the smack?</li>
            <li> I purchased my no-no at a store, not through Amazon. I do not recommend this product at all. It doesn&#x27;t remove the hair and leaves your face red and sore. It was almost like a burn on my face. Do Not buy No-No. It&#x27;s a waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfull since the beginning of June.  It is now the beginning of October.  I might (and I say might) see a little difference but not $300.00 worth. I have called the customer service twice and asked the same question and gotten a different answer each time.  So put your $300.00 toward real lazar treatments.</li>
            <li> Regarding the No No, be sure you understand what IS and is NOT advertised/proven. My No No is (unfortunately) exactly what is advertised: a hair removal product -- period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You, as I, are looking for a PERMANENT hair removal product.  No No does not advertise that it will permanently remove your unwanted hair -- and it doesn&#x27;t do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No No is essentially an electric shaver that burns off, as opposed to cuts off, your unwanted hair. You will want to spray air freshener after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No No advertises that using it results in slower regrowth of hair. Think about this.  Hair grows at the same rate of speed whether it&#x27;s starting from below the skin or at skin level, such as when you chop it off with a razor or scissors. If you remove hair below the skin surface i.e., by tweezing, waxing or using the No No, it merely APPEARS to \\&quot;grow slower.\\&quot;  If I shave a whisker from my female chinny chin chin, its stub can be felt by bedtime.  If I pull it out, it will reappear maybe 2 days later. There&#x27;s no \\&quot;slowing\\&quot; in the GROWTH RATE of a hair plucked from my chin. Rather, there is a LENGTHENING of the time before the hair says \\&quot;Howdy do\\&quot; after a longer trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A positive comment about No No is that it appears to do sufficient damage to SOME hair shafts below the skin on my face and lower legs to make regrowth visible a day or two later than would be expected after shaving or using a depilatory. I have used the No No on my face, on average, 5 days a week for the last 6 months, so I don&#x27;t feel too hopeful about permanent results. There is the REMOTE possibility that I may live long enough to see a permanent REDUCTION in hair growth after decades of \\&quot;controlled burns.\\&quot;  I dropped and damaged my No No last week and am not sure if I wish to replace it. The $250 - $300 replacement cost will buy several electrolysis treatments that just might do the job -- permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sought the advice of dermatologists, gynecologists, and endocrinologists about how to permanently remove body hair.  I spent $20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s having successful electrolysis treatments for removal of body hair. How I wish laser had been available back then. It would have been expensive but still only a fraction of the cost of electrolysis that took nearly a decade. And then there&#x27;s the thought that some electrologists intentionally kept the current too low so that I would keep returning for more treatments.  Needless to say, I have done serious sleuthing to get permanent hair removal results.  It is a fact that there are but two options that guarantee a permanently hair-free body:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Laser treatments for permanent removal of only dark hairs; and&lt;br /&gt;2.  Electrolysis for permanent removal of both pale and dark hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;Your Fuzzy Friendcrinologists about how to permanently remove body hair.

            <li> I have tried everything to get rid of unwanted hair. The no no seemed to be the answer.....sadly not. It will take off very fine hair but this still comes back. If your hair is beyond fine, don&#x27;t waste your money ! Laser treatment is the only thing that works, if you have the money the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does not take the hair off like it showed on T.V. We have been using it for 3 weeks and we still have to use a razor to get our hair off.  I would not recommend this to any one it cost way to much and it does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 stars if I could but that&#x27;s not how it goes. Where to start?!? The burning hair smell is just AWFUL, also you have to go over the same spot for like 5 times, you still have stubbles not to meantion. After awhile it starts to burn and it feels like it&#x27;s not doing anything (and it&#x27;s really not) also the company tries to trick you into saying you can&#x27;t return you called to late when u call on the 60 day return. And let&#x27;s not forget IF u can even return it u may NOT EVEN get your money back! $300 is a lot of money and waiting 1-4 for your money back! People just SAY NO TO THE NO NO it&#x27;s by far the biggest scam ever the little things u use to shave wear off way quick and u can&#x27;t just buy them you have to buy a whole new no no. I hope this was helpful dnt be fooled save your money!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money....clearly does not work like the commercials suggest. Over $300 down the drain!!&lt;br /&gt;And so far getting my money back has been difficult...so probably not going to happen</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased the NoNo directly from the company. She and I have both used it, it is working as we expected. Admittedly we did not expect the results they claim on the commercials. So here is our experiences with the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does burn the hair, smells awful.&lt;br /&gt;It does not completely remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I saw all the reviews saying they were burnt by the NoNo, but neither of us have been burnt the way they describe and I have to wonder if it isn&#x27;t operator error.&lt;br /&gt;I have really dark, coarse hair on my arms and legs. It is growing in much slower. I do not use it terribly regularly. But I have gone from needing to shave my legs 3-4 times a week to only needing to shave once a week. The hair on my arms is growing in much lighter and finer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the buffer thing, it looks like a pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has really fine blond hair and she shaves maybe once a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t know how people are burning themselves and breaking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I started using it on my husband&#x27;s face due to his facial hair growing so thick and covering most of his face. It is working on him as well.</li>
            <li> I have used it not many times, only for the areas above my upper and lower lip. It was difficult to obtain a good result.  I had to do  it over and over again.  At the beginning of October I noticed that the blue light was on continually and I got scare of getting burned.  I bought it in August/13.  I sent an E-mail to  the customer service but never got an answer.  Can you help ne?  I would appreciate it very much.  Thank you!  Lucia Mueller</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product.  To my dismay, the unit was defective.  I followed the instructions and plugged in the unit to charge the battery.  At the end of the recommended time, there was no light on the front bar and the unit would not turn on.</li>
            <li> The no no was a complete waste of money (and a lot of money at that). I read many reviews before I bought the product, they sounded very compelling actually, so I had high hopes. I tried the no no as directed for several months before I finally gave up. I have fair hair on my legs and it did not do anything but burn the hair down temporarily into stubble. There is nothing permanent about it. The no no is a scam if I ever was suckered into one.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Very nice set, has everything in it. You do need to be able to deal with the smell of burning hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to get proficant with it yet but I am looking to it and getting much better.</li>
            <li> When you see the No-no. It is complete crap. Would not recommend. It doesnt catch stubble hair which is primarily the main reason to even get something so outrageously expensive. Hell no. Im going back to cigarette lighters and nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am laughing at all the shilled reviews on this terrible product. You&#x27;ve been warned</li>
            <li> I am loving my no no hair removal system....the battery has lasted forever!  I would recommend this to my friends and family.  You need to give it the full trial period like anything else to know if it works for you or not!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, a little expensive, works a little too slow. Bought for my daughters and they love it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY,  DOES NOT WORK.  SMELLS LIKE BURNT HAIR.  HOW COULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO SELL SOMETHING THAT COST THIS MUCH AND DOESN&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT,  TIME LAPSED.  NO REFUND.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this item. Thank goodness for the reviews! I have certainly changed my mind! It is a NO NO for me! Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> The product is supposed to be painless.  Every times use it it causes great pain.  I&#x27;ve tried the multiple settings and still it causes pain.  I&#x27;m not at all happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I see they changed the advertisement to &amp;#34;a few weeks&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;immediate results&amp;#34;. I returned mine (still lost over $100) after watching the commercial again stating it removes hair with immediate results. I was literally watching the commercial of the gentleman removing hair from his arm while talking to customer service as she was explaining it slows the grow process and I would see results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried this, and while I was lucky to get my money back easier than some it was still a shockingly bad bit of junk. Seriously, they should  not be allowed to advertise and sell it.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of money and all you get is singed stubble. Complete and utter rubbish, please be warned and stay well clear lovely people.</li>
            <li> Takes way to many passes, missing thick hair and takes to long to when doing mulpile area&#x27;s. NO NO don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> This is a horrid little gadget! It burns your skin, along with a few hairs that leaves a stink in your&lt;br /&gt;nose as well as the entire house. Took a week for the burnt skin to heal, and yes I use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looked like a mild floor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Did not purchase this from Amazon, but from NO NO site.&lt;br /&gt;They will not take it back until you have use it for at least 45 days, perhaps hoping you&#x27;ll forget and time will&lt;br /&gt;expire on returning the thing.&lt;br /&gt;Believe me one time on your skin is ALL IT TAKES to know this doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;Shaving my legs is much safer, quicker, and I like the no pain of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;How is burning the hair suppose to prevent it from returning.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine using this on the tender skin of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, and your skin!</li>
            <li> Did not work the way it was advertized. I was not happy with the lack of results. would not recomend.</li>
            <li> This was the 3rd NoNo.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered before from NoNo on a trial period before paying and both of the first units came in old boxes and had obviously been used.&lt;br /&gt;Must have been sent back by people trying them for the free trial period.&lt;br /&gt;This was really a turn off and so my wife would not use them.&lt;br /&gt;Sent them both back and waited over a year before finally ordering one we had to pay up front for and it did come in a new unopened box.&lt;br /&gt;It is doing what it said it would do but hair does come back quickly.</li>
            <li> Do not suggest to use on legs instead of shaving, in addition to shaving, it works well since not as much hair grows back next time.  Yay!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, I find it difficult to use. I would like to return it for a refund. How do I do that?  Karen Portella</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my NoNo Pro. However, it did not work whatsoever. Sure, it removed some hair but it didn&#x27;t even get rid of it down to the skin like shaving does. I then returned my NoNo after the 30 day trial and they claimed to have &amp;#34;never received my return.&amp;#34; I am still dealing with the collection agency after six months of explaining to the company that I returned it. They owe me money for my return and they are trying to collect money from me. Big rip off.</li>
            <li> I takes forever to remove hair.  Even though it should be burning the hair, it doesn&#x27;t.  It may be too soon to be soon to judge (two weeks), but for now I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> bought two.  Used one and did not see any real effect to continue use.  Have second one never opened and still in box, don&#x27;t want to give to someone if it is useless.</li>
            <li> This product only worked three weeks, the electronic blades never lasted a week.  I was told I was being sent a replacement model but it never arrived.  This is a very bad investment because you have to replace electronics at a whopping $60.00 every month or so</li>
            <li> Piece of junk! A BIG waste of money, Norelco body groomer works excellent! I would not recommend No No to a bald person!</li>
            <li> Purchased No No over 18 months, tried it numerous times without any results. This is a rip off for us men. Please DO NOT BUY this product! Spend your money on Lasher /or Wax treatments you will be better off. Don&#x27;t walk away from NO NO; Run away save your money a giant RIP OFF!!</li>
            <li> The No No is a great product. I have used so many different types of hair removal products, laser, wax and electrolysis. I was skeptical about No No because I have purchased other products from T.V. after using this for a month I began to see great results, I have a lot of body hair and facial hair (for a girl) and this has been awesome. It has a slight sting when using but the results are worth it. I would recommend starting on the lower setting and increase slightly.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. This just doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. It may take some hair off, but skips a lot and just not satisfactory. In my opinion, it is a big rip-off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. A waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work even close to what they show on TV.  I waited too long and wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li> BEWARE FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! No No is a terrible product, and DOESN&#x27;T WORK!  This is a scam if you ask me. I have tried using it since April, as well as my sister, and we are very unhappy with the non-results. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product as I did. By the way, they have unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service.</li>
            <li> It just does not remove the hair!!! I&#x27;ve tried several times but the hair is still there I am at a loss on what to do</li>
            <li> I, like the rest of you reading this, was looking for a product that was easier or equivalent to shaving/waxing, with potentially some longer lasting results.  I didn&#x27;t EVER think this product would eliminate hair re-growth, but was hopeful it might be an excellent alternative to shaving. Maybe it would be easier - less ingrown hairs - smoother shave - last longer...? I was absolutely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT work on coarser leg hair (and, by the way, I wouldn&#x27;t consider my leg hair to be any coarser than average.). It simply didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair... at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my arms - just to see if the darn thing worked at all... it sort of burnt up some hair, but not a smooth close finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely not recommend this product, frankly, even if it was free.</li>
            <li> The No-No hair removal tool is the best painless way to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;The unit (comes with a charger) moves across your skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a fine stubble which one must buff with the pad to achieve&lt;br /&gt;smoothness.  It basically singes hair off, and there is a faint singed hair smell,&lt;br /&gt;but it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used in sensitive areas such as bikini lines without pain.&lt;br /&gt;The hair eventually does regrow but is much finer and easier to remove.</li>
            <li> This product is being advertised on TV . Please please ignore .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it may be the answer to unwanted hair on my face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it ( being a beauty therapist I thought I may use it within my business ). I used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and could not believe the smell of burning; leaving my face with curly singed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be taken of the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get a full refund which was very difficult.</li>
            <li> The product arrived and did not function as stated.  The seller approved return and credited my account within a very reasonable time.  The down side was that I had to pay for the postage to return it.  Very disappointed in the product for the high price.  The service was good but the product was not.</li>
            <li> does not work and having a horrible time getting my money back i have received confirmation they have received and signed for their product but I get the run around when I ask when my money will be refunded I do not recommend this product I think real laser hair removal is more affordable and long lasting in the long run and at least you not dealing with rude customer service. I would not recommend buying this and trying to get your money back</li>
            <li> From what I see in the reviews, this system doesn&#x27;t work and getting your money back is a hassle. Thats IF you get it back! Don&#x27;t the NoNo people read these reviews? Guess not, they&#x27;re too busy screwing the public!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receving this and as I live abroad I had to wait for a friend to get it for me… I originally bought it to remove the odd hairs on my chin but because of the size of the head I ended up with even more hairs… So not impressed…. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!  Thanks to the NO NO i have a horrible dark bruise looking marking at the bottom of my chin.  I tried to return the product and got the run around from the company.  I am really thinking of a product lawsuit as i have spent lots of money and time trying to recover my once before flawless skin.</li>
            <li> Well another not satisfied customer.......The truth is I bought it for my daughter who only used if for a bit and it kinda works but stinks so bad she will not longer use it. My real problem is their customer service. 94 days after my purchase I receive a letter saying there going to turn me over to a collection agency.......WHAT.... I paid for the item at the time of purchase. I called and spoke with 2 different people who were obviously being trained that day......(That should say something for itself) They were somewhat rude and demanded I show proof that I paid for my product. I tried to give them the acct. number and the payment verification and that would not do. It had to be faxed to a certain number and no E-mail was available where I could verify it was received. ( What company does not have E-mail this day and age) I was told to wait 10 days and call back to see if they were satisfied...........NOT GONNA HAPPEN........ Please do not waist your time with this product or company. With any luck they will close there doors and go away. ( I apologize in advance to those of you who have ordered product and may loose out if they do close. )</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS!!!!  The price was ridiculous for NO RESULTS!!!!  The advertisement that you present on TV is false advertisement. It does not work. Rather a miracle or it takes a while for results, I have had it for 6-7 months and I have had NO RESULTS AND NEITHER DID MY HUSBAND!!! And this is the &amp;#34; Pro&amp;#34;. DONT BUY IT, ITS A SCAM!!!</li>
            <li> Did not like at all.  It would have been a full time job to complete the functions advertised.  The other reason I was not pleased with this product was my whole house smelled like burnt hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I decided to purchase the nono hair removal system because I wanted to get rid of unwanted hair. I read all the bad reviews on this thing but, decided to try it out for myself. If I didn&#x27;t like it I could return it and get my money back. Well I ordered the nono and I recieved it a week later. I used the nono exactly as it said to do so in the instructions. The thing only removed half of the hair. My hair was short it wasn&#x27;t long at all. I went over the area around 8 times and it still didn&#x27;t remove the hair. Then I thought maby the buffer will remove this. I used the buffer and still nothing. I had stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a week and the same thing. It clearly says that when you use the buffer you have smooth hairless skin for a while and this was never my case. So I decide to return the product. I call customer service. I tell them that I have not had any luck with this product and wish to return it. She tells me that I have to have it for 45 days with it or I can&#x27;t return it. So I wait 45 days. I forgot to call before the 60 days I was 7 day late and now they will not refund my money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people bitch &amp; cry about this thing not working. Talk to a professional and ask the right questions. Make certain to re-enforce how important hair removal is to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then ask if the $1500 - $2500 neighborhood spa quality gear would be a better investment. If the professional doesn&#x27;t yes they are lying to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend $300 - $500 on no-no or tria or spend $1500 - $2500 on a unit similar to what pros use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You decide....</li>
            <li> Absolutly useless and time consuming! My mom got the free trial and it doesn&#x27;t even work at all. It also smelled very bad.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Not only does it not work, NO NO does not stand behind their money back guarantee. I called to inquire about returning, and you I was told you must keep the NO NO for 45 days, and return it before 60. Folks, that&#x27;s a 15 day window! They also tell the reason it did not work for me is that after using the NO NO, you also need to shave. Hello! That&#x27;s about an hour + on hair removal each time you need to shave! Plus, in order for NO NO to work, you need an 1/8 inch hair growth. Save your money and shave. It&#x27;s faster and waaay smoother! And you won&#x27;t be walking around with stubble.</li>
            <li> I got the pro 5 like 6 months ago I&#x27;m still waiting to have that silkysmooth feeling on my legs,  I have very coarse hairs on my legs which is why I opted to  get the newer version which costs over 300.00 the price is outrageous.!!! Considering it does not work the way it says it does. It works ok on fine hair which is why they advertise it mainly on your arms but if you think you&#x27;re going to have silky smooth legs.... forget about it !  I still have to shave my legs after using it.  Its very dissapointing considering how much it cost. Believe me it has a lot of bad reviews for a valid reason. Like a lot of people I was very hopeful and I gave it a fair shot but if you have coarse hair don&#x27;t waste yout time and money !</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star, considering how terrible it is. I tried this out, because the infomercial made it seem so easy and safe to use. Much to my surprise, this device is very painful and will burn the skin and smells incredibly awful when it singes the hair off. It doesn&#x27;t even remove the entire hair, just singes it and you are left with gross stubble. When I attempted to return this product to Radiancy, I was told that I needed to wait out the 60-day trial before returning it and once that time came, I contacted them again to be told that I would not be refunded. This is a complete joke. If you are debating on purchasing this product, check out Radiancy on BBB and it will make you NOT want it :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with the express consent of using it on my face. (especially chin and upper lip0. After reading the directions, I attempted to use the product. It did NOTHING to remove my facial hair. I am thoroughly disappointed. I won&#x27;t be buying any other products from this company again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pink NO NO 8800 for my wife about 2 u&#x3D;years ago and she LOVES it! You must be patient! It takes several uses to begin seeing results. After a couple of weeks is when my wife starting seeing her results. She has not used a razor in over 2 years and she has silky smooth legs. I think that others that give a bad review have not used it enough to really rate it correctly. Definitely recommend the NO NO.</li>
            <li> Did not remove any hair. It left me smelling like burnt skin and also when I used it, I was told it is pain free, well thats untrue!  I felt the heat and the burning</li>
            <li> this might as well be considered a scam, doens&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy it. Even if use it regulary for 8 weeks the results are minimal</li>
            <li> Yeah, hoped for a good product, sounded too good to be true. I don&#x27;t really use it, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> After carefully following the instructions for hair removal prior to using the NoNo and in a 5 week period I found this product grossly lacking in it&#x27;s ability to remove hair. Approximately, 95% of the hair was not removed even after repeated passes (recommended 4 passes), I performed 5-6 passes without burning or damaging my skin and the hair was still there. My recommendation is to clip and use a cream which helps to prevent hair growth.</li>
            <li> First I could not agree more about poor customer service, they would not honor money back...&lt;br /&gt;I tried many times it does not work, it is dangerous to use on your areas that you want to get rid of hair like your face and chest...when I called to ship it back all I got was accusations I was using it incorrectly, and refferred to a s person that just instructed me on what directions already said.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> very disappointing useless piece of junk.  I would give it a -5 stars if this option was available. I strongly don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a friend of mine who is of east indian decent.  She saw the ad on tv and was really exited about it. so i looked it up on amazon but i found that it was expensive especially when converted to our currency(Trinidad). she didn&#x27;t mind though so i ordered it. We received the package on time which is good. Later on when i asked her how the no no hair removal system was, she said it didn&#x27;t work for her at all. It was a complete waste of money. I didn&#x27;t want to say i told you so.</li>
            <li> I bought this piece of s*** hoping that it would make \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; a bit quicker. What a horrible product!!!! The first one I received shocked me every time that I hit the button, so I sent that back, got a replacement (after 3 weeks) and went to use it on my nether regions. Yea, it gets rid of hair all right...by burning it! Trying to get thru to customer service for a refund was a joke (not Amazon, but the manufacturer) and I got the runaround so many times that I had to threaten a supervisor with reporting them to the BBB to get my refund. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this from HSN couple years ago.  Used it faithfully with unsatisified results.  Looks good on TV like everything else.  It is cheaper on Amazon than I actually paid for it.  I kept it thinking I was doing something wrong as most other women.  But after over two years, I think not.  God idea if it worked.  Sorry to say, nope.</li>
            <li> At first the No No hair removal system worked.  But after a time, I noticed that I had to use the adapter and when I did the whole thing went wild and dangerous.  Why?  The whole thing became hot to touch and it was constantly emitting its laser rays/&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend it because it could also give you a bad burn.</li>
            <li> I purchased the No!no! Hair Removal System on January, 2014.  I watched the video included, followed all the instructions to a tee, only to find out IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS ADVERTISED!  My problem area is on the chin and neck area; and I ran the No!no! over and over the same area.  It did burn off some of the hair, but it left stubble, and not even the buffer would remove it.  I kept hoping the unit would work as promised, and I kept it beyond the time allowed for returning it.  I am saving up to have electrolysis treatments; at least I know the hair removal will be permanent!</li>
            <li> I can easily afford little extravagances like no no and feel very sorry for those who find money tighter and buy this in the hope it works - IT DOES NOT  WORK!&lt;br /&gt;i have had mine for 3 months now and used it 3 times a day every day and was being patient like you are told to. 4-6 weeks I read. I went round with stubble on my chin waiting for it to start to work. It never did. Humiliating and and infuriating!&lt;br /&gt;Went on no no website and funnily enough you are unable to leave customer reviews - not surprised.&lt;br /&gt;This is singularly the most useless piece of rubbish I have ever bought&lt;br /&gt;STEER WELL CLEAR!</li>
            <li> First of all when I ordered this product from the nono website I received 2 confirmation emails so I called the company and the sales department was a nightmare. The kid I talked to said it was his first day and lied to me about the shipping time frame and tried to talk me into cancelling my order and ordering from him. If I had done so I would have not had time to cancel the other one as he said and I would have received 2. Also everytime I asked a question he would just say your gonna love it, blah blah and would avoid the question so I hung up on him and called during business hours the next day. I did only order one and thank goodness because it already shipped by the time I had called. I received this product yesterday. I ordered it from the nono website to ensure I could try it for up to 60 days and if I didnt like it I would be reimbursed for the shipping, the product and the shipping back. Well I received the item yesterday and tried it out today. It is not a great product in my opinion. I used it on my legs and face. On my face there were a couple of thick hairs that I kept going over and it didnt remove them. It did remove some of the lighter ones but mostly it burned me in couple spots and didnt do a very good job on removing the hairs I wanted it to. Then I tried it on my legs. I went over the same spot numerous times and it some spots still had hair and that was only on the side of my leg I still had the other 3/4 of my leg to do and the other one. I suppose if you sat there all day and did it you could eventually take all the hair off but I would rather shave for 10 minutes. The only thing I cannot comment on is the long term effects of it and having the hair not come in as thick or as often over time. I only used it for a day but I am not willing to try it again. It was a waste of a half hour and I still have to shave. The burning hair smell didnt bother me. I think if the hair would have all been gone after 3-5 swipes in the same section I would have gave it more of a chance but it just seemed ridiculous to go over the same spots countless times and still have hair there that the pad could wipe away either. So now for the worst part. So after giving it a try and realizing I am not satisfied with the product I call customer service and they will not issue me a return label until I have had it for at least 45 days. So basically they know this product is junk and are hoping to get people to buy it and only leave a very small window of opportunity to return it in hopes they forget and get stuck with it. Well I have the date marked on my calander and November 10th I am getting my label. I realize its a business and they need to make money but I just think if people knew the whole return policy they would think twice about the trial. (I suppose I could pay the 10-20 dollars to ship it back and I still may but that is not how it was advertised and just wanted to give everyone a heads up. Especially since they will charge you the full price before you can return it and you will not be able to get a refund for the 45-60 days plus however long it takes for them to receive it and actually issue you the refund, so if you dont have a lot of money and are hoping you can return the device sooner and get your money back sooner, it doesnt work that way) Crappy product, crappy return policy, and crappy sales department!gave it more of a chance but it just seemed ridiculous to go over the same spots countless times and still have hair there that the pad could wipe away either.

            <li> Recieved my nono 8800 today and I was so impressed by the results. I use hair removal cream for my face and this morning I had some hairs on my face used no no and it took all the hairs off, plus my face feels so soft!! And it does not hurt one bit! although it did take me some time to get use to using the device.</li>
            <li> That photo us deceiving , I did not get all of those things! The hair does not come offf as easy as the commercials say they do !</li>
            <li> I bought into the marketing on TV. The marketing is effective, &amp;#34;Not a laser! Not a razor! It&#x27;s No!No!&amp;#34; The TV commercial makes it look and sound like such an easy solution to long-term hair removal that will make your life easier. NOT THE CASE. It&#x27;s similar to a laser in the sense that it&#x27;s very tedious ... you have to SLOWLY run it across every last hair and then buff that area to completely remove the hair. Sometimes, you have to do it two or three times in one area to achieve the smooth result. It&#x27;s similar to a razor in the sense that the hair removal only lasts a day or two and then it grows back because the No!No! beam is only &amp;#34;burning off&amp;#34; the very top portion of the hair, just above the skin. The only plus to it ahead of using a razor is that there aren&#x27;t any nicks in your skin at the end. Is it worth the amount of money they charge for it? NO!!!!!!! I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I sent for a NoNo for a trial. It didn&#x27;t appeal to me and seemed complicated. Plus some of the attachments would have to be replaced as well. It was pricey enough at $300.00. I had made one payment of $120.00. The ad said I could return it and they would refund my total refund including the shipping and even pay the postage for the return. When I checked for my refund on my Visa, I was disappointed to see that I only received $90.00 refund. Not only did they not refund all my money, they never paid the almost $25.00 I paid for postage for the return. They still owe me about $50.00 to my mind, but when I enquired they more or less told me to go whistle for it. The woman I spoke to was rude and laughed when I said I&#x27;d give them a bad online review.</li>
            <li> concept good but product extremely lacking.  I suggest you wait for the technology to improve.  this is an outrageously expensive product and hardly performs...if you can state that it performs at all.  I kept trying ... hoping...and should have sent it back within the 60 days but I waited too long.  don&#x27;t make the same mistake!</li>
            <li> a pain to use, and makes the whole room smell like burnt hair. I did not continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am a Cancer survivor, and hair grows now like a monkey. I really wanted this&lt;br /&gt;product to work. It worked a little using it at least 3 times a day sometime 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;  You can never change the Battery. After a year and you are out of warranty&lt;br /&gt;the battery will no longer charge. Your $ 270.00 is gone and no refunds&lt;br /&gt;  The manufacture claims no part, &amp;#34;HSN&amp;#34;  although nice on the phone dismissed&lt;br /&gt;any refund and told me to call &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;  directly. They offered me a $ 70.00 discount&lt;br /&gt;to buy a new one but no refunds or reasonable exchanges. I will not spend another&lt;br /&gt;$ 200.00 for a SO SO product that does not last any time at all.&lt;br /&gt;  Buyer Beware. Not happy in Virginia.</li>
            <li> my daughter, whom I purchased it for says she loves it and it works fine.  she has used many barbaric ways to remove hair but this is the easiest and best</li>
            <li> I did read the directions, but, as they say, a pic is worth a thousand words, wife could not get the hang of how to use it at first, then I tried, the blue laser light came on and I almost evacuated my bowels, it scared it nearly out of me!  but, then I saw a U Tube presentation on how to use it, I tried, it, damn if it didn&#x27;t work, then I taught my wife how to use it and for the next 2 hours I was treated to the scent of burning hair.  ICK, but, even in the directions it says if you smell hair burning, you know it is working.  It is pricey, but it does seem to work.  So, I suppose initially, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought the NONO on Sept 30th 2013 and put it up for Christmas for my wife. She did not use it right away until she could read the instructions. She used it five times on her face  the last part of Jan 2014. She had only used it on her face. The part holding the roller broke and the roller was lost. Realizing the 2 month return date had already passed. Searching all the paper work for an address or phone number was a failure. It was all in Spanish which she does not speak. It has a years warranty but we cannot contact anyone for information. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is an expensive piece of junk. I am a good customer of Amazon and have been exstremely&lt;br /&gt;satisfied until this. Need advice on how to contact the manufacture. Thanks for all your outstanding service.&lt;br /&gt;Harry E. Moore&lt;br /&gt;hmoore1030@aol.com</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT waste your money on this piece of rubbish. I bought one for my wife for Christmas.  Not only does it not work the No No burnt her top lip and she could actually smell the hairs burning. Her lip is now red, sore and blisterd.  Even after this she still had hairs that hadn&#x27;t been removed. WhenI telephoned No No for a refund I was greeted by a pleasant, friendly voice but this changed somewhat when I told her the No No was rubbish and I would like a refund.  She said that my wife had the No No on to high a setting.  My wife is not stupid and only had the No No on its lowest setting.  My advice is to buy a pair of tweezers and a magnifying  mirror, it may take you longer to pluck and sting for an instant but it is certainly better than getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Had to use it several times before starting to see the results that were advertised. Works fine now that useage is regular.</li>
            <li> I watched the infomercial Im not sure how many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched multiple reviews in YouTube and read reviews on Amazon, and still most reviews were positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I called and purchased it. Customer service sucks and is pushy. Supoosedly I got a deal with extra pieces.  But I am not sure I got what she promised.  I am not sure they charged me the correct amount since they don&#x27;t give a reciept or detaield packing slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all its OK.  Works well on my face. Seems useless other places. Its good because I can do it at lunch sitting in my car. be prepared to use it in combination with a tweezer or other form of hair removal, this is only one tool in the arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buffer things do nothing, and the case is a waste since you can&#x27;t put the charge and the devise in it. For travel I would wnat to take the the charger with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I am not sure I would spend the $300 again.</li>
            <li> Produst did not do what it was advertised to do.  My wife tried it for the recomended six weeks and found no results what so ever.  Tried to return and was told we were too late to return the product.  If you try this product do not keep for the recomended time to try or you will not be able to return.&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Hornsby</li>
            <li> seeing that it was not bought though the nono site itself, when you buy it here, and want to return it you do not get the money for shipping and handling back.&lt;br /&gt;But the product it self so highly touted by itself. I put it on just a few chin hairs several times a for the time advised.&lt;br /&gt; and its never even softened the hair, it did nothing. Oh you smelled burnt hair smell, which have no idea what it was&lt;br /&gt;doing to make the smell because no hair was ever removed. my husband tried it on a small patch of hair on his lower arm.&lt;br /&gt;he has very soft not much hair, and he also did it for several times a day, for several day. Some results, not one single hair&lt;br /&gt;was removed, but the same burnt hair smell was noticed.  I would not recommend this product unless you want to get your hopes up and be let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in light and love&lt;br /&gt;crissy snow</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it just doesn&#x27;t work. I read the instructions and followed them exactly. The buffing thing takes the hair off and makes the skin feel smooth... For about an hour. The actual device doesn&#x27;t do much at all, certainly not what it is advertised to do. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The product does not work which makes this purchase not only a very expensive mistake but also a huge headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product: It leaves your skin smelling like it was &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; and without any hair removal whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: I followed protocol and requested the RMA label. I prepared package and placed package for UPS pickup. Unfortunately, UPS did not pick up package as scheduled. Ultimately, my error. When discovered, I was notified I missed the 7 day window and was no longer qualified for a refund. This policy is ridiculous. You have to wait 60 days to try and then have a 7 day window to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What reputable company the delivers a quality product would EVER create a return policy like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> My wife has used product as suggested and is not satisfied with lack of expected results.Has used exactly as suggested/</li>
            <li> I gave this product a terrible rating due to the burns that I received from it upon the 1st use, the lack of level control which was advertised with the product, and the fact that it burned my skin but didn&#x27;t remove any hair during the process!  The transaction with the seller was very unpleasant due to the unresponsiveness and lack of communication despite attempts by myself to contact them.  I also found out from the seller that it was used on themselves prior to mailing it to us!</li>
            <li> No!No!, No!No!Good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was defiitely NOT what I expected.  It takes too long for the hair removal...it took 2 days and 2 people trying to get the hair removed from the chin area...there was also a little burning of the skin and some discoloration.  And then there were hair stubbles THE VERY NEXT DAY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the No No does not work as advertised.  I would like to return this item.</li>
            <li> I chose the one star rating simply because a zero wasn&#x27;t given me as an option.  When I called the company to arrange a return for a product that obviously didn&#x27;t work I was told to return it to the store even though the producy has a flyer enclosed telling you not to return to store.  After I got off the phone I took the product back to Bed, Bath and Beyond ( a 5 star rated company ) where they returned with no questions asked.  Stay away from this product and company.  Remember the old saying &amp;#34; if it sounds to good to be true it probably is&amp;#34;  This definitely applies to this product.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; used NO NO  religiously for almost two years with zero results.  Save your money(and it aint cheap!)&lt;br /&gt;The FDA should definitely look into this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and first it said it came to my house but the package never came! I told the seller and they sent &#x27;another one&#x27;. The one that came was the no no all by itself without a charger or any tips to it or any other information or accessories that are supposed to come with it. It doesn&#x27;t work at all! DO NOT BUY from this!</li>
            <li> Stupid purchase. Not working. Burned out in less than a year. Should be removed from the market.&lt;br /&gt;Bad bad no use gadget.</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone for honest reviews.  My mum is enthralled by the TV ad for this product and keeps saying &#x27;I think that would be great&#x27;.  After reading her all the negative reviews, she has changed her tune!  Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing a no no!  Saved myself a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product after reviewing the product website, and especially since it appears on the Dr. Oz \\&quot;endorsement\\&quot; list (\\&quot;Over 40 Breakthrough Fixes, Pt. 2\\&quot;). I was very, very disappointed!  It does not remove hair, even fine hair, like advertised, especially if you are of Hispanic descent.  I&#x27;ve never really had problems with facial hair until entering \\&quot;peri-menopause\\&quot;; the product works \\&quot;just Okay\\&quot; for facial hair, but I have to use it daily, almost like a shaver, to remove fine facial hormone-induced hair.  I&#x27;ve tried the No-No many times on my legs and underarms, but it definitely will not work there!  Overall, if I could send it back for a full refund, I would; the advertising is very misleading and the product is definitely not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought a no-no a few years ago.  That company should stop advertising falsely that this is the be-all end-all to hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I got mine and didn&#x27;t try it until after I had it for 4 months because I am extremely busy and it was faster to just use a razor than to wait for the no-no to charge up and then use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have been using it EVERY DAY to try and get rid of leg hair.  I can run that stupid thing over the same area 3 and 4 times and the hairs are still there.  The no-no is a scam and their advertising is pumping up an item that does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for something that doesn&#x27;t work, the price is absolutely outrageous.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to ANYone!</li>
            <li> It worked really good on soft hairs but I needed it for dark course hairs.&lt;br /&gt;after several tries many times it would not remove them.</li>
            <li> If  you Google No!No! reviews online, you will find illuminating information from Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> I used my wife&#x27;s no no pro IV (most powerful model requires a large outside  240 volt diesel generator)  I have very hairy testicles... and the no no IV is no better than my no no pro... yo yo bro! Rather than &#x27;pink&#x27;, can you make the color fuschia? Hey bro, fix that no no</li>
            <li> This is a scam!  All the TV ads must be fake. Remember the hairy guy,who uses the NO NO on his arm to shave and looks like shaves his hair in one shot! It does not work, period. My wife bought 2 of those for X-mas, we both tried to use while it burns one or 2 hairs does not do anything. Every time I see the add in TV it gives me headache, so much lie! My daughter said she tried her mom&#x27;s to shave her leg nope didn&#x27;t work.  Wished my wife had returned within the 30 or 60 days:( $390 dollars wasted. If you still want to buy find someone that alreay used it and ask if it really works. Is there a negative star?</li>
            <li> I have had my No No for about a year. It has stopped working. Very bad product DO NOT buy</li>
            <li> It did not remove the hair. It was the nastiest smell I&#x27;ve ever encountered! It left painful blisters all over my legs. I was charged one payment of $104, which I was under the impression was the only charge, then they charge me another $89 the next month and they claim another $89 charge will come out next month. As I went through the checkout process it NEVER said anything about more charges!&lt;br /&gt;This is a waste of plastic and not worth a penny of your hard earned money!!! Please do not buy this garbage from the Radiancy company!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and waited and waited for it to arrive. Seriously, three months later it arrived. I  guess there are lots of other chumps out there who also want to try the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; hair remover. FIRST OF ALL Trying to keep the thing on is the biggest issue I had. It has this tiny roller that has to be pressed down the right amount while rolling it over your skin, where ever you choose to use this thing. SO hair removal takes so much longer than simply running a razor ONCE over the area! SECONDLY, It burns the hair and your poor lip. I hated the nasty smell and guess what IT DIDN&#x27;T REMOVE THE HAIR! I really wanted it to work but the only thing it succeeded at was putting me in a bad mood. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Perhaps the makers of No No should be sentenced to prison time like the weight loss Book guy. He got 10 years for lying. This device is an out right scam! An over priced scam!</li>
            <li> No no means --no no --do not buy this product!! I tried using for 10 months would be better and quicker running a razor over my legs.</li>
            <li> I bought my NONO mainly for my face.  Works great on my arms and legs. It does take time but is worth the time.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well on my face as I would like but I do use it along with hair remover on my upper lip.  It is just hard to use in a small area.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  It really didn&#x27;t seem to do what it claimed.  I have had it almost a year and have not had much success.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product does not work and I cannot understand how they get away with selling it.  I used mine for five months and it actually worsened the hair growth.  By which time I could not return it.  Buyer Beware!!!!!  I have given it one star as you cannot give no stars.</li>
            <li> This item is garbage.  Simply stated, it does not work.  Ran it over my leg, 20 times in the same spot, and it did NOTHING.  I am sorry I wasted $300 that they WILL not give back.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and be fooled by their deceptive advertisements.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the no-no system after years of shaving and using other products that burned my skin and weren&#x27;t very effective at hair removal, as the hair just grew back. When I received the no-no, I immediately put it to the test, using it on my chest and upper back...the first time I used it, it took forever!!! just to visually see any removal, and the smell, my wife actually said I should stick to Nair as that didn&#x27;t smell as bad...they don&#x27;t advertise that in their commercial. Anyways, after a few weeks of 30-40 minute sessions of \\&quot;hair removal\\&quot; I decided that the no-no wasn&#x27;t working, so I tried to contact their customer service...3 days past before I received a response, coincidentally @ the end of my 60 day \\&quot;risk free\\&quot; trial. I would&#x27;ve had to express ship it that night as there wasn&#x27;t any return instructions enclosed with my no-no. You see, you have to send it back and have it in their hands before the 60days is up to get your refund. In other words I am out the $300 I spent on this garbage. I don&#x27;t even think I can recycle it, maybe I&#x27;ll keep it as a reminder that if it&#x27;s too good to be true...it is. Thanks for nothing no-no!!! Stay away from this product... and no, I didn&#x27;t buy the pink one, I bought the guys kit.</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say that the no no hair removal system is the best item that I have ever bought. It works like it says it does and the best part is that I absolutely love it.  I have no complaints about the no no at all.  The battery stays charged for a very long time,  I can use it for a week and the battery is still up on it.</li>
            <li> I was so interested in no no; I felt I just absolutely had to have one. Their onsite videos were positive and upbeat, ( duh, of course). I asked friends on facebook and got horrible reviews. Alas, I ordered it anyway. Unless your hair is long enough to be unsightly, this product DOES NOT work. I used it on my face exactly as directed; the little chopper heads cut my skin and it looked as though I had fallen and skinned my chin on something. I kept trying, but didn&#x27;t see enough of a difference to be worth more than 200 bucks and constant abrasions and scabs. Stick with the inconvenience of waxing and dipilatories, or pay big bucks for laser. Don&#x27;t purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I received this in reply to my disgruntled customer letter...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your interest in No! No! by Radiancy. We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the device. We are not able to locate an account for you in our system. We only have a 60 day money back guarantee so we cannot allow you to return it at this time for a credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replied with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your reply... You asked for my recommendation, so  I will post this letter on Facebook so everyone will know about your satisfaction guarantee... and that your product is a \\&quot;NO NO\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If this $200-$300 product is so good, why does miss clairol (who has ALWAYS seen and ALWAYS wondered) have to keep going over and over the same skin to get results, as do the other what-evers that are  trying to sell??&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU BUY IT, SAVE YOUR RECIEPTS!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the No!No when it was first introduced on the market.  It worked ok, but not super.  However, I continued using it to see if it was my fault or the product&#x27;s.  After a while it stopped working.  I called the company to ask what needed to be done, and was told that I needed new heads, inserts, or whatever they call those things you place on the end of the unit.  They arrived, and I tried to use it, but it split the skin on my face.  I waited until it healed, and then tried it again.  Same result, it split the skin open and left a thin sore about 1/2 inch long wherever I used it.  I called the company again to see what could be done and was told I was doing it wrong, to only go over the skin once.  This is what I had been doing for a year already, but they didn&#x27;t really care about my dilemma, and just blew me off.  I will not recommend it ever again, and will not purchase it ever again.  I hope they can sucker too few people into their till to stay in business.</li>
            <li> this item doesn&#x27;t work. I should have returned it. DO NOT BUY IT because it doesn&#x27;t work at all. it is garbage.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write a review, but I wanted to get the word out in my own way.  I fell for the advertising - regardless of all the negative reviews - and I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  I used the system diligently for 2 months, and it only burns the hairs topically - there are no lasting results. Do not waste your time or money on the No-No. Do some research and find a good quality product that actually works.  Trust me - don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have any real pain when using this product, I did receive some small burns, especially in my facial areas. I never achieved the smooth, hairless skin promised in the commercials, and I have used it for a year now. I lost interest when it didn&#x27;t perform as promised, and it has been an expensive lesson for me. I do have course blond hair, so maybe this is part of the problem, as I have stubble almost immediately if I shave, but bottom line, I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought it would be good for my skin. I&#x27;m very to everything from soaps to razor types. I thought this would be a great replacement for shaving/tweezing but it never worked on my hair. It would only singe the very top of it. I even used it on my facial area and all it did was burn me. No No removes NO hair. It was an utter disappointment. Forget it. I&#x27;ll live with razor bumps. At least razors work. The only reason I have it one star was because it&#x27;s required.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  The commercial didn&#x27;t mention the sound the thing makes or the burning flesh smell.  It is VERY noisy.  The worst is that it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair at all.  We were lucky to get our money back.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone trying it.  It is a scam you wonder why their commercials have no sound at all fromt he machine when it is in reality very loud.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing a difference so far.  I feel that I have wasted $250, but it&#x27;s possible that I need to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li> Removes hair, but hair comes back as before. Extended use finds same result. Now it&#x27;s just a very expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> I can not believe the price of this product and then it did not even work for hair removal.  Since I was past the return it just sits in my closet collecting dust. Don,t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased it a while ago and have been tinkering with it.  I must say that I am not very happy with it.  Yes it does remove hair.  Just not to the level that is advertised.  I use it exclusively on my stomach and chest.  I always have stubble afterwards, even though it says there will be none.  I use the buffer as well.  The only reason I did not return it is that I had cancelled my card that I purchased it with.  That would just make more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  I can do just as good of a job with a razor and it&#x27;s quicker with the razor.  I have not received a single burn though, even though that seems to be the major complaint.  I was previously using Nair and received scarring burns, even following the directions.  In my opinion don&#x27;t waste your money on NOno.  Just use a razor.</li>
            <li> This is all I have to say about the no-no.  NO.. NO!!!!!! Noooo! Do not buy it!!</li>
            <li> OMG I JUST GOT THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IT&#x27;S AWESOME.  I USED THE CLASSIC ONE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF DOING LASER HAIR REMOVAL BUT NOW THAT I FOUND THIS IT&#x27;S GREAT!!  I TRAVEL A LOT FOR WORK AND THROW IT RIGHT IN MY CARRY ON.  NOW I HAVE THE RESULTS I WANTED FROM LASER BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT AND I CAN DO IT WHILE I WATCH TV BEFORE A DATE WITH MY BF!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product and wasted $200.  I would smell burning hair, but that was only my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;...it made no effect on my unwanted facial hairs nor my leg hairs.  I spent a lot of time with repeated &amp;#34;applications&amp;#34; but still no results.  Then I started closely watching the ads.  They make NO claims for effectiveness.  The say &amp;#34;imagine no hair&amp;#34;....and so forth.  If they had a product that was effective they would not shy away from saying so.</li>
            <li> It did not work AT ALL, and getting a full refund was extremely difficult.  I do NOT recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> worst product I have ever bought and I did buy it a little bit more expensive. My hair feels as if I have been shaving and I have been using it for over 4.5 months. don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and it was about 50/50 good vrs bad. But I have tried it according to the instructions for about 3 weeks now, and it works great for me. This was a gift from my husband, and I am happy, happy ,happy.</li>
            <li> But this product is nothing like it claims. First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing). When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result. To treat an area sized 2-3 inches you would need to spend several hours. It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> IF THIS APPLIANCE GOES WRONG AFTER THE YEAR&#x27;S WARRANTY EXPIRES, THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING IT REPAIRED, even if you are prepared to pay. The only thing you can do is purchase another. &amp; as we know that&#x27;s a big outlay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is therefore don&#x27;t buy one, unless you are happy to pay £200 per 13 months, if necessary. Plus they&#x27;re not as good as the ads make out.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time. Does not remove all of the hair, and doesn&#x27;t slow the growth of hair. Still have to shave afterwards. Was able to get my money back with no issues though.</li>
            <li> My grandma purchased this crap and it don&#x27;t do ANYTHING . the actors on the commercials have false hair and shaving off fake hair do NOT waste your 300 bucks seriously .</li>
            <li> Worst product for hair removal. Doesn&#x27;t work properly it has terrible customer service I would never recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my No No and I was not disappointed.  Very easy to use.  I used it for hair removal on the back and neck with much success.  If you think about going to someone to help with hair removal, one visit will equal the price of the No No.  I know that I am saving money every time I use my No No.</li>
            <li> NONO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had trouble with the nono. I cant get it to do what it should. is it because I have coarser facial hair than most. do I need a stronger nono, is there such a thing or should I give up and return it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this NoNopro on a trial. it never worked for me at all. I could smell the burnt hair but even with the buffing the hair was still there..I put it in the box and after paying well over $300.00 for it, i was told i am past my return period so there is noting they can do for me..She even told me to try to sell it on ebay and see if someone will buy it from me there..now that is professional..&lt;br /&gt;so bottom line, i am stuck with product that doesn&#x27;t work, and i see how they make their money is hoping people will try it for the full 60 days so they can tell them they are past their return time, leaving them stuck with the product and out of pocket cost..I am very disappointed and would like to warn others of this type of business..</li>
            <li> Yet another tempted by NoNo.  First indication all might not be well is reading word for word NoNo&#x27;s own poop!&lt;br /&gt;Busy castigating OTHERS and saying one will be seen off.&lt;br /&gt;Their description of rivals made me suspicious so turned to Amazon, to whom many thanks, and read several reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou Amazon.  Thankyou, the unlucky people who have been through the trials and triblulations and have taken the time to write reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be a buyer, am not very hairy anyway!</li>
            <li> It did not work!  It is not a shaver and will not remove all your hair. Does not work on chin area or bikini area. When I called a customer service rep with my complaints she said &amp;#34;Well we never said it removes all your hair&amp;#34; (What??) Could not get the whopping $300.00 cost refunded because I stupidly waited too long and called on the 61st day and was told refunds only after 60 days. This is a scam!!Can&#x27;t believe they get allowance for so much false advertising. They should be shut down by the BBB or the FCC. Do not spend your hard earned money on this bogus product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the no no device, 8800. Its promising result was not so promising. It&#x27;s a rip off and I did not notice ANY changes for hair removal!! DO NOT waste your time!!</li>
            <li> I used this for about two weeks and showed no sign of change in my hair. I tried it on my arm hair which isn&#x27;t think just dark in color. I called customer service and asked to return the product which I could but I wouldn&#x27;t get a full refund. They than asked why and I told them that it wasn&#x27;t removing any hair. The man then responded with yeah a lot of people think it&#x27;s a hair remover but it&#x27;s not... Umm yeah talk about misleading commercials. Definetly my worst most stupid buy ever</li>
            <li> I did not know that it was not a permanent hair removal until I had the NO NO for 2 weeks.  It is O.k.  I will continue to use and see if it works like they said.  I may not have gotten it if I knew I had to use it forever.  Shaving is not that bad!!!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to any one.  The NoNo is quite expensive for producing little to no results.  I purchased one several months ago used regularly with no positive results make one feel duped.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the performance of my No No!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  I am trying to return it.  The claims they make on tv are false.  I went over the same spot on my leg 30 times (you are supposed to go over it four times to achieve the same look and feel as waxing) and could barely tell the difference from where I had not used it.  I do not have thick hair so I was really hoping it would work.  Even after using it for quite a while I see NO difference in how the hair grows.  I did a test spot so that I could compare it to areas that I did not treat.  When they say &amp;#34;Imagine being able to go weeks without shaving&amp;#34; they should say &amp;#34;Imagine because the reality will not match&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory is that they make their money not from having a quality product but from people not sending it back in the small window of time they allow for returns because they keep holding out hoping that it will work.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT WORK!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I have been trying it for 2 months now and still have facial hair. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK AND THEIR COMMERCIAL IS IRRATING AS H***! Give it one try and you know it is a piece of junk, keep trying it in hopes it works over time and you find you wasted so much time trying to believe in something that doesn&#x27;t work you feel stupid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and I can only speak about my own experience.I have dark coarse chin and neck hair as well as upper lip hair.I tried creams ,wax,tweezing and yes shaving.No girl or woman wants facial hair.So I really had very high hopes for this product to work.I read all the instructions in the book and did a patch test.I was very patient as I waited for results.&lt;br /&gt;First problem was the burning hair smell which I wouldn&#x27;t have mind if it took away the hair.Yet all I got was skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;and red blotches and the hair remained.Also I stuck with it and continue to use it for 3 weeks all the while hoping.So as I said for me the No No was a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it remove my hair....No No</li>
            <li> With all the advertising on the TV and internet it sounded like the perfect device. Unfortunately after my wife read the instructions twice, it did not remove a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;She rechecked the instruction , insured the battery was fully charged still nothing. The box it came in would probably do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend Amazon, they are a great company and provide excellent customer service. I will continue to use them for internet purchases.</li>
            <li> So I read the negative reviews after I tried this for about half an hour and was not impressed.  As I spent near 350.00 I was not just ready to give up. I have very course black chest hair and had tried several products to get rid of it and nothing worked. After awhile I figured out the problem with the no no was and that is the buffer wears out very quickly. What I did is I went to Walmart and bought these Velvet Touch pads by beauty maid that are the equivalent of the no no buffing pad although quite a lot rougher. At first these Velvet Touch pads irritated my skin quite a lot but once you use it and it smooths out they work amazingly in conjunction with the NO NO. My stomach is now smooth and hairless and my chest is getting there and this is after only a week. It does take a long time but worth it. I simply put on the TV and went back and forth between the two products as much as I could the last week. Don&#x27;t give up so easily, this method does work quite well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. I couldn&#x27;t get my money back in tears by the disappointment. I should known. This is a useless toy!! It does nothing at all! I thought &amp;#34;maybe it&#x27;ll work if I keep using it.&amp;#34; Nothing!  Waste of time. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Horrible unit. Do not purchase. Does not work and the little black rubber band on the unit has broken.  Radiancy will not repair!!!!!</li>
            <li> Shocked to see so many negative reviews!! Truly I have had no issues with the nono. I really like it! Only reason I stopped using it was that I lost the charger.&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, I&#x27;ve had this product for going on 3 years and it has never broken or stopped working. My dad is Italian, so I got his unfortunate hairy gene -_- and I&#x27;m a girl, so that was a big part of my awkward phase.&lt;br /&gt;I use the nono for my arms (hair is moderately fine, not coarse, but about 1/2in to an inch long, no joke!). It got rid of all of it! What a trooper.&lt;br /&gt;Never burned my face. Got all the chin hair, upper lip, and side burn. Maybe once or twice I irritated the corner of my lip by accident but it didn&#x27;t burn. Certainly nothing I would write a negative review about.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it&#x27;s not a 5-star is that it doesn&#x27;t work on my legs :/ I guess the hair&#x27;s too coarse! Even though it&#x27;s /supposed/ to work on men too. Who knows! Also it didn&#x27;t get my bikini area. But I always wax for that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;But aside from those problem areas, it&#x27;s wonderful! Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s simple, effective, painless, and quick! Makes a big difference for me. Can&#x27;t wait to get my new charger in the mail!</li>
            <li> No! No! Pro! The Product is a Razor/shaver to be a if you will Hair Removal. This system sadly doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me because I tried lazar my Beard, and nothing happened. That is a major disappointment. I wanted a razor to remove my beard, but that didn&#x27;t happen. I really wanted this product, just to find out if doesn&#x27;t work, maybe for other people but not me. That should have worked out fine. 4 out of 10, that is the first bad grade I ever gave to a Amazon Product. For those who want Hair Removal you might want to reconsider your decision first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review From, Rogness</li>
            <li> works best on my legs.  have not yet given it a chance in many other places.  Oh, it was WONDERFUL on my arms and hands.</li>
            <li> first, I want to thank all the reviewers who have taken the time to review the product and save me loads of money and angst!  after trying a friend&#x27;s No! No!, I considered purchasing one, but, of course, you can&#x27;t tell much from trying a friend&#x27;s. my friend, by the way, is not happy with hers, and is willing to sell it to me at half price.  nice friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in return for the kindnesses of reviewers, let me offer some advice: when purchasing questionable products with questionable success rates and questionable guarantees:  PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD, preferably AMEX. as soon as you realize you&#x27;ve made a mistake, the product is garbage, call your credit card company and ask them to withhold payment.  they will back you up, and I&#x27;ve found Amex the easiest to deal with in this regard.  you may have to explore the vagaries of the credit card company you&#x27;ve chosen to use, but hey, it&#x27;s going to be a lot more reliable/reasonable than the product&#x27;s representatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my other piece of advice comes from a sage who counseled me in my younger years:  \\&quot;A person will tell you everything you need to know about themselves in the first five minutes of talking to you.\\&quot;  this advice has worked for me without fail and I&#x27;ll bet it works in the case of many products, too:  there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s called No!No! ... !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Save your money! You can get the same results by burning the hair off your body with a lighter. It stinks too because it simply is burning the unwanted hair and it barely removes the hair even on the highest setting. Read the other bad reviews for additional truth. Do not buy! Terrible product!</li>
            <li> I bought the pink nono 3 years ago because I had a few hairs on my neck and chin. 3 years later, I have hundreds of hairs on my neck and chin and if I don&#x27;t nono it everyday, I have a man beard.&lt;br /&gt;The nono does take your hair away but it comes back 10 x more so you have to use it forever. If I don&#x27;t use the buffer pad every few hairs, I have prickles on my chin and it is very embarrassing for a lady to have prickles.&lt;br /&gt;I called nono before my 60 days and the girl told me to keep using it and my hair will stop growing. Well now it is 3 years later and I have to use it every single day and I have way more hairs than when I started.&lt;br /&gt;IF you are buying this product for your chin and neck, DO NOT BUY IT. I am so disappointed and I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy the No No from the on line site as seen on TV those guys are scammers big time! They will double bill your credit card, and refuse to correct the order over the phone. Their customer service said they will send me two units and when I send the extra unit back they will credit my card accordingly. I advised customer service to cancel the entire order and the customer service supervisor said he could not do that as I was not in their system...WHAT! How do you send something if your not in the system? There is no place online to review their company so thought at least if I posted here it may save someone the same scam. I should have bought it from Amazon then I would have only been billed once.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a no-no after seeing it on TV. Even though it was expensive, I had to have it. Got it and found it to be cheap feeling and the case was pretty flimsy and not a perfect fit as you would think. I have owned mine now for almost a year and have yet to find the time to actually sit down and complete a shave. It takes hours just to complete 1 leg let alone move on to the other. I end up having to physically shave! I would not recommend this product. Just stick to the shaving and waxing and spend your money on something that actually WORKS!</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions with this product and it did not work.  Pure and simple!  I phoned the company to send it back for the refund but was convinced to keep it and they were going to send me another \\&quot;newer\\&quot; version, that was supposedly stronger.  I phoned several weeks later only to be told they had no record if that arrangement and they would investigate.  When I phoned again, they stated that they still had no record but that the \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; product could not be shipped to Canada.  Meanwhile, the 60 day return guarantee had expired so now I&#x27;m stuck with a useless product that I paid $300 for.  Serves me right for falling for something that seemed too good to be true!  It was!!</li>
            <li> My NoNo was a waste of money. It did not do a good job on dark coarse hairs on my chin. Very disappointed for the money I paid.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the no no it worked well and I was pleased. So I know I was using it correctly. After a few months it stopped getting the hair and my hair was getting thicker, stronger and blacker. It left more hair than it took off and took forever to get a little off my legs. It was just faster to shave. Since then when trying it again it fell on the floor and the glass in the display broke so it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Should have know it was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I bought this item in 2012 and have not seen much results. I am extremely disappointed.  The claims about hair free in few weeks are simply not true. There is a reason for the 60 days MBG, namely you will not see any change or results in 60 days. My mistake for not returning this $300 piece of crap is trying to be patient based on the info posted in the product website  that  some people may need more than 12 weeks to see results. They should add \\&quot; more than 12 weeks, in perpetuity\\&quot;. Also it is very time consuming and hard to use on sensitive areas. After much frustration, I did not use for some time and now it is acting up and not working properly. Literally, a waste of time and money and a great source of frustration. DO NOT BUY A NO-NO HRS and save yourself all these things. Plus I bought it during a promotion and used the option of paying three monthly installments. For some reason I was charged more than the initial invoice. I submitted an online inquiry to customer care and never heard back from them. I would give this product 0 star rating if I could complete a review with that choice.</li>
            <li> Does not work on legs at all, leaves them stubbly.  Does nothing for slowing down the growrh pattern even after using for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my face red.  for my peach fuzz,  I have to use it weekly, at least.&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair naturally,  so it isn&#x27;t course&lt;br /&gt;THIS JUST IS A VERY LUCRATIVE GIMMICK!</li>
            <li> After many years of fighting hair removal from areas that I didn&#x27;t want there to be.  NO NO came up with a wonderful product the NO NO.  Easy to use, No scarring, quick.  I love it.  If you have facial hair that you want gone, buy this one, All those others I tried were just a waste of my time and in some cases painful and irritating to my skin.  I no longer have to deal with that I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the nono last year!! Use it on my face and chin, it smells real bad and works on fine hair!! Then hair grows back thick and black and it won&#x27;t remove it after that!!  I have lost box it came in and just had to face the fact I had to take a loss on this NoNo!!</li>
            <li> Not fantastic, if it works at all one can&#x27;t tell. Terrible customer service. Waste of $. Regret the purchase. I called customer service. They weren&#x27;t helpful. Told me to keep doing it and I had to use the cream. Didn&#x27;t make a difference. I tried contacting them later and got no response to my email.</li>
            <li> I gave this two starts because it does actually reduce the hair in less time than tweezing (on my face) but it is not a good product. I bought this product about two years and I liked it at first. But after a few months of using it (only on my face) it began to malfunction and would only operate on the highest setting- which is a little too much for facial hair, but I am extremely hairy and desperate so I keep using it. One major issue I have with this product is that it does hurt- a lot! When you use it on the upper lip it zaps the skin in the middle because of the contour of the lip and this product also burns the skin if you use it in the same place too much, which you will have to do because it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair. I have to tweeze after each session too. I would never buy this product ever again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;definetly would not reccomend...another over advertised product that doesn&#x27;t work!!!!!! My wife asked for this for christmas...Piece of junk!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this at a local department store. Tried it for a week. This is simply not an effective product and gets rid of very little hair. Returned mine, went back to a shaver. The end. My advice, avoid.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked yet, I have been trying to get the hair off my legs keep letting them grow&lt;br /&gt;I thought if the hair got longer it might work, but no not yet&lt;br /&gt;Fran Eldridge</li>
            <li> Just got off the phone with NoNo and am too angry to go into a long rant, but I really wanted to warn people about the slippery return policy. They tell you that if you return the product before 45 days, you&#x27;ll eat the return shipping cost - what they don&#x27;t mention is that they will go ahead and deduct $15 from your product refund to cover their initial shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;It basically cost me $25 to try out a incredibly time consuming product that I knew I didn&#x27;t want the minute I unpacked it and read the full story about it - it&#x27;s quite different than the story they tell on tv.</li>
            <li> It was a present for my wife and she says it does not work as good as the commercisls say it does.</li>
            <li> I tried my nono today for the first time,and I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I tried the nono on my arms,and now they are hair free,they were very hairy.The nono isn&#x27;t hard to use once you get the hang of it.The burnt hair smell is kinda bad but hey who cares open up a window or something.Now i just have to wait and see how long it&#x27;ll take the hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift from my husband for Christmas--the product does not work.  So far, it has  not removed ANY hair.  I had friends read the instructions &amp; try it --same results.  It is a huge disappointment.  And the seller states they will not allow returns for a refund.</li>
            <li> Almost everyone who has given the NoNo a good review, 4/5 stars, have not bought the product here. has not reviewed any other items on amazon! Very suspicious! Those who have reviewed the NoNo poorly have reviewed many items on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this item for around 5 months now with no result. Thats my reivew plain, simple and clear cut. The hair amount is the same, the density, the frequency, etc. Also, the smell when using is less than desirable which would be less of an issue if the product actually worked. Its worth far less than the actual cost and I am not at all satisfied with the result. Dont waste your hard earned money on this. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the no-no in sept 2014. it worked for three uses and then it refused to charge and just glowed red without removing hair&lt;br /&gt;I have an old one that worked for three years before having the same problem. No-no absolutely refuses to help. they say its a warn out tip  ha! after three uses? I think they should at least provide a new tip.  they stink.  willing to sell me a new one tho!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product......it is a rip off ....does not remove hair!!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would. This piece of crap is not worth it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would not even remove the thin thin hair on my inner arm. Forget about anything thicker than that. All it did was burn some of the hair and made my room smell like burnt hair. When I spoke with customer service, they said, &amp;#34;oh, well it&#x27;s not meant to remove your hair. It&#x27;s working but you just can&#x27;t tell.&amp;#34; -_-&lt;br /&gt;It sounded like a joke. And then he proceeded to try and sell me hair removal cream. I demanded a refund and they did not even refund me the full amount. They jipped me about $8 which I didn&#x27;t bother calling about because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble but they advertise that they will give a full refund plus the cost to ship back. They did not do that as advertised. Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good. I didn&#x27;t maybe use it long enough to really test it out right. So...if I could win one, then I would try it:)</li>
            <li> I have tried it and am totally disappointed.  It does nothing.  That&#x27;s a lot of money for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your return policy is a joke.  I&#x27;d like to have my money back.  Can you make that happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product.  Deceitful advertising.  Maybe it will just take a law suit to get our money back.</li>
            <li> I have had my NoNo for a while now.  I used to need to use it several times a week...then less and less often...now i use it two or three times a month.  It is GREAT.  I no longer have those dark or noticable long hairs on my face.  I do not even think about them any more...I just get out my NoNo and they are gone at the first sign of them.  Very easy to travel with...it&#x27;s case is small and neat.  I do recomend this product...often.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing .... it does not do as advertised and it is too late to send it back.  I do not&lt;br /&gt;recommend it period!</li>
            <li> The NoNo is the best thing that ever happened to me. it really works.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t think it would. did the hair on my arms and it never grew back.&lt;br /&gt;Great little item.</li>
            <li> Being a hairy man I have tried waxes and creams and well as just plain ol&#x27; shaving always the hair comes back very quickly. I saw the commercial for the NO NO for men and decided to try it. Boy was I disappointed. This product does nothing except singe the hair. I tested it on the back of my hand and it seemed to work ok. But when using it on my chest, underarms or back it failed to do anything except make a smell of burnt hair. Undeterred I followed the instructions and used it every day hoping I would see a difference. Unfortunately there was none. After three months of trying I gave up. While this product may work for the occasional blond chest hair it clearly is incapable  of removing any coarse hair at all. I strongly suggest saving your money and go another route.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the pink nono (model 8800) for 15 months. From the beginning, it didn&#x27;t work very well. I followed their instructions to use it twice a week on the area (a lot of light blond hair on my face--hormonal) for 6 weeks. It ALWAYS left stubble. I would buff and buff--still stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 6 weeks, I used it once a week. I kept hoping that the hair would stop growing. It didn&#x27;t and I still had stubble because the nono didn&#x27;t get rid of the whole length of each hair and the buffer pad was nearly useless. I kept using it because at least the stubble didn&#x27;t look as bad as the full-length peach fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the nono for 15 months, it quit working right. Nearly $300 and it breaks a little over a year later? What a racket and a rip off!!!! It wouldn&#x27;t recharge at all, and the only way it would sort of work was by plugging it in. When I tried to use it that way, I could get maybe 5 minutes out of it before it quit working again. So basically, it is a $300 piece of junk that doesn&#x27;t do what the ads say, and then it breaks within a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON&#x27;T WASTE IT ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK. DON&#x27;T FALL FOR THE FALSE ADVERTISING OR THE FAKE REVIEWS THAT SAY IT&#x27;S GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can stand it, wax your unwanted hair. At least that way, the hair REALLY is gone for 3 or 4 weeks, and waxing DOES slow hair growth after a while.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to get any positive results with it.  Planning to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Also will post my findings on Facebook as I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY AND IF YOU DO, DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON..READ BELOW WHY YOU SHOULDNT. If there were a no star rating would be best! 1st- according to the manufacturer  they do not accept returns on the No No bought via Amazon but only when purchased via HSN and their website. So why through Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho...also Consumer Reports stated that ot took about 25 minutes per leg and still left prickly hair. That shaving was faster and left legs smoother. And the NoNo left such a terrible burnt hair smell, which is what it really is doing. All in all...its not worth the price tag. The BBB is full of complaints. Stick with shaving or waxing peeps.</li>
            <li> Just perfect. I love it.</li>
            <li> The NoNo removes hair but when it is removing the hair it leaves your house smelling like burnt hair and it burns you when it is removing long hair. The only way to get the smell of burnt hair out of your house is to completely air it out I am talking all windows and doors open and fans on. If you like your house to smell like burnt hair and like getting burned while your shaving than this is the product for you but if you don&#x27;t like that.DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the item because I wanted to get rid of facial hair and it would also be nice not to have to shave my legs. The nono does NOT work as you see it on TV! You must go over the area again and again and again and still there is hair left. It takes forever to get one little area close to being &amp;#34;hair-free.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t been able to get the thing to work on my facial hair AT ALL. I&#x27;m sending the nono back and I don&#x27;t care if I have to pay the shipping! it&#x27;s practically worthless!</li>
            <li> After using this product I thought it ROCKED!!!... Not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just pulled the old Louisville slugger out of the basement that I haven&#x27;t used since 1991. I took the &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; and the bat outside and sent that thing to outter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of negative reviews out there, but my wife says it works perfectly.  It came quickly and exactly as advertised.  My wife uses it all the time and loves it.</li>
            <li> This device was more like a torture device than a healthcare/beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it left horrid noticeable burns to any location it was used while at the same time failing to remove hair the smell while using this product is awful the smell of burning hair as well as burning skin is overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after using the product for 30 days enough was enough i sent it back asking for my full refund under there try it for 60 days not happy send back guarantee to which i received a letter stating as it was sent back before 60 days i was not entitled to the refund.&lt;br /&gt;which i though was a little strange as any later than 60 would be after there guarantee, what you suppose to do time it that they receive it on the 60th day for a refund or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well after a letter from my solicitors stating we were taking them to the small claims court they folded like a house of cards and i got my money back 10 days after the letter was sent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moral of this story is simple avoid this product like the plague it don&#x27;t work as a hair removing product it just leaves you with 3rd degree burns a nasty smell of burning flesh that seams and a load of hair that this item was suppose to remove</li>
            <li> After charging the unit it would only operate for approx. 10 minutes then the battery would go dead.  I called and was given a return authorization and have returned the No!No! for credit. Prior to my calling customer service I contacted the manuf., they claimed they don&#x27;t warrant units sold through Amazon</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. NOBODY TELLS YOU ABOUT THE SMELL OF BURNING HAIR. DOES NOT REMOVE HAIR JUST BURNS IT.&lt;br /&gt;WOULDN,T EVEN GIVE IT HALF A STAR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible product.  Do not buy!! Will burn you, and no no&#x27;s customer service is terrible.</li>
            <li> I decided to put this here since the app won&#x27;t let me edit my review of the &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;. I had wanted to try the no-no, but cannot afford it. I was planning to try to save up money for it, but after reading the reviews here, I will not waste time or money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin (I have eczema) and if this thing caused burns on others than it most likely will on me... Considering that something like Nair literally burned sores into my skin. So, I am grateful for those who have left feedback about this product. You saved me from getting hurt by this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased nono straight from their website so I didn&#x27;t see what horrible rating they got...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me warn you- STEER CLEAR!!! EVERYTHING.  EVERYTHING YOU READ HERE IS TRUE. Except that my hair grew back THICKER. See pic of my leg!! My hair WAS FINER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their product is a scam.  This company is a scam. I lost $200...  Never will I be this stupid AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> Such a rip off , do not buy this for any reason at all , it&#x27;s a horrible product .</li>
            <li> not sure yet, so far not impressed</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe a fellow user on this site can clue me in. This product does absolutely zilch. Nothing. No, I don&#x27;t expect fast results. But something, anything would be good. I run this over the hair. Nothing. No burnt hair smell. No hair removal. Nothing. Maybe the hair is too short?  But it&#x27;s exactly the length on the instructions. And when I hit longer hair it gives an abrupt shake and shuts off as if the device \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t like\\&quot; that. I&#x27;m completely baffled. And, yes, it&#x27;s fully charged. But it does 1000% nothing. What&#x27;s up?  Anyone else have this same problem. One reviewer gave one star because it only removed half his/her hair and left stubble. I&#x27;d be THRILLED with such a result. I feel like I&#x27;m just waving a magic wand across my hair. To date it hasn&#x27;t removed one single hair and I&#x27;m following the instructions verbatim. Any advice?  Does the hair actually need to touch the wire (if so, that&#x27;s my problem and the instructions included with the device are WRONG... hair as short as they recommend can&#x27;t reach the wire)?</li>
            <li> It was a gift from a friend of my. Sorry for him. Bad product,I returned it to him but don&#x27;t know if he got his money back</li>
            <li> I have had embarrasing facial hair forever.  I have tried epilators, tweezing, waxing, &amp; bleaching.  It has been a painful &amp; expensive struggle. I was hesitant to purchase the Nono because of the reviews I read, but I was desperate and saw that I could return it.  Well, I am so pleased with my results. I use it on my face about 3 times a week- it only takes a few minutes and my facial hair is gone.  I have also used it on my arms, and it works perfectly. I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Simply put, IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK &amp; THE COMMERCIALS ARE GROSSLY MISLEADING! Just wanted to add my 1 star, 0 if I could to ALL THE OTHERS! Wax on, Wax off, PERIOD.</li>
            <li> it was a gift, and they liked it.</li>
            <li> My name is kurt a. Betz, I am a certified laser technician and operate out of the nala med spa in phoenix az. I use lasers which cost over $100,000 to permanently kill hair follicles and stem cells so the hair will never come back. It is a painless procidure and takes anywhere from ten to 30 minutes for different areas. I have had many clients that have used nono and have had absolutely no difference in hair regrowth. With laser hair removal I use laser light in the 810nm wave legnth which is red light. The laser has a cooled tip so only the hair follicles and stem cells are heated and killed, the cooled tip keeps the skin from burning. Hair grows in cycles that last about a month so with each treatment I am able to kill between 15 to 20 % of your hair. It takes anywhere from 5 to 8 treatments to get all the hair. Now depending on the person they may get new hair growth in treated areas for the rest of their life and may have to come back from year to year for a touch up session.&lt;br /&gt;In short nono may work a little bit but it&#x27;s not going to give the results you are after in a short period of time. I would recommend you look for a med spa that can give you pain free real results. Most med spas offer discounts and financing so ask about that before you commit and also do your research on the med spa before you plop down a ton of money, remember not all lasers are built equal and the more the laser costs the safer and more effective the treatment will be. If you find someone that is willing to treat your hair for way less then others, remember lasers can burn, scar, and permanently discolor your skin if not used by a trained professional.&lt;br /&gt;If you live in az and are interested in laser hair removal my number is four eight zero six five two three four three four.</li>
            <li> works well but it is slow, takes time.</li>
            <li> Product died right after warranty even though barely used. Customer service doesnt want to hear it. Replaced charger. Replaced thermicon and they are noy cheap. No mention of that in thrir ads.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. It did not work for me and I did follow the instructions. I felt that I spent a lot of money on it and I did&lt;br /&gt;not even attempt to get a refund because I waited too long. I kept trying it hoping it would work but it did not. I would definitely not&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago &amp; it did &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; hairs away in an adequate manner.  I also started using the prescription cream, &amp;#34;Vaniqa&amp;#34; which really reduced the hairs on my chin &amp; face.  About 8 months ago, the device stopped charging completely &amp; would work for only about 2 minutes and then the red light went on and it completely stopped.  I tried contacting the company, but I couldn&#x27;t produce the receipt (stupid me!), so they blew me off.  Not sure if a part needs to be replaced, but the company never got back in touch with me.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This may be one of the most over -rated items ever!&lt;br /&gt;i give you...it IS painless...however it might be faster to lightly singe your unwanted&lt;br /&gt;Hair with a lighter and buff.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and blonde..it took over an hour to get to &#x27;almost clean shaven &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;IF i was actually In -Country at the moment, I&#x27;d return this junk!  I should have listened&lt;br /&gt;to my Daughter and saved my $$ !&lt;br /&gt;judy</li>
            <li> I bought this from one of the TV shopping networks and used it as the directions said.  They said it would take up to 6 months before you started to really see the results.  It has now been 9 months and even using it every day, I still feel stubble on my legs.  A razor is still the best thing to use, not this.  I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs as often as I used to, but if I want to be stubble free and smooth, I do.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the No!No! for 5 weeks now and have mixed results.  The first time I used it I loved it &amp; by day 2 I had already done my entire bikini line.  After the first month&lt;br /&gt;though I am not happy with the results on the coarse hair on my lower legs, it always feels like they have a couple of days stubble.  Im still happy with the results on my bikini area even though the hair is coarser here.  Its not smooth like a waxing, but the hair regrowth is slow &amp; similar to waxing but without the ingrowing hairs &amp; pain so Im quite pleased.  I also did my peach fuzz mustache which I dont usually bother with because my face isnt that hairy but I only did it every other day for the first week &amp; havent seen any regrowth at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ive also used it on the shoulders &amp; back of my furry italian husband with good results.</li>
            <li> Saw a glimpse of this product advertised on tv. Called to find out the price. Asked the No!no! representative for the price but he continued to ask me questions about my location and various other irrelevant inquiries. The price does not change based on my zip code. I told him I was getting very frustrated because I just called to find out the price. He responded, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t really care if you&#x27;re getting frustrated.&amp;#34; I hung up. No product is worth buying if they treat their customers like that.</li>
            <li> I brought nono and the first 40 days I did not see any results. My skin burned! I called for assistance and they gave me pointers on how to use the no no. Still no results! I called back and was told to try it another 20 days, of course, 60 days no return. they promised that since i was having trouble they would extend my time. I called back and they pretend they had no notes of anyone talking to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have thick coarse hair growing on my lower chin and jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I hated it! It kept burning my darn chin! I bought it to try taking care of my full on lumber jack beard and mustache, because laser is too expensive now. It&#x27;s this thin wire that gets hot as all hell and only comes down to the skin when you&#x27;re holding it at the right angle, speed, pressure, spinning counter clock wise while sprinkling fairy dust on your head and sucking on eye of newt. Every time I was \\&quot;finished\\&quot; with a session, and by finished I mean crying because my chin looks like it was lashed by the fiery whip of a Greek God, I had tons of wire burn marks all over, and the hair was still there. THE DAMN HAIR WAS STILL THERE! And to add to the torture, you&#x27;re supposed to buff the remaining hair away, so essentially, you&#x27;re just rubbing sand paper over burnt skin while not one friggin hair comes off your body. Needless to say, I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00383I8T6 Radiancy No!no! 8800 Series Hair Removal Device - Pink]] Please do not order  this product.  During my so call trail period which they charged me $313.00 I had to make a trip to my Dr&#x27;s Office, pick-up a prescription where this product had brunt my face. I started calling in Oct. trying to get my money back.</li>
            <li> We saw the ad in the TV and wanted to try it out. These guys offer money back guarantee but they discourage you to return the item. You need to return the item between 45 and 60 days after purchase to get the shipping charges refunded. Crazy, isn&#x27;t it? If you return it within one week of purchase, you need to pay for shipping. It&#x27;s not refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get to the product. This is a complete junk. This does not work at all. It does not remove hair, even the smallest one. It gives burning smell which is normal according to the manual. But, there is no hair coming out of hands or legs. Hair will probably come out of your head if you keep trying this for few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the item after paying about $10 shipping. It&#x27;s almost like I tear my $10 note in pieces and threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I started to place my order because the email I got after backing out the first time said it was only $89.00 this was at 8:00am this morning and it would come with free shipping and everything so I thought what the heck... Well the page after the page I put my CC information into said make a onetime payment of $298.00 WTH!!! I closed the window and a few minutes later I got a email confirming my order so I called to make sure that I didn&#x27;t order the No No and sure enough they had placed the order. Well the young lady that answered the phone at 8:15 said that I would have to call back later today as the order hadn&#x27;t yet showed in their system. So at 2:45 this afternoon I called back again as suggested to make sure that the order was canceled and this young lady told me that they already shipped the product. I am more than a little pissed and I feel as it I have been scammed I even talked to a supervisor and got the same story that they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it and that it was going to be charged to my CC. They are scammers and I am here to warn you Buyer beware!!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, and was convinced it would.  I tried it for 6 months, continually, and had no change.  I was using it for facial hair and was definitely using it correctly.  I also tried it on my legs and have not seen any change there either.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money!!!! I wanted to return it but they would only give me 75% of the money back and I have to pay postage to return it to Israel and that is $50.00. It does not remove hardly any hair. I used it everyday for a half hour on one leg for three week and it barely removed any hair. This was a expensive lesson I learned, I should of listened to all the reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a flat out waste of money.  It does not work as advertised.  Do yourself a favor and join the dollar a month shave club.  You will get better results and save a ton of money.  I wanted to like this but it just does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and was very disappointed. First of all they should tell you there are additional costs for more of the pads, lotion, and the replacement heads (I think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called.) I had to keep going over the same area and it still didn&#x27;t get all the hair off. I also am allergic to scents and the lotion is so heavily scented it gave me a headache every time I used it. If it works for you great, but I was so unhappy with it that I thought it may be valuable info to some people with similar issues. Decide for yourself. At least they have a money back guaruntee but make sure you follow all the rules like I did so you get a full refund.</li>
            <li> My nono failed after four months, feeling it should have lasted longer then that, I called nono customer service. Nono customer service told me that, because I bought from amazon, they will not honor the warranty.  The amazon warranty expired after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effectiveness, I have less hair, but still have hair. I have been using it three times a week for four months</li>
            <li> No No Machine very expensive and does not work. I, like others ignored negative reviews - paid $300 + tax - was so disappointed when it just left stubble. It does not glide across skin removing hair like it shows on their ad -DOES NOT -&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin red &amp; blotchy with rug burn feeling.  I&#x27;m thinking using it for long term - it would be hard on your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money $ time</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have bought nearly every product ever made to remove hair.  Let&#x27;s face it; nothing has been invented yet that will get your skin as smooth as a razor.  That&#x27;s just a fact.  The No!no! removes hair as well as the device they sold in the 90&#x27;s that pulled hair out by the roots (can&#x27;t remember what that torture device was called).  At least there&#x27;s no pain with the No!no!, unless you don&#x27;t use it right and go over one spot, or linger too long in one spot - then you will burn your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine as directed for the first month, starting with short stubble and then using it 3 times a week.  After a month, I tried what other users suggested, just using it more frequently.  I did that for another month.  During this time, I had constant stubble on my legs (the buffer removes some of the stubble, but not all).  Hair regrowth definitely diminished, but after 2 months, the stubble was driving me nuts and I just went back to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My assessment is that, knowing what I know now, I would not purchase the No!no!.  It&#x27;s just too expensive for what it does.  Your hair regrowth will definitely diminish, but it comes at the cost of never having smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product straight from their website, I tried to be patient and give it a try, but IT DOESN&#x27;T REALLY WORK!  And be warned, do you all know that its full price is $264 and you are just paying the first installlment, the first time you pay, although you would think that you paid the whole price!  The buffer doesn&#x27;t work either. Save your money...it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting to have 60 days to try it. It only took a few to find out it didn&#x27;t work in the main places I needed to use it, and it left painful red marks behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called to return it using the \\&quot;no-catch\\&quot; return policy and they charged me a return fee because I didn&#x27;t try it long enough. I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;m going to get my full return price either. And I&#x27;m really going to watch my credit card for the rest of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a nightmare. I really, really, really need to never order anything off TV again. If it was so great, they&#x27;d sell it in stores.</li>
            <li> A slick television commercial has done exactly what was intended -- and continues to do so. With paid actors, a script full of outright lies and from a company with no sense of right and wrong, once they have your money you are of no value to them.&lt;br /&gt;The product works for less than one in four users that leave feedback and many more wind up with burned skin. Over three quarters of all buyers/users report poor (or no) results -- and most seek a return and refund.&lt;br /&gt;Two out of three actual buyers leaving feedback gave the lowest possible rating of one star for the product.&lt;br /&gt;A two month &amp;#34;trial period&amp;#34; and return policy with refund? Hogwash. This is a deliberate and critical lie used to get your money.&lt;br /&gt;On a one through five star scale, (5 being the highest) 452 customer reviews broke down like this:&lt;br /&gt;5 stars: 49&lt;br /&gt;4 stars: 36&lt;br /&gt;3 stars: 26&lt;br /&gt;2 stars: 50&lt;br /&gt;1 star: 291&lt;br /&gt;This company thrives on the unsuspecting buyers that don&#x27;t research the product -- and getting a resolution through a product return and refund can quickly become a nightmare with one roadblock after another. They hope you&#x27;ll eventually just give up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d imagine the company investors and owners laugh all the way to the bank -- with no shame whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one but the head (themicon tip) would jump up an down and would not \\&quot;glide\\&quot; as on the infomercial except in short spurts.  I called the manufacturer but got NO help.  The tip would get stuck in the up position with the red light on.  The manufacturer recommended I buy more tips (the ones I had on the machine were new) and I did and the same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on the peachfuzz on the face and kept at it (remember the tip would not stay down for more than a couple of seconds) and it did take a little of the fuzz off (got the burning smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is much too labor intensive for the money.  Also when the company will not stand by its product or provide help when the customer is obviously having a bad experience with the product are not good signs.</li>
            <li> Does this product remove hair?  Somewhat.  It burns it off almost to the skin and then you rub rather hard with the buffer to get some of the stubble off.  Is it permanent? No!  Not even close to permanent!  BTW, I am using this only on my face.  Again, BTW, I have been using this off and on (following directions) for 9 months!  In order to keep my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; and \\&quot;chin whiskers\\&quot; down, I have to use it 2 to 3 times per week.  Save your money for electrolysis!</li>
            <li> Easier to use than I thought it would be!  Give it a chance-takes some practice. It&#x27;s worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I am not at all happy with this product.  Nothing was said in the advertising about it singing the hair and then you would have to remove with a buffer (which still doesn&#x27;t work).  Also, I saw nothing in the ads that it would take 45-60 days to see significant results.  This puts you right at the time that is too late to return for a refund.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work out for me. I tried it for about a month on my face (upper lip) with no luck. I had carefully saved everything (packaging, box, etc.) and kept everything in good condition so I though I would have no trouble returning it. After speaking with a very polite nono representative, however, he informed me that I missed the 60 day return deadline by 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I explained to him how my husband&#x27;s family tragically experienced 4 deaths in the previous two weeks, thus I had been out of the state and missed the return deadline (this is NOT a \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; story). My sales representative took the extra step in asking this manager about my ability to return the product due to these circumstances. Once again, however, the answer was \\&quot;no.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not only was the product a failure for me, but my extenuating circumstances were not taken into the consideration they deserved upon attempting to return this product. I DO NOT recommend this product OR doing business with this company!</li>
            <li> This product doen&#x27;t begin to do what it is advertised to do.  It was a expensive useless purchase.  Should have known that if it sounds to good to be true it is no good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the platinum model after seeing the infomercial on TV.  They showed a man with hairy arms removing a  large amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it, it didn&#x27;t work.  Reading the &#x27;FINE&amp;#34; print, I learned that it doesn&#x27;t work on hair longer and an eighth of an inch. It smells like burnt hair when you use it and good luck trying to remove any hair without wearing the area out with multiple passes.  I paid about $100 when I first ordered and was not told that this was just a down payment and the that it actually costs $300.  I was also told that they wouldn&#x27;t pay return postage, unless I used it for 45 days.  I put it away and waited for the date to arrive, so I would pay my return postage paid.  When I phoned back to get the shipping label, I  was then told that I was one week past the 60 day warranty and now they wouldn&#x27;t take it back at all.&lt;br /&gt;This company is  using deception to get you money and is  a HUGE RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> I received the product and immediately tried it after charging.  First, the instructions are not that helpful, and the CD included does not give you a visual representation on how to use the product, it is merely a digital version of the written user manuel, which is lacking.  At no time did my unit have a \\&quot;blue guide\\&quot; light and despite several tries and passes on the same small area no hair was removed.  Note, that the unit was fully charged. It does not burn the hair off as stated in the instructions, nor was there any tingling sensation or burning smell at all. I am returning the product and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it ,the best  Device to ever get!!!Just wish I had gotten the lotion also.But excellent product!!!!!! Told all my friends about it!</li>
            <li> it  is  a  pice  of  junk  for  the  price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it  did  not  help  me  do  not  by  it  it  will  be  a  wase  of  money  it  realy  deserves  0  stars</li>
            <li> I was given a nono by my aunt in 2011.  Due to the fact that my mother was in a terrible car accident and sustained traumatic brain injury I have simply not had time to use the machine.  Last night after using it literally 3 times before, I got half of my arm done and the rubber band broke off.  Assuming they would at least be able to repair the machine I contacted customer service only to hear that since it&#x27;s been over a year all they can do is SELL ME ANOTHER ONE!!! WHAT A JOKE!  BEWARE THE NONO IS A SCAM!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and takes forever.</li>
            <li> My nono quit within a month after the warranty went out so really never had a chance to see if it would work Would not suggest anybody spend this kind of money on something that don&#x27;t last any longer than the warreny</li>
            <li> I had to be the defiant person who reads all the reviews and says \\&quot;It can&#x27;t be that bad.\\&quot; Trust me; it is worse than bad. I bought the No No specifically for my upper lip, but followed all the directions and tried it on my arm first. It zapped a few hairs, but without a second person to hold my skin taut, all it did was wrinkle up my skin. I am 60 years old, so I&#x27;ll grant that my skin is not as tight as it used to be, but it&#x27;s not drooping! Long story short, the skin on my face IS taut due to a face lift a few years ago. The No NO did not even burn 1 hair. I spent 30 minutes trying to make it work and all I accomplished was giving myself a headache. If there was a rate of Zero stars, this product would warrant it. Do yourself a favor and spare yourself the return shipping cost.</li>
            <li> WELL all the bad reviews explains why the commercials are on day and night. They need to dump this looser. before going out of business. In fact in the past 15 Years of begin on amazon. I have never ever seen the  the 5 stars at 51 stars below the 1 stars at 221&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all. I do not like the hair on my ears or back but being ripped off (pun in there it seems)  is even worse. Sorry all of you  had to find out the hard way but thanks for warning us.</li>
            <li> I bought this off HSN and tried it immediately, it doesn&#x27;t really work. I&#x27;ve tried it on multiple areas over and over and the hair just doesn&#x27;t melt away completely, it burns off the tip of the hair but I&#x27;m sending it back to get the TRIA. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I don&#x27;t know how in the world they were able to have off some guys hair on his arm in 3 swipes but  I&#x27;m a girl and it won&#x27;t hardly touch mine.</li>
            <li> There is no way to contact no no. I have a nono which was a gift, have tried it a few times and it sort of worked, figured I just needed to work it more. But suddenly, it just quit working. I have no way to contact any kind of customer service or support. I am so upset I wasted this money because I paid the friend who bought this.</li>
            <li> I have fine natural blonde hair. I have had my No No for two years I keep trying it and hoping it will work. But hours later I still end up shaving. It is a waste of money; I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathay@live.ca</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second unit. The first one was so poorly made that you couldn&#x27;t plug the charger into it. I sent it back and received a new one. Simply put, it doesn&#x27;t work. It singes the hair off leaving stubble. It looks like I haven&#x27;t shaved In about a week. Tried it on my face and it made me break out. It also burned my upper lip. It&#x27;s really difficult to use on soft areas, like cheeks, or around curves. Wish I had sent it back, but I kept thinking I just needed to give it more time. Can&#x27;t believe they haven&#x27;t been shut down. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a NONO! means don&#x27;t buy it! I should have check the reviews first before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just received the nono! about a week ago. I didn&#x27;t get the memo about using it three times a week, and so I&#x27;ve been using it every day. Day 1, I charged it for five hours, then I went to work with it day two, three and four. Today is day four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had pretty bad unwanted facial hair since childhood.  I&#x27;m incredibly turned off by the idea of lazer surgery, but eventually got this as a gift for Christmas.  Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days (only on my cheeks, chin and neck), I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my 3 day trial.  I don&#x27;t use the lotion that comes with it, and I&#x27;m considering dropping the buffer from my routine (I think it makes my skin dry/irritated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about burning the bumps on my skin (from in grown hairs), as well as it not working for my hair type, since I&#x27;m African American. Nope! The heat passes right over the bumps with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my skin feels smoother, and the hair is gradually lightening from my skin. The stubble that it misses, and other hairs that remain, are softer after using the nono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell? Sure. But it&#x27;s really not that bad. If you&#x27;ve ever had to flat iron your hair, then you&#x27;ve smelled MUCH worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain? Essentially none. There&#x27;s a bit of heat when using the product, and my skin feel tingly for a good ten minutes afterwards. I&#x27;ll continue to update on whether this becomes an issue or not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main worries include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the hair growing back thicker and faster,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) My skin being irritated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It not actually having lasting effects, and my sweet gifter who made the $300 investment wasted her money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m still skeptical.  I&#x27;m waiting for the hidden side effects to pop up any day now. But so far, so good. I&#x27;m satisfied...</li>
            <li> This product rocks!  Hair removal is a synch and it’s very easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product to a friend…</li>
            <li> Simply put, anyone who says this thing works  is either seeing what they want to see or they are being paid by nono.  It is not true. Save your money and sanity. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  It is easy to use and the process leaves the treated area smooth!  I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> So far it is doing what it is advertised to do.  I hope to share the information with my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use it smells like something is burning.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with the product. It is  not at all what I expected for the price. I will remain using my razor. Better results. I will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Totally craptastic!!!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  I ordered this from the no no website and there isn&#x27;t even a place to write a review so I came here.  This thing stinks so bad cause it&#x27;s just burning your hair off.  It most certainly does not feel like a fresh wax.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of hair and the little hair it does remove does not stay gone for weeks.  One week maybe.  And when I tried to return it they said they would e-mail me a label to send it back.  I never got anything.  Terrible buy.  Bad customer service and the website sucks.</li>
            <li> No!no!... more like yes!yes! I just received the nono and I already see the difference in my arm hair! It may not get rid of all your hair, but it definitely thins out the hair. I highly recommend trying the nono before spending thousands on laser removal.</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year ago and used it as directed for about 3 months. It is difficult and time consuming to use but, I persisted hoping to get results. It worked to remove the hair on my arms but did not work at all on my legs where I have coarser hair. As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue. The same amount of hair remains on my arms. The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns. The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks and I had to send it back for replacement. They made me pay for shipping their defective product back to them. The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This works, but like most products it takes effort, and you have to have a certain type of hair and use it a certain type of way in order for it to work. Thankfully for me, my hair is the perfect type for tv products because I have never had issues with most tv products. This I ordered through the phone. I called up, and they set up a payment plan for me so I could pay all in 1 payment. Wait for the right offers to come up. I got the offer back with the $100 spending dollars. I thought this meant I would get cash back, but I was wrong... It took me to another website were I had to set up an account, and then it gave me discounts off certain items that I knew I could find elsewhere for cheaper... So, I have not even used my shopping dollars. I have half a mind to call up and ask if I can trade for something else, but I doubt that they let me. Besides I think I lost the card thing... woops... Anyways, they extended my warranty and gave me a 4 year warranty. However, this warranty is only for the device. I called up about the charger out of curiosity, but the warranty is only for the device. However, they said if I wanted to buy another charger they gave me a free shipping discount. The charger is 17.99 if you want another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this product:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are pressing down hard enough, but not too hard that you&#x27;ll burn yourself. I have never burnt myself yet, but I think there are safety things around the heating part that help protect it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair, or a lot of hair, it may take a couple tries to get all the hair off.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you clean the device after using. Use the brush, or blow into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a funky smell. My friend said it smelt like burnt onions.&lt;br /&gt;Careful when using this around your lip. It gave me a cold sore. I used it one night around my lip area, and woke up with a huge cold sore, wasn&#x27;t fun to get rid of.</li>
            <li> At first did not like it - after useing it 2weeks,&lt;br /&gt;Learn how it works, love it&lt;br /&gt;Use large adapter&lt;br /&gt;Turn on&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hold button&lt;br /&gt;Hold Nono Strate up&lt;br /&gt;Run over leg, etc</li>
            <li> I thought I really found an answer to waxing and shaving! Sorry to say I did not , and I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not do what the commercials says it does. To me that is a HUGE NoNo!&lt;br /&gt;It removes some hairs and leaves others, and it needs to be passed over and over on the same facial spots.  OUCH! I&#x27;ll stick to waxing and shaving.</li>
            <li> This item was ordered as a Christmas gift and the individual was not satisfied with the results, I am trying to return the item but I am not see the needed information to make the return</li>
            <li> So glad I checked the reviews I dont have $300 too throw away! I thought it sounded too good to be true.  Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> I was told that this product would give me great, not to mention quick, results. I&#x27;d avoid the no!no! because thin hair near my lip grew back, making me feel self-conscious. The cream burns and course hair stays no matter what. Using this makes me feel like I never bought it at all, despite what saleswomen say. People shouldn&#x27;t advertise something that doesn&#x27;t work, such as this. Clearly, using this product is a no-no!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it takes, but so far, it is NOT worth the money.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and only use it about every third day, and see very little impact.  Have gone over the same spot a couple/few times with each use and then leave that spot for the next time.  I will keep trying, but not impressed.  One good thing I can say is that the battery seems to last a long time on one charge.</li>
            <li> Mine removed some hair, but after 2 months of use it burned out the thermal tip. Since then I have tried to contact them for a replacement and all requests have been ignored. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU EVER WANT SERVICE or part!!! I would have paid for another  tip but they will only accept new buyers once they have your money... forget it.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and have patiently tried and tried to like it.  When the directions say go over the same area 3-5 times, what they should have said was 30 to 40.  It simply does not work despite following the directions completely.  I&#x27;ve tried it on legs, arms and face.  Just spent 20 minutes trying to use it on my face....can still see peach fuzz and have gone over it so many times that my face feels burned.  Please save your money and avoid the frustration of trying to make this product work like the infomercial claims.  Wish I had trusted the reviews before purchasing but had wanted this thing for so long.  Do not buy this product unless you just love frustration.  If I could rate it appropriately it would get a negative 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CCW</li>
            <li> I bought the No No Hair Removal System last year.  For two months, I religiously used it twice a week - with NO results.  I thought my hair might be too short so after the two months, I waited until the weather was cool enough to go without shaving my legs and didn&#x27;t shave them, my underarms and bikini area.  Once again I tried the No No Hair Removal System religiously twice a week for a month.  Still NO results......No No No No No No one should be ripped off like this!  This product doesn&#x27;t deserve even a half a star but I have to give it at lease one star to show that I hate it - it stinks!  I would recommend to anyone who has purchased it and is still within the 60 day return period - RETURN IT!</li>
            <li> If I had known this product was $300, I would have passed. Silly me didn&#x27;t read the details on the website. After the initial $90 payment, there were 2 more $90 charges to be taken afterward. Why this product is so expensive, I have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to use a \\&quot;pulse of heat\\&quot; to remove hair for long lasting smoothness. It&#x27;s a hot wire that cuts hair off at the surface, if it even manages to get through the hair itself. No! No! does not work, I tried and tried but no hair was removed...not even a little bit. A razor does a better job, for $298 less than this piece of electronic garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought mine less than a year ago, and the elastic band on the head snapped already, which means, the whole unit doesn&#x27;t glide anymore and therefore does not even work anymore. I wonder why such a pricey product has to be made that flimsy. For the results: Yes, I saw a slight difference on legs and arms. Not so much on the face. I think it&#x27;s because it is hard to get the right contact with the curves in the face. Yet, the facial hair is my biggest concern and the reason why I bought this unit in the first place. Absolutely not recommendable! I will try to get my unit repaired, if possible (also a thing, I don&#x27;t even know if anybody repairs it), for the use of the legs and arms only. For the face I will have to hunt down somethings else, because the results, even after 7 months, are pitiful.</li>
            <li> Ok - I admit it.  I caved in and bought this device about 11 months ago.  (Although I currently own about 8 (yes 8) devices that claim to remove all hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does remove peach-fuzz.  In other words, it does a decent job at removing baby fine hair.  However, the reason that I purchased this was for the horrible thick ugly very course hair on my chin that I have to shave every single day or someone will notice it.  I also use Vaniqa - the prescription creme to help with this issue.  Vaniqa doesn&#x27;t stop the hair from growing, but it slows it down a bit.  I used the No-No every single day, 7 days a week for close to 11 months straight.  NOT ONE difference from when I started, when it comes to the hair on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-No didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING with the hair on my chin.  As I said before, the hair on my chin is extremely course (like a guys).  I have been at war with these hairs for several years now and refuse to throw in the towel.  However, the no-no...isn&#x27;t the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If buying for peach fuzz (very baby fine hair) - then the No-No may have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;If buying for very course hair - not going to work.</li>
            <li> For a year I&#x27;ve debated whether to get the NoNo and I finally gave in and ordered it . . . huge mistake! The first thing I found irritating is that it&#x27;s not as easy to operate as they make it seem on the commercial. If you aren&#x27;t holding it just right, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Then when I finally did get it to work a little, I ended up with a nasty welt on my arm that took overnight to go away. I called the next day so I could return it because I saw no point in keeping it for the 60 day trial when I knew I didn&#x27;t want it. At first the customer service rep was friendly and concerned but once I made it clear that I no longer wanted it, her attitude became antagonistic. I got the return confirmation number and am shipping it back. I hope that I won&#x27;t have issues with getting my refund like some of the other reviewers had. However, it was because of those reviews that I decided to send it back and pay the $15 shipping fee rather than make the next installment and have a difficult time recouping my money. I guess this is just a reminder that when something sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li> Why so many infomercials? Because you need them when you are selling garbage and can lie to customers on its performance. In short, just buy a razor. No hype, just smoothness with blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A piece of junk that runs on batteries trying to replace a blade that &amp;#34;simply works&amp;#34;, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, please don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> does not do  what I though it was going to do. Not impressed. tooo much money for this.</li>
            <li> Nono it did not work at all I&#x27;m letting my hair grow so there is something to work with I have done it 2x a week for 3 weeks so far I&#x27;ll do the 6 weeks they recommend then I&#x27;ll return it I hope it&#x27;s stupid waist of mony</li>
            <li> This has been a great disappointment. I really want my money back. I have tried this since I got it in May and it has not worked as advertized</li>
            <li> the item wont hold a charge.  Sent it back three times for the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stuck with it now because the warranty is up.  It has become a paper weight.</li>
            <li> I have 3 words to describe this  :  don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> This does not work and I use it faithfully</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this thing a -10 out of 5 stars, my mom had ordered this machine before the commercials where even out on the tv. She wanted to try it so she bought it, she tried it and it did barely anything about the hair. She called costumer service and they told her that we couldn&#x27;t return it even though we had a 60 day trial. Time wasn&#x27;t even up for the deadline to return it. Basically do not and I mean seriously DO NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not work the way it is shown on TV. I purchased it for a specific area but it is difficult to use and the smell of burnt hair was too much.  It also failed to work on the area I bought it for.  Totally useless product, returned for my money back.</li>
            <li> It does not work. After watching the ads - we were really disappointed  and have sent it&lt;br /&gt;back to get our money back.&lt;br /&gt;Bryan and Rosie Toney</li>
            <li> It takes forever to get your money back.  First NO NO I received was defective.  Dummy me, I had them send a replacement.  Now that I want to return it I have been given the run around.  I filed a disputed charge with my credit card today.  It has been 17 days since I contacted NO NO for an RMA label.</li>
            <li> Do not waste ur time with this product. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says. It took them 4 months in total to return my money after I called and threatened to sue. They will take ur money than hope to deter you from refunding it by continuously telling you to call back in another week hoping you just give up.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! It&#x27;s truly unfortunate this product has such positive hype on commercials/brochures and in stores because it is complete CRAP and does not work! All the nono does is \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your hair off! a) it stinks like burning hair when you use it, b) it leaves stubble anywhere on your body-regardless if you use the crappy \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; they provide afterwards because you might as well take a dull nail file to your skin, and c) customer service for this product is completely useless! For almost the same price, I highly recommend the \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n Flash and Go Permanent Hair Removal System\\&quot; which is REAL laser hair removal you can do at home and is much more effective!!</li>
            <li> I tried a Nono on my arms and I do not see any results after doing it a few times. I do not believe it works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get ripped off.  I&#x27;ve had some friends who have bought this thing and it doesn&#x27;t do as good as the so-called customers who try it out on the commercial  This just a way for some backward, crooked scam artist to get quick money.</li>
            <li> This does not work on stiff hair on face or legs. Plus the tips will bounce up and down and cause the filament to burn the skin. When I called with this complaint, they would not replace the tip and told me to use a razor! Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I cannot get it to stay in the blue no matter what I do.  The red light keeps coming on and I shut it off and start over and it just keeps happening.  It suppose to work in facial hair yet the directions say do not use on the face.  Very upset with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to be able to quit shaving and because I&#x27;m not overly tolerant of pain so didn&#x27;t want to try lasering...I was REALLY enthused about it thinking it would be the thing for me.But it turns out it does not work all that well...it didn&#x27;t work at all on my legs where the hair is quite coarse and black.Nor did it work on my underarms or bikini line where the hair is also coarse and black.It worked fairly well on my arms and face where the hair is much fairer and finer...but it still left stubble.So now I&#x27;m back to shaving my arms, which I don&#x27;t really like to do, and epilating my legs,which is painful,and if you use Dr. Numb is a long process.I do still use it on my face but not really regularly.I haven&#x27;t noticed that the hair is thicker or thinner...just about the same.The buffer worked the first time I used it and got most of the stubble off ,but hasn&#x27;t worked very much since.So if you have fine hair,this will work for you but if not,then I wouldn&#x27;t advise trying it.</li>
            <li> I got this product on Ebay for a wasteful $150.00 since i had seen these being sold for almost $400.00.  PLEASE dont buy this product here or anywhere else!!  It does NOT work as advertised that is all a gimmick.  The product is made of cheap light metal and the small amount of blue light they claim is laser?  come one what a joke!!  The kit comes with things that you wont use AND the adapters they say to use for the face and body are so cheap and small and plastic and to replace them they are $25.00 each and you will wear them out every month trying to remove your hair (so you think) thats where they make their money.  If you need your hair removed go to a professional LASER place and do it that way.  You need advanced technology to remove hair not this mickey mouse product.  WASTE of your TIME and money equals worthless !!  I am so depressed and mad that I even spent the amount i did.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don&#x27;t buy ANY of their products even the newest and upgraded ones they advertise on HSN or QVC or even their webside- DONT buy !!!</li>
            <li> i bought the no no costing me $289.00. igot it and thehair on my chin was still there. tried it on my legs (one hair was an inch long) i ran it over &amp; over on the hair, with no results.the ad did not say to buff the hair. this is false addvertizing, if you ask me. ITS A RIPOFF.AS yet (over a week that i returned it) I still havent gotten my money back. they wanted me to keep it 45 days,if i had, my chin hair would be down to my sholders. DONT BUY IT!</li>
            <li> After I use the NoNo, which really doesn&#x27;t work, the hair grows back twice as much; now I am left with hair on my face, that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> Did not receive polishing items for skin. Also no caring case. Always advertised on Television as coming with those items included. So expectations not met. Ken</li>
            <li> I love it. I would recommend it to anyone. It does exactly what it says it does on the commercial.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this only on my arms. I don&#x27;t have incredibly hairy arms but they&#x27;ve always bothered me. When I shave I get bumps and scars and general ickiness so I mostly leave them alone. Bleaching is extremely itchy torture and I don&#x27;t want to do that again. Intuitively I realized this thing would never work on legs or under arms - shaving or laser is the way to go there. I am fortunate to not have any facial hair issues. So, I finally ordered one. I was surprised that it arrived in the product box only, not the product box inside a shipping box. The actual No No device was rattling around loose in the product box. The box was sealed only with some clear tape. It came with the pink device, a white charging cord, a wide comb and a slightly narrower comb, one round buffer, a little brush for cleaning the combs, a grey zip case for storing the device and components, and some sample lip and skin products (nowhere near the amount of stuff shown in the photo). There is a DVD that I haven&#x27;t watched yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it and figured out how it works. The part that removes the hair is a little plastic &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; that clicks into the No No. It has a wire. It is that wire that heats up and clicks down onto your skin as you run the device across your arm, etc. You need to buy replacement combs periodically. The smell of burning hair is pretty awful but I was anticipating that so it didn&#x27;t bother me. After the first couple days, I no longer need to open the windows and air out the house after using the No No device. Don&#x27;t use it right before you have company coming - everyone will wonder about the stench in your home - not good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feeling of the heat from the wire on my skin - very soothing and relaxing and I like to think perhaps healing as well. I use it on the highest setting and run it slowly across my skin. It does melt off your hair (at first you&#x27;ll have to wipe away little balls of charred, melted hair that drop out of the device as you use it) but doesn&#x27;t result in smooth skin. Even with extensive buffing, there is little or no actual smooth, hair-free skin. You will have stubble - a little prickly but basically invisible.I repeated the process on my arms over three days. They look amazingly better than they did when I started. There are no razor bumps and my arms feel okay. If I was getting ready for a hot date, I would probably use Nair or something to be truly hair free. My long-term plan is to use No No in conjunction with the Tria laser (which I also own), using the No No to keep the appearance of my arms nice and perhaps weakening future hair growth while keeping the hair short enough to use the Tria laser properly. I hope the combination of the No No device and my Tria laser will result in permanently hair free arms sometime in the next few months.use it) but doesn&#x27;t result in smooth skin.

            <li> If you already have dry skin, no-no will make it much worse.  It burns off the hair but also the skin by extreme drying.  So not only will you have STUBBLES [lousy product] you&#x27;ll also have SANDY, rocky SKIN.</li>
            <li> I bought this no no pink one, used two times and the rubber broke, cannot get my money back it does not work waste of money. Don&#x27;t waste your on this product, stay away.</li>
            <li> All of the pieces were not there, was unable to us</li>
            <li> It does not work at all! This is false advertisement at its best. The guy in the commercial must have shaved his arm because that Nono certainly did not. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> make a great Christmas present</li>
            <li> Thank God I read the reviews! I am definitely NOT purchasing this product!  Sounds awful and the customer service department needs to learn how to treat its customers! Btw I had to give it 1 star because they stated it is required.  If it was up to me I&#x27;d give it no stars!</li>
            <li> Terrible, does not work and just smells</li>
            <li> Crap item no money back</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I prepared my face the way the demo said, clean, no moisturizer, oils, etc.  I used it on my chin and sideburns, where the hair was the required length.  First, it did not remove the hair.  Most of the chin hair stayed on my chin.  It also did not remove the hair on my sideburns.  There was the horrible smell of burning hair - which, by the way, lasted for days - so I know some of the hair came off.  That wasn&#x27;t even the worst part!  As the demo states, if the hair doesn&#x27;t come off in 3-4 passes, wait a few minutes and go over it again.  So I did.  The result was cuts in my chin the next day!  It looks like someone came at my chin with a sharp object and put several scratches in it!  I looked like I had fallen face down on my chin and scraped it.  The small cuts are still there, my chin looks horrible and I still had to tweeze most of the chin hair off!  This is going back!</li>
            <li> I saw the commercials for the &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;,,, and boy do they sound convincing,,, I was thinking of buying 2 of them for my daughter and my wife for Christmas,,, I will find other options now that I have read these posts....&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me exactly of that male enhancement product,,&amp;#34;ageless male&amp;#34;,, yet another rip off company,,, they got sued,,, I got paid back,,, but they are still advertising and selling their bogus product (snake Oil)&lt;br /&gt;I just can not figure out how they get away with this crap... they brag about selling millions of bottles,,, and those millions of bottles are crap,, but they are still selling their crap...Just follow the money trail if you ever want to find out what&#x27;s happening... someone out there is making the millions,, ripping off the public,,, and paying off the officials,,,&lt;br /&gt;Thank GOD for the internet..&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and WATCH OUT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Ben</li>
            <li> does not work as well as expected on face</li>
            <li> Not good for face because of curves and angles of face and It would take hours to do legs because of how slow you have to go to get this to work and get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> After lots of thought I decided to give this product a try.  Seeing as the price was up there.  This was the worst purchase I have ever made.  Apparently people who use this product only have one hair to remove.  I used it as instructed and It not only took forever but I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I found I got better hair removal using my razor and it took less time.  The worst part is that by the time I decided I didn&#x27;t want it anymore I couldn&#x27;t get my money back.  I was able to sell it and get some of my money back.  But, for what I paid this product should have worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is just use your razor.  It&#x27;s way cheaper in the end and works a lot better.  Yes, you may have to shave every couple of days but you will be a lot happier and you will save yourself the money and the hassle.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, it does not work.  I hate it.  This product is an example of advertising at its worst.  I strongly urge anyone not to buy this product - it&#x27;s a NO! NO!</li>
            <li> Not what you pay for. I was disappointed and  will not recommend anyone buying this item unless you have money to give away.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago and it really does not work at all... arm hair it seems ok but really a complete waste of money and far too time consuming</li>
            <li> I purchased the NoNo in pink about a year ago.  I called after about 3 mo. of use, and, they kept telling me it didn&#x27;t work on my legs because I had to replace the tips more often.  Guess what?  I have bought at least 3 or 4 new sets of tips, and, it still doesn&#x27;t remove hair from my legs completely.  As you look down at your leg there is a lot of long new growth that it just will not remove and, I am very fair and blonde.  Take it from me, don&#x27;t waste your money!!!P.S.  I agree the sales staff is lousy.</li>
            <li> I purchased my No!No!last year and what I found is \\&quot;it does not removed curly hair that well in African American or other people of color. I had to go over and over my skin until it turned red. I think it is great for find hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It takes some time, and must be done slowly (not every day) but it works!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because nothing (laser, old time electrolysis, waxing, sugaring, you name it)has ever worked on me before. I&#x27;m Italian, with super sensitive skin, and with coarse dark hair on my arms, legs, and face, and since menopause, if I didn&#x27;t tweeze every day, I&#x27;d probably have a beard! So this product looked really good, and I couldn&#x27;t find any negative reviews, but didn&#x27;t think to look here on Amazon. So even though I don&#x27;t usually fall for \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; hypes, I bought the No No! I knew I&#x27;d not be able to return it because I knew it would take me longer than most to get the stubborn hairs off my face. So I used it religiously for 3 months, exactly as directed. Tried it on my arms, first, because that hair is less coarse- but after a couple of days it was all back there, too.  I smelled the burned hair, hoped it was working, but the next day it was all back. Buffing with that stupid buffer just burned my skin. All in all, NOT ONE HAIR WAS REMOVED ANYWHERE!I put the gadget away, and about 6 months later thought I&#x27;d try again. After another 2 months, same results. NOTHING! Finally after 2 years at least, I threw the darn thing away. I happened to mention it to my hair dresser who&#x27;s also a skin care specialist, and she said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a big scam. Don&#x27;t waste your money.\\&quot; I agree. I&#x27;m so disappointed! My advice-don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this overpriced worthless piece of junk!</li>
            <li> what a worthless piece of work!  It didn&#x27;t work and because I kept it  9 days over the 60 day trial period, they will not take the piece of crap back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They  need a lot of work on their customer service also.  I guess because I was now stuck with the piece of crap, the foreign speaking woman thought she could be nasty to me.  Never will I purchase another Neova product either because they are associated with the Radiance Company.  Watch out - don&#x27;t try them or buy them.  Rip off big time.</li>
            <li> Did not work in the slightest. And customer service?!? -sighs- It was a bad experience and now I am 200 short with a janky piece of pink crap that looks like a female Star Trek device.</li>
            <li> Great, works as promised</li>
            <li> it did not work for me...a huge waste of money and pain also.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the Consumer Reports review and make your decision based on an impartial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember if it sounds too good to be true it usually is.</li>
            <li> my wife says it doesnt work on any part of her body. this was a gift and at first she was excited, but after using it for over a month it didnt meet her expectations at all.</li>
            <li> Because at the same price as tv I did not recieve the case. The one on tv included a case. Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUT THIS.  Burned my chin and did not remove hair as advertised.  When i called they say it is a treatment not instant.  That is not how it is advertised.  This thing burned my face, beware.</li>
            <li> I tried using the no no for the two month time period, and as instructed by the manual. It does not work for me! After the two months that I tried the no no for, I saw absolutely NO reduction in hair regrowth as advertised. Customer service was rude and would not let me send back their no no as agreed upon. They said I could try the no no free for two months, but they started charging me before the two months was even up. When my two months was up, I asked to return it and they told me NO, and that if I returned it, they would send it back to me at my expense and still continue to charge me until it was fully paid off! I&#x27;ve never been forced to buy a product before, let alone threatened with bad credit if I refused to pay for something that DOESN&#x27;T WORK! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I like no no. It works, it just takes time. Which is exactly what the instructions and commercials say. It&#x27;s a little tricky though when using on curved parts of the body such as the face or knees. Be careful not to burn yourself when doing curvy areas.</li>
            <li> CRAP, yes it burns the hair down and also can burn your sensitive skin!!!  Hair grows back no matter if you were to use it every day!!  You may as well  throw your money out the window, it doesn&#x27;t even work on fine hair!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, a waste of money. I strictly followed the regime of rolling No!no Hair Removal, by small areas and repeatedly on the same area many more times when the hair grows back. Saw very slight reduction of my hair growth rate but it always grows back and I also have to shave after that because it couldn&#x27;t remove the hair completely. I gave up on this device now after using it regularly for over six months now, so tired of doing it without any short or long term results and i wasted my time, energy and money hoping it will work! I used my device so carefully and still have it in perfect working condition, don&#x27;t know what to do with it now!</li>
            <li> I only have one thing to say about this product --  WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!  In January it will be a year that I have been using NONO and I have just as much hair on my chin and upper lip that I had a year ago, and I use it about every other day.  It&#x27;s not painful but sometimes it does burn - skin and I have to use Neosporin after so I don&#x27;t get an infection.  It&#x27;s a waste of money - try something else.</li>
            <li> This product is a SCAM, pure and simple.  Do not order it unless you want to lose your money on a worthless product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and haven&#x27;t used a razor at all, if you follow the instructions properly and use it correctly it works great. you have to be diligent and not skip treatments to start out. I can already see about  50% of my hair not returning and by spring, I shouldn&#x27;t have to use it much at all except for touch ups. I love it.</li>
            <li> I had no expectations of this product, just high hopes that it would take care of the stubborn hairs growing on my chin and the peach fuzz on my cheeks. I charged the unit overnight and used it in the morning. The first time I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all, but the second time I was amazed at how much hair had disappeared. Yes, there was the burnt hair smell but it wasn&#x27;t offensive. I just turned the exhaust fan on in the bathroom. It was so encouraging to me to have a smooth hairless face. No matter how feminine one feels, having long hairs protruding on one&#x27;s chin made me feel like a man!&lt;br /&gt;I love my &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34;! I wish I had purchased it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;For me, it was well worth the purchase price and time involved.</li>
            <li> I like it. The only problem is the smell of burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t what I expected but it did remove the hair and it did not grow back.</li>
            <li> This product is a total sham!  No hair was removed after 8 applications.  Please save your money not worth the money get a Brazilian wax instead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Williams</li>
            <li> The product is not what they advertise.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t work as fast as they show on TV and secondly, it burns your skin and leaves this awful burning smell for a while.  It&#x27;s not at all effective at all.  I would not recommend this to any of my friends.  I feel bad wasting $100 on this product and now it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom cabinet collecting dust.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for upper lip area, it is not designed for this at all!  The head of the no no is too big, even using the smallest one, you cannot get all the upper lip area and it burns the skin around the lips.  You are supposed to avoid lip area, but is kind of hard to do since it fills up that whole space from under nose to top of lip.  Doesn&#x27;t have a smooth glide on that area either.  Would not recommend this at all for this particular body area</li>
            <li> I am not biased and actually wanted this thing to work. I have a lot of hair to get rid of. Tried it for two days on a chest and belly and quit. Very disappointed.  Since I am a design engineer here are some non-emotional reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- My body hair was at different length under 1 cm. First day Nono trimmed only about 70% of it leaving the stubs of different length- from 2mm to 10mm. About 30% of hair was not cut at all even after 10 passes! Burning hair smell was terrible. You&#x27;d need to change your close and shower after the procedure. Don&#x27;t even think doing this at home. Need to be outside or in well-ventilated room. Taking this thing on a trip is a joke. The hotel will hate and evacuate you.&lt;br /&gt;-  I&#x27;ve repeated the treatment of the same area on a second day. Same result. Perhaps trimmed 20% more. Stubs are the same length- all over the place. Very unpleasant feeling on a touch even after polishing with nono&#x27;s sponge.&lt;br /&gt;- The nono recommends to start the procedure on 3mm long hair . How can you do that? Use a clipper or shave and wait for 2 weeks?&lt;br /&gt;- Remember, you&#x27;ll loose your shipping if returned before 45 days.  Full refund only between 45-60 days.&lt;br /&gt;- And the biggest thing: I don&#x27;t believe it may slow the hair growth or remove it. The follicles remain untouched and undamaged.  The wire just burns the hair really high to avoid skin damage. You also have to move Nono pretty fast otherwise the protection pops the tip up. You can&#x27;t go slow.There is no scientific proof behind this concept and no result. Nono is going back.</li>
            <li> Not a good product. Only works on soft fine hair.  I was very dissatisfied with the product.  This product does not work for people who has been fighting unwanted for years.</li>
            <li> Thought the claims on this product were too good to be true, and I was right.  It does not work as claimed that it would; does NOT remove coarse hair (which they told me it would)and does not even do a good job on fine hair.  In addition they guaranteed a triple money back guarantee of product which includes refund of purchase price, shipping and handling and cost to ship it back.  Not TOTALLY true.  I returned mine and they shorted me $12.95 for the original shipping.  They said it had to be returned between 45 and 60 days after the purchase date to have the shipping cost returned to you.  Deceptive.  It is an expensive product and  I debated before buying due to the price; however, I thought if it worked it would be worth the money.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T buy this item or into the hype. This product totally sucks so save your money, girls!  I am over the 30-day trial now so I can&#x27;t send it back.  It does not cut the hairs on my legs plus it takes FOREVER!  The fist time i did my legs, it took an hour and a lot of this is because I had to go over and over, sometimes 6 - 8 times.  The next time it took me 50 minutes to do both legs, same thing.  It just will not burn off the hairs and I really don&#x27;t think mine is particularly coarse.  Who has the patience required for this when you know that you can shave both legs in 5 minutes while in the shower?!  I mean, REALLY?!  I tried it on my face on the lower sideburn area, the chin, the moustache area, etc., 2 - 4 times and I don&#x27;t see any difference AT ALL!  My hairs just keep on growing back.  Frankly, I had more success with the prescription Vaniqa (approx. $90 for a tube and should last for about 3 months and not covered by medical insurance), which really does slow down the hair growing process if you use it faithfully, twice a day.  Just save your money on that No No and instead get the prescription from your physician or your OB/GYN.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend who didn&#x27;t have Prime. It&#x27;s not as fast as she was expecting to remove hair, but it functions as promised. The first iteration the smell of burnt hair is noticeable. But after first use, subsequent uses don&#x27;t produce the odor. Need to use slowly for maximum effect to ensure the hairs are being affected.</li>
            <li> I purchased my No No for use on some fine facial hair and have had wonderful response. It is not a quick fix, but after going to the electrolysis for years and not seeing a marked improvement this has really been a blessing and would encourage anyone to purchse one.</li>
            <li> My name is curt samu do not buy this product it doesn&#x27;t work leaves hair stubble even after buffing. Even worse they don&#x27;t want to take it back. They refused me a shipping label. And told me I had to pay to send it back. Now I have to call my credit card to stop payment&lt;br /&gt;customer service is terrible. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 years ago! I sent it back immediately because it BURNED me! On my face no less. I was embarrassed for weeks waiting for the burn to fade. It was well within the 60 days. It took forever to get my refund though, so I called Discover, and within 3 days of that call, I had a full refund. DO NOT waste your time or money! I&#x27;d say NO!No! is a No!Go!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, it&#x27;ll pay for a year of waxing/threading...</li>
            <li> I was watching Hawaii 5-0 one night while my wife was out bowling with her friend Linda. I&#x27;m pretty sure Linda is one of those &amp;#34; preppers&amp;#34;, but I can&#x27;t actually prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was the newer version of 5-0 not the original with Jack Lord. I like the original better but we have basic cable and it only has the new version. There&#x27;s no damn way I&#x27;m paying an extra $35 a month just to watch the original. No damn way!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway I was truly mesmerized by the NoNo. It looked magical, like something a magical wizard  might use in a Harry Potter movie so of course I plunked down a weeks hard earned pay and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I&#x27;ve never seen any of the Harry Potter movies. I think there are books too. I haven&#x27;t read them either. My son Donald saw them and enjoyed them immensely. The wife and I call him Donny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My understanding is that this Potter kid and his friends are in league with demons. I make it a rule never to judge a person I&#x27;ve never met, but this kid sounds messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway a few exciting days later a package comes in the mail with our new NoNo. I tried reading instructions but they got confusing so I just took it out of the box and started playing around with it. The thing works with laser beams. Laser beams!!! I was immediately pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The commercial shows a woman removing upper lip hair effortlessly and without pain. So I decided it was time to put this magical laser beam wonder to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the power to FULL BLAST and went to work on the facial hair. Then after that I concentrated on body hair. It took about 4 hours but when I was done our cat Scamp was as bald as bowling ball. He was shivering and he seemed kinda dazed but he&#x27;s always been a bit of a weirdo. Most cats are dicks IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: the NoNo worked as advertised. I would not hesitate to recommend this fine product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Expensive and completely useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. No no does not remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy this until I read the reviews.  Even then, I took that with a grain of salt.  But $300 for a device that burns your hair off?  It would be cheaper to just run a lighter up and down my legs.  Pass.</li>
            <li> My nono hair removal system which was very expensive and is 2 year old is useless at this point. I contacted customer service which is also useless to explain that the black rubber band which is needed to make this pricey little machine function needs to be replaced and slips off the blade head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told sorry we do not sell replacement bands. Now I can throw my little gadget in the garbage. This was a very expensive item. Do not buy....</li>
            <li> I think this company should be investigated. Although the product does take some of the hair off, it doesn&#x27;t remotely work as advertised. In the commercials, they show masses of dark hair falling off as the product is used. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN. It seems to burn off about half the hair, leaving a rough stubble. If you use it every day, this seems to diminish. But it never entirely gets the skin clean and hair free. Meanwhile, you have to be extremely careful. This thing will bite! You&#x27;ll be going along smoothly for a few strokes and then it is like it hits your skin with extra force, leaving burn marks in the shape of the wire. I cannot tell you how many times I have walked around all day with burn marks on my face thanks to this thing. Meanwhile, I suspect it contributes to hair growth in the long run. I quit using mine a few months ago and the facial hair is WORSE than it has ever been. Don&#x27;t waste your money....and if you already have the misfortune of owning one, join me in complaining to the FCC and the better business bureau. There ought to be a class action against this thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many hours I spent using it and it did very little. Don&#x27;t waste your money as I did.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair. If you go to slow, it burns your skin. Laser stops working when you go over knees, chin, and bony area.&lt;br /&gt;Called No No to return product because it didn&#x27;t remove hair. He said, &amp;#34;you&#x27;re right it doesn&#x27;t remove hair and we don&#x27;t advertise it for hair removal. Use a razor instead.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this is the worst thing i have bought in a while. i would tell any one what a piece of trash it is. it did not remove the hair .when i used it on my face it burned my face and still did not take away the hair.i am so glad to get to rate it because it has ben on my mind what i should do.now i know warn everyone to not purchase it</li>
            <li> I really liked this product but it quit working all of a sudden after just a few uses. I wish it would have kept working but no one wants to pay that much for a product and not be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It does kinda trim ur hairs but it leaves a nasty smell behind and sometimes burns ur skin</li>
            <li> People, people, people! What possessed u to think that u can remove hair with a Blue LED light!? Its a simple $2.37 kids toy that emits a light.. Its a flashlight!&lt;br /&gt;If you really want results, then go get a Brazilian wax or just stick to a $.99 razor blade and cheap shaving cream.. Seriously, how ignorant is this country..?</li>
            <li> I bought this device from the company itself and used it faithfully for about two weeks.  Number one, it is difficult to use.  Number two, even though I was smelling burnt hair, I didn&#x27;t see any hair removal.  And I would go over the same area several times.  I did this every day for the two weeks before I finally gave up.  I had no trouble returning it, though.  The customer service rep was very nice, even though she tried to get me to keep it longer and keep trying.  I said no and she gave me a RMA#.  I got my money back in a short amount of time.  My niece bought the newer Pro model and it seems to be working for her, so maybe it really depends on your hair type.  However, it&#x27;s too expensive to get and find out it doesn&#x27;t work.  I would save my money and just use a razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife. She said she wanted one. I checked some reviews and was on the fence. Told her to read some reviews and let me know for sure if she still wanted it. She was iffy but said she would like to try it. It burned some hairs but did not work like advertised. I even tried it on my arm hair. Could smell some burnt hair but that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. If it looks too good to be true.....</li>
            <li> I bought the product for my granddaughter.  She and her parents tried the product and felt it to be not at all useful.  I took it back and tried it for mysef.  I have found the NoNo to be quite satisfactory.  It is not as easy to use as instructed, but thus far I am liking it.  Will know better after the first six weeks is up and I am able to see the final results.</li>
            <li> item was unusable after first use, would not turn on or off.  did not even function properly the first use.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  It does not work.  I used it daily for a couple of months until it broke completely. I doubt if one hair was removed.  I really gave it the best effort I could, I followed their directions exactly.  I looked on U Tube and followed the advise on the video clips I saw.  This is a piece of junk.  I am surprised their is no class action suit against this company.  If I could find one I would join in.  The TV commercials are just plain false.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the reviews here on Amazon.  I  was hoping this supposedly new one was better than the old one.  This company has duped a lot of foolish people like me.  This really is the modern day version of snake oil.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but have had a great deal of trouble with it. I have replaced the tips several times and now it will not recharge. It is very costly and now I am unable to use it. I would check out the competition. When it is working, I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife had wanted NoNo for quite a while. It did not perform as the advertising suggested. Plus about 20 days after starting to use it the on/off button stuck. We are going to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the No!No! for months.  I&#x27;ve been occasionally burned, not badly, but I can deal with that if it will help with the thick peach fuzz on my face and neck (my epilator works great but it really hurts!).  The problem with the product is that it does not work.  It takes many, many, many passes with the No!No! for it to burn the hair down, and it still does not get the majority of the hair.  Most are still as long as ever.  I had to follow it with shaving.  There is the smell of burning hair, and sometimes a curl of smoke, so something is being done.  After a few weeks, I can use the No!No! without shaving, but it definitely leaves stubble and I still have to pluck some thick hairs that won&#x27;t respond to the No!No!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months of use, the hair on my face, neck and arms is growing in just as fast and thick as ever.  I&#x27;ve switched back to my epilator and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someday someone will find a painless, effective method of permanent or semi-permanent hair removal, but the No!No! does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Garbage it didnt work after the first week and left marks when i did use it the commercials are lies i want my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not work an absolute waste of money.  Do not buy, you will be sorry!!!!!!  My money was wasted I am so sorry I believed add.</li>
            <li> I got the no no about two weeks ago and have had no luck with it thus far. It burned my chin with burn lines and smells of burning skin.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and the girl I talked to told me how to &amp;#34;properly&amp;#34; use the devise. Plus I went over and over my skin and it took very little hair off. Frustrating. Want to send it back to get my funds.</li>
            <li> for anyone that wants to purchase this - check out the Better Business Bureau website first. There have been 180 formal complaints about the product/company-Radiancy in the last 3 years</li>
            <li> I bought this thing from Argos last week and there I asked the lady at the till if I could return this product if I didn&#x27;t like it and she said sure. So I went on and bought it. I thought it was going to shave off all my hair like as in shave off. I actually dreamed of buying this product. I used to see good and convincing reviews on TV so I went ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I actually came home and used it, it was really hard to use it. I tried reading the instructions but they only tell home to switch it on not how to use it. So I tried the CD. The CD ROM was tiny that was kinda unusual. I saw the CD but it was the same thing as the instruction manual/booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I saw on YouTube how to use it, it was clear. And I saw this video why not to buy NO! NO! Pro. And it said that hair on skin started to burn and smoke came out of the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I used it, the blue light kept on switching on and off. It was very frustrating. I actually cried spending at least £200. I was upset. My hair was still there and the machine crashed down. The machine itself was really cheap looking. And all the plastic came out and fell apart. I wasted £200 on this crap machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my point of view I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as it looks cheap, is expensive, breaks easily and is a waste of time when you can just go ahead on hair surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of 1 star I would of given this 0 star!!! Its true!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on coarse hair. Tried several times. Burned my face! Able to return but of course you lose the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work! I thought I had to give it some time but after 8 months it still doesn&#x27;t work. Does not, I repeat does not remove all the hair. After 8 months I still have to shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money because they only give 1 month to return it. I know someone that bought it some where else and after 3 months could get their money back. Not here. I should have thrown the money away. This was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I can not get it to work. It turns on but that is all.</li>
            <li> I bought one a year ago I tried it it did nt work for me I kept trying , after 6/7 try&#x27;s I got fed up with it and decided to wait a while and try again well I forgot all about it , when I did eventually try again the therma part stuck down so I sent it back customer service told me it&#x27;s a sealed unit and carnt be fixed , it&#x27;s hardly been used ,I was disappointed at the outcome but it didn&#x27;t do as it said anyway so now it&#x27;s in a draw  useless , customer service not helpfull , full of bull , I would never recommend it I wouldn&#x27;t even rate it , it&#x27;s that bad</li>
            <li> Does not work, waste of money. Even with the extended warrantee I was unable to get a refund. They make the hoops you have to jump through impossible to achieve. I am glad to see the overwhelming reviews warning people away from this very expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD!! I bought this probably two years ago from the official no no hair remover site, its like running a lighter over your skin and it has a horrible burned hair smell as you are using it. DONT BUY!! Why are they even allowed to sell this piece of crap!! I have thick black hair! it does NOT work!!</li>
            <li> My Mom owns the no no hair series and it&#x27;s okay she&#x27;s been using it for a while and her hair is slowing growth. She hasn&#x27;t had hair on her upper lip for a couple months now. Still some where it is thicker but it is not growing back as fast and it is getting softer with each use. Now I use the pro series and I have to say I like it better than the hair series because I have some coarse hair on my chin and it gets it better then the hair series. Both the hair and pro series use the same tips so if you own this one and want to upgrade to the pro you don&#x27;t have to buy more tips right away. It&#x27;s a big plus considering the cost of refill tips. My mom after trying out my pro with her tips wants to upgrade to the pro. If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest the pro 5 series the hair is good for thinner and less coarse hair. It still works on it but it takes longer and the longer you have to use your tip per session the quicker it burns out. The pro series has two tips the one like the hair only it has better control it can work hotter without burning you, still work as well, get as close and last as long (unless it is a defective wire) and the then you have the pro 5 which is made for thicker coarse hair and instead of just 3 settings it has 4. The regular pro works great for me, but for my friend has thick dark coarse hair on her legs, almost like a mans beard on her legs she needs the pro 5 series and she says that it works better than razors for her it just takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;How this works is simple the tip has a little wire that heats up and burns your hair, yes you get a burnt hair smell from it and lets you know it is working. It even tells you so in the instructions so why people are complaining about it I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s kind of a duh your burning the hair did you expect it to smell like roses even though they tell you it burns the hair and you&#x27;re going to smell burnt hair, that&#x27;s what tells you it&#x27;s working. If you leave it like that you are going to be walking around smelling like you just walked out of a fire so you buff it. The buffer will just take off the burnt part of the hair if you go over it lightly once and leave you with annoying stubble. Go over it a few times and your legs will be smooth. The buffer is like an extra fine sandpaper and it doesn&#x27;t hurt If you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor you&#x27;ll know what you are doing, if you haven&#x27;t the videos don&#x27;t really explain it too well and you will be left with a lot of stubble like you see a lot of people complaining about.&lt;br /&gt;How to use the buffer properly press lightly and go small circular motions in a straight line up and down for like legs or side to side for like the jaw line on your face, then go back in the opposite direction rotating in the opposite direction as well so if you were going clockwise down your leg from the knee to the ankle you would go counter clockwise up your leg from the ankle to the knee. Do this until it is smooth, you may need to wipe away the dried skin and hair off the buffer and where you are doing so that it works better and faster. Then you can rinse off your legs and put on your capi slow lotion then go.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than shaving with a razor but it lasts longer than a razor and your legs feel smoother and not only does it grow slower the more you use it, as long as you use the lotion with capi slow, your hair gets softer as it goes. It takes longer when you are first learning to use and it gets quicker the more you use it one because your hair is less and thinner and two because you&#x27;ve learned the perfect speed and you are no longer going too fast so that it is not getting as much and having to go over it several time or going too slow and it stopping and having to start a little farther back so it gets all of it. Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t take long to master it&#x27;s kind of like when you first learned to shave your legs with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Tip really long hair doesn&#x27;t do so well it takes longer to get to because the plate in front that is meant to lift the hair up so the wire can burn it ends up holding it down until the wire has past so it doesn&#x27;t burn it right away. If you can trim it before hand or shave a day or two before you use it so that your hair is no more than 1/4 inch and it will go so much faster and you won&#x27;t burn out your tip as quickly by having to use it so much just to do it. Also in all honesty their buffers are not the greatest they are done after 1 or 2 uses so I got the smooth away kit from amazon (actually when you get it it is called silky smooth but is listed as smooth away) and this works much better and lasts a lot longer. I used to use smooth away all the time instead of a razor before they stopped selling them in stores in my area. Now if you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor you know that it can be time consuming and if you do it too much your skin will be red or you can have patches of hair left but using the no no first then buffing is so much faster and so much better. I didn&#x27;t have any over buffing redness, I only had to go over it a couple times with the silky smooth instead of the normal 15 times when I don&#x27;t use the no no, I didn&#x27;t have any patches of hair left either and it is still good for a lot more uses. Their buffer was only good for one use on my legs, face, underarms and it already wasn&#x27;t working as well after doing my legs before I even did anything else. Also the no no on it&#x27;s own will not slow your hair growth. I had a couple friends try it and they complained that their hair was still thick and needed to use it every 3 days after 3 months. You need the lotion with capi slow  that is what slows the hair growth and thins it. Will it work for everyone probably not, but it has worked for me and I only used it once and my hair is already softer and not growing in as fast as when I was using tweezers and razors.&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service  My mom and I both bought ours from No No and she had to call No No because her No No Hair was having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right. The customer service she got was less then acceptable. The person didn&#x27;t want to help her. They couldn&#x27;t tell her what was going on and didn&#x27;t go through the steps to figure out if it was a defect in the device or just the tip needing to be changed. When she got her No No Hair it was still new on the market and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard it wouldn&#x27;t work (because the wheel is not spinning at the proper speed and sticking and cause you to burn yourself so it is suppose to shut off) and the red light will come on when the tip goes bad (or if there is another device issue). Now my mother is a push over she doesn&#x27;t follow through on things if someone says they are going to give her something and she pays for it and doesn&#x27;t get it she won&#x27;t call them back to say hey where is it she just waits and if she gets bad customer service reps (every company has them) she won&#x27;t call back to get someone else and get it taken care of properly and if they don&#x27;t respond to her email she doesn&#x27;t try again she just gets mad and gives up. So I had to call no no again and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it and the rep didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with it. Well turns out all she needed was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems. So I was a bit afraid to order my No No Pro, because a lot of people complained they got the same bad customer service my mom did and very few people gave good rating on customer service, but I went ahead and did it anyway because I liked what I was seeing happen when with my mom using hers. I gotit two weeks ago and the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then went to 3 so I figured it was just the way it worked then I used it again for the second time ever today it started out at 3 then went 1 then 3 then 1 then 3 and then the wire snapped. I didn&#x27;t even finsh 1 leg. So running around with 3/4 of a leg done and the other one not touched at all I called talked to a no no rep. I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me. no issues, no hassle, he didn&#x27;t try to blame me. I even asked if it was something I did and he reassured me it wasn&#x27;t my fault. It will be here in 7-10 days, then I send them back the bad one in the same box all paid for and I just need to let them know when I get it because it resets my warranty for another 60 days from that day and it gives me 10 days from the day I get them for it to get back to them.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it you&#x27;re out of luck. There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed and you don&#x27;t mind the burnt hair smell or can use incense to mask it then go for it. I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair get you a different buffer system to like I did and use their buffers to polish up after you finish buffing with the other one.s with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right. The customer service she got was less then acceptable. The person didn&#x27;t want to help her. They couldn&#x27;t tell her what was going on and didn&#x27;t go through the steps to figure out if it was a defect in the device or just the tip needing to be changed. When she got her No No Hair it was still new on the market and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard it wouldn&#x27;t work (because the wheel is not spinning at the proper speed and sticking and cause you to burn yourself so it is suppose to shut off) and the red light will come on when the tip goes bad (or if there is another device issue). Now my mother is a push over she doesn&#x27;t follow through on things if someone says they are going to give her something and she pays for it and doesn&#x27;t get it she won&#x27;t call them back to say hey where is it she just waits and if she gets bad customer service reps (every company has them) she won&#x27;t call back to get someone else and get it taken care of properly and if they don&#x27;t respond to her email she doesn&#x27;t try again she just gets mad and gives up. So I had to call no no again and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it and the rep didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with it. Well turns out all she needed was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems. So I was a bit afraid to order my No No Pro, because a lot of people complained they got the same bad customer service my mom did and very few people gave good rating on customer service, but I went ahead and did it anyway because I liked what I was seeing happen when with my mom using hers. I got it two weeksago and the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then went to 3 so I figured it was just the way it worked then I used it again for the second time ever today it started out at 3 then went 1 then 3 then 1 then 3 and then the wire snapped.

            <li> Rubbish , &#x27;burns&#x27; hair off unevenly leaving very rough stubble. Does not remove hair as well as a 99p razor. Total rip off</li>
            <li> This thing not work. I try remove hare, but hare still eat carrot.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and &amp;#34;killed&amp;#34; two of these.  I have smooth legs but occasional &amp;#34;wild hairs&amp;#34; appearing.  It has done nothing on my face, however I have not used it as often on my face as I should have.  My real complaint is that they don&#x27;t last.  You use it and in too short a time it stops firing.  For me, the price was ok but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Nearly 2 years of use have taught me that the No!No! does remove hair, but not as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a brunette. As such I have dark hair in places that I would rather not, such as the shadow on my upper lip that started to become obvious around junior high school. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen No!No! advertised again and again and finally I just could not help myself and I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple of times to get the feel of it and to move it smoothly and slowly so the machine doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;skip\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t difficult to use.. but it is timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did/does the No!No! do for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes fine hair, both light and dark. By fine I mean baby hair like the hair on the upper lip and jawline that is like baby hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes it very nicely leaving a nice smooth feeling. While it does seem to cut the hair rather than remove it, it doesn&#x27;t leave a shadow or a stubble feeling like the handheld feminine facial trimmers do. If you, or someone you know, gets in close to your face after using this on fine hair the feeling is soft and smooth skin, nothing else. No one will know that the hair ever was there. Another plus is that makeup looks nicer as there isn&#x27;t any fine hair for makeup to cling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does No!No! not do for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not remove any course hair or stubble. It doesn&#x27;t work on an occasional tough facial hair and is spotty at best on legs and thighs. While it will cut/burn/trim any fine hair on the legs and thighs it leaves everything else behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using No!No! on my legs for quite some time - over 6 months worth of time. I would spend quite a bit on my legs while watching a movie and follow it up with a shave. I felt less stubble doing it this way, but is is more because the hair that is removed with the No!No! wasn&#x27;t stubble type hair and I was hoping that spending the time doing this every other day would result in cleaner legs and eventually shaving less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have seen less hair growth anywhere. I continue to use it on my face every other day. It takes just a couple of minutes and it leaves my face looking the way I want it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this device been sold to trim peach fuzz or fine hair it would work perfectly as advertised, however the price point is probably more than a bit high to sell for that alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I keep it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the device because it was working on the fine hair on my face that bothered me so very much. I was hopeful that it would become permanent or at least less troublesome and that by working on my legs that even though the courser hair wasn&#x27;t being removed that perhaps it was being affected and would become finer and... well I have a heck of an imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I did pay for the device and it does serve some purpose I will continue to use it. At this point I have no illusions that my fine hair will go away or that I will be able to repurpose my my pretty pink tweezers into a framed artwork piece on antique beauty supplies. No!No! is what it is.. a really close hair trimmer by electrical wire. It burns fine hair very close to and at the skin line. When used every other day it helps to create a fine pallet for makeup and smooth place for tender touches and kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Finally....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not completely lost site of believing in permanent at home hair removal and may at some point try [[ASIN:B00B0S7KUY Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X - Blush]] but at this time I will continue to use the No!No! for its limited use along with my [[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]] [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]] and razors. With these combined tools along with an arsenal of facial and body cleansers, exfoliants, creams, lotions, oils and butters I am able to get asexy sleek appearance. :psexy sleek appearance. :p</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they lock you into a tiny return schedule--unless you are REALLY organized and write all the dates down precisely on the calendar, you will wind up owning this terrible overpriced product even though you do not want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, even if you follow all the return instructions to the letter, they will not return your money unless you call and call and call again (it took me seven times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very possibly the worst product and sleaziest company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product even though I was skeptical.... I wish I would have believed the product reviews.  The device gets warm, smells like it&#x27;s burning the hair... but that&#x27;s all that happens.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks.  Sometimes I shaved the area and waited to use the devise the next day,  sometimes I waited two days.  I tried the different settings... IT DOES NOT WORK.  When I called the customer service line to return it, they kept me on the line for 15 minutes, saying over and over that it works, did I try this? did I try that?  did I change the settings...  what an ugly experience!</li>
            <li> Worst hair removal product ever made.  This is a scam and it&#x27;s on national T.V. too. Not as good as a well used razor.</li>
            <li> I think this product gets a lot of bad reviews because it is being compared to a razor. I will offer a review to compare it to an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an epilator for three years now. Shaving is, obviously, less painful but epilating lasts longer. I find that the NO NO lasts as long as an epilation treatment with zero pain. This product does not get as close to the skin as a epilator (it does not pluck the hair out of the socket) but the regrowth is slower than a shave, so for me that is the key. Plus it is not painful at all, and my first few experiences with an epilator gave me tears. I Have been using this item on my bikini line and I do like the results. I will have to go over the area with a shave, but the hair seems to be growing back slower and that was my main goal- because I hate shaving every day :) (I&#x27;m not lazy I live somewhere warm and have two kids, so the longer I can go between shaves, the more time I have to enjoy my coffee in the AM!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to an epilator I do like this item better. I will continue to use it, while buffing or shaving over the top.</li>
            <li> It works, but slowly. And the cover is a bit loose, but we&#x27;ve already sent one back for always switching to high from low -- and the new one does the same. So you can only use the product on high because it doesn&#x27;t mater what setting you put it on - it always switches to high after one stroke.</li>
            <li> Bought one for the wife and it did nothing for her. You will not get your money back so do not believe in their ad!!</li>
            <li> This is a very bad company and product avoid getting involved with them at all.</li>
            <li> It removes the hair however it hasn&#x27;t proved it&#x27;s self on keeping the hair from growing back and hasn&#x27;t done so well at thick hair such as whiskers these are cores dark hairs that have strength like a tooth brush bristle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom.. It doesn&#x27;t work! She hates it! Need to be returned ASAP. Help help please!!</li>
            <li> We had a very unfortunate experience with this product and the company. We purchased this product and it was put to use for weeks by my wife to no results, I left many emails to the company to find out they do not answer them, although this is from a contact page on their web site, I then contacted support, I was told I could not ask for refund right away as I had to continue trying the product for the major part of the trial period. When we remembered that we needed to call back, it was too late and we were gladly told that we exceeded the warranty period. I consider this a nasty marketing trick to escape refunding unhappy customers, and anyone that having the bad luck who falls in that trap winds up loosing a sad 350$. We are not wishing that to anyone.</li>
            <li> appears to meet all claims</li>
            <li> I purchased the no no from their website and used it exactly as was stated but there has been absolutely no difference in the hair,  if anything it leaves you with stubble and makes it looks like you have a REALLY BAD SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Could be a better product for the money. Maybe it&#x27;s just me &amp; my hair., but it still seems like a lot of time invested for the desired results. I can say I&#x27;m not 100% pleased.  PLUS you need to purchase additional &#x27;electro heads&#x27; to get the best results. Sign me, Somewhat Disappointed</li>
            <li> It removes the hair--BUT THAT IS THE ONLY THING IT DOES!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the No!no! for about two months. My hair growth has barely lessened. Instead of having to use hair removal products every three days, now I have to use the No!no! every four to five days.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied, because it is effective at removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely get burned. I have yet to experience an allergic reaction from it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it isn&#x27;t horrible, but it is not a miracle.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT remove hair.  It burns skin--no hair whatsoever.  It should be taken off the market and there should be a class action suit to get people their money back.  That they continue to advertise it on TV is beyond me.  It does not work on the face or anywhere else for that matter.  I followed the instructions on it faithfully, so it&#x27;s not as if I wasn&#x27;t using it properly. Should you buy this product?  The answer is:  NO-NO!</li>
            <li> Great product works as advertised. Have had no problems, wife and daughters love it, would highly recomend.&lt;br /&gt;Have let other family members use they just love it.</li>
            <li> I have an epalsilk and I have always loved it. I thought this would work as well but if you have a lot of hair like I do, it&#x27;s just a pain. If you only have a little hair I bet it works great.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this piece of crap! I did and it worked once and quite for no reason. I bought it off tv. Never will I waste money on this again. It&#x27;s worthless!</li>
            <li> Works OK, but not as simple as the advertisement.</li>
            <li> The product did not do what it said it would do. I have been burnt on several occasions. The item then malfunctioned,and there is not customer support. I did everything I was suppose to do, and had been very excited when I bought it. Wish I could say something good about it, but if you have hair issues this is not the answer. The little bit it did take off was not worth all the time, burnt smell, burnt skin you have to go through to get it. Sorry ladies keep on waxing, shaving.</li>
            <li> I just want to thank everyone  that took  a little time to post the truth about this product and help hundreds of people NOT  to go through the painful process of getting their money back, but after reading all this histories, I refused to go through all the burocracy to get my money back, but thanks to all of you that have the courage to speak up For many of us and  saved us. Thanks again...Viva Internet</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered right from the NoNo website...but wanted to put a review on Amazon because of the volume of customers that shop on here.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this thinking it was going to stop me from having to wax. I have had hair growth on my chin for quite some time. I have course hair so I knew it would take a while to see results. The first couple times I thought, \\&quot;cool, this is gonna work!\\&quot; I did it every other day, then had to go to every day. The hair grew in thicker. The last couple of weeks I had it, I was having to use it 2 times a day. Instead of helping, it made it worse. I am now waxing again.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this was a bad investment. I have a feeling it works best on fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back and am waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> Cartridges didn&#x27;t last long. And I saw no results.</li>
            <li> I have used this since Dec. and still have not achieved the results advertised on TV. Even after using there is still stuble. Not nearly as smooth as when shaving.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.  I will keep using it however.  It is easy to use, that&#x27;s the best part.</li>
            <li> my friend has one and loves it...I think it works great and I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I have told several friends they should buy one...</li>
            <li> It takes far longer to use than a razor and the results are nothing more than a scorched hair smell.  The hair is still there and has to be removed by another method.</li>
            <li> I have been back and forth for a while on whether or not to &amp;#34;NO-NO&amp;#34;. I just received a flier in mail today and debated purchasing again. After reading about refund disasters, their so-called &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; and most importantly the TRUTH about this product performance as opposed to their advertising and marketing hype, I am definitely declaring NO! NO! to this scam. These days, very few people have an extra $268 to throw away including myself. My feeling is there are SO MANY negative reviews that you ALL can&#x27;t be wrong. :-) Back to wax, tweezers and my faithful razor! Who says beauty isn&#x27;t a lot of work! LOL!</li>
            <li> it is kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> The No!no! is a definate NOT and I will not purchase after reading this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How we tested&lt;br /&gt;Six female staffers who normally shave their legs at least three times a week let hair grow for a week. We took pictures (no, you won’t find them on Instagram), then asked panelists to shave one leg as usual and use No No and its buffer on the other leg at least three times a week for six weeks. We compared before and after photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we found&lt;br /&gt;Panelists used words such as “prickly” and  “hairy” to describe how their legs felt after No No. All six said the treated leg was never hair- or stubble-free during the six weeks of testing. Something else that panelists noticed: the smell of burned hair. The final straw? Using No No took far longer than shaving—up to 25 minutes per leg. None of the panelists said they’d want to buy the device, though some described it as “cute.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close-up&lt;br /&gt;We tested No No units bought at Amazon.com but found out that the manufacturer won’t back devices purchased from that retailer. According to the manufacturer, the only authorized retailers are Drugstore.com, HSN, and No No’s website. We then tested No No devices bought at trynono.com and HSN, and they performed similarly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editor&#x27;s Note: This article appeared in the December 2013 issue of Consumer Reports magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/12/no-no-hair-remover-review/index.htm</li>
            <li> My mother wanted a No No hair removal thing so she bought it. She then asked me to be the guinea pig and try it out for her. I really gotta learn how to say no.&lt;br /&gt;The other day I pulled the thing out of the box and got it ready. I read the directions: start with level 1 if it&#x27;s your first time using it, hold it at a 90 degree angle with the roller facing you, do not allow it to sit in one spot for too long. Ok. I got this.&lt;br /&gt;Put the thing on level 1, hoist my hoof onto the edge of the tub , and I begin.&lt;br /&gt;The stench of burning hair begins to fill the bathroom, completely overpowering the little air freshener thingy from Bath and Body Works. NOTHING overpowers the smell of those things....until now. I push on.&lt;br /&gt;After a few passes with the No No, I run my hand down my leg expecting baby smooth skin. Not so much. I decide to do the same spot again. As I ready it to make another pass, I notice that the No No is no longer on level 1, it&#x27;s on level 3. Hmm... I put it back on level 1 and try again.&lt;br /&gt;90 degree angle, roller facing me, and here we go. First pass complete, I start the next section. My thumb slipped a little so I took less than a fraction of a second to reposition it and, &amp;#34;HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL! WTF?!&amp;#34; I receive a zapping/burning jolt to my leg from it. When they say not to allow it to sit in one spot for too long what they really mean is NEVER EVER stop moving it! This thing could be used as a torture device! OMG! I proceed to give a profanity-laden lecture about how rude I felt this was. As I&#x27;m yelling at it, I notice that it is once again on level 3. Cheese and rice!&lt;br /&gt;When the tingling in my leg finally subsided, I decided to give it one last try. I put it back on level 1 (AGAIN), 90 degree angle, roller facing me, blah, blah, blah. Make 3 more passes on the same area. The trust in our new relationship completely gone, I never took my eyes off of it. Because of this, I was able to actually watch the little indicator move itself from level 1 to level 3. Caught it red handed! That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;I run my hand down the side of my leg once again hoping for baby smooth skin. After 8 passes, one teeth grinding zap, and the acrid smell of burnt hair stuck in my nostrils, I was left with stubble on my leg that had the appearance of grass after a fire and felt like it, too.&lt;br /&gt;I call my mother to tell her NO NO to the No No. She decides that we will be taking it back. No point in having it if it doesn&#x27;t even help. THEN she responds with:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;They did a write up on it in Consumer Reports that said it wasn&#x27;t all that great. I guess I should have listened. They&#x27;re usually right about these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.rom level 1 to level 3. Caught it red handed! That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;I run my hand down the side of my leg once again hoping for baby smooth skin. After 8 passes, one teeth grinding zap, and the acrid smell of burnt hair stuck in my nostrils, I was left with stubble on my leg that had the appearance of grass after a fire and felt like it, too.&lt;br /&gt;I call my mother to tell her NO NO to the No No. She decides that we will be taking it back. No point in having it if it doesn&#x27;t even help. THEN she responds with:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;They did a write up on it in Consumer Reports that said it wasn&#x27;t all that great. I guess I should have listened. They&#x27;re usually right about these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this product. It did not work most of the time and when it did it wasn&#x27;t very good at all. It is not worth all of the money I spent on it! And then why I tried to email them about a refund they never helped me. They would always reply with I did not understand your question please resubmit a new one!!</li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with this product . It&#x27;s appearance is great however it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does it&#x27;s not a razor or laser . It supposedly crystallizes the hair wherever you would like for it to be gone BUT it burns your hair and smoke comes out !!! Yes it burns em !!! The smell it leaves is awful and takes forever to remove the hair and when I mean forever I mean forever and doesn&#x27;t even leave the area smooth it leaves your hair toasted</li>
            <li> I asked for this in pink and it came in black second it shocked me 4 times already it leaves a terrible odor that resembles the smell of weed. This thing is terrible! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing worse than this device is the company&#x27;s customer service.  While I would like to just say &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy it,&amp;#34; the only advantage to spending the money on one is that you&#x27;ll be included in what will inevitably become a class action lawsuit for one reason or another.  Good luck, I warned you.</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me fast. Unit works great easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Directions are easy to follow, comes with two sets of heads</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work save your money</li>
            <li> Douse yourself in rubbing alcohol and strike a match. What does that have to do with this product? The no! no! removes hair the same way! With fire! You&#x27;re going to pay them to poke you&#x27;re face with a red hot peice of metal... The scent this product leaves behind is revulting (burnt hair smell) and their pad of false hope is only present as a distraction. It makes you think, perhaps this removes my hair. Wrong! You&#x27;re hair is here to stay with no! no! On an ending note, if you&#x27;re reading this and do decide to ignite yourself for the purposes of hair removal, the 3rd degree burns are easier to deal with than the customer return policy. Soo.... Good call!</li>
            <li> I wish they would take this product off the market. It is expensive and it does not work. I waited past the 30 days hoping it would get better or would even work but alas it did not. Please don&#x27;t waste your money and spread the word.</li>
            <li> This did not do a good job on my course hair. I would not recommend it to anyone. I returned it and am hopeful I am able to get my money back. It is A LOT of money for a gadget that does not work. CJ</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical. On the other hand I have tried some infomercial products with surprising results. Besides that I was getting desperate to treat the unwanted facial hair. So I ordered it and I have been using it for about 3 weeks. I have only used it on my face and neck so far but I have to say I have noticed a decrease in the amount of facial hair. I can smell the hair burning when I use it even if I can&#x27;t see the hair. I am not tweezing nearly as much as I was before no! no!. I think if I continue to use this, I will definitely see a bigger difference. I use it almost every day and so far my skin can take it. It does leave a very slight burning but it is nothing compared to the irritation from tweezing. So far so good. If I had it to do over, I would definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product. I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all! It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me.</li>
            <li> It works like it says it does, BUT it is an EXTREMELY slow process and it doesn&#x27;t get it as smoothly as a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife.  She read the instructions and could not get it to work the way that it is advertised.  I read the instructions and asked her questions and agree with her that it is not doing the job like it is advertised.  If you had almost no hair to remove, then this might be okay, but to attempt to remove what I would consider as normal hair growth, it is not worth the time and trouble that would be required using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It amazes me in that Amazon would ask me to rate this product in that I returned it for the reasons stated above.</li>
            <li> i bought it a few years ago and tried it the full time, with the 90 day warranty and it was a time consuming miserable experience, patches of hair just would not come out on my legs, the hair grew back and not sure if it was finer but still looks awful and have been looking for an answer ever since.  i used it as directed.  i have heard that when items grow in popularity, they sign contracts and the quality goes way down since they got their money</li>
            <li> This no no thing is aweful if you want to remove hair permanently. I have had electrolysis and laser hair removal for over 20 years. I have PCOS and the side effects are facial hair so I will never be hair free. I bought this hoping it would work between sessions at the doctors office and it does not. The only way to stun the growth of hair is by killing the ROOT. All this thing does is burn the hair on the surface. It seems like it works because you smell the hair burning and see a light pulse which makes it seem like its getting deeper but it isnt. This is exactly the same as shaving. All you are doing is removing the surface hair and not getting the root below the skin. Depending on how fast your hair grows, all people are different, you will see the hair come right back. Do not waste your money if you want any coarse, dark hair gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Shaving does not make your hair thicker or darker. Shaving does the same thing. It removes the hair from the surface. It does nothing to the root which is the only way that changes the appearance and texture of the hair. Hence, waxing and plucking will.</li>
            <li> I have had some facial hair since early adulthood and I have tried bleaching, waxing, tweezing, threading, laser, cream, etc. I saw an infomercial for NO NO. While I was both skeptical and hopeful this would be the holy grail of hair removal, I decided to take the plunge anyway and purchase one. I should have went with my gut feel on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the out of the box quality is hokey, it has the weight and feel of a 50.00 item, not one that cost nearly 300.00. It feels like it will shatter into little pieces if it is ever dropped on like a tile floor for example. The NO NO will become a yard sale dollar item within just a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are a clear as mud. They just instruct you make sure the blue light stays on while gliding. no tips or strategies for hair along jaw lines, upper lip etc. I went over these areas several times over and never was able to remove all the hair even on the highest setting. I eventually gave up after a few weeks and waited for the 45-60 day guaranteed satisfaction or your money back to roll around and asked for a return RMA on Day 46. The customer service is mediocre at best. I did however get an email saying my return was processed. We will see how long it takes for the credit to hit my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news, there is a much more cost effective solution out there. the REM spring which runs for around 20.00 including on amazon. I was reluctant to spend even that after the NO NO debacle so I went to the hardware store and purchased a large decorative plate hanger. It is a contraption with two springs between two clips. The springs appeared to have the right tension and pitch. Not quite as long as the REM spring but similar in every other way. I paid a 1.57 for two springs and just removed the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the REM how-to-video and used my little 79 cent spring to remove the hair from my lip and chin while watching TV and w/o a mirror. While it hurts as to be expected, these areas have never been so hair free or smooth; not even professional waxing accomplishes this. Pain just means you are doing it correctly. I am amazed at the results I achieved on the very first try. I will never wax or tweeze again. If you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of finding a cheap spring like I did which was really no hassle at all, go with the REM spring. You will much happier and have a lot more money in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew., these areas have never been so hair free or smooth; not even professional waxing accomplishes this.

            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the directions - the burned hair smell is strong, but after 2 months 90% of the hair is still there.</li>
