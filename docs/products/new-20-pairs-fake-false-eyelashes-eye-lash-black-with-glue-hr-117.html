            <li>the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>but, when they came they were really nice.  </li>
            <li>but the lashes are nice</li>

            <li>used my own.</li>
            <li>so if you are Fair you may or may not be able to pull that off.)</li>
            <li>Hope this helps, stay gorgeous :)</li>
            <li>They have a nice curve to them.</li>
            <li>But I use my own glue anyways</li>
            <li>I bought my own eyelash glue even though each packet comes with some.</li>
            <li>but they are nice lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the quality of the glue that comes with them because I use my own glue that I already have.</li>
            <li>and I ended up buying my own eyelash glue for about $5.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad!:)</li>
            <li>The glue isn&#x27;t that great but other than that, everything is awesome.</li>
            <li>these lashes are great for photos, or just to wear for fun...</li>
            <li>It would be nice to protect your sales and make sure they get to their customers with a teaching number ....</li>
            <li>Once they were on though they were quite comfortable and looked good.  </li>
            <li>These eyelashes are the best so far i&#x27;ve seen on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the lashes came in there own case.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use your own glue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply too!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but I loved them!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>these are super nice!</li>
            <li>these are great eyelashes and great for those beginers starting out with eyelashes.</li>
            <li>you barely tell that there spiky they blend in well! :D</li>
            <li>But this is a great company they immediately gave me a refund and was even to willingly send me replacements ...</li>
            <li>so I was pretty happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was quick and the product is good.</li>
            <li>They look more like lashes you would put on a doll.</li>
            <li>There are much better one on here.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>These lashes are OK but not anything like the picture.</li>
            <li>They are more spiky and criss crossed, not whispies as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Many people have complimented me on them.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because the glue is not the best</li>
            <li>No one could get a better deal on these lashes.</li>
            <li>I purchased these eyelashes for myself &amp; found them to be much better quality</li>
            <li>More glue would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>but I now am in love with these.</li>
            <li>The lashes sent were not the ones pictured, but were ok, and there was no glue.  </li>
            <li>The glue adhesive is okay,</li>
            <li>they are cheap!  </li>
            <li>They have apologized and agreed to send me a tracking number to make sure everything shows up this time.</li>
            <li>Most of my lids or bottoms were off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ecstatic! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The packeging was okay</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>applied them without eye makeup and they looked adorable.</li>
            <li>Cannot beat the price for 20 pairs!!! :-)</li>
            <li>but in this case, I got a lot more than what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love them for going out or weekends.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them but make sure you buy some glue to put them on.</li>
            <li>Either way, the eyelashes mixed with DUO adhesive worked great!</li>
            <li>I wore them again today to work and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>eyes\\&quot;... just something for days when I dress up more at work and want my eyes to look better.</li>
            <li>which is what I would care more about) and trust me...</li>
            <li>sure my wife love it.</li>
            <li>It may be awhile before I need some again:)</li>
            <li>I am in love with these lashes and when I run out I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li>Also you get more than one use out of them, and you get a lot of lashes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the lashes, but the \\&quot;glue\\</li>
            <li>but I LOVE these lashes</li>
            <li>Love the feel will reorder from again</li>
            <li>You have to bend the backing to make them more flexible.  </li>
            <li>I Love How It Make My Eyes Pop.</li>
            <li>I wad sceptical of buying these at first, but i made sure i read the reviews &amp; all seemed good.</li>
            <li>But anyway- they are easy to use, light weight, and form nicely with the shape of my lids.</li>
            <li>The lashes are long but they are not bulky and look great!</li>
            <li>super nice lashes.</li>
            <li>besides that everything is fine :)</li>
            <li>For people who put their lashes on top, they should be fine.</li>
            <li>c:  If you&#x27;re going to get this, BUY YOUR OWN GLUE FIRST!.</li>
            <li>After I tried to return my order that was not what I expected, they did their best to help me to fix the problems.</li>
            <li>lashes feel incredibly plasticy, they are a gross thickness, and add it&#x27;s soo not belieavble length</li>
            <li>I have to cut them just a bit for a custom fit and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but thats an easy fixing.</li>
            <li>Easy to re-use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and to remove.</li>
            <li>Removed easily too which is always a bonus for</li>
            <li>Lashes go on easily and stay on.  </li>
            <li>These lashes looked great in pictures, until I recieved them and realized that if I ever want to use them I will most definitely have to trim them.</li>
            <li>The packages they come in make it easy to slip into a suitcase or makeup bag without them getting destroyed.  </li>
            <li>i recomend this product and the lashes are strong so youcan reuse them like 5 times</li>
            <li>AMAZING and will absolutely repurchase!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR ITS PRICE AND WORKS BETTER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER EYELASHES</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have worn falsies daily and these lashes are perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Overall I think they are pretty good, it just depends on the eyelash, for example; some of the hair falls out and in others they look natural and perfect.</li>
            <li>They were a little longer then my eye, but I trimmed them and they worked perfect!!</li>
            <li>If done nicely some people don&#x27;t know if your really wearing lashes or not.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and are reuseable and a form to keep them in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it so, enjoy!</li>
            <li>These have flexibility and can be bent to fit the eye.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it, but the glue is a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Even though they are cheap...</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the cheap lashes you sometimes get that fall apart after one use.</li>
            <li>It is SO much more worth the money.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been the type to spend more than a dollar on a pair of eyelashes because to me it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how happy I am with these lashes.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering from this person and everytime was a great experience.</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and they wear well.</li>
            <li>it was on the cheap side</li>
            <li>This deserves a two-star because it&#x27;s really cheap quality</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t get a one-star because I knew it would be cheap stuff anyway.</li>
            <li>and I actually laughed out loud when I opened them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eyelashes must be cut to size to fit and work perfectly for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to search amazon instead of just going to the store because I wanted to be able to actually see which ones had good reviews.</li>
            <li>They STILL look good enough for one more use.</li>
            <li>but, i highly recommend buying your own glue seperate.</li>
            <li>And I was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light weight, long wear, easy to use, natural looking and an awesome value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The band desalve when you try to clean them..</li>
            <li>They seem too look really natural on my eyes :) shipping took forever though!</li>
            <li>First off,although it&#x27;s nice that they include glue with each individual pack of 2, I used my own glue.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>The glue is nothing special.</li>
            <li>These are a bit too natural unless you&#x27;re looking for that kind of look.</li>
            <li>These make my lashes look full.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for Halloween and have enjoyed them so much I wear them from time to time now.</li>
            <li>but I have to put full on mascara before these make a difference....</li>
            <li>Overall good though.</li>
            <li>but the line was more intense on some lash pairs than others.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for natural but more full lashes, trust me... get these!</li>
            <li>but i cut them to what i needed i new that from begining it is very hard to find these kind of lashes very happy with them</li>
            <li>As I said I Love Lashes as some women become older your lashes become thinner</li>
            <li>so I went for it and glad to say I&#x27;m not only satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more and highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
            <li>I just received these in the mail today and they look great nice for everyday use natural look but makes a big difference at the same time love them and by far the best lashes for the price!</li>
            <li>Great product and faster shipping then expected!!</li>
            <li>These work great if you cut them in half and use them as demi lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, i suggest buying some that cost more, so long as those do in fact look more</li>
            <li>Definitely synthetic feeling, but very nicely packaged and look decent on the eyes.</li>
            <li>But try the glue that comes with these first, since I haven&#x27;t yet!)</li>
            <li>I wanted to save some money and after reading the reviews on here I gave it a shot, and for only $3.99 for 20 lashes, sure why not!  </li>
            <li>the glue that comes with this is really cheap, and kind of dry.</li>
            <li>I feel that big, over the top lashes are OK for certain occasions,  but I prefer a more natural but</li>
            <li>Great for what you pay and not cheap whoreish looking lashes</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for someone that wants a cheap pair of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love them, even after putting mascara they look soft(no clumping) and lush.  </li>
            <li>Now I wish I didn&#x27;t get them wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get it, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I glue my lashes under my eyes for a more natural look, but these already come with glue on them, so everytime i close my eyes</li>
            <li>(Mine curl enough on their own</li>
            <li>ehhhh doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li>I assumed they would be &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; but the human hair kind.</li>
            <li>But i guess you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I use them daily, easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li>I literally have them on right now and can&#x27;t even feel them.  </li>
            <li>they said they would send me glue right away.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li>not plastic.these are much more comfortable realy to long</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great lashes for everyday use!</li>
            <li>the ones I usually  get, these ones are not that great.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes of my own.</li>
            <li>The babies are light weight and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>other than than I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>My solution was simple clip then into three parts and apply each section, &amp;#34;WOW WAS THAT EASY!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll add VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 16 year old grand daughter and she loves them, they look super natural on her.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item after reading other reviews which shouted out how great they were - how natural looking.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes look really good in their little box..</li>
            <li>but like most people we think it will b different this time...</li>
            <li>I only wish they had supplied more than one &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; tube of glue.</li>
            <li>I will be trying a different lash design but still bought more of these.</li>
            <li>This product had fast shipping and exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I actually really like these!</li>
            <li>The longer length in the middle gives the appearance of a more doll eye rather than a winged look.</li>
            <li>Love that they&#x27;re individually packaged and that it came with glue!</li>
            <li>I love having some extra lashes on hand to give to my friends.</li>
            <li>If you want to tug, itch, pull, and be so aware of you eyelashes while you&#x27;re trying to focus on a conversation with someone else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute style, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>that being said, i wouldn&#x27;t exactly wear this to my engineering job...</li>
            <li>I actually love them, was not liking that tiny glue</li>
            <li>they are pretty sticky but the problem is where is the glue?</li>
            <li>When I saw these, the first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s 4.5 star rating</li>
            <li>I tried these on for the first time yesterday morning</li>
            <li>yet since I wanted to try DUO first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture, which is what I like.</li>
            <li>You bet i&#x27;ll be ordering more when i run low on stock.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with these it is more than likely your inexperience with them and not the eyelashes themselves.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is my first amazon review.</li>
            <li>first of all it took over 3 weeks for my eyelashes to arrive.</li>
            <li>Right when i lifted the top box, i knew right away with the plastic reflection that the lashes would look not real.</li>
            <li>Other than that it seemed like everyone liked them.</li>
            <li>I cut about 3og the corner lashes and they fit great and looked gorgeous on (not big and fake) has a thicker band which I had to master keeping the inner corner on</li>
            <li>I do also wear them daily so for the price its better than buying mod lashes at 3/4$ a pair</li>
            <li>But overall there good lashes last all day.</li>
            <li>The lashes are spread far apart, which gives  a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>because all the positive reviews encouraged me.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me set things</li>
            <li>First of all, I received these sooo fast.</li>
            <li>that actually didn&#x27;t even stick anything, but other than that there are great.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect thickness to look realistic and natural, but with enough length to offer a little glamour.</li>
            <li>The company has contacted me and offered to correct the problem by sending a new product with the right items.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for these lashes before they arrived...</li>
            <li>The seller really is wanting people to use their product..</li>
            <li>These lashes were better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were much pointier - think the crown of the statue of liberty.</li>
            <li>So beware anyone who wants to buy these.</li>
            <li>CAUSE THEY BLEND IN WITH YOUR REAL LASHES</li>
            <li>They really make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li>so it really didn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely will continue using these.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these lashes to anyone who wants a wide-eyed look.  </li>
            <li>Came fast and I wear these all the time.</li>
            <li>the lashes are ok but all of the tubes of glue was empty.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very plastic-like</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these if you like them to look more natural.</li>
            <li>Just because something looks good doesn&#x27;t mean it is..</li>
            <li>Great product, natural look, you want more dramatic double them up!</li>
            <li>But they are decent if you just need eyelashes to fill in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>Very natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>In other words.. it was more of a compliment to me that people seemed to have assumed these were natural since no one looked at me funny when talking to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I get down to one box, I will order another two boxes to make sure I always have them on hand.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Amazon but thanks to this and another purchase</li>
            <li>Just make sure you coat your lashes with black mascara then curl them......</li>
            <li>Which was the main reason I purchased them.</li>
            <li>They are plastic lashes and you will not like them if you are looking for something realistic.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely order more later!!!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking , and because they are a synthetic fabric, they do not get out of shape!</li>
            <li>Would  highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you want to test drive wearing false lashes, you might need several tries to get it right and this multi pack is perfect.</li>
            <li>I did trim a little, but pleased.</li>
            <li>all the other people who are commenting about the glue and \\&quot;fake\\&quot; positive reviews: The glue that comes with is VERY small, but honestly, the lashes are already a SUPER bargain, so go out and buy some glue and have it ready when you get the lashes in the mail.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and real looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>People ask if they are my real lashes, I say no, and they always say \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Afterwards, rest the lash on your index finger and hold it with your thumb while using tweezers to gently pull the old glue from the lash.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I asked about the missing lashes I never received an answer there.</li>
            <li>I normally use Ardell lashes which can cost anywhere from from $3.59 to $4.99 a pop.</li>
            <li>However, wearing them for a second day is pretty much out of the question.</li>
            <li>Other than that the lashes look fine</li>
            <li>Other than that, I recommend this product, it came on time and was quick!</li>
            <li>can typically make one pair last one week... which is amazing.</li>
            <li>i tried other false lash bundles on amazon and this one is by far the best one i &#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li>these are pretty but they are hard and scratchy and don&#x27;t have much give in them, can&#x27;t wear them comfortably.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually use these yet but by looking at the material I would think it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>These are my new go-to lashes.</li>
            <li>I like theses they are very natural looking...</li>
            <li>They are very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I just recently purchased these, and I only got ten packages of them, which have 2 pairs</li>
            <li>English is not their first language)</li>
            <li>The &#x27;glue&#x27; that comes with them is one small tube that is more like rubber cement.</li>
            <li>The adhesive that&#x27;s designed to keep them on the plastic is actually enough to keep them on for their first wear believe it or not.</li>
            <li>You get what you paid for and it came early!</li>
            <li>I got #117 which is just some classic looking eyelashes, they are pretty long though.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes look natural and easy to work with, however there were little bottles of glue in each container but no glue in them.  </li>
            <li>so I went out of my way and bought my own glue just to find out there too thick!</li>
            <li>Although they had a very good rating, I was still skeptical because until now, to me, all false eyelashes were going to be a huge pain</li>
            <li>, I add a little more mascara to them after I put them on, &amp; they actually look pretty natural, &amp; they are really long.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on them.</li>
            <li>THEY ARENT NATURAL</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look real (like your regular lashes....</li>
            <li>They are very flexible/plyable (my personal opinion).  </li>
            <li>Long, pretty and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids completely.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this brand as they looked and feel natural on.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are NOT as natural looking as the photographs led me to believe.</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised and would 100% buy again when they run out</li>
            <li>I was going for the natural look...which I got...</li>
            <li>do not look natural at all.</li>
            <li>They look so natural, and i get complements all the time.</li>
            <li>They look SO natural</li>
            <li>So if you want natural falsies, then these might not be the ones for you.</li>
            <li>Spend a few extra bucks for better quality.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time with false lashes,my ordinarilly are long, but I singed one side.(lol)I love these, as they could definately pass for real lashes,</li>
            <li>The thick ones were better</li>
            <li>I bought these because I had damaged my eyelashes with other fake individual eyelashes and these were perfect!!!</li>
            <li>My major issue was the stark white line across the top of the lash band.</li>
            <li>However, I was not able to find my perfect fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Finally, this is a real review by a real person and there is nothing fake about me...except my lashes. :-)</li>
            <li>The glue is no good so order more from another merchant...</li>
            <li>They really are natural looking and last even after several washes.</li>
            <li>The backing is a little stiff, but these are so cute!</li>
            <li>They stay on all day, are comfortable, and with a little alcohol wash to remove the glue, I wear them several times before I dispose of them.</li>
            <li>They are long and full without looking like a drag queen....</li>
            <li>Place them back in the case and they are ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand how otehrs have deemed these worthy of everyday use.</li>
            <li>so I was a little skeptical at first if they would look good and stay on</li>
            <li>but i just cut the front a bit, also since the band is kind of thick, i just put gel liner ontop and they look awsome!!</li>
            <li>They are very cheaply made and very thick...</li>
            <li>first it took a little of the old \\&quot;bend and wiggle\\&quot; that we all do to relax the lash band.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that they took nearly a month to get here</li>
            <li>It is definitely better than some of the ones I bought in the past(the thin</li>
            <li>I could easily wear these alone with a pink gloss for a simple but finished look.(I&#x27;m medium complexion with dark brown eyes</li>
            <li>These find the right balance between being full but not being fake.</li>
            <li>I like more dramatic,  </li>
            <li>I noted previously that another reviewer recommended \\&quot;DUO\\&quot; Eyelash adhesive (in DARK not clear, supposedly it works better)</li>
            <li>However, they are extremely long - long to the point it makes wearing falsies very noticeable.</li>
            <li>afterwards i was surprised when I opened my package and found only ten pairs of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the lashes were a bit too long but can be easily fixed by trimming them.</li>

            <li> the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> but, when they came they were really nice.  </li>
            <li> but the lashes are nice</li>
            <li> So you have to buy your own.</li>
            <li> These are amazingly nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> used my own.</li>
            <li> so if you are Fair you may or may not be able to pull that off.)</li>
            <li> Hope this helps, stay gorgeous :)</li>
            <li> They have a nice curve to them.</li>
            <li> But I use my own glue anyways</li>
            <li> I bought my own eyelash glue even though each packet comes with some.</li>
            <li> but they are nice lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the quality of the glue that comes with them because I use my own glue that I already have.</li>
            <li> and I ended up buying my own eyelash glue for about $5.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad!:)</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t that great but other than that, everything is awesome.</li>
            <li> these lashes are great for photos, or just to wear for fun...</li>
            <li> It would be nice to protect your sales and make sure they get to their customers with a teaching number ....</li>
            <li> Once they were on though they were quite comfortable and looked good.  </li>
            <li> These eyelashes are the best so far i&#x27;ve seen on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how the lashes came in there own case.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use your own glue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply too!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but I loved them!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> these are super nice!</li>
            <li> these are great eyelashes and great for those beginers starting out with eyelashes.</li>
            <li> you barely tell that there spiky they blend in well! :D</li>
            <li> But this is a great company they immediately gave me a refund and was even to willingly send me replacements ...</li>
            <li> so I was pretty happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was quick and the product is good.</li>
            <li> They look more like lashes you would put on a doll.</li>
            <li> There are much better one on here.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> These lashes are OK but not anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> They are more spiky and criss crossed, not whispies as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Many people have complimented me on them.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because the glue is not the best</li>
            <li> No one could get a better deal on these lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these eyelashes for myself &amp; found them to be much better quality</li>
            <li> More glue would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> but I now am in love with these.</li>
            <li> The lashes sent were not the ones pictured, but were ok, and there was no glue.  </li>
            <li> The glue adhesive is okay,</li>
            <li> they are cheap!  </li>
            <li> They have apologized and agreed to send me a tracking number to make sure everything shows up this time.</li>
            <li> Most of my lids or bottoms were off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ecstatic! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The packeging was okay</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> applied them without eye makeup and they looked adorable.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price for 20 pairs!!! :-)</li>
            <li> but in this case, I got a lot more than what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love them for going out or weekends.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them but make sure you buy some glue to put them on.</li>
            <li> Either way, the eyelashes mixed with DUO adhesive worked great!</li>
            <li> I wore them again today to work and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> eyes\\&quot;... just something for days when I dress up more at work and want my eyes to look better.</li>
            <li> which is what I would care more about) and trust me...</li>
            <li> sure my wife love it.</li>
            <li> It may be awhile before I need some again:)</li>
            <li> I am in love with these lashes and when I run out I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Also you get more than one use out of them, and you get a lot of lashes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the lashes, but the \\&quot;glue\\</li>
            <li> but I LOVE these lashes</li>
            <li> Love the feel will reorder from again</li>
            <li> You have to bend the backing to make them more flexible.  </li>
            <li> I Love How It Make My Eyes Pop.</li>
            <li> I wad sceptical of buying these at first, but i made sure i read the reviews &amp; all seemed good.</li>
            <li> But anyway- they are easy to use, light weight, and form nicely with the shape of my lids.</li>
            <li> The lashes are long but they are not bulky and look great!</li>
            <li> super nice lashes.</li>
            <li> besides that everything is fine :)</li>
            <li> For people who put their lashes on top, they should be fine.</li>
            <li> c:  If you&#x27;re going to get this, BUY YOUR OWN GLUE FIRST!.</li>
            <li> After I tried to return my order that was not what I expected, they did their best to help me to fix the problems.</li>
            <li> lashes feel incredibly plasticy, they are a gross thickness, and add it&#x27;s soo not belieavble length</li>
            <li> I have to cut them just a bit for a custom fit and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> but thats an easy fixing.</li>
            <li> Easy to re-use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and to remove.</li>
            <li> Removed easily too which is always a bonus for</li>
            <li> Lashes go on easily and stay on.  </li>
            <li> These lashes looked great in pictures, until I recieved them and realized that if I ever want to use them I will most definitely have to trim them.</li>
            <li> The packages they come in make it easy to slip into a suitcase or makeup bag without them getting destroyed.  </li>
            <li> i recomend this product and the lashes are strong so youcan reuse them like 5 times</li>
            <li> AMAZING and will absolutely repurchase!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR ITS PRICE AND WORKS BETTER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER EYELASHES</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have worn falsies daily and these lashes are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Overall I think they are pretty good, it just depends on the eyelash, for example; some of the hair falls out and in others they look natural and perfect.</li>
            <li> They were a little longer then my eye, but I trimmed them and they worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> If done nicely some people don&#x27;t know if your really wearing lashes or not.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and are reuseable and a form to keep them in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it so, enjoy!</li>
            <li> These have flexibility and can be bent to fit the eye.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it, but the glue is a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Even though they are cheap...</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the cheap lashes you sometimes get that fall apart after one use.</li>
            <li> It is SO much more worth the money.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been the type to spend more than a dollar on a pair of eyelashes because to me it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how happy I am with these lashes.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from this person and everytime was a great experience.</li>
            <li> These are comfortable and they wear well.</li>
            <li> it was on the cheap side</li>
            <li> This deserves a two-star because it&#x27;s really cheap quality</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get a one-star because I knew it would be cheap stuff anyway.</li>
            <li> and I actually laughed out loud when I opened them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyelashes must be cut to size to fit and work perfectly for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to search amazon instead of just going to the store because I wanted to be able to actually see which ones had good reviews.</li>
            <li> They STILL look good enough for one more use.</li>
            <li> but, i highly recommend buying your own glue seperate.</li>
            <li> And I was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light weight, long wear, easy to use, natural looking and an awesome value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The band desalve when you try to clean them..</li>
            <li> They seem too look really natural on my eyes :) shipping took forever though!</li>
            <li> First off,although it&#x27;s nice that they include glue with each individual pack of 2, I used my own glue.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> The glue is nothing special.</li>
            <li> These are a bit too natural unless you&#x27;re looking for that kind of look.</li>
            <li> These make my lashes look full.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for Halloween and have enjoyed them so much I wear them from time to time now.</li>
            <li> but I have to put full on mascara before these make a difference....</li>
            <li> Overall good though.</li>
            <li> but the line was more intense on some lash pairs than others.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural but more full lashes, trust me... get these!</li>
            <li> but i cut them to what i needed i new that from begining it is very hard to find these kind of lashes very happy with them</li>
            <li> As I said I Love Lashes as some women become older your lashes become thinner</li>
            <li> so I went for it and glad to say I&#x27;m not only satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more and highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
            <li> I just received these in the mail today and they look great nice for everyday use natural look but makes a big difference at the same time love them and by far the best lashes for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product and faster shipping then expected!!</li>
            <li> These work great if you cut them in half and use them as demi lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please, i suggest buying some that cost more, so long as those do in fact look more</li>
            <li> Definitely synthetic feeling, but very nicely packaged and look decent on the eyes.</li>
            <li> But try the glue that comes with these first, since I haven&#x27;t yet!)</li>
            <li> I wanted to save some money and after reading the reviews on here I gave it a shot, and for only $3.99 for 20 lashes, sure why not!  </li>
            <li> the glue that comes with this is really cheap, and kind of dry.</li>
            <li> I feel that big, over the top lashes are OK for certain occasions,  but I prefer a more natural but</li>
            <li> Great for what you pay and not cheap whoreish looking lashes</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for someone that wants a cheap pair of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love them, even after putting mascara they look soft(no clumping) and lush.  </li>
            <li> Now I wish I didn&#x27;t get them wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get it, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I glue my lashes under my eyes for a more natural look, but these already come with glue on them, so everytime i close my eyes</li>
            <li> (Mine curl enough on their own</li>
            <li> ehhhh doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li> I assumed they would be &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; but the human hair kind.</li>
            <li> But i guess you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I use them daily, easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li> I literally have them on right now and can&#x27;t even feel them.  </li>
            <li> they said they would send me glue right away.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li> not plastic.these are much more comfortable realy to long</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great lashes for everyday use!</li>
            <li> the ones I usually  get, these ones are not that great.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes of my own.</li>
            <li> The babies are light weight and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> other than than I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> My solution was simple clip then into three parts and apply each section, &amp;#34;WOW WAS THAT EASY!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll add VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 16 year old grand daughter and she loves them, they look super natural on her.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading other reviews which shouted out how great they were - how natural looking.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look really good in their little box..</li>
            <li> but like most people we think it will b different this time...</li>
            <li> I only wish they had supplied more than one &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; tube of glue.</li>
            <li> I will be trying a different lash design but still bought more of these.</li>
            <li> This product had fast shipping and exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I actually really like these!</li>
            <li> The longer length in the middle gives the appearance of a more doll eye rather than a winged look.</li>
            <li> Love that they&#x27;re individually packaged and that it came with glue!</li>
            <li> I love having some extra lashes on hand to give to my friends.</li>
            <li> If you want to tug, itch, pull, and be so aware of you eyelashes while you&#x27;re trying to focus on a conversation with someone else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute style, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> that being said, i wouldn&#x27;t exactly wear this to my engineering job...</li>
            <li> I actually love them, was not liking that tiny glue</li>
            <li> they are pretty sticky but the problem is where is the glue?</li>
            <li> When I saw these, the first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s 4.5 star rating</li>
            <li> I tried these on for the first time yesterday morning</li>
            <li> yet since I wanted to try DUO first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> You bet i&#x27;ll be ordering more when i run low on stock.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with these it is more than likely your inexperience with them and not the eyelashes themselves.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review.</li>
            <li> first of all it took over 3 weeks for my eyelashes to arrive.</li>
            <li> Right when i lifted the top box, i knew right away with the plastic reflection that the lashes would look not real.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seemed like everyone liked them.</li>
            <li> I cut about 3og the corner lashes and they fit great and looked gorgeous on (not big and fake) has a thicker band which I had to master keeping the inner corner on</li>
            <li> I do also wear them daily so for the price its better than buying mod lashes at 3/4$ a pair</li>
            <li> But overall there good lashes last all day.</li>
            <li> The lashes are spread far apart, which gives  a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> because all the positive reviews encouraged me.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me set things</li>
            <li> First of all, I received these sooo fast.</li>
            <li> that actually didn&#x27;t even stick anything, but other than that there are great.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect thickness to look realistic and natural, but with enough length to offer a little glamour.</li>
            <li> The company has contacted me and offered to correct the problem by sending a new product with the right items.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for these lashes before they arrived...</li>
            <li> The seller really is wanting people to use their product..</li>
            <li> These lashes were better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were much pointier - think the crown of the statue of liberty.</li>
            <li> So beware anyone who wants to buy these.</li>
            <li> CAUSE THEY BLEND IN WITH YOUR REAL LASHES</li>
            <li> They really make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> so it really didn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely will continue using these.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these lashes to anyone who wants a wide-eyed look.  </li>
            <li> Came fast and I wear these all the time.</li>
            <li> the lashes are ok but all of the tubes of glue was empty.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very plastic-like</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these if you like them to look more natural.</li>
            <li> Just because something looks good doesn&#x27;t mean it is..</li>
            <li> Great product, natural look, you want more dramatic double them up!</li>
            <li> But they are decent if you just need eyelashes to fill in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> Very natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> In other words.. it was more of a compliment to me that people seemed to have assumed these were natural since no one looked at me funny when talking to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I get down to one box, I will order another two boxes to make sure I always have them on hand.  </li>
            <li> I am new to Amazon but thanks to this and another purchase</li>
            <li> Just make sure you coat your lashes with black mascara then curl them......</li>
            <li> Which was the main reason I purchased them.</li>
            <li> They are plastic lashes and you will not like them if you are looking for something realistic.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely order more later!!!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking , and because they are a synthetic fabric, they do not get out of shape!</li>
            <li> Would  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you want to test drive wearing false lashes, you might need several tries to get it right and this multi pack is perfect.</li>
            <li> I did trim a little, but pleased.</li>
            <li> all the other people who are commenting about the glue and \\&quot;fake\\&quot; positive reviews: The glue that comes with is VERY small, but honestly, the lashes are already a SUPER bargain, so go out and buy some glue and have it ready when you get the lashes in the mail.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and real looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> People ask if they are my real lashes, I say no, and they always say \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Afterwards, rest the lash on your index finger and hold it with your thumb while using tweezers to gently pull the old glue from the lash.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times I asked about the missing lashes I never received an answer there.</li>
            <li> I normally use Ardell lashes which can cost anywhere from from $3.59 to $4.99 a pop.</li>
            <li> However, wearing them for a second day is pretty much out of the question.</li>
            <li> Other than that the lashes look fine</li>
            <li> Other than that, I recommend this product, it came on time and was quick!</li>
            <li> can typically make one pair last one week... which is amazing.</li>
            <li> i tried other false lash bundles on amazon and this one is by far the best one i &#x27;ve come across!</li>
            <li> these are pretty but they are hard and scratchy and don&#x27;t have much give in them, can&#x27;t wear them comfortably.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually use these yet but by looking at the material I would think it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> These are my new go-to lashes.</li>
            <li> I like theses they are very natural looking...</li>
            <li> They are very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I just recently purchased these, and I only got ten packages of them, which have 2 pairs</li>
            <li> English is not their first language)</li>
            <li> The &#x27;glue&#x27; that comes with them is one small tube that is more like rubber cement.</li>
            <li> The adhesive that&#x27;s designed to keep them on the plastic is actually enough to keep them on for their first wear believe it or not.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for and it came early!</li>
            <li> I got #117 which is just some classic looking eyelashes, they are pretty long though.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes look natural and easy to work with, however there were little bottles of glue in each container but no glue in them.  </li>
            <li> so I went out of my way and bought my own glue just to find out there too thick!</li>
            <li> Although they had a very good rating, I was still skeptical because until now, to me, all false eyelashes were going to be a huge pain</li>
            <li> , I add a little more mascara to them after I put them on, &amp; they actually look pretty natural, &amp; they are really long.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on them.</li>
            <li> THEY ARENT NATURAL</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look real (like your regular lashes....</li>
            <li> They are very flexible/plyable (my personal opinion).  </li>
            <li> Long, pretty and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids completely.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this brand as they looked and feel natural on.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are NOT as natural looking as the photographs led me to believe.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised and would 100% buy again when they run out</li>
            <li> I was going for the natural look...which I got...</li>
            <li> do not look natural at all.</li>
            <li> They look so natural, and i get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> They look SO natural</li>
            <li> So if you want natural falsies, then these might not be the ones for you.</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra bucks for better quality.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time with false lashes,my ordinarilly are long, but I singed one side.(lol)I love these, as they could definately pass for real lashes,</li>
            <li> The thick ones were better</li>
            <li> I bought these because I had damaged my eyelashes with other fake individual eyelashes and these were perfect!!!</li>
            <li> My major issue was the stark white line across the top of the lash band.</li>
            <li> However, I was not able to find my perfect fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Finally, this is a real review by a real person and there is nothing fake about me...except my lashes. :-)</li>
            <li> The glue is no good so order more from another merchant...</li>
            <li> They really are natural looking and last even after several washes.</li>
            <li> The backing is a little stiff, but these are so cute!</li>
            <li> They stay on all day, are comfortable, and with a little alcohol wash to remove the glue, I wear them several times before I dispose of them.</li>
            <li> They are long and full without looking like a drag queen....</li>
            <li> Place them back in the case and they are ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand how otehrs have deemed these worthy of everyday use.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical at first if they would look good and stay on</li>
            <li> but i just cut the front a bit, also since the band is kind of thick, i just put gel liner ontop and they look awsome!!</li>
            <li> They are very cheaply made and very thick...</li>
            <li> first it took a little of the old \\&quot;bend and wiggle\\&quot; that we all do to relax the lash band.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that they took nearly a month to get here</li>
            <li> It is definitely better than some of the ones I bought in the past(the thin</li>
            <li> I could easily wear these alone with a pink gloss for a simple but finished look.(I&#x27;m medium complexion with dark brown eyes</li>
            <li> These find the right balance between being full but not being fake.</li>
            <li> I like more dramatic,  </li>
            <li> I noted previously that another reviewer recommended \\&quot;DUO\\&quot; Eyelash adhesive (in DARK not clear, supposedly it works better)</li>
            <li> However, they are extremely long - long to the point it makes wearing falsies very noticeable.</li>
            <li> afterwards i was surprised when I opened my package and found only ten pairs of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the lashes were a bit too long but can be easily fixed by trimming them.</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes every day, and when these arrived , I thought I would hate them because they are very plastic feeling, but they actually look great on!</li>
            <li> (i had to cut down which is normal for me).  </li>
            <li> Okay ladies (and gents), I must first tell you that I almost RARELY use false eyelashes because the few times I&#x27;ve tried to put them on, it turns into a tedious disaster.  </li>
            <li> absolutely recommend these for everyday!</li>
            <li> These have really long lashes alternating with short ones.</li>
            <li> These are long enough to cut to the size you want.  </li>
            <li> It is not too soft or too hard, it looks natural as well.</li>
            <li> (Although I swear by iENVY Professional [by Kiss] strip eyelash adhesive in jet black.)</li>
            <li> Each box contained a single pair, not double pairs.</li>
            <li> I went round and round with them trying to get the right order😠</li>
            <li> poor quality and its super long</li>
            <li> Looking cheap and fake.</li>
            <li> Cheap material look to fake</li>
            <li> I was sitting at my friend&#x27;s table late into the morning when I began peeling my eyelashes off getting ready for bed as we sipped on some tea.</li>
            <li> so long I USE THEM FOR DANCE COMPETITIONS</li>
            <li> My lashes are medium and not to long.</li>
            <li> They was a different design nothing like what I expected.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> They also didn&#x27;t appear to be so long in the photos, I can&#x27;t wear these even if the glue would hold, they are way too long.</li>
            <li> Quite long lashes and plenty of eye length</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are definitely thicker than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Some might think they are too long, but not for my taste.</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a long time (about a month), but for the rock-bottom price of about 25 cents per pair, I don&#x27;t mind planning ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not even putty material... &amp;&amp; the glue was only a drop in the tip the rest of the bullet was Empty??</li>
            <li> The lashes are also really long</li>
            <li> However, they r way to stiff to put on and look natural..</li>
            <li> And the glue well the little tiny tube of glue wasn&#x27;t enough to put on</li>
            <li> So order long before you run out!</li>
            <li> and they were straight not curved on plastic like in the pic and not as full :(</li>
            <li> Normally I pay at least 4-8 dollars for 1-2 pairs.</li>
            <li> i opened them and saw they where kind of spiky and unnatural looking :(</li>
            <li> These are my first pair of false lashes.</li>
            <li> Noticeably gorgeous on, but not too dramatic or fake looking.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because most inexpensive lashes are plastic, with a big black strip and very uncomfortable; HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised after trying on these lashes!  </li>
            <li> I typically will wear a winged lash for a smokey eye, but these will work too as I then applied makeup to further test the look.</li>
            <li> Once I get them on they dont look super fake.</li>
            <li> how&#x27;d you put them on, how long were you wearing them?&amp;#34; Needless to say we did not go to bed right then &amp; then as I stayed up teaching her how to apply these</li>
            <li> I love the style these lashes are, not too subtle, not too dramatic.</li>
            <li> and the quality isn&#x27;t bad, the eyelashes don&#x27;t bend and are not at flexible to fitting my eyelid as I had hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> I am so upset that I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;Enticing price, great reviews, but terrible quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not believe I have spent approx $4.00 for lashes.</li>
            <li> And it comes with glue, but the plastic tube is just empty.</li>
            <li> Just be careful in how you remove them from the package because they can come apart.</li>
            <li> All of them are empty.  </li>
            <li> The only con to these, is all the glue that it comes with is dried out.</li>
            <li> lashes however were well packaged, sealed and kept in place by their packaging, so there were no mashed, crushed, or bent</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look \\&quot;drag queenish\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The lashes came on time but they were not what I expected they came in one box</li>
            <li> But at this price thats really not an issue.</li>
            <li> I just have to be careful of what I search for.</li>
            <li> you people need to b honest when u r selling this crap..</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t really bother me at all as I don&#x27;t need a curler/heated curler when I apply false lashes.</li>
            <li> i would cut one lash in half and wear them as half lashes since theyre the same length on both sides</li>
            <li> but I found applying as close as you can get to the lash line and sliding them down when the glue is almost dry.</li>
            <li> they are a little long</li>
            <li> they are a little long</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to use the other one.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and look very fake.</li>
            <li> Other than the plastic feel and no glue....</li>
            <li> Normally don&#x27;t wear false lashes...</li>
            <li> They r shaped and so long u can cut them in half and use one twice!</li>
            <li> I did have to cut the end off JUST a smidge because they were a little too wide for my eye</li>
            <li> do not use the glue that is uncluded, I use a Duo lash glue in the dark tint.</li>
            <li> only complaint maybe would be the packaging and the glue.</li>
            <li> Not your average drag-queen falsies.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting or hoping that people in my office would say how much prettier my eyes looked today, but I WAS hoping that they wouldn&#x27;t notice that they were fake.</li>
            <li> I ordered these a few weeks ago and finally put them to the test this past weekend for my trip to Reno.</li>
            <li> THEY DONT LOOK LIKE THOSE 0.50 CENTS ONES THAT ARE SO BIG AND THICK</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick enough to hold adhesive.</li>
            <li> I actually had no problem with the look of the lashes or even the thick band.</li>
            <li> other than those few things</li>
            <li> It is hard to cover and you will need eyeliner and it can actually get messy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something natural and not too dramatic, this is it.</li>
            <li> much less 20...</li>
            <li> -in-all, I highly believe the 5-star reveiws were paid for or fake.</li>
            <li> These definitely are NOT good quality.</li>
            <li> this says that it comes with glue but the ones i got didnt there was a little black tube</li>
            <li> but I am needing a little help understanding how to use these lil black glue bullets?</li>
            <li> that is supposed to come with it,um there was none in any of the little black tubes!!!!So</li>
            <li> almost destroyed the lashes despite how careful I was and how stiff they were) they looked like something that belonged on a mannequin!</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to get them</li>
            <li> texture of the lash itself is a little \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot;,(my reason for 4 stars)</li>
            <li> The box might be a little damaged but it was bubble wrapped well.</li>
            <li> and I noticed they pulled up a little.</li>
            <li> and there are these little tubes that it comes with</li>
            <li> I was trying for a pair of lashes a little thicker then</li>
            <li> The little ridge/band helps make the application process easier.</li>
            <li> If not, I suggest something a little easier.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why others think they are so plasticky, but a few of the heavier lashes did have that plastic shine....</li>
            <li> The ones I picked have few lashes with spikes.</li>
            <li> Plastic un-natural looking and the glue was dried up.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> still having trouble putting them on, must be a learning curve.</li>
            <li> They seem like they will hold up for a few wearings.</li>
            <li> Delivery took a few weeks.</li>
            <li> glue tubes are all dried out, just discard those.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing eyelashes everyday for over 2 years</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected and the line is too thick...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> and then possibly a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friends couldn&#x27;t tell they were fake and that it looked natural</li>
            <li> Glue was all dried up.</li>
            <li> Received the item but it was not what I purchased, waste of money</li>
            <li> A waste.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd attempt at false eyelashes.. need help?</li>
            <li> The glue on the strip is a little thick, I ended up pulling it all off and using the glue I use on all my other lashes.</li>
            <li> The band is firm but not too stiff and it&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are definitely meant for dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I expected and they looked long and fake in yhe package.</li>
            <li> I have been scared to get them before thinking they would look super fake but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> They do come with this poor excuse of glue</li>
            <li> The band is a little thick</li>
            <li> I ordered HR 117 and can&#x27;t seem to get that same order of thick, black and re-usable very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with my order</li>
            <li> Which is absolutely pointless.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the lashes look absolutely fake and plastic.</li>
            <li> They wasn&#x27;t like the pictures, not really pleased, but used them</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> the only way to get them is by buying fake ones.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> These things usually cost )5 per pair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was on eveyone&#x27;s order</li>
            <li> If your a regular user of fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> I like my false lashes to be exaggerated but lush and volumous - these were not.</li>
            <li> Those who do not care if whether they look fake or not, then i would say that the lashes are really long and need to be trimmed to the size of your eye.</li>
            <li> How can you not love 20 pair of false eyelashes, with glue, for less than 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> Not at all hard to apply</li>
            <li> Hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I cut off the tip of one and the glue was hard?</li>
            <li> I gave this product a one star rating because it was three months late</li>
            <li> It absolutley sucks.</li>
            <li> &quot; it comes with is just a fake bottle that is completely empty.</li>
            <li> Thick band.</li>
            <li> STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SMALL STUFF!</li>
            <li> The band on these lashes were very stiff (it worked for me because I&#x27;m not good at applying lashes.....</li>
            <li> They arent crazy long or thick.</li>
            <li> These were tough to put on because they are very stiff.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to apply</li>
            <li> these lashes have very thick tracks and the individual lashes look very fake.</li>
            <li> some are thick some are thin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear it at all and also it&#x27;s very hard</li>
            <li> absolutely unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as irritating as some falsies.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE ALSO THIN</li>
            <li> The strip isn&#x27;t so thick that it looks fake</li>
            <li> Poor quality product and lies.  </li>
            <li> I lost 2 pairs of false lashes.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything dramatic or for \\&quot;evening</li>
            <li> Theyre not too dramatic and can be used for every day wear</li>
            <li> very thick, extremely fake.</li>
            <li> I was WAITING to see it on someone&#x27;s face that my eyes looked random and dramatic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use fake eyelashes myself, but I bought these for a friend at her request and she did not like them at all.</li>
            <li> Fake doll looking eyelashes.</li>
            <li> ; she took my face into her hands and looked at me face for a bit, &amp;#34;I had NO idea you were wearing fake lashes, do they hurt,</li>
            <li> it looks really fake ..</li>
            <li> The glue that come with which is why I purchased was completely fake along with the reviews.  </li>
            <li> not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that</li>
            <li> BUT I will note that no one seems to notice that they are fake or weird looking (</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look so fake.</li>
            <li> I get sick of this farce advertising..</li>
            <li> That was disappointing; I had to go an purchase glue.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use fake eyelashes myself, but I bought these for a friend at her request and she did not like them at all. She sold them the next day.</li>
            <li> There was glue all over the eye lashes. Some of the lash were bent. Looks nothing like a eye lash a person would wear. They look more like lashes you would put on a doll. Do NOT waste your money on them. There are much better one on here.</li>
            <li> I can not believe I have spent approx $4.00 for lashes. I have purchased the same style I wear. Now I can wear all the time.  They are so soft and real looking.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why others think they are so plasticky, but a few of the heavier lashes did have that plastic shine....BUT I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT THERE REASONING IS.  The ones I picked have few lashes with spikes. If done nicely some people don&#x27;t know if your really wearing lashes or not.  Just make sure you coat your lashes with black mascara then curl them......now put on your lashes.  I don&#x27;t think I remember seeing any glue, but I don&#x27;t use that crappy glue any way.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is great but I prefer longer lashes. These are a bit too natural unless you&#x27;re looking for that kind of look.</li>
            <li> Looking cheap and fake. I didn&#x27;t wear it at all and also it&#x27;s very hard</li>
            <li> I gave this product a one star rating because it was three months late and it was badly damaged when it arrived at my house. I lost 2 pairs of false lashes. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As I said I Love Lashes as some women become older your lashes become thinner, I&#x27;m just happy lashes are made</li>
            <li> I love them but i only dislike one thing is that they come with glue, but besides that everything is fine :)</li>
            <li> great lashes so long I USE THEM FOR DANCE COMPETITIONS THEY ARE GR8! GET THESE! THEY DONT LOOK LIKE THOSE 0.50 CENTS ONES THAT ARE SO BIG AND THICK THEY ARENT NATURAL BUT THEY REALLY SHINE ON STAGE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These lashes are OK but not anything like the picture. They are more spiky and criss crossed, not whispies as I was expecting. Definitely synthetic feeling, but very nicely packaged and look decent on the eyes.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to get them but, when they came they were really nice.  I could not believe the quality of then and would definetely order again.  I have three granddaughters and they all wear them for the proms and dances. Would  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The pic shows the individual lashes. The ones I rec&#x27;d were criss-cross. Not what I ordered and not what I want. Don&#x27;t look real (like your regular lashes....don&#x27;t know anyone with criss-cross lashes). Disappointed. Wedge not flimsy (looks as though it can endure a wear or two). Just not the lash in the pictures online.</li>
            <li> If your into falsies or if you&#x27;re a newbie here is your start... I love them, even after putting mascara they look soft(no clumping) and lush.  They are easy to clean and are reuseable and a form to keep them in.  They are very flexible/plyable (my personal opinion).  It&#x27;s worth it so, enjoy!</li>
            <li> These are my first pair of false lashes. I have been scared to get them before thinking they would look super fake but boy was I wrong. These make my lashes look full. Many people have complimented me on them. My lashes are medium and not to long. I got these because I have 2 gaps in my lashes which annoys me because I always have to make my mascara brush go in the area to fill it. These were just the trick to my problem. :) I only gave it 4 stars because the glue is not the best but thats an easy fixing. I would reccomend it to all of you!</li>
            <li> Great product and faster shipping then expected!! Great deal toooo A+ for sure. No one could get a better deal on these lashes. They are just like the ones you get for only one pair at walmart for 4.97!!!</li>
            <li> It said it came with glue .. However it did not. Not pleased with my order but the lashes are nice</li>
            <li> I purchased these eyelashes for myself &amp; found them to be much better quality then the eyelashes I have purchased at any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look really good in their little box.. They even feel good.. However, they r way to stiff to put on and look natural.. The price should tell u that but like most people we think it will b different this time... The seller really is wanting people to use their product.. So we fall for the price...Not me, not again.. I get sick of this farce advertising.. I get sick of this crap.. And the glue well the little tiny tube of glue wasn&#x27;t enough to put on one lash much less 20...&lt;br /&gt;So you people need to b honest when u r selling this crap.. Just because something looks good doesn&#x27;t mean it is.. Take these lashes for example .. THEY R CRAP..</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but I loved them! Great product, natural look, you want more dramatic double them up! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I like these.  Long, pretty and inexpensive.  Very happy and would surely order again.  No problems in packaging.  Pasticy, yes, but not a problem.  Very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They was a different design nothing like what I expected. Now I wish I didn&#x27;t get them wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! Normally don&#x27;t wear false lashes...I have long lashes of my own. I ordered these for Halloween and have enjoyed them so much I wear them from time to time now. The glue is no good so order more from another merchant...</li>
            <li> After I tried to return my order that was not what I expected, they did their best to help me to fix the problems. I appreciate them.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for these lashes before they arrived...these lashes are great for photos, or just to wear for fun...but i will probably purchase drug store lashes from here on out. these lashes have very thick tracks and the individual lashes look very fake.</li>
            <li> I try out different eyelashes from different company on Amazon. However, I was not able to find my perfect fake eyelashes. These eyelashes are perfect. It is not too soft or too hard, it looks natural as well. These are great deal for this price. I will purchase these eyelashes again!  If you are looking for eyelashes for clubbing or going out, you might not like these. I recommend these for daily use.</li>
            <li> These definitely are NOT good quality. I ordered HR 117 and can&#x27;t seem to get that same order of thick, black and re-usable very frustrating.  I went round and round with them trying to get the right order😠</li>
            <li> The thick ones were better</li>
            <li> these are pretty but they are hard and scratchy and don&#x27;t have much give in them, can&#x27;t wear them comfortably.</li>
            <li> Easy to re-use. These have flexibility and can be bent to fit the eye. They aren&#x27;t as irritating as some falsies. Hit them with some mascara then go!</li>
            <li> These lashes were better than I expected.  I only wish they had supplied more than one &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34; tube of glue. More glue would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. They stay on all day, are comfortable, and with a little alcohol wash to remove the glue, I wear them several times before I dispose of them.</li>
            <li> The glue is horrible. It wouldn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids completely. Such a piss off, to have to deal with.</li>
            <li> Okay so I just recently purchased these, and I only got ten packages of them, which have 2 pairs each.when I ordered 20.  And it comes with glue, but the plastic tube is just empty. So you have to buy your own. Other than that the lashes look fine but are NOT what they look like in the picture. They seem too look really natural on my eyes :) shipping took forever though!</li>
            <li> So they were not wat I expected and they looked long and fake in yhe package. I cut about 3og the corner lashes and they fit great and looked gorgeous on (not big and fake) has a thicker band which I had to master keeping the inner corner on but I now am in love with these. I will be trying a different lash design but still bought more of these. I do also wear them daily so for the price its better than buying mod lashes at 3/4$ a pair</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product. They were a little longer then my eye, but I trimmed them and they worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> i hated the! these lashes sucked and there was nothing in the glue container so I went out of my way and bought my own glue just to find out there too thick! I regret buying them!</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes every day and these are perfect! They beat spending $5.00 per pair and they are just as good. I sleep in them and MOST days they are still one in the morning, lol. Everyone always ask where I get my lashes done. I always send this link.</li>
            <li> Plastic eyelashes. They&#x27;re all different sizes. Can&#x27;t curl them. They don&#x27;t stay on for a long time. Would recommend for costume wear but not every-day wear.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these lashes! Each set has its own glue, the lashes are a great quality and I would recommend them!</li>
            <li> The lashes sent were not the ones pictured, but were ok, and there was no glue.  Was refunded $2 to cover the glue.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this brand as they looked and feel natural on.  The price is unbeatable.  I would have given it 5 stars but I wish it was thicker.  If there was a thicker version of this brand, seller please email me the item number and I will definitely order.  I cannot leave home without my falsies!!!</li>
            <li> I received my lashes just yesterday and I actually laughed out loud when I opened them. These lashes are NOT as natural looking as the photographs led me to believe. My lashes were much pointier - think the crown of the statue of liberty. I like my false lashes to be exaggerated but lush and volumous - these were not. Beware the pictures are a bit misleading!!</li>
            <li> The glue adhesive is okay, some are thick some are thin. Overall I think they are pretty good, it just depends on the eyelash, for example; some of the hair falls out and in others they look natural and perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I had damaged my eyelashes with other fake individual eyelashes and these were perfect!!! Easy to apply and to remove. I&#x27;ve never used the adhesive that came with it. I still have tons of these left over because you can reuse them. Just be careful in how you remove them from the package because they can come apart.</li>
            <li> Mkay. So I bought this months ago. And I was excited to use it. Good price and what-not. I tried to use it, but the glue is a cheap product. It absolutley sucks. 2 stars for allot of eyelashes. 1 star for shipping. c:  If you&#x27;re going to get this, BUY YOUR OWN GLUE FIRST!.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually use these yet but by looking at the material I would think it&#x27;s pretty decent. It is definitely better than some of the ones I bought in the past(the thin flimsy)&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I rated 4 stars because of the delivery speed. Though it said it would come feb 14-mar 2, it came before jan 31st and I ordered it on jan 17(:</li>
            <li> The glue on the strip is a little thick, I ended up pulling it all off and using the glue I use on all my other lashes. A little difficult to apply but I found applying as close as you can get to the lash line and sliding them down when the glue is almost dry. Great for what you pay and not cheap whoreish looking lashes</li>
            <li> Plastic un-natural looking and the glue was dried up.  Even though they are cheap...the reason is ...they are cheap!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because most inexpensive lashes are plastic, with a big black strip and very uncomfortable; HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised after trying on these lashes!  I literally have them on right now and can&#x27;t even feel them.  Although they are plastic, I would compare the feel of them to Red Cherry!  AMAZING and will absolutely repurchase!</li>
            <li> The company has contacted me and offered to correct the problem by sending a new product with the right items. They have apologized and agreed to send me a tracking number to make sure everything shows up this time. I will let you know and edit my review if it is all fixed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received these in took them out of the package(which almost destroyed the lashes despite how careful I was and how stiff they were) they looked like something that belonged on a mannequin! They were nothing like the description in a can in a totally different box then was pictured. I also never received any glue. The final slap in the face was instead of getting 20 lashes I received 19! I emailed the company and from what I can tell (it was very obvious English is not their first language) they said they would send me glue right away. no matter how many times I asked about the missing lashes I never received an answer there. I am a bit nervous because I read the ratings after my purchase and something tells me even if I get my glue it is going to be horrible. I am new to Amazon but thanks to this and another purchase I will always read the reviews before I make a purchase here again. So beware anyone who wants to buy these. They even showed up in a different package dan is pictured here. They are a total rip off!</li>
            <li> The glue doesn&#x27;t hold the lashes.  They also didn&#x27;t appear to be so long in the photos, I can&#x27;t wear these even if the glue would hold, they are way too long.</li>
            <li> I like theses they are very natural looking...</li>
            <li> This product had fast shipping and exceeded my expectations! I received 20 sets of 2 lashes, meaning I actually got 40 pairs of eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Cheap material look to fake</li>
            <li> Packaging is horrible. Most of my lids or bottoms were off so I had to put it together. This was used as a misc item for a bachelorette party, so it did the job.</li>
            <li> Not the eyelashes in the picture at all. Thick band. No glue included. Fake doll looking eyelashes.</li>
            <li> OMG. I&#x27;m so ordering these again! I would&#x27;ve gave it another star if the band was thinner, but the length and thickness of the lashes is perfect. And, the packaging is awesome. Took a while to get it, but worth the wait. I&#x27;m ecstatic! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These are amazingly nice for the price.  I was so pleasantly surprised and would 100% buy again when they run out</li>
            <li> Impressed with how many come in the package but when I put them on I wanted them to look fuller. I was going for the natural look...which I got...but I have to put full on mascara before these make a difference....</li>
            <li> I wad sceptical of buying these at first, but i made sure i read the reviews &amp; all seemed good. I bought these for my 16 year old grand daughter and she loves them, they look super natural on her. All and all they look great. Now they are double banded just thought id let you knoe... and they do not come with glue. They do come with this poor excuse of glue but, i highly recommend buying your own glue seperate. The packeging was okay but the shipping took forever it was so rediculous.. other than those few things these are great eyelashes and great for those beginers starting out with eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even get a star ... I never received my package after waiting two months just for them to ship it ... It would be nice to protect your sales and make sure they get to their customers with a teaching number .... But this is a great company they immediately gave me a refund and was even to willingly send me replacements ... I ended up buying my lashes else where tho</li>
            <li> absolutely unbelievable!! given them to all my girlfriends too. Not only that, I don&#x27;t know what they r made of but u can soak them and use them over and over! They r shaped and so long u can cut them in half and use one twice! Love the ridge for the adhesive! Best value on the market!</li>
            <li> I like these lashes. Once I get them on they dont look super fake. They arent crazy long or thick. The &#x27;glue&#x27; that comes with them is one small tube that is more like rubber cement. Overall good though.</li>
            <li> these are super nice! I didn&#x27;t expect such quality</li>
            <li> still having trouble putting them on, must be a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I actually really like these! I wear false eyelashes every day, and when these arrived , I thought I would hate them because they are very plastic feeling, but they actually look great on! Very natural looking , and because they are a synthetic fabric, they do not get out of shape! One pair lasts for weeks, because they hold there shape so well! I have already ordered another box! I am set for about a year now .  I didn&#x27;t want to try the glue it came with, ( didn&#x27;t trust glue from china) used my own. I recommend !</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading other reviews which shouted out how great they were - how natural looking. Hah! They are very cheaply made and very thick...do not look natural at all.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these lashes. I was used to the drug store brands for 3x the price of these. I&#x27;m ordering more and highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
            <li> If you know how to put on lashes these are great they are not too big so you can use them  on a daily basis.... they are a little long but i just cut the front a bit, also since the band is kind of thick, i just put gel liner ontop and they look awsome!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM CAUSE THEY BLEND IN WITH YOUR REAL LASHES AND THEY ARE ALSO THIN WERE YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN TELL THAT THEY ARE ON IT IS LIKE YOU ARE WEARING NOTHING</li>
            <li> Did not look nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> How can you not love 20 pair of false eyelashes, with glue, for less than 10 bucks! Perfect for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; like me. If you want to test drive wearing false lashes, you might need several tries to get it right and this multi pack is perfect.</li>
            <li> this says that it comes with glue but the ones i got didnt there was a little black tube i every eyelash container that i guess there was supposed to be glue in out of 10 tubes not one of them had glue i was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Without a doupt I will purchase these lashes again! for the quality and QUANTITY that your getting these lashes are great.</li>
            <li> they are what i was looking for lashes that are threaded with thread not plastic.these are much more comfortable realy to long but i cut them to what i needed i new that from begining it is very hard to find these kind of lashes very happy with them</li>
            <li> Got these yesterday and gave &#x27;em a test drive to see how they held up.First off,although it&#x27;s nice that they include glue with each individual pack of 2, I used my own glue.&lt;br /&gt;At first it took a little of the old \\&quot;bend and wiggle\\&quot; that we all do to relax the lash band.The lashes are longer towards the middle so it was easy to see where the best fit would be.Not at all hard to apply but you do need sufficient glue for these especially in the corners.The band is firm but not too stiff and it&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I applied them without eye makeup and they looked adorable.I could easily wear these alone with a pink gloss for a simple but finished look.(I&#x27;m medium complexion with dark brown eyes so if you are Fair you may or may not be able to pull that off.) The longer length in the middle gives the appearance of a more doll eye rather than a winged look.I typically will wear a winged lash for a smokey eye, but these will work too as I then applied makeup to further test the look.I just don&#x27;t think it will enhance the cat eye shape of a smoked out eye look.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the lash itself is a little \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot;,(my reason for 4 stars) but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get over. They are synthetic after all, so give that some consideration.They do hold mascara well btw.I wore them for about 5 hours and they held up without budging.Removed easily too which is always a bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;So yes,I would recommend these lashes.They&#x27;re pretty,comfortable and the price is amazing.Hope this helps, stay gorgeous :)</li>
            <li> I love the style these lashes are, not too subtle, not too dramatic. Love that they&#x27;re individually packaged and that it came with glue!</li>
            <li> Why oh why did I buy these lashes?!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, that&#x27;s right...because all the positive reviews encouraged me.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me set things straight.&lt;br /&gt;These lashes feel incredibly plasticy, they are a gross thickness, and add it&#x27;s soo not belieavble length and we&#x27;ve got a horrible mess.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how otehrs have deemed these worthy of everyday use. I am so upset that I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;Enticing price, great reviews, but terrible quality.&lt;br /&gt;Please, i suggest buying some that cost more, so long as those do in fact look more realistic!&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I highly believe the 5-star reveiws were paid for or fake.</li>
            <li> Great lashes for everyday use! Cannot beat the price for 20 pairs!!! :-)</li>
            <li> It did not look like the picture at all</li>
            <li> I thought that the Lashes was going to come with adhesive already applied bit they didn&#x27;t do I end up purchasing additional glue</li>
            <li> super nice lashes. Glue doesn&#x27;t work, but had my own glue, still works great! so many pairs, it&#x27;s great use over again or not.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes look natural and easy to work with, however there were little bottles of glue in each container but no glue in them.  All of them are empty.  That was disappointing; I had to go an purchase glue.</li>
            <li> I glue my lashes under my eyes for a more natural look, but these already come with glue on them, so everytime i close my eyes my lids stick together. For people who put their lashes on top, they should be fine.</li>
            <li> These are great eyelashes. The adhesive that&#x27;s designed to keep them on the plastic is actually enough to keep them on for their first wear believe it or not. These find the right balance between being full but not being fake. (Although I swear by iENVY Professional [by Kiss] strip eyelash adhesive in jet black.) These aren&#x27;t the cheap lashes you sometimes get that fall apart after one use. They seem like they will hold up for a few wearings. They really make your eyes pop. I didn&#x27;t need to trim them. They have a nice curve to them. The strip isn&#x27;t so thick that it looks fake but it&#x27;s thick enough to hold adhesive. These are my new go-to lashes.</li>
            <li> I got my lashes today they came wayyy sooner then i thought!!! i opened them and saw they where kind of spiky and unnatural looking :( BUT then i put them on and coated with mascara and they look GOOD! you barely tell that there spiky they blend in well! :D OVER ALL im HAPPY with the product! C:</li>
            <li> These were tough to put on because they are very stiff.  Took me a while to bend them to the shape of my eye.  Once they were on though they were quite comfortable and looked good.  Quite long lashes and plenty of eye length (i had to cut down which is normal for me).  Delivery took a few weeks.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are the best so far i&#x27;ve seen on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The glue tubes are all dried out, just discard those.&lt;br /&gt;The eyelashes must be cut to size to fit and work perfectly for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing eyelashes everyday for over 2 years and i love these!</li>
            <li> I just received these in the mail today and they look great nice for everyday use natural look but makes a big difference at the same time love them and by far the best lashes for the price!</li>
            <li> First of all, I received these sooo fast. I got them two mornings after I ordered them. I would definitely recommend these if you like them to look more natural. I like them a lot, I add a little more mascara to them after I put them on, &amp; they actually look pretty natural, &amp; they are really long. They stay on all day &amp; don&#x27;t start to come off at all like the cheapy ones from the store do. It is SO much more worth the money. Normally I pay at least 4-8 dollars for 1-2 pairs. Which is absolutely pointless. These ones you can reuse a couple times! They&#x27;re great. The only con to these, is all the glue that it comes with is dried out. But I use my own glue anyways so it really didn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> they dont look like the picture and no glue</li>
            <li> They always say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; but in this case, I got a lot more than what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick and the product is good. I believe these are plastic- they feel like they are anyway. But that doesn&#x27;t really bother me at all as I don&#x27;t need a curler/heated curler when I apply false lashes. (Mine curl enough on their own so they mesh nicely with falsies!) But anyway- they are easy to use, light weight, and form nicely with the shape of my lids. All around good product for a more than great price</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t stay on and I had good glue</li>
            <li> I just ordered my third box of these lashes. I really like these for everyday. They look so natural, and i get complements all the time. People ask if they are my real lashes, I say no, and they always say \\&quot;Wow they look great! So natural!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can typically make one pair last one week... which is amazing. One pair of lashes at the drugstore/sally&#x27;s costs $4.00-$5.00 and I paid under $9.00 for 20 pair. Such a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the glue that is uncluded, I use a Duo lash glue in the dark tint. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend these for everyday! I love having some extra lashes on hand to give to my friends. I absolutely will continue using these.</li>
            <li> The package came great! The box might be a little damaged but it was bubble wrapped well. The only problem is that the lashes look absolutely fake and plastic. Right when i lifted the top box, i knew right away with the plastic reflection that the lashes would look not real. Those who do not care if whether they look fake or not, then i would say that the lashes are really long and need to be trimmed to the size of your eye. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The backing is a little stiff, but these are so cute!</li>
            <li> I was sitting at my friend&#x27;s table late into the morning when I began peeling my eyelashes off getting ready for bed as we sipped on some tea. She gasped &amp;#34;wait stop I WANT TO SEE!,&amp;#34; she took my face into her hands and looked at me face for a bit, &amp;#34;I had NO idea you were wearing fake lashes, do they hurt, how&#x27;d you put them on, how long were you wearing them?&amp;#34; Needless to say we did not go to bed right then &amp; then as I stayed up teaching her how to apply these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree they don&#x27;t bend too well and I noticed they pulled up a little. My solution was simple clip then into three parts and apply each section, &amp;#34;WOW WAS THAT EASY!&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll add VERY COMFORTABLE. The babies are light weight and very natural looking. If you are looking for a caterpillar look stuck to your eyeballs, then these are not the lashes for you. If you want to tug, itch, pull, and be so aware of you eyelashes while you&#x27;re trying to focus on a conversation with someone else then these are also not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light weight, long wear, easy to use, natural looking and an awesome value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint maybe would be the packaging and the glue. The glue was thrown into the shipping package was not sealed as part of the set and was not sealed at all no plastic showing me that the glue was sanitary. Also the glue stick was chipped on the end it looked like something you would borrow from a friend used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes however were well packaged, sealed and kept in place by their packaging, so there were no mashed, crushed, or bent pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wait almost a month for this shipment to come in. So order long before you run out!</li>
            <li> The lashes I received look nothing like the style depicted in the photos. These have really long lashes alternating with short ones. It&#x27;s a cute style, but it&#x27;s not the same. Also, I received only 10 pairs - not 20 - as was advertised. Each box contained a single pair, not double pairs.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase. Lashes go on easily and stay on.  I would recommend these lashes to anyone who wants a wide-eyed look.  I did trim a little, but pleased.</li>
            <li> poor quality and its super long it looks really fake ..ehhhh doesn&#x27;t worth the money do not buy it. save your money</li>
            <li> To start off they do not look like they do in the picture. Which was the main reason I purchased them. Good thing they are good quality eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They were not the eyelashes in the picture nor did they come with glue!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected and the line is too thick...</li>
            <li> I love how the lashes came in there own case.  They are very natural looking.  I like more dramatic,  so I doubled them to achieve that look.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are definitely thicker than what I expected. But they are decent if you just need eyelashes to fill in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Not your average drag-queen falsies. that being said, i wouldn&#x27;t exactly wear this to my engineering job...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them for going out or weekends.</li>
            <li> I actually love them, was not liking that tiny glue it came with that actually didn&#x27;t even stick anything, but other than that there are great.</li>
            <li> These lashes looked great in pictures, until I recieved them and realized that if I ever want to use them I will most definitely have to trim them.</li>
            <li> I ❤ my lashes. 20 pair for 3.00 and some change u can&#x27;t beat that. My only problem is that they took nearly a month to get here but I guess that&#x27;s because they shipped from China  other than than I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely horrific.  The glue that come with which is why I purchased was completely fake along with the reviews.  The lashes don&#x27;t even cling to the skin even if u used crazy glue.  Poor quality product and lies.  You get what you pay for I guess.  Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re time money or frustration.  Spend a few extra bucks for better quality.  Seriously!!!!!  -JLO</li>
            <li> Came fast and I wear these all the time. I bought my own eyelash glue even though each packet comes with some. They look awesome!</li>
            <li> They wasn&#x27;t like the pictures, not really pleased, but used them</li>
            <li> the lashes are ok but all of the tubes of glue was empty.</li>
            <li> These work great if you cut them in half and use them as demi lashes.  They are plastic lashes and you will not like them if you are looking for something realistic.  These are definitely meant for dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> So I finally got my eyelashes in the mail I put them on they are pretty sticky but the problem is where is the glue? It specifically says it comes with glue and there are these little tubes that it comes with but no glue is in them. :/ I am very disappointed in that but they are nice lashes. Very soft and pretty. I would recommend them but make sure you buy some glue to put them on.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies (and gents), I must first tell you that I almost RARELY use false eyelashes because the few times I&#x27;ve tried to put them on, it turns into a tedious disaster.  I recently decided I wanted to try again because I wanted fuller, thicker, longer lashes and for me.. the only way to get them is by buying fake ones. :/ I decided to search amazon instead of just going to the store because I wanted to be able to actually see which ones had good reviews. When I saw these, the first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s 4.5 star rating and I thoroughly read through all the reviews. Although they had a very good rating, I was still skeptical because until now, to me, all false eyelashes were going to be a huge pain and then possibly a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG. I tried these on for the first time yesterday morning and they looked AWESOME! I did have to cut the end off JUST a smidge because they were a little too wide for my eye but after I did that they fit and looked perfect. I noted previously that another reviewer recommended \\&quot;DUO\\&quot; Eyelash adhesive (in DARK not clear, supposedly it works better) so I bought that also to use with the eyelashes. Um, yes. I will be reviewing them next. These eyelashes DID come with glue in each pack of 4 but I haven&#x27;t used that yet since I wanted to try DUO first. Either way, the eyelashes mixed with DUO adhesive worked great! They look SO natural it&#x27;s not even funny. I wore them again today to work and absolutely love them. They are long and full without looking like a drag queen.... not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that but I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything dramatic or for \\&quot;evening eyes\\&quot;... just something for days when I dress up more at work and want my eyes to look better. I&#x27;m not gonna lie and say that I&#x27;ve gotten all these compliments BUT I will note that no one seems to notice that they are fake or weird looking (which is what I would care more about) and trust me... I was WAITING to see it on someone&#x27;s face that my eyes looked random and dramatic. I wasn&#x27;t expecting or hoping that people in my office would say how much prettier my eyes looked today, but I WAS hoping that they wouldn&#x27;t notice that they were fake. In other words.. it was more of a compliment to me that people seemed to have assumed these were natural since no one looked at me funny when talking to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 5 out of 5 stars, indeed! If you&#x27;re looking for natural but more full lashes, trust me... get these! (And also the Duo adhesive! But try the glue that comes with these first, since I haven&#x27;t yet!)</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture, which is what I like. However, they are extremely long - long to the point it makes wearing falsies very noticeable. So if you want natural falsies, then these might not be the ones for you. The glue is nothing special. I never use the glue that comes with it.</li>
            <li> this is a great accessory for women. sure my wife love it. will be helpful for her make up skills to be improved</li>
            <li> Before I got this I did my research And read all of the reviews. The biggest problem it seems like everyone seems to have were the glue. Other than that it seemed like everyone liked them. I have never been the type to spend more than a dollar on a pair of eyelashes because to me it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. I ordered these a few weeks ago and finally put them to the test this past weekend for my trip to Reno. There were two pairs in each and to my surprise I didn&#x27;t even have to use the other one. I wore them friday night and reused them Saturday night. They STILL look good enough for one more use. Theyre the easiest lashes I&#x27;ve ever put on. The band is a little thick but it looked like eyeliner once it was on. I can&#x27;t say enough how happy I am with these lashes. My friends couldn&#x27;t tell they were fake and that it looked natural And I&#x27;m glad!:) will definitely buy these Again although.. It may be awhile before I need some again:)</li>
            <li> Glue was all dried up. Hard to put on. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for someone that wants a cheap pair of eyelashes. You get what you paid for and it came early! The glue isn&#x27;t that great but other than that, everything is awesome. I have been wearing them everywhere. I</li>
            <li> These things usually cost )5 per pair. Cannot beat this price, anywhere. Only thing, IV&#x27;s never used the glue provided with these lashes. Always use my glue I already have.</li>
            <li> Its alot of lashes. 3 boxes,10 in each box, 2 in each pack so that equalls 60 pairs. And they only give u 2 tiny micro minnie lash glues. But overall there good lashes last all day.</li>
            <li> I was trying for a pair of lashes a little thicker then the ones I usually  get, these ones are not that great. The band desalve when you try to clean them..</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have worn falsies daily and these lashes are perfect for me. The little ridge/band helps make the application process easier. I have to cut them just a bit for a custom fit and that&#x27;s okay. Some might think they are too long, but not for my taste. They are the perfect thickness to look realistic and natural, but with enough length to offer a little glamour. They don&#x27;t look \\&quot;drag queenish\\&quot; either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting two to three uses out of them too! Simply soak in alcohol for a bit. Afterwards, rest the lash on your index finger and hold it with your thumb while using tweezers to gently pull the old glue from the lash. Place them back in the case and they are ready for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased two boxes! When I get down to one box, I will order another two boxes to make sure I always have them on hand.  Shipping takes a long time (about a month), but for the rock-bottom price of about 25 cents per pair, I don&#x27;t mind planning ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the other people who are commenting about the glue and \\&quot;fake\\&quot; positive reviews: The glue that comes with is VERY small, but honestly, the lashes are already a SUPER bargain, so go out and buy some glue and have it ready when you get the lashes in the mail. STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SMALL STUFF! Finally, this is a real review by a real person and there is nothing fake about me...except my lashes. :-)</li>
            <li> I feel that big, over the top lashes are OK for certain occasions,  but I prefer a more natural but glamours look. The lashes are long but they are not bulky and look great! I am in love with these lashes and when I run out I will purchase these again. They give me the length I want without looking overbearing. Also you get more than one use out of them, and you get a lot of lashes.</li>
            <li> Received the item but it was not what I purchased, waste of money</li>
            <li> I got my eyelashes today, and I was supposed to get them September 2nd at the earliest so I was pretty happy. I did not get the glue, also I got all 20 of the pairs they were 2 pairs a box. The only thing with with packaging is that one box was cracked but the eyelashes were not out the box or anything, I didn&#x27;t get the ones pictures I got #117 which is just some classic looking eyelashes, they are pretty long though. I got them because i&#x27;m a beginner with eyelashes, for the price it&#x27;s okay. Not the worst but not the best. Overall I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> They came before the supposed delivery date, which i always great! Also, I tried them and found out they sticked on without glue. I did get glue, but i tried opening one of the glue capsules and there was so glue, i don&#x27;t know why or if there was an issue, but thats all! :D</li>
            <li> I normally use Ardell lashes which can cost anywhere from from $3.59 to $4.99 a pop. I wanted to save some money and after reading the reviews on here I gave it a shot, and for only $3.99 for 20 lashes, sure why not!  I got my package yesterday and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Lashes were perfectly packaged in a box with no damages. I tried them on and they looked amazing!! You bet i&#x27;ll be ordering more when i run low on stock.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from this person and everytime was a great experience. they eyelashes are good quality</li>
            <li> Another great purchase!! These are comfortable and they wear well. They seem to stay on beautifully. If you have a problem with these it is more than likely your inexperience with them and not the eyelashes themselves. Try them! You&#x27;ll love them!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the lashes, but the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; it comes with is just a fake bottle that is completely empty. Be sure to buy glue separately!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Cheaply made and look very fake. I couldn&#x27;t even give them away. They fall apart before you even put them on.</li>
            <li> the glue that was promised , was not with this eyelashes, and also this stands on eyes hut one day</li>
            <li> I did the research and read the great reviews on this item so I went for it and glad to say I&#x27;m not only satisfied but I LOVE these lashes and I will definitely order more later!!! Shipped on time and the product is AWESOME. Noticeably gorgeous on, but not too dramatic or fake looking. Very natural and pretty. Just make sure you use your own glue (I recommend DUO)! It&#x27;s easy to apply too! If you&#x27;re looking for something natural and not too dramatic, this is it. and it&#x27;s a great deal ;) i tried other false lash bundles on amazon and this one is by far the best one i &#x27;ve come across! Thanks crazycart these are awesome!</li>
            <li> it was on the cheap side</li>
            <li> Love the feel will reorder from again</li>
            <li> The lashes came on time but they were not what I expected they came in one box and they were straight not curved on plastic like in the pic and not as full :(</li>
            <li> I like to wear eyelashes quite a bit so I was excited to find this product, when I received it I noticed they are plastic so I was a little skeptical at first if they would look good and stay on but I have had no problems with them and you can&#x27;t tell they are plastic once they are on. I don&#x27;t know the quality of the glue that comes with them because I use my own glue that I already have.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are great! I think its the best bulk here on Amazon. However, the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; isn&#x27;t even glue. It&#x27;s just a piece of plastic, buy DUO glue instead. Other than that, I recommend this product, it came on time and was quick!</li>
            <li> Good, my daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> Other than the plastic feel and no glue....the lashes are nice...arrive faster than expected and they have a natural look</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review. I actually had no problem with the look of the lashes or even the thick band. My major issue was the stark white line across the top of the lash band. It is hard to cover and you will need eyeliner and it can actually get messy. I&#x27;m not sure if this was on eveyone&#x27;s order but the line was more intense on some lash pairs than others. A waste.</li>
            <li> love it! works great, however you need to buy your own glue! the glue that comes with this is really cheap, and kind of dry.</li>
            <li> The band on these lashes were very stiff (it worked for me because I&#x27;m not good at applying lashes..... Laid on my lash line GREAT) I will reorder!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the lashes. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the lashes were a bit too long but can be easily fixed by trimming them.</li>
            <li> These are long enough to cut to the size you want.  The packages they come in make it easy to slip into a suitcase or makeup bag without them getting destroyed.  The lashes are spread far apart, which gives  a more natural look.  You have to bend the backing to make them more flexible.  I wash them off and reuse them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE These lashes! Theyre not too dramatic and can be used for every day wear i would cut one lash in half and wear them as half lashes since theyre the same length on both sides dont miss out i recomend this product and the lashes are strong so youcan reuse them like 5 times</li>
            <li> The glue containers don&#x27;t even come with glue in them, however the eyelashes are great! I use them daily, easy on and easy off. However, wearing them for a second day is pretty much out of the question. But at this price thats really not an issue. I&#x27;d definitley buy them again. Im already on my 4th box, still in love!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know that I purchased &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; eyelashes. I assumed they would be &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; but the human hair kind. I just have to be careful of what I search for. The glue was horrible. It don&#x27;t stick whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This deserves a two-star because it&#x27;s really cheap quality and I hated it. It&#x27;s very plastic-like and IT DOES NOT COME WITH GLUE like it states, which bummed me out quite a bit since I had to go buy the glue separately. This doesn&#x27;t get a one-star because I knew it would be cheap stuff anyway.</li>
            <li> first of all it took over 3 weeks for my eyelashes to arrive. afterwards i was surprised when I opened my package and found only ten pairs of eyelashes. It&#x27;s still a good price. and the quality isn&#x27;t bad, the eyelashes don&#x27;t bend and are not at flexible to fitting my eyelid as I had hoped they would be. But i guess you get your money&#x27;s worth. they are a little long so you do have to trim them. If your a regular user of fake eyelashes these are good. If not, I suggest something a little easier.</li>
            <li> Great lashes, they apply good and stay on all day. Thanks</li>
            <li> Okay well I recieved my eyelashes sooner than estimated arrival which was great but I am needing a little help understanding how to use these lil black glue bullets? I cut off the tip of one and the glue was hard? not even putty material... &amp;&amp; the glue was only a drop in the tip the rest of the bullet was Empty?? How in the world is that drop supposed to go on with two sets of eyelashes... This is my 2nd attempt at false eyelashes.. need help?</li>
            <li> THEY WORK WELL .THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THE ONES I BOUGHT IN THE STORE..BUT I GOT WAY MOR FOR MY MONEY....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Giving 5 Stars. I Love How It Make My Eyes Pop.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR ITS PRICE AND WORKS BETTER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER EYELASHES THAT I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t that great and I ended up buying my own eyelash glue for about $5. The lashes are also really long and I have to cut them so I don&#x27;t look so fake.</li>
            <li> This is my first time with false lashes,my ordinarilly are long, but I singed one side.(lol)I love these, as they could definately pass for real lashes, altho the glue....that is supposed to come with it,um there was none in any of the little black tubes!!!!So I ordered some Duo glue after reading these reviews.All in all I am very pleased, they stayed on until I took them off this evening.Very Happy</li>
            <li> very thick, extremely fake. Takes forever to receive. Can&#x27;t beat the adell lashes.  They really are natural looking and last even after several washes.</li>
