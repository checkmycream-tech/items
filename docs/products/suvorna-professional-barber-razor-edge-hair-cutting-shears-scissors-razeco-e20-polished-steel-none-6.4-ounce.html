            <li> if you have large hands, especially men, they ma find these too small.</li>
            <li> The 5\\&quot; size is apparently not the size of the blades but the size measured tip to end when the scizzors are opened up and extended to their fullest length.</li>
            <li> They fit my hands, which are small, but they are too small for my husband&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a professional, this pair of scissors is not for you but for the average person cutting hair at home, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy cutting my hair at home myself for months now.</li>
            <li> Only problem was my fingers would not fit in the holes in the handles.  </li>
            <li> only lasted a few weeks because I work in a salon goob for anybody</li>
            <li> So while they work, you need to be careful about who will be using them.</li>
            <li> ; Professional Barber Razor Edge Hair Cutting Shear is a good scissor for hair cutting, I like it.</li>
            <li> A bit bulky and not as sharp as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It appears my other scizzors must be about 8\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> Im not impressed with how quickly they go dull</li>
            <li> These scissors have remained very sharp after about 8 months of use and about 30 haircuts.  </li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, in fact I nicked myself a couple of times because I am used to duller blades.  </li>
            <li> Other posts I read talked about the finger holes being too small</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the 6 1/2-inch Suvorna for use in cutting hair only.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> delivery was its usual excellence.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the holes for the fingers are small.  </li>
            <li> In any event, the holes in the inserts are too small both for me and Mary.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these for any purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of scissors cutting my kids hair.</li>

            <li> Good scissors.  Only problem was my fingers would not fit in the holes in the handles.  Will give them as a gift.</li>
            <li> only lasted a few weeks because I work in a salon goob for anybody wants to cut haie at home not for salon cut&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of these scissors.  I have been cutting the men&#x27;s hair in our family for a long time and I was looking for a good pair of scissors in which to invest.  These scissors have remained very sharp after about 8 months of use and about 30 haircuts.  I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  I would buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> My wife has cut my hair for years...these are the best scissors she has ever used.  Very comfortable and sharp.</li>
            <li> Great item, at a great price very happy with them, 2nd pair I have bought.</li>
            <li> They came with a storage case.  The feel of the shear is comfortable and just the right size for cutting hair. They come with removable finger size adjusters.  You are able to adjust the tension between the blades with a twist. The edge holds a good sharp edge!  I would recommend these shears to anyone that is looking for a proffesional shear for home or commercial.</li>
            <li> Love these shears, so smooth and have not given me any problems.</li>
            <li> These scissors were a birthday present for my husband so he can trim his mustache and beard.  I know they&#x27;re meant for cutting hair, but they looked like a good tool for cutting hair of any kind.  And they do cut hair nicely.  The problem is that the holes for the fingers are small.  They fit my hands, which are small, but they are too small for my husband&#x27;s hands.  I didn&#x27;t see anything on the website that spoke about the size of the finger holes.  If they had, I would have specified Large instead of what we got.  So while they work, you need to be careful about who will be using them.</li>
            <li> I enjoy cutting my hair at home myself for months now. I just bought this scissors by chance and turned out to be very nice! It&#x27;s very sharp and easy to use. And it even has a leather cover of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of scissors cutting my kids hair. These are so nice that I could hardly feel the blades sliding against each other. The other part that I love about these is the fact that there is no binding when I accidentally get a larger group of hair that normally twist or binds these slice though them easily. My fingers a lager than the holes but that doesn&#x27;t matter with the ease of the shears.</li>
            <li> When I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, I used different brand one that I bought from Sally&#x27;s Beauty.  so I thought if I buy a bit expensive one, it works better but... it didn&#x27;t work better.  I&#x27;m kind of sad because I already have 3 scissors I don&#x27;t want to buy another one.....</li>
            <li> These scissors are very high quality and work very well, however they are smaller than I expected. The 5\\&quot; size is apparently not the size of the blades but the size measured tip to end when the scizzors are opened up and extended to their fullest length. Other than that they are nice but small. It appears my other scizzors must be about 8\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the 6 1/2-inch Suvorna for use in cutting hair only. Loved it so much I got this smaller pair for my wife to use with her new sewing kit. She loves them. They are perfectly finished and cut flawlessly and without effort. If the rubber finger-hole inserts were permanent, the scissors would lose a star but since they are removable, they present no difficulty. In any event, the holes in the inserts are too small both for me and Mary. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these for any purpose.</li>
            <li> The shears are sharp and work very well in the salon. I feel like I have total control and I like that the finger holes are a bit smaller so my fingers don&#x27;t slip through them. I am getting great results on all my haircuts.</li>
            <li> Suvorna Ador 5&amp;#34; Professional Barber Razor Edge Hair Cutting Shear is a good scissor for hair cutting, I like it.</li>
            <li> Im not impressed with how quickly they go dull I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again I think it was a waste of money honestly.</li>
            <li> Other posts I read talked about the finger holes being too small and if I had larger hands, this would have been true for me as well.  However, they worked very well for me.  The blades are very sharp, in fact I nicked myself a couple of times because I am used to duller blades.  For my purposes, they are a great purchase.</li>
