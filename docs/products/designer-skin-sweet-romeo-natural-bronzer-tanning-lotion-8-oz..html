    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my color- as I don&#x27;t want to look like I belong on Jersey Shore, take that however</li>
            <li>The lotion is great!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a beginner type lotion -- I hadn&#x27;t tanned in a while and wanted to start again, which it was perfect for.</li>
            <li>And it is a great product for the price!!  </li>
            <li>but the lotion worked perfect for my fair skin!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, and this distributed the tan evenly without burning.</li>
            <li>The smell is incredible, I don&#x27;t stink like I was baking for 10minutes.</li>
            <li>It works great and smells great too!!  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and good results!</li>
            <li>She suggested this lotion, explaining that for someone who has very fair skin like me, this would probably be a good option for starters.</li>
            <li>I get great color.</li>
            <li>Great tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Great product, great scent.</li>
            <li>It is 100% streak free!!!</li>
            <li>I hope the rest of them produce results that are as good and smell as great as this</li>
            <li>Also the bottle is really cute and it smells great!</li>
            <li>Because it feels so good</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>and I think that it is a good bronzer</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I have fair to medium freckled skin, no orange color from this lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, goes on smooth, no streaks, but the bottle is a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>It was a good starter lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, its a great lotion, but something that you will have to upgrade from once you start wanting more color.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and great for the price.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice though.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is really nice.</li>
            <li>Smells great, not of perfume, but of a cool cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li>: If you have fair skin and/or are new to tanning, this is a REALLY nice and inexpensive lotion to try!</li>
            <li>Smell is good, after smell is not bad but as others state, the bottle doesn&#x27;t work well at the end.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome for a girl, but a guy could definitely wear it and not have any comments from the peanut gallery.  </li>
            <li>But I think I got better results in the bed without the lotion.</li>
            <li>I* love the way this smells</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it on here.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>There is a reason you don&#x27;t see more tanning lotion packaged like this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Designer Skin is a GREAT company&amp;is highly ranked.</li>
            <li>so true!</li>
            <li>It smells very beach-y to me when it first goes on, and it goes on great.</li>
            <li>, just smooth.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is so smooth, my skin soaks it</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 22 now) at a salon my mom&#x27;s friend owned because she&#x27;d sell her lotions extremely cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually really happy with the results, my skin looks a teensy bit darker (I only went for seven minutes)</li>
            <li>Smells food and goes on sooooo smooth.</li>
            <li>The lotion is PERFECT to get that base tan and smells delicious!  </li>
            <li>Good brown color gradual and natural looking.</li>
            <li>, I plan on looking into some of the other lotions in this line, since this one has been so good!</li>
            <li>You just smell clean.</li>
            <li>I do smell clean, that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I don&#x27;t see much color right away after using it.  </li>
            <li>which I have found to have a lot of problems with in tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Its very affordable, and since it is by DS it will for sure not clog your pores.</li>
            <li>Just a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>There really isnt any color you get from it, mostly you will get moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with red hair, and new to tanning.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has a soft, silky, refreshing feel on.  </li>
            <li>I have used this lotion quite a few times&amp;am tanning beautifully.</li>
            <li>Summer, I am a golden beauty.</li>
            <li>, the price was right too compared to what you pay in the tanning shops.</li>
            <li>I get a little darker and want to get more adventurous</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and clean and a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li>I notice your tan fades very fast when using it.</li>
            <li>It contains natural bronzers, which do not turn you orange, so that was a huge plus since I was nervous about</li>
            <li>The only dislike I have is that I wish it had a bit more of a bronzer in</li>
            <li>but this is dha free, natural bronzers in it.  </li>
            <li>The silicone in the lotion makes your skin buttery smooth and soft, and there is no weird after-tanning scent like some people report with some lotions.</li>
            <li>Prefer Cyphor but its so expensive and this is a perfect starter.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very excited too see how my tan comes along with future use!</li>
            <li>The color I got so far from 3 uses, it a pretty golden brown..  </li>
            <li>My tanning salon kept pushing their high-end intense bronzers ($$$)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soo much cheaper than the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>(I paid only $10 for this), and like everyone on here is saying, it really is a light, beginner lotion.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a very intense bronzer, but thats why I bought it, is keeps that natural tan look that I like.</li>
            <li>Mainly because after you tan there is NO smell.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a small packet of it to give it a try, and while I did not notice a difference after one session, I was pretty much in love with the way it made me smell.</li>
            <li>However smells good and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about using a bronzer at first, since i am so pale, and figured if i turned orange my red hair would not complement that very nicely, lol.</li>
            <li>I wanted a very natural brown tan for my wedding</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a sensitive area anyway.</li>
            <li>I have used other lotions before that were also cheap, they left me slimy&amp;stinky.</li>
            <li>you are looking to be super dark when you leave the salon, this one isnt for you.</li>
            <li>purchased my own bottle, and probably after the second or third session I started really noticing a difference, especially on my legs which are extremely hard to tan.</li>
            <li>Being my first time tanning, I wanted to ease into it, in order to avoid the orange &amp; \\&quot;too dark\\&quot; fake looking tan that most people get.</li>
            <li>It also slips out of your hands while you&#x27;re trying to pump once they&#x27;ve got lotion on them, so I would have to sit it down on the (curved) tanning bed and press the top down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to the whole tanning thing, and after building a base for a few sessions, I asked one of the ladies at my local salon what would be a good product with some light bronzer in it for a beginning tanner.</li>
            <li>It is a very sweet subtle lotion.</li>
            <li>I have never been to a tanning salon before, but I am going to SoCal in a month&amp;wanted to look like a golden goddess instead of a pale tourist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of JWOWW - and still continue to be... but for the first time in 3 years I wanted to try something a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>Do not buy from the salon if you are new to tanning, even if you tan extremely well in the sun,  like me.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to tanning, so I don&#x27;t have any other lotions to compare it to...</li>

            <li> I am fairly new to tanning, so I don&#x27;t have any other lotions to compare it to...</li>
            <li> However, now that I am much tanner, I find it hard to get any darker while using the lotion.  </li>
            <li> The natural bronzers have taken my pale skin&amp;have made me look like I was born tan.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to order this again in the future&amp;look at other products along this line.</li>
            <li> it is very light and the scent is very faint.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t wanna get dry or burn.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel oily, or dry</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one, I meant to buy the love notes accelorater, because I heard that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to use in the beginning, but I got the bottles confused.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get as dark as with other bronzers.  </li>
            <li> I just got this today and went down to my tanning salon to test it out.</li>
            <li> Half the time it fell over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sun is my bestfriend, however during the Winter I become pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference in my color.</li>
            <li> I also like how the scent is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve had better lotion and never had it his terrible of packaging.</li>
            <li> The pump gets air bubbles making it hard to get the lotion out.  </li>
            <li> Never, because it&#x27;s thick and the bottle gets clogged and then there are air pockets and it shoots stuff everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I lay the lotion on THICK!  </li>
            <li> However, once I had a base tan (a month or so) this jus couldn&#x27;t get me any darker, so I had to buy a different lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is almost like a faint sun block</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this lotion because it was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> After tanning you still have the weird tan smell but its not as bad, since you have the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> I did not even get a base tan.</li>
            <li> HATED trying to work the bottle as well</li>
            <li> The bottle is terrible!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells awesome for a girl, but a guy could definitely wear it and not have any comments from the peanut gallery.  Mainly because after you tan there is NO smell.  You just smell clean. No one would ever notice a tan/lotion/shimmer/glimmer/scent  ...not one bit.  The color I got so far from 3 uses, it a pretty golden brown..  but this is dha free, natural bronzers in it.  I&#x27;m very happy with my color- as I don&#x27;t want to look like I belong on Jersey Shore, take that however you want.&lt;br /&gt;  I tanned about 6 hours ago (using this) and I don&#x27;t smell like I went to tan AT ALL and I lay the lotion on THICK!  Because it feels so good and i don&#x27;t wanna get dry or burn.  And I didn&#x27;t.  I do smell clean, that&#x27;s about it.  I don&#x27;t feel oily, or dry, just smooth.  I recommend for any skin type, skin color, or gender.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and went down to my tanning salon to test it out. The scent is almost like a faint sun block so yes it does have a smell. The smell fades a bit after tanning. I noticed a small difference in my color. This product didn&#x27;t make me orange. Just a nice natural looking tan. It seemed to work well but burnt my bottom a bit but that&#x27;s a sensitive area anyway. I will just have to lather it on thicker next time. This tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t smell girly so I would recommend it for a guy as well.</li>
            <li> I have never been to a tanning salon before, but I am going to SoCal in a month&amp;wanted to look like a golden goddess instead of a pale tourist. My tanning salon kept pushing their high-end intense bronzers ($$$) I passed. Do not buy from the salon if you are new to tanning, even if you tan extremely well in the sun,  like me. Summer, I am a golden beauty. The sun is my bestfriend, however during the Winter I become pale as a ghost. Being my first time tanning, I wanted to ease into it, in order to avoid the orange &amp; \\&quot;too dark\\&quot; fake looking tan that most people get. So I did some research &amp;came across this product. Designer Skin is a GREAT company&amp;is highly ranked. I have used this lotion quite a few times&amp;am tanning beautifully. The smell is incredible, I don&#x27;t stink like I was baking for 10minutes. The natural bronzers have taken my pale skin&amp;have made me look like I was born tan. I have used other lotions before that were also cheap, they left me slimy&amp;stinky. Also I got discoloration. This lotion is so smooth, my skin soaks it up&amp;my tan is always even. I am definitely going to order this again in the future&amp;look at other products along this line.</li>
            <li> It smells good. But I think I got better results in the bed without the lotion. I notice your tan fades very fast when using it.</li>
            <li> I* love the way this smells and I think that it is a good bronzer, the price was right too compared to what you pay in the tanning shops.</li>
            <li> I love this. I get great color.</li>
            <li> Pump doesnt work. However smells good and a little goes a long way! Probably wont purchase again! Because of pump &amp; lotion not bronzy</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion. Is sold for $65 where I tan. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it on here. It isn&#x27;t a very intense bronzer, but thats why I bought it, is keeps that natural tan look that I like. Smells good. Keeps your skin from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  It&#x27;s soo much cheaper than the tanning salon. Tanning salons are way too pushy with their stuff.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this lotion because it was so inexpensive.  I am fairly new to tanning, so I don&#x27;t have any other lotions to compare it to...but the lotion worked perfect for my fair skin!  The lotion is PERFECT to get that base tan and smells delicious!  However, now that I am much tanner, I find it hard to get any darker while using the lotion.  Otherwise, DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the whole tanning thing, and after building a base for a few sessions, I asked one of the ladies at my local salon what would be a good product with some light bronzer in it for a beginning tanner. She suggested this lotion, explaining that for someone who has very fair skin like me, this would probably be a good option for starters. It contains natural bronzers, which do not turn you orange, so that was a huge plus since I was nervous about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a small packet of it to give it a try, and while I did not notice a difference after one session, I was pretty much in love with the way it made me smell. It&#x27;s very light and clean and a little bit sweet. If I had to describe in one word how I smell after applying this lotion, the word would be yummy. It&#x27;s not a perfume-y scent, per se, so a man could probably try it too and be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my own bottle, and probably after the second or third session I started really noticing a difference, especially on my legs which are extremely hard to tan. The silicone in the lotion makes your skin buttery smooth and soft, and there is no weird after-tanning scent like some people report with some lotions. My skin now has a natural-looking, dewy glow to it, and it is not at all obvious that I spend time in a tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I get a little darker and want to get more adventurous, I plan on looking into some of the other lotions in this line, since this one has been so good! I hope the rest of them produce results that are as good and smell as great as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you have fair skin and/or are new to tanning, this is a REALLY nice and inexpensive lotion to try! Smells great, and good results!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion at the beginning of spring.  I can&#x27;t say it gave a lot of noticeable color, but moisturizes.  Smells great, not of perfume, but of a cool cucumber scent.  I have fair to medium freckled skin, no orange color from this lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great! It smells awesome, goes on smooth, no streaks, but the bottle is a nightmare.  The pump gets air bubbles making it hard to get the lotion out.  I ended up pumping what I could out and putting it in a travel size shampoo container for size and convenience.  All together too time consuming to buy again.  It was a good starter lotion but now its time to move on to a darker bronzer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this lotion.  It goes on smooth and has a soft, silky, refreshing feel on.  I also like how the scent is not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s nice, but I don&#x27;t see much color right away after using it.  That&#x27;s the only thing I wish were different about it.  I see color almost immediately from using Purple Reign, which is another bottle of lotion by this brand, so I wish I did from this one as well.</li>
            <li> Good brown color gradual and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I had bought this lotion when I started tanning again after stopping for a year or so (started tanning at 16, I&#x27;m 22 now) at a salon my mom&#x27;s friend owned because she&#x27;d sell her lotions extremely cheap (I paid only $10 for this), and like everyone on here is saying, it really is a light, beginner lotion. There really isnt any color you get from it, mostly you will get moisturized. I&#x27;ve never had any streaking or any orange at all. It smells very beach-y to me when it first goes on, and it goes on great. After tanning you still have the weird tan smell but its not as bad, since you have the smell of the lotion. The bottle is terrible! Absolutely hate it. It slips everywhere, and once you get closer to the bottom of the bottle you have to beat it to get any out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, its a great lotion, but something that you will have to upgrade from once you start wanting more color.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and great for the price. Prefer Cyphor but its so expensive and this is a perfect starter.</li>
            <li> Smell is good, after smell is not bad but as others state, the bottle doesn&#x27;t work well at the end.</li>
            <li> I like the smell or lack of. I used it and laid in the tanning bed for 20 minutes. I had noticable results. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned with red hair, and new to tanning. I ordered the wrong one, I meant to buy the love notes accelorater, because I heard that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to use in the beginning, but I got the bottles confused. I was a little nervous about using a bronzer at first, since i am so pale, and figured if i turned orange my red hair would not complement that very nicely, lol. but I figured I might as well try it. I&#x27;m actually really happy with the results, my skin looks a teensy bit darker (I only went for seven minutes) but I&#x27;m very excited too see how my tan comes along with future use! Also the bottle is really cute and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a beginner type lotion -- I hadn&#x27;t tanned in a while and wanted to start again, which it was perfect for. I&#x27;m very fair, and this distributed the tan evenly without burning. However, once I had a base tan (a month or so) this jus couldn&#x27;t get me any darker, so I had to buy a different lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATED trying to work the bottle as well - it&#x27;s a standard pump, but how often do you see lotion in a pump bottle? Never, because it&#x27;s thick and the bottle gets clogged and then there are air pockets and it shoots stuff everywhere. It also slips out of your hands while you&#x27;re trying to pump once they&#x27;ve got lotion on them, so I would have to sit it down on the (curved) tanning bed and press the top down. Half the time it fell over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve had better lotion and never had it his terrible of packaging. There is a reason you don&#x27;t see more tanning lotion packaged like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of JWOWW - and still continue to be... but for the first time in 3 years I wanted to try something a little cheaper. I love this. I think I will just switch back and forth. Smells food and goes on sooooo smooth.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. I did not even get a base tan. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read another review about this product not leaving you with that tanning bed funk after tanning- so true! You could go tanning on your lunch hour and your coworkers would be none the wiser.</li>
            <li> Great product, great scent. I wanted a very natural brown tan for my wedding and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. I will use it again.</li>
            <li> It works great and smells great too!!  And it is a great product for the price!!  Thank you and God Bless</li>
