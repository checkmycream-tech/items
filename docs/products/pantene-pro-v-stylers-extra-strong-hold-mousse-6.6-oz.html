            <li> Holds hair VERY well but causes hair to be extremely dry to the point you think its going to snap off, but then again it does say extra strong hold so I can&#x27;t knock pantene for that. Be sure not to apply too much, when I applied too much product it became a complete mess and caused my entire head to feel very stick. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this to get the look you are after.</li>
            <li> Smells great and holds great, but doesn&#x27;t seem like &#x27;extra strong&#x27;.</li>
