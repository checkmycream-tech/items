    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful for speeding up the healing of bruises.  </li>
            <li>so I was very happy with the seller&#x27;s promptness for one.</li>
            <li>but I was very impressed seller made contact to let me know and</li>
            <li>Wonderful, it seems working for me.</li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>This cream worked great for me.</li>
            <li>This used to work great, but does not anymore.  </li>
            <li>Great Cream to use on the veins.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Bought this after reading some good reviews of it.  </li>
            <li>price is good too.</li>
            <li>I am 41yrs old...stay out of the sun, eat very healthy and drink copious amounts of water</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice to use</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am going to get another shipment and by the time it is used up I will have a better opinion of the performance of the product.</li>
            <li>It seemed that it was the best rated product for veins that actually worked for some.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that you need more than 1 tube in the 6 weeks, you&#x27;ll need about 3 or more.</li>
            <li>Sure it thinned them, but my case is too severe.</li>
            <li>Some people who get this might not have it running in their family line and mostly recieved the Spider Veins from weight gain or lack of leg</li>
            <li>because this cleared up the Spider Veins some, I&#x27;m hoping that with a tan they&#x27;ll be covered some more.</li>

            <li>Some people who get this might not have it running in their family line and mostly recieved the Spider Veins from weight gain or lack of leg movement.    </li>
            <li>But, because this cleared up the Spider Veins some, I&#x27;m hoping that with a tan they&#x27;ll be covered some more.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m extremely glad I did.</li>
            <li>IT IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Keep some on hand -- you&#x27;ll be glad.</li>
            <li>He keeps asking me to buy him more of this cream every time he runs out, so I guess it works.</li>
            <li>Used it 2-3 times a day and showered before applying so it would soak in more.  </li>
            <li>I just need to buy more because of the amount of veins have have in my legs.</li>
            <li>praticall removed most discoloration from bruises from spider vein surgery in 1 week.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better than just lotion alone.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li>it is a nice skin creme tho, so I will continue to use and see if I get any improvements with veins, and its not expensive</li>
            <li>So buy this stuff when it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I only have fine spider veins on my chin, used product as directed for 6 weeks, no visible change :p</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes yet.  </li>
            <li>The original was terrific, I hope this is as good</li>
            <li>This is my second time that I ordered Vita K and seems like is working fairly well.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to find as one might think - thanks for making it available</li>
            <li>There is a money back guarantee, which made me more confident in trying it.  </li>
            <li>but I can say that I am more than pleased with my personal results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, I&#x27;ve used all of the Vita-K creams (spider veins, dark circles) for bruises, and they are all great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First you start off by applying large amounts twice a day, and you will see results very quickly, but it will take 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I had my doubts at first!</li>
            <li>The area on my leg has lightened as well but not as much as the ones on my face which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, cheap price.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth the price to try it.</li>
            <li>False advertisement at it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li>item was still received in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I am almost through my first tube of Vita-K and I have to say I think it might be lightening some of my spider veins.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the dark spots but it greatly lightens the spider vein area.</li>
            <li>I first applied this product I noticed the splotches on my knee faded in a matter of days, but the front of my leg took almost a month for it to begin fading</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product on prominent, red spider veins on my nose that I&#x27;ve had since childhood.</li>
            <li>After 7 weeks of consistent use, the veins on my nose are 95% gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be investigating more products from Vita-K from now on.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but felt compelled to do so because of the positive results I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to really work when I first used it.</li>
            <li>By the third tube my problem areas are very light, so I got creative and decided to try it on the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My spider veins have really faded!The</li>
            <li>w/ how much stuff is still inside.</li>
            <li>but I am really liking the results.</li>
            <li>but I am really liking the results.</li>
            <li>and I never bruised though my toe was very sore</li>
            <li>(I really smacked it).  </li>
            <li>so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any change for a while.</li>
            <li>and I see a VERY noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>and when I wear make up, I have to really strain to see them.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.</li>
            <li>My veins were bothering me too much to wait 6 weeks to find out if this lightens there appearance.</li>
            <li>As the packaging states it will take a month of 2x daily application to see full effect.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s going to work based on what it&#x27;s done so far.</li>
            <li>My legs are almost cleared up and believe by next year for summer that I can get into a tanning bed and show off my pretty legs for the very first time of my adult life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My legs are almost cleared up and believe by next year for summer that I can get into a tanning bed and show off my pretty legs for the very first time of my adult life.    </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(yes I really am telling you to do this), but don&#x27;t cut yourself, and you&#x27;ll be surprised</li>
            <li>It arrived within the time expected and enjoy applying it.  </li>
            <li>this will normally make the Spider Veins go away.</li>

            <li>It may be a new formula, but it&#x27;s not improved.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this product does work, but only if you follow the directions and depending on how severe your Spider Veins are.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t working as quickly on the pink spider veins.</li>
            <li>Also, my son&#x27;s eye socket was hit by a board about 4 days before he was starting his first &#x27;real job&#x27; out of college -- no long lasting damage, but he was headed for a real shiner.</li>
            <li>I must have had an allergic reaction to this stuff as it&#x27;s been three days since I completely stopped applying it</li>
            <li>Even with the help of this product it does not work completely since I inheritted it from my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;But,</li>
            <li>Even with the help of this product it does not work completely since I inheritted it from my Mom.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY light spider veins, very small pieces here and there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it regularly, but it has cleared up most of my spider veins and I even use it on dark spots left from scarred acne and it works!</li>
            <li>Another piece of garbage Amazon sells which actually does exactly the opposite of what is advertised.</li>
            <li>applying.&lt;br /&gt;The tube also says the product works differently for different skin types, so it might not be certain that this product will work for you.</li>
            <li>The veins just branched out further and made new spots.</li>
            <li>, cause i feel like i have to use it every day for the first week, then every other day to keep the veins at bay.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product after searching online for a \\&quot;reasonably priced\\&quot; cream that might be able to help with spider veins I have on the sides of my nose, one small area near my mouth, and a few tiny patches on my thigh.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth but not effective.</li>
            <li>I still see them but barely......</li>
            <li>I had a reaction to this product, anyone with sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy it, my face was red for days with just one application.</li>
            <li>A complete rip-off, I had my doubts and they were confirmed after trying it.</li>
            <li>Today, after having done only 2 applications, they are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have light and pink small spider veins on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>In my case, the pink ones are a lot older, and the blue ones have come on recently (within the last year).</li>
            <li>have been using twice a day like directed for a little more than 5 weeks now and and have seen absolutely no results.. waste of money.</li>

            <li> For instance: I&#x27;ll have some people show me their Spider Veins and are merely 1 or 2 lines, my case is very severe on both legs and in splotches, I have 1 spot on the front of my leg about 2 inches across and 4 inches in length, then 2 more splotches on my other knee w/ another 2 inch splotch that were colors of red, blue and green.</li>
            <li> I have typical pink spider veins mostly on my outer thighs and inner calves, and larger patches of blue veins behind my knees.</li>
            <li> Try this first at least.</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks you can die down to applying once a day, but that&#x27;s if the Spider Veins have nearly faded away.</li>
            <li> I just recently cut another tube and have it placed in a ziplock bag so the cream won&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> But if you have a severe case, and desperate, then be sure to fork over time, patience and some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you have a severe case, and desperate, then be sure to fork over time, patience and some money.    </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of 2x a day application the smalled spiders are nearly vanished.  </li>
            <li> I sent the almost empty tube back as they said, explained that it didn&#x27;t work and mailed it to the address given.  </li>
            <li> About 6 hours after the first application, I saw improvement in the blue veins behind my knees.</li>
            <li> On the other hand spyder veins are still present...</li>
            <li> Then I missed a day and they came right back, looking even worse!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, and apparently there is no recourse.  </li>
            <li> Less than a week later, it was returned in the mail saying \\&quot;Forwarding Adress Expired\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have small purple spider veins in little clusters, nothing major but not minor either.</li>
            <li> And being single and on a strict budget; you can;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in short, if you have one or two little spots then go on ahead and buy this product, you might need just 1 or 2 tubes.</li>

            <li> Even when you feel it&#x27;s empty, remove the cap and squeeze it onto your leg like you would a tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> -in-all, I have spent close to 50$ on these tubes</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I have spent close to 50$ on these tubes</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect it to work, but hate the spider veins so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works on deep, dark and heavy leg spider veins, but for about $10, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford laser or other \\&quot;medical\\&quot; treatments and figured it wouldn&#x27;t break me to waste under $20 if this didn&#x27;t work.....</li>
            <li> I gave this stupid product the 6 weeks daily use it recommends on the box, but no spider veins were diminished, and the new ones have yet to heel properly.</li>
            <li> Seems to helping a little.</li>
            <li> As a licensed medical doctor, I am very skeptical of cosmetic creams and products in general.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> DO NOT let any of it go to waste.</li>
            <li> I have been using EVERYDAY since then and will continue to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does nothing.</li>

            <li> The skin is thin there and results are quicker.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for it to start, but once it did, the itching has been nonstop and it&#x27;s driving me crazy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes yet.  I do like the creaminess of the product, not sure if it will work.</li>
            <li> I must have had an allergic reaction to this stuff as it&#x27;s been three days since I completely stopped applying it and I am still itching and red!  I did not have an immediate reaction so used it since the day after receiving it.  It took a few days for it to start, but once it did, the itching has been nonstop and it&#x27;s driving me crazy!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of 2x a day application the smalled spiders are nearly vanished.  The larger darker spiders have lessened in color and size.  As the packaging states it will take a month of 2x daily application to see full effect.  I am well pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am almost through my first tube of Vita-K and I have to say I think it might be lightening some of my spider veins.  I did not give it a 4 or 5 star because I am not exactly sure yet,  but I do have quite alot on my legs and all but for the worst of them it seems they are lightening up.  I am going to get another shipment and by the time it is used up I will have a better opinion of the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while.  It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the dark spots but it greatly lightens the spider vein area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for one day. I have typical pink spider veins mostly on my outer thighs and inner calves, and larger patches of blue veins behind my knees. About 6 hours after the first application, I saw improvement in the blue veins behind my knees. Today, after having done only 2 applications, they are barely noticeable. This isn&#x27;t working as quickly on the pink spider veins. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s going to work based on what it&#x27;s done so far. Overall, I would recommend this product, but I think results may vary based on skin type (I&#x27;m pretty pale) and how long you&#x27;ve had the spider veins. In my case, the pink ones are a lot older, and the blue ones have come on recently (within the last year).</li>
            <li> Two purchases of this cream and I haven&#x27;t noticed a different.  Will be getting laser surgery on my veins.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work!  I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for several weeks and see zero results.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading some good reviews of it.  It seemed that it was the best rated product for veins that actually worked for some.  It did nothing for me, even after several weeks of constant use.  There is a money back guarantee, which made me more confident in trying it.  Well guess what?  I sent the almost empty tube back as they said, explained that it didn&#x27;t work and mailed it to the address given.  Less than a week later, it was returned in the mail saying \\&quot;Forwarding Adress Expired\\&quot;.  Then I see here that Amazon lists it as discontinued by the manufacturer.  I feel totally cheated.  Waste of money, and apparently there is no recourse.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> This cream worked great for me. My spider veins have really faded!The price is good too. Use twice a day as directed on the package</li>
            <li> First of all, this product does work, but only if you follow the directions and depending on how severe your Spider Veins are. For instance: I&#x27;ll have some people show me their Spider Veins and are merely 1 or 2 lines, my case is very severe on both legs and in splotches, I have 1 spot on the front of my leg about 2 inches across and 4 inches in length, then 2 more splotches on my other knee w/ another 2 inch splotch that were colors of red, blue and green. They were nasty. I never wore shorts and so never tanned my legs.&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this product I noticed the splotches on my knee faded in a matter of days, but the front of my leg took almost a month for it to begin fading (I&#x27;m still working on the front of my leg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a one time use product, if you&#x27;re desperate to be rid of your Spider Veins forever then you have to commit to this product and use it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;First you start off by applying large amounts twice a day, and you will see results very quickly, but it will take 4 to 6 weeks. The problem is that you need more than 1 tube in the 6 weeks, you&#x27;ll need about 3 or more. So buy this stuff when it&#x27;s cheap. After 6 weeks you can die down to applying once a day, but that&#x27;s if the Spider Veins have nearly faded away. If not, keep applying.&lt;br /&gt;The tube also says the product works differently for different skin types, so it might not be certain that this product will work for you. So buy only 1 tube and see how it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, treat this stuff like it&#x27;s gold, DO NOT let any of it go to waste. Even when you feel it&#x27;s empty, remove the cap and squeeze it onto your leg like you would a tube of toothpaste. And after that, grab a knife or box cutter and cut open the tube (yes I really am telling you to do this), but don&#x27;t cut yourself, and you&#x27;ll be surprised w/ how much stuff is still inside. I just recently cut another tube and have it placed in a ziplock bag so the cream won&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff isn&#x27;t greasy and dries very quickly, it doesn&#x27;t smell so bad either. I like how my legs feel and smell after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, if you have one or two little spots then go on ahead and buy this product, you might need just 1 or 2 tubes. But if you have a severe case, and desperate, then be sure to fork over time, patience and some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I have spent close to 50$ on these tubes but I am really liking the results. My legs are almost cleared up and believe by next year for summer that I can get into a tanning bed and show off my pretty legs for the very first time of my adult life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope this review was of some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit/Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a long time of using this product I am sad to say it hasn&#x27;t removed up my Spider Veins. Sure it thinned them, but my case is too severe. The tube does say it will not work for everyone and works differently according to different skin types. I believe that my problem is that it&#x27;s inherited. Some people who get this might not have it running in their family line and mostly recieved the Spider Veins from weight gain or lack of leg movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not blaming this on my family line because I&#x27;m lazy. I&#x27;m female, 5 foot 9 and 160 lbs., the correct weight for my height and age. Plus getting on the treadmill an hour each day and lift about 10,000 lbs a week by myself from work. I do plenty of working and walking, and if you do your research online this will normally make the Spider Veins go away. Even with the help of this product it does not work completely since I inheritted it from my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;But, because this cleared up the Spider Veins some, I&#x27;m hoping that with a tan they&#x27;ll be covered some more. I even have plans to send some to my Mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, try only one and see how it will work for you.ery quickly, it doesn&#x27;t smell so bad either. I like how my legs feel and smell after I apply it.  So, in short, if you have one or two little spots then go on ahead and buy this product, you might need just 1 or 2 tubes. But if you have a severe case, and desperate, then be sure to fork over time, patience and some money.    All-in-all, I have spent close to 50$ on these tubes but I am really liking the results. My legs are almost cleared up and believe by next year for summer that I can get into a tanning bed and show off my pretty legs for the very first time of my adult life.    Anyway, I hope this review was of some help.    Edit/Update:     After quite a long time of using this product I am sad to say it hasn&#x27;t removed up my Spider Veins.

            <li> I have light and pink small spider veins on my cheeks. I bought this product, dubious, but since it was affordable, I reasoned, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; I&#x27;m extremely glad I did. I&#x27;m not using it regularly, but it has cleared up most of my spider veins and I even use it on dark spots left from scarred acne and it works! I&#x27;m not sure how it works on deep, dark and heavy leg spider veins, but for about $10, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> IT WAS ADVERTISE IT WOULD COVER UP SPIDER VEINS IF YOU USE IT FOR AWHILE BUT IT NEVER MADE THEM DISAPPEAR OR COVER UP.</li>
            <li> Seems to helping a little.</li>
            <li> i have had a small spider vein under my left eye for about two years now and ordered this to try and get rid of it... have been using twice a day like directed for a little more than 5 weeks now and and have seen absolutely no results.. waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worthless - didn&#x27;t make a single bit of difference even though I was very faithful in applying it as directed.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM BY FREEMAN IS A MIRACLE! NOT ONLY DOES IT VISIBALLY REDUCE THE APPEARANCE OF SPIDER VEINS, IT ALSO TIGHTENS AND RETEXTURIZES YOUR SKIN WITH ANTI-AGING PEPTIDES. I USE IT TO DIMINISH MY SPIDER VEINS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT TIGHTENS AND FIRMS LIKE NOTHING ELSE I HAVE EVER FOUND. IT IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This product seemed to really work when I first used it. My spider Veins seemed lighter in just one day. Then I missed a day and they came right back, looking even worse! I have been using EVERYDAY since then and will continue to give it a shot. Maybe it just takes time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for speeding up the healing of bruises.  I used it on my toe the minute I stubbed it. I applied this cream 4-5 times a day and I never bruised though my toe was very sore (I really smacked it).  Also, my son&#x27;s eye socket was hit by a board about 4 days before he was starting his first &#x27;real job&#x27; out of college -- no long lasting damage, but he was headed for a real shiner. I convinced him to use this on the area and he didn&#x27;t bruise at all. His eye was a bit swollen, but we averted the \\&quot;Mom, I&#x27;m gonna look like a freak!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I&#x27;ve used all of the Vita-K creams (spider veins, dark circles) for bruises, and they are all great. Keep some on hand -- you&#x27;ll be glad.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully and I did not see any results.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> my dad uses this product for his post-operated varicose legs. he says it soothes the discomfort of his legs. He keeps asking me to buy him more of this cream every time he runs out, so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> I only have fine spider veins on my chin, used product as directed for 6 weeks, no visible change :p</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after searching online for a \\&quot;reasonably priced\\&quot; cream that might be able to help with spider veins I have on the sides of my nose, one small area near my mouth, and a few tiny patches on my thigh. I can&#x27;t afford laser or other \\&quot;medical\\&quot; treatments and figured it wouldn&#x27;t break me to waste under $20 if this didn&#x27;t work.....I thought I&#x27;d at least give it a try. I am 41yrs old...stay out of the sun, eat very healthy and drink copious amounts of water but I think genetics is playing a role with my spider veins. Well, I ordered this cream which arrived maybe 3 days after payment so I was very happy with the seller&#x27;s promptness for one. Directions say to use generously twice a day for 4-6weeks so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any change for a while. I apply a small amount after I wash my face and before I put on my moisturizer morning and night. I rub it in really well and wait a few minutes before applying my Avon Anew product or makeup. I have only used this cream for 4 days and I see a VERY noticeable difference. My lines were pretty dark and very obvious and a bit difficult to conceal with any cover up. I still see them but barely......and when I wear make up, I have to really strain to see them. After reading other reviews I was a little skeptical if this would help any but I can say that I am more than pleased with my personal results. The area on my leg has lightened as well but not as much as the ones on my face which is fine with me. I will of course continue using the cream and have a feeling that by the \\&quot;4-6 week\\&quot; mark my troubled areas will be pretty much gone. I never write reviews but felt compelled to do so because of the positive results I&#x27;ve had. And being single and on a strict budget; you can;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is an abominable product. It&#x27;s supposed to alleviate spider veins but in fact it ends up causing them since it is acnegenic and so promotes increased appearance of veins as the acne heals. I gave this stupid product the 6 weeks daily use it recommends on the box, but no spider veins were diminished, and the new ones have yet to heel properly. Another piece of garbage Amazon sells which actually does exactly the opposite of what is advertised. I suggest you not only do not buy it, but spit at all advertisements associated with it!</li>
            <li> This used to work great, but does not anymore.  And my veins aren&#x27;t that bad.  The box says it&#x27;s new and improved?  It may be a new formula, but it&#x27;s not improved.  I tried three tubes of it last summer.  Used it 2-3 times a day and showered before applying so it would soak in more.  How frustrating.  The summer was over, and I never got to wear my shorts :(  It didn&#x27;t even fade them, which I would have settled for.</li>
            <li> I have small purple spider veins in little clusters, nothing major but not minor either. Applied product 2-3 times a day until empty with no results. If I&#x27;d at least seen them fade any I probably would&#x27;ve tried another bottle but I saw no results at all. I had also bought a bottle of it for my mom who applied the same way and saw no results as well.</li>
            <li> This is my second time that I ordered Vita K and seems like is working fairly well. Don&#x27;t expect miracles though but the skin definetely regain is elasticity. On the other hand spyder veins are still present...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference on my red nose. Been using daily for a month. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again .</li>
            <li> This item was back ordered but I was very impressed seller made contact to let me know and item was still received in a very reasonable amount of time. Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, it seems working for me.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep spider veins from swelling.</li>
            <li> Just did not work. Shipping cost is astronomical. Will never purchase again</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me....</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, cheap price. This stuff is nice to use</li>
            <li> I used the product about a year ago and saw improvement. It does take time and liberal amounts for bad patches of spider veins. I stopped for a while then got more and did another round. By the third tube my problem areas are very light, so I got creative and decided to try it on the dark circles under my eyes. The skin is thin there and results are quicker. I also just realized it helped age spots and skin blotches so I am stocking up. I picture that I will eventually be taking a bath in this stuff. It&#x27;s really quite an amazing product. I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Altho a tad bit expensive, cause i feel like i have to use it every day for the first week, then every other day to keep the veins at bay.  But it does work and I had my doubts at first!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice now.  Trying to atleast diminish some spider veins on my legs.  I do think it&#x27;s helped lighten them.  I will buy it again because I see a difference.  Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li> I always buy on Amazon, but this has been the worst I&#x27;ve compared prodcut in my life, well you would expect of a product as cheap and nasty</li>
            <li> Have had quite noticable spider veins on the back of my legs for YEARS. Ran across this in a discount store when I was looking for something else last summer and bought it on impulse. Didn&#x27;t really expect it to work, but hate the spider veins so much I thought it was worth the price to try it. I used it twice a day and could see the difference in a week. By the end of the summer, I had to look close to see any signs of spider veins at all!</li>
            <li> It arrived within the time expected and enjoy applying it.  I just need to buy more because of the amount of veins have have in my legs.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction to this product, anyone with sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy it, my face was red for days with just one application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product works because it is sitting in my medicine cabinet barely used. My veins were bothering me too much to wait 6 weeks to find out if this lightens there appearance. I went to groupon and bought vein-gough therapy treatment. It was terribly painful and now my legs look scarred. DO NOT GET THAT DONE. Try this first at least. The veins just branched out further and made new spots. Great!</li>
            <li> i tried using it for blue veins under my eyes didn&#x27;t do anything and I&#x27;ve been using in for a month although its not considered spider veins i still gave it a shot</li>
            <li> No effect on my spider veins. The cream is smooth but not effective. Would not buy product again. No effect.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the Vita-k for scars and bruises to give it a try.  The original was terrific, I hope this is as good</li>
            <li> I have VERY light spider veins, very small pieces here and there. But, because this runs in my family, I thought I would try to prevent further development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me, too bad :( I used as directed, but no fading. I&#x27;ll probably just go to a specialist when I can.</li>
            <li> As a licensed medical doctor, I am very skeptical of cosmetic creams and products in general. I decided to try this product on prominent, red spider veins on my nose that I&#x27;ve had since childhood. I slathered this product on the skin of my nose once daily at nighttime before I went to bed. After 7 weeks of consistent use, the veins on my nose are 95% gone. I wish I had taken before and after photos. I was very impressed. Now I only use the cream about 2-3 times a week and the veins have not reappeared. I&#x27;ll definitely be investigating more products from Vita-K from now on.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it promises.</li>
            <li> I can not  say that I saw any difference, so I did not reorder.  I saw no difference.  Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> praticall removed most discoloration from bruises from spider vein surgery in 1 week. I used it 15 yrs. ago and it removed a bruise I had had from spider veins  all my life!</li>
            <li> Snake oil. Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Great Cream to use on the veins. It does help on the spider veins and the skin around the veins.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month and don&#x27;t see any improvement in the marks on my cheeks...it is a nice skin creme tho, so I will continue to use and see if I get any improvements with veins, and its not expensive</li>
            <li> This is my second week of applying the lotion, twice a day.  To date, I&#x27;ve not seen any fading - but intend to use it as directed.  Twice a day for 4-6 weeks, than once a day.</li>
            <li> A complete rip-off, I had my doubts and they were confirmed after trying it. Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does nothing. False advertisement at it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> I recommend trying a vitamen supplement as well. It seems to work better than just lotion alone. Both did the trick for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a good price. Not as easy to find as one might think - thanks for making it available</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Used it as described. It did nothing. I wasted my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Talk to your dr, for advise about spider veins.</li>
