            <li> A strange, musty, ricey coconut smell....</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely smells more like rice and coconut than vanilla and rice milk.</li>
            <li> The jar itself is very small and only lasted me FIVE days total using on my arms, legs, and torso.</li>
            <li> will recommend to other buyers looking for themselves or as a gift</li>
            <li> The container had been previously opened and used.</li>
            <li> Sorry, street harassment is an actual problem around the world and it is not a compliment, it&#x27;s a threat.</li>
            <li> The body butter has some substance to it, but isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the recent bad advertising with the description on the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very thick body butter.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and leaves your skin a sickly chalky white after applying it and unfortunately for me I found that it didn&#x27;t go away unless I wiped it off or it wore off.</li>

            <li> I hope this is the one with &amp;#34;cat-calling begin&amp;#34; on the label that has the PC crowd in an uproar! lol</li>
            <li> I bought this after the recent bad advertising with the description on the side of the bottle. I thought people were complaining about nothing and wanted to show my support for Burt&#x27;s Bees. The lotion smells good and feels great. It&#x27;s very silky and soft. I don&#x27;t think the odor was too strong at all. It had a vanilla scent that I thought was just right.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees needs to repackage this and apologize. &amp;#34;Let the catcalling commence&amp;#34;. Sorry, street harassment is an actual problem around the world and it is not a compliment, it&#x27;s a threat. No one should buy this product until they change the label.</li>
            <li> Very thick body butter. I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely smells more like rice and coconut than vanilla and rice milk. A strange, musty, ricey coconut smell.... strange, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I saw a news item that this company was going to have to pull this item off the shelves, or sell through discount venues, because the writing on the container said &amp;#34;let the catcalling commence&amp;#34; and some people were offended by this.  We have become a nation of whiners who have no concept of what is important and what isn&#x27;t.  So I bought 4.  I give them to the ladies I which to &amp;#34;catcall&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product with a more vibrant vanilla smell and this basically has no scent whatsoever - or perhaps the jar I got was a dud. The jar itself is very small and only lasted me FIVE days total using on my arms, legs, and torso. The product is very thick and leaves your skin a sickly chalky white after applying it and unfortunately for me I found that it didn&#x27;t go away unless I wiped it off or it wore off. Despite all of this, my skin feels very refreshed and soft after using it for such a short period of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the pear version is better - because it definitely smells much more inviting than this did.</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this.  I&#x27;ve bought every container I can find...that isn&#x27;t wildly overpriced.  Burt&#x27;s Bees--please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I love vanilla do i was excited about buying this product. Smells great!! And smells even better with the body spray..Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Gave this a birthday gift to a friend who was looking for this product.  She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Like it but the perfume is too strong for me. Nice that it is natural and I had no reaction to the perfume. Will use it just prob won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and softens skin. Great for winter when the heater is on and drying out the air.  I&#x27;m ordering more before it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li> Like the name implies goes on smoothly. Smells good, but strong of rice milk. Kind of like rice pudding with vanilla. Still, very good and the smell stays for a while.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps your skin feel so smooth and the aroma is wonderful.  Great product for those who like to have a fresh scent and smooth skin.</li>

            <li> This is top quality lotion. It smells good and it moisturizes very well.  My wife likes to use this for her feet, but it works great everywhere.</li>
