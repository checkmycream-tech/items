            <li>I ran out of my Everyone soap and this was on sale with good reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>SO GOOD</li>
            <li>I loved their mint soap, so I ordered the Orange.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this bath and shower gel!</li>
            <li>but it does make the bathroom smell amazing.</li>
            <li>this is a great product the smell is not over barring a light citrus with</li>
            <li>honestly, this smells great and makes you silky smooth</li>
            <li>In my opinion both mint and orange smell nice, but the mint is nicer to wake you up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping this helps.</li>
            <li>Rinses nicely also.</li>
            <li>Very nice shower gel and was looking for something cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling well-moisturized and with a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The reviews mention a good citrus scent, good cleaning and hydrating power with an economical price.  </li>
            <li>I love this size and nice shower gel.  </li>
            <li>It lathers into a nice suds and feels very rich and creamy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent gentle cleansing with light scent.</li>
            <li>Just bought it - and it is probably too soon to write but so far, it is very nice - developes a lot of soap on the body - and smells great, although light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on skin and smells great (not artificial or chemical).  </li>
            <li>and it makes me feel so fresh and clean!!!</li>
            <li>I like the citrus smell (kind of a sweet citrus) and it gets me good and clean.</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps my skin nice soft.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>There are some days when I notice my skin IS softer after using it, but it&#x27;s not like its a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; body wash and is making my skin amazingly better.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Alba Botanica shower gels.  </li>
            <li>Now I have even more acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the remaining bottle, but will be cleaning a lot more often until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Would have given it another star if I were able to use the pump.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, which does not overpower my perfume.</li>
            <li>I hope I will continue to be able to get this as I don&#x27;t want to have to find another product that works as well as this does for me.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for my kids</li>
            <li>I love the product and the scent.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>- I love it</li>
            <li>I really think Alba is a great brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the whole family</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this bath gel for two years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love, love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and great scent.</li>
            <li>Love this product and this brand.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I both use this product and love the smell.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time this morning and my first impression is that this is a wonderful way to wake up in the shower!</li>
            <li>Nice light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t lather well, even when used with a loofa.  </li>
            <li>Not horrible, but probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I love this shower gel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alright but do not expect anything more.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>Love saying &amp;#34;very emollient&amp;#34; for anything I like now.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice when you are using it though because it really wakes you up and put you in a good mood.</li>
            <li>, it is so refreshing and smells heavenly with that Island Citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I love Alba products, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>The smell is great &amp; it works well, just doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the body wash-</li>
            <li>Just wanted to let everyone who reads this review that I am so happy and pleased with this all natural shower gel.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd..4th bottle, and find that it is the perfect solution for extremely dry menopausal skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for their slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is clean and fresh, and it is good for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 32-ounce pump bottle is fabulous; why don&#x27;t more companies do this?</li>
            <li>Even after just one use, I feel like my skin is already more moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>A light refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very citrus-y; but smells good.</li>
            <li>Best body wash we can find without so many harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>With the help of a pore brush, I find this product leaves my skin clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This product rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>the scent evaporates very quickly and do not lather well.</li>
            <li>This is way too strong.</li>
            <li>nice mild fresh scent  very agreeable product good bargain lots of product for the money  </li>
            <li>because of the way it was shipped.....part of the product leaked and covered the inside of the box....not cool and would expect better</li>
            <li>but that is fine since I then put on lotion, perfume, etc.</li>
            <li>The large quantity lasts a while and the pump is handy.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful but a little too runny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cruelty free too</li>
            <li>a nice soap that&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>The Island Citrus smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will probably try another scent of their body wash in the future.</li>
            <li>The Alba Botanica Island Citrus soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin silky smooth and clean with no dryness after bathing.  </li>
            <li>Alba&#x27;s Body Wash. The soap is a light citrus scent, not overpowering and it leaves your feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and is very soothing on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product and size -- shipping is fast!</li>
            <li>I notice a significant difference when i use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>First off, the citrus smell is more a floral vomit citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>Clean citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>It produces a good amount of latter without using a lot of the gel.  </li>
            <li>and I love it so much .</li>
            <li>It is so emollient that you only have to use one pump to get a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild, moisturizing and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but for some it might be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>OK for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love that their products are all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than using products that contain natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Well worth shipping to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li>It is ok product, I had expected more moisturizing and citrus sense,  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean and leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>My acne was pretty calm until I started using this.</li>
            <li>The smell is actually really nice - my fiance loves it - and it doesn&#x27;t linger on skin too long</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sud very well, but that&#x27;s part of being most all Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>love this wish i had know a lot earlier</li>
            <li>This product lathers really well and the Hawaiian scent keeps you fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased</li>
            <li>The smell is great even though it does not last long.</li>
            <li>It is a minor infraction, to be sure, but something to take note of if you care about such things.  :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Alba Botanica Island Citrus, but I like it well enough when I think of the tradeoff! :-)</li>
            <li>Not only am I clean, but also I do not seem to be dusting away as quickly.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product and used it for a long time.</li>
            <li>It cleans and feels good on my slim, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve tried the orange emollient, and although it claims to be better for dry skin, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality as well, but not too keen on the scent, a little too Jones Soda like for my taste.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also very drying on the skin, it&#x27;s not moisturizing what so ever.</li>
            <li>I also use their Very Emollient Body Lotion - it works very well and is well-priced.  </li>
            <li>It smells too much like cough syrup.</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>One pump is all you need for your whole body.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is very emollient and gently cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>It has the very unorange like smell, smells chalky..</li>
            <li>(I actually kind of regret getting such a big bottle now before testing it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive searched far and wide for nice citrus scented body wash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall fine, and if you&#x27;re watching your chemical intake, it&#x27;s probably a good option, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to my previous soap.</li>
            <li>It seems to have more moisturizing qualities than other shower gels I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use Alba&#x27;s lotions so was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I have been using body washes/gels for a long time and this Alba shower gel is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>like there&#x27;s enough soap and lather to clean with.  </li>
            <li>But because I have mild bacne, it irritated my back so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it smooth and makes you actually feel clean.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last me 5 times what the Bath &amp; Bodyworks bottles last for the same cost or less and the coconut oil in it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li>However, this particular sent is not.</li>
            <li>Very affordable for the quality of this body wash that is gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love having a large pump bottle like this in the shower, and it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The citrus is blended with other light fragrances to give it an \\&quot;island\\&quot; scent that makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation instead of getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin soft after a shower!!</li>
            <li>This is a very fragrant shower gel that is also quite natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked and so is my better half!</li>
            <li>It smells exactly the same as a some citrus wipes or any dish washing soap.</li>
            <li>I wish I had tried a smaller bottle of this first.</li>
            <li>Another plus, the bottle is huge and will last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very tropical, but has kind of a weird edge to it that ruins the effect and keeps me from using it more regularly.</li>
            <li>So overall, I really like this body wash and would buy it again for myself or for friends/family</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft and the scent is citric.</li>
            <li>My husband and I really wanted to get away from all the chemicals in regular soaps and gels, and this is just the answer</li>
            <li>Upon getting the bottle, I opened it up to try the stuff and was unpleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>five days later I found that the smell went from that to a very rancid version of it.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>We feel so clean, it is not a cheap perfume type smell.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter loves the smell and wishes it came in a deodorant, lotion and possibly as a food item.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, cleans skin well without drying it out, rinses off well, and the pump always works without fail</li>
            <li>The earth AND the creatures that live in rain forests, such as those in Indonesia, are suffering greatly—once again losing to those who want only to profit.</li>
            <li>The large size is hard to find and it was worth ordering it online as it lasts really long.</li>
            <li>ship in quickly, but a little bit leaking, however it was wrapped with extra plastic bag, so I just cleaned it with water and wiped it dry.</li>

            <li> It lathers into a nice suds and feels very rich and creamy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Excellent gentle cleansing with light scent.</li>
            <li> Just bought it - and it is probably too soon to write but so far, it is very nice - developes a lot of soap on the body - and smells great, although light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on skin and smells great (not artificial or chemical).  </li>
            <li> and it makes me feel so fresh and clean!!!</li>
            <li> I like the citrus smell (kind of a sweet citrus) and it gets me good and clean.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my skin nice soft.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> There are some days when I notice my skin IS softer after using it, but it&#x27;s not like its a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; body wash and is making my skin amazingly better.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alba Botanica shower gels.  </li>
            <li> Now I have even more acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the remaining bottle, but will be cleaning a lot more often until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Would have given it another star if I were able to use the pump.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, which does not overpower my perfume.</li>
            <li> I hope I will continue to be able to get this as I don&#x27;t want to have to find another product that works as well as this does for me.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my kids</li>
            <li> I love the product and the scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> - I love it</li>
            <li> I really think Alba is a great brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the whole family</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bath gel for two years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love, love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and great scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this brand.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both use this product and love the smell.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time this morning and my first impression is that this is a wonderful way to wake up in the shower!</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t lather well, even when used with a loofa.  </li>
            <li> Not horrible, but probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright but do not expect anything more.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Love saying &amp;#34;very emollient&amp;#34; for anything I like now.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice when you are using it though because it really wakes you up and put you in a good mood.</li>
            <li> , it is so refreshing and smells heavenly with that Island Citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I love Alba products, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> The smell is great &amp; it works well, just doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the body wash-</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let everyone who reads this review that I am so happy and pleased with this all natural shower gel.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd..4th bottle, and find that it is the perfect solution for extremely dry menopausal skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for their slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is clean and fresh, and it is good for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 32-ounce pump bottle is fabulous; why don&#x27;t more companies do this?</li>
            <li> Even after just one use, I feel like my skin is already more moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> A light refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very citrus-y; but smells good.</li>
            <li> Best body wash we can find without so many harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> With the help of a pore brush, I find this product leaves my skin clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This product rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> the scent evaporates very quickly and do not lather well.</li>
            <li> This is way too strong.</li>
            <li> nice mild fresh scent  very agreeable product good bargain lots of product for the money  </li>
            <li> because of the way it was shipped.....part of the product leaked and covered the inside of the box....not cool and would expect better</li>
            <li> but that is fine since I then put on lotion, perfume, etc.</li>
            <li> The large quantity lasts a while and the pump is handy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but a little too runny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cruelty free too</li>
            <li> a nice soap that&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> The Island Citrus smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will probably try another scent of their body wash in the future.</li>
            <li> The Alba Botanica Island Citrus soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin silky smooth and clean with no dryness after bathing.  </li>
            <li> Alba&#x27;s Body Wash. The soap is a light citrus scent, not overpowering and it leaves your feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is very soothing on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product and size -- shipping is fast!</li>
            <li> I notice a significant difference when i use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> First off, the citrus smell is more a floral vomit citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> Clean citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> It produces a good amount of latter without using a lot of the gel.  </li>
            <li> and I love it so much .</li>
            <li> It is so emollient that you only have to use one pump to get a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild, moisturizing and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, but for some it might be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> OK for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> and I love that their products are all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than using products that contain natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Well worth shipping to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> It is ok product, I had expected more moisturizing and citrus sense,  </li>
            <li> Rinses clean and leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> My acne was pretty calm until I started using this.</li>
            <li> The smell is actually really nice - my fiance loves it - and it doesn&#x27;t linger on skin too long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sud very well, but that&#x27;s part of being most all Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> love this wish i had know a lot earlier</li>
            <li> This product lathers really well and the Hawaiian scent keeps you fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased</li>
            <li> The smell is great even though it does not last long.</li>
            <li> It is a minor infraction, to be sure, but something to take note of if you care about such things.  :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Alba Botanica Island Citrus, but I like it well enough when I think of the tradeoff! :-)</li>
            <li> Not only am I clean, but also I do not seem to be dusting away as quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product and used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It cleans and feels good on my slim, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve tried the orange emollient, and although it claims to be better for dry skin, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality as well, but not too keen on the scent, a little too Jones Soda like for my taste.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also very drying on the skin, it&#x27;s not moisturizing what so ever.</li>
            <li> I also use their Very Emollient Body Lotion - it works very well and is well-priced.  </li>
            <li> It smells too much like cough syrup.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> One pump is all you need for your whole body.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is very emollient and gently cleans your skin.</li>
            <li> It has the very unorange like smell, smells chalky..</li>
            <li> (I actually kind of regret getting such a big bottle now before testing it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive searched far and wide for nice citrus scented body wash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall fine, and if you&#x27;re watching your chemical intake, it&#x27;s probably a good option, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to my previous soap.</li>
            <li> It seems to have more moisturizing qualities than other shower gels I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use Alba&#x27;s lotions so was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I have been using body washes/gels for a long time and this Alba shower gel is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> like there&#x27;s enough soap and lather to clean with.  </li>
            <li> But because I have mild bacne, it irritated my back so much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it smooth and makes you actually feel clean.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me 5 times what the Bath &amp; Bodyworks bottles last for the same cost or less and the coconut oil in it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> However, this particular sent is not.</li>
            <li> Very affordable for the quality of this body wash that is gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love having a large pump bottle like this in the shower, and it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The citrus is blended with other light fragrances to give it an \\&quot;island\\&quot; scent that makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation instead of getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft after a shower!!</li>
            <li> This is a very fragrant shower gel that is also quite natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and so is my better half!</li>
            <li> It smells exactly the same as a some citrus wipes or any dish washing soap.</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried a smaller bottle of this first.</li>
            <li> Another plus, the bottle is huge and will last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very tropical, but has kind of a weird edge to it that ruins the effect and keeps me from using it more regularly.</li>
            <li> So overall, I really like this body wash and would buy it again for myself or for friends/family</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft and the scent is citric.</li>
            <li> My husband and I really wanted to get away from all the chemicals in regular soaps and gels, and this is just the answer</li>
            <li> Upon getting the bottle, I opened it up to try the stuff and was unpleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> five days later I found that the smell went from that to a very rancid version of it.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> We feel so clean, it is not a cheap perfume type smell.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves the smell and wishes it came in a deodorant, lotion and possibly as a food item.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, cleans skin well without drying it out, rinses off well, and the pump always works without fail</li>
            <li> The earth AND the creatures that live in rain forests, such as those in Indonesia, are suffering greatly—once again losing to those who want only to profit.</li>
            <li> The large size is hard to find and it was worth ordering it online as it lasts really long.</li>
            <li> ship in quickly, but a little bit leaking, however it was wrapped with extra plastic bag, so I just cleaned it with water and wiped it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and like it--it smells good and has a nice lather; however it&#x27;s left terrible soap scum in my shower.  </li>
            <li> If I were crazy rich I would prefer a high-end shower gel with expensive ingredients like essential oils--the kind that smell out of this world, but of course, that would cost four times as much money so I usually only purchase those shower gels in small bottles for an occasional splurge.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> This Alba gel, however, is a great everyday alternative to bar soap (which can be messy and inconvenient, and make it harder to clean your shower/tub due to soap scum)</li>
            <li> This will be staying in my subscribe-and-save list for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Palm oil is used in many products sold in the US, and its production is annihilating the rain forests, since big and small companies are buying it from local suppliers who are profiting from cutting down the natural rain forests and replacing them with palm oil tree plantations.</li>
            <li> I seem to be plagued with dry skin.</li>
            <li> in a limited access apartment??</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the last couple bottles we bought did not have a clean/simple label with solely orange and white colors on it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this product, but after giving it plenty of tries, I&#x27;m positive that this is the reason why my bacne has gotten so much worse.</li>
            <li> Came a little later</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband he has sensitive skin and its hard to find something that doesnt break him out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was using Dove soap previously and I never realized how it dried out my skin and left a yucky residue.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Will be dedicating this soap to other purposes.</li>
            <li> I actively avoid it if I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> This was the biggest one I can fin on amazon, but unfortunately it makes my skin very itchy</li>
            <li> and it is also a nice alternative to less expensive grocery store shower gels (which generally smell icky and artificial).  </li>
            <li> Also the Island Citrus scent reminds me of what hospitals use to clean things, like a badly masked Lysol smell.</li>
            <li> (we&#x27;ve gone through at least a dozen of these in the last few years).  </li>
            <li> Maybe the extra perfumes are annoying my skin, but I definitely notice more red spots and chicken skin (on places I&#x27;ve never gotten before!)</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight when I wash it off.</li>
            <li> We purchase this on Prime for a little savings.  </li>
            <li> so all in all a waste of money</li>
            <li> In Indonesia, the orangutans are being displaced, orphaned, killed.</li>
            <li> Well, I have been fooled a few times by reviews on Amazon and this happened to be another.  </li>
            <li> my parents order expensive crap all the time and ups leaves it in the middle of nowhere on an unsecured porch guarded by comatose cats.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy it again because I lose half of it on the shower floor on the way from the bottle to my body!</li>
            <li> then I had hoped for,also the bottle was messy from leakage,but still used it,awkward smell (popsicle) not really my smell,and thin watery wash</li>
            <li> There would be big bumps (painful ones) and small ones (like small pimples) on my back</li>
            <li> If you really, really like the scent, then you might be a little disappointed because it won&#x27;t stay with you past the shower, but then that might be a plus for people who like to put on perfume or scented lotion.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount lathers well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shower gel for the past maybe 3 years now.</li>
            <li> We both use this, and there is no soap scum to scrub off each week.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who likes Jason body washes or Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap Body wash may find that Alba&#x27;s product is comparable, at least I did.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, luxurious body wash produces miles of suds in a sweet-smelling lather.</li>
            <li> subtle scent of oranges and bubbly in the tub.</li>
            <li> I could not believe it, how could this go from bad to worse?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a very faint citrus smell (like an orange).</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t release for me which was annoying.</li>
            <li> It immediately brought me to my childhood and the terrible taste and smell of St. Joesph&#x27;s Children&#x27;s asprin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but still not something I would prefer to deal with.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and size -- shipping is fast!</li>
            <li> Very nice shower gel and was looking for something cruelty free.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I prefer unscented products. But the scent is not overpowering and does not linger.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this body gel! Works great and keeps my skin nice soft. It smells awesome, too!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  OK for sensitive skin.  I prefer this scent, but my husband prefers the mint (so we buy both).  We purchase this on Prime for a little savings.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft after a shower!! I notice a significant difference when i use it and when I don&#x27;t. I have pretty dry skin so this MATTERS</li>
            <li> love this wish i had know a lot earlier</li>
            <li> The smell is actually really nice - my fiance loves it - and it doesn&#x27;t linger on skin too long but it does make the bathroom smell amazing. I love having a large pump bottle like this in the shower, and it will last me a long time. (I actually kind of regret getting such a big bottle now before testing it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 3 stars because I do not think it&#x27;s great for skin. I think it&#x27;s causing me to break out on my arms and legs and giving me KP or just clogged pores or an allergic reaction or something. My skin feels tight when I wash it off. There are some days when I notice my skin IS softer after using it, but it&#x27;s not like its a &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; body wash and is making my skin amazingly better. Maybe the extra perfumes are annoying my skin, but I definitely notice more red spots and chicken skin (on places I&#x27;ve never gotten before!) when I use this. I actively avoid it if I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up for those on the search for the perfect body wash. I&#x27;d say keep looking - this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful shower gel.  Also is great for relaxing in the tub.  Rinses clean and leaves skin soft and smooth.  Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alba Botanica shower gels.  I use them in lieu of soap and they work great for shaving as well.  I&#x27;ve used them for several years now!</li>
            <li> I ran out of my Everyone soap and this was on sale with good reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much. The scent is very tropical, but has kind of a weird edge to it that ruins the effect and keeps me from using it more regularly. As it is, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go through a bottle this size. It&#x27;s overall fine, and if you&#x27;re watching your chemical intake, it&#x27;s probably a good option, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to my previous soap.</li>
            <li> This product lathers really well and the Hawaiian scent keeps you fresh for hours.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews, and it honestly lathers well and it&#x27;s got a very faint citrus smell (like an orange). But because I have mild bacne, it irritated my back so much. My acne was pretty calm until I started using this. There would be big bumps (painful ones) and small ones (like small pimples) on my back and they spread and kept going lower to my back. Now I have even more acne there then I ever did before! They itch and hurt. Ugh. I so wanted to like this product, but after giving it plenty of tries, I&#x27;m positive that this is the reason why my bacne has gotten so much worse. And it&#x27;s also very drying on the skin, it&#x27;s not moisturizing what so ever.</li>
            <li> Smells like orange Flintstones vitamins. It cleans and feels good on my slim, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> Came a little later then I had hoped for,also the bottle was messy from leakage,but still used it,awkward smell (popsicle) not really my smell,and thin watery wash,Will not order or buy this again...</li>
            <li> I have been using body washes/gels for a long time and this Alba shower gel is by far my favorite.  I love the scent and how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It produces a good amount of latter without using a lot of the gel.  This will be staying in my subscribe-and-save list for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> It seems to have more moisturizing qualities than other shower gels I&#x27;ve used.  I also use their Very Emollient Body Lotion - it works very well and is well-priced.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy both.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t sud very well, but that&#x27;s part of being most all Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  He says that his skin looks 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount lathers well.  Doesn&#x27;t smell very citrus-y; but smells good.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not as effective for the purpose of the product as their lavender, rose or mint, however the cleanliness is always an excellent after effect with their body wash regardless of aroma.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a body wash that would last all year.  This was the biggest one I can fin on amazon, but unfortunately it makes my skin very itchy so all in all a waste of money</li>
            <li> I regularly use Alba&#x27;s lotions so was excited to try this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and like it--it smells good and has a nice lather; however it&#x27;s left terrible soap scum in my shower.  I&#x27;ll use the remaining bottle, but will be cleaning a lot more often until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Would have given it another star if I were able to use the pump. It wouldn&#x27;t release for me which was annoying. I had to transfer it to another dispenser. I do love how it moisturizers tho and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I was using Dove soap previously and I never realized how it dried out my skin and left a yucky residue. I use this all over my body and my face and it makes me feel so fresh and clean!!! I was kinda nervous about the citrus smell, but I can assure you this stuff smells DIVINE! My 8 year old daughter loves the smell and wishes it came in a deodorant, lotion and possibly as a food item. Ha. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it smooth and makes you actually feel clean. Love this!!</li>
            <li> This brand is awesome. However, this particular sent is not. It smells too much like cough syrup. I would stick with the mint or the honey mango sent.</li>
            <li> honestly, this smells great and makes you silky smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is great--it actually relieved my sons skin allergy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is very soothing on dry skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash/shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, a!nd it&#x27;s cruelty free too</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd..4th bottle, and find that it is the perfect solution for extremely dry menopausal skin. I love the smell, which does not overpower my perfume. I hope I will continue to be able to get this as I don&#x27;t want to have to find another product that works as well as this does for me.</li>
            <li> nice mild fresh scent  very agreeable product good bargain lots of product for the money  this is one for everyone</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, luxurious body wash produces miles of suds in a sweet-smelling lather. It leaves skin feeling well-moisturized and with a light, pleasant scent. The 32-ounce pump bottle is fabulous; why don&#x27;t more companies do this?</li>
            <li> like the product, smell, and the overall feel......but I just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.....because of the way it was shipped.....part of the product leaked and covered the inside of the box....not cool and would expect better</li>
            <li> i always buy this brand.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin silky smooth and clean with no dryness after bathing.  Excellent gentle cleansing with light scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good on the skin, and leaves the skin nourished. I use this mostly for my kids and it&#x27;s perfect for their slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, gentle on the skin, and a good value...not to mention that the pump bottle is so convenient.</li>
            <li> Great body wash. Smells wonderful and softens skin too.</li>
            <li> I use the citrus scent to help wake me up in the morning--it works like a cup of coffee but without the jitters.  The citrus is blended with other light fragrances to give it an \\&quot;island\\&quot; scent that makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation instead of getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> Best body wash we can find without so many harsh chemicals. The smell is great too. Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me and I would try it and I love it so much . I will buy it again when it done.</li>
            <li> guess it is my fault for waiting until the last minute to get soap...cleanliness sometimes slips my mind. every alba botanica product I&#x27;ve ever purchased is wonderful, but for this purchase i HAD to sign for it. c&#x27;mon...for a $13??? in a limited access apartment?? i don&#x27;t get it. my parents order expensive crap all the time and ups leaves it in the middle of nowhere on an unsecured porch guarded by comatose cats. and one time ups left a wireless modem in a box on my boyfriend&#x27;s parents front steps...in the rain!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s a pH-balanced foaming soap, which is real nice for the body but I also use it for cleansing the face as well.  With the help of a pore brush, I find this product leaves my skin clean and healthy.  It&#x27;s mild, moisturizing and smells fresh.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve tried the orange emollient, and although it claims to be better for dry skin, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  In my opinion both mint and orange smell nice, but the mint is nicer to wake you up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping this helps.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was a great price.  I love the product and the scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this stuff smells SO GOOD - I love it and my boyfriend loves the way it smells on me too.  I will probably continue to buy this shower gel for a while.  I really think Alba is a great brand and I love that their products are all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> subtle scent of oranges and bubbly in the tub. a nice soap that&#x27;s gentle. It&#x27;s great for the whole family</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bath gel for two years and love it.  I will keep ordering.  Love, love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this body wash.  One pump is all you need for your whole body. Very moisturizing and great scent.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! This bottle will last me 5 times what the Bath &amp; Bodyworks bottles last for the same cost or less and the coconut oil in it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Love this product and this brand.  The Island Citrus smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and rejuvenating. Clean citrus scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very fragrant shower gel that is also quite natural.  It&#x27;s easy on skin and smells great (not artificial or chemical).  The large size is hard to find and it was worth ordering it online as it lasts really long.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I both use this product and love the smell. It&#x27;s a citrus floral smell and it smells divine. A little of this product goes a long way! Yes, it is very emollient and gently cleans your skin. This product rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product and used it for a long time. However, I recently learned that it contains palm oil products—the Laureth Sulfosuccinate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (and maybe others) that are listed on the bottle as ingredients. Palm oil is used in many products sold in the US, and its production is annihilating the rain forests, since big and small companies are buying it from local suppliers who are profiting from cutting down the natural rain forests and replacing them with palm oil tree plantations. The earth AND the creatures that live in rain forests, such as those in Indonesia, are suffering greatly—once again losing to those who want only to profit. In Indonesia, the orangutans are being displaced, orphaned, killed. I can no longer use products made with palm oil products without betraying my conscience. I&#x27;ve switched to a shower gel sold at Trader Joe&#x27;s, which contains no such products. I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Alba Botanica Island Citrus, but I like it well enough when I think of the tradeoff! :-)</li>
            <li> I am giving a generous two stars. I loved their mint soap, so I ordered the Orange. It immediately brought me to my childhood and the terrible taste and smell of St. Joesph&#x27;s Children&#x27;s asprin. It has the very unorange like smell, smells chalky.. I wanted it citrusy. Anyway try their mint, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time this morning and my first impression is that this is a wonderful way to wake up in the shower! The scent is amazing, but for some it might be a little overwhelming. If you really, really like the scent, then you might be a little disappointed because it won&#x27;t stay with you past the shower, but then that might be a plus for people who like to put on perfume or scented lotion. It lathers into a nice suds and feels very rich and creamy on the skin.  Even after just one use, I feel like my skin is already more moisturized and smooth. Another plus, the bottle is huge and will last for a very long time.  So overall, I really like this body wash and would buy it again for myself or for friends/family and if my opinion changes at all, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I love this bath and shower gel! I looked everywhere in stores and was relieved to find it online. Ive searched far and wide for nice citrus scented body wash but this is the only brand I could find that actually smelled like citrus. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very affordable for the quality of this body wash that is gentle on my sensitive skin.  There&#x27;s nothing better than using products that contain natural ingredients.  My skin is baby soft and the scent is citric.</li>
            <li> We both use this, and there is no soap scum to scrub off each week.  Well worth shipping to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent is too strong. It smells exactly the same as a some citrus wipes or any dish washing soap. They should make it softer and creamer with a hint of citrus. This is way too strong. I couldn&#x27;t wait until we finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the citrus smell (kind of a sweet citrus) and it gets me good and clean. The large quantity lasts a while and the pump is handy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but a little too runny. Not sure I will buy it again because I lose half of it on the shower floor on the way from the bottle to my body!</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t lather well, even when used with a loofa.  I have to pump it twice just to feel like there&#x27;s enough soap and lather to clean with.  Not horrible, but probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shower gel for the past maybe 3 years now. I love this shower gel. I like how it comes in a convenient pump bottle, the scent, and texture. It&#x27;s not drying on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it either.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased Alba&#x27;s Body Wash. The soap is a light citrus scent, not overpowering and it leaves your feeling clean. Anyone who likes Jason body washes or Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap Body wash may find that Alba&#x27;s product is comparable, at least I did. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will probably try another scent of their body wash in the future.</li>
            <li> Good amount for the price. Nice quality as well, but not too keen on the scent, a little too Jones Soda like for my taste. Will be dedicating this soap to other purposes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband he has sensitive skin and its hard to find something that doesnt break him out this is a great product the smell is not over barring a light citrus with is good.</li>
            <li> A light refreshing smell.  Good lather.  It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> The soap arrived and had leaked. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but still not something I would prefer to deal with. Also the Island Citrus scent reminds me of what hospitals use to clean things, like a badly masked Lysol smell. Would definitely not order this scent again.</li>
            <li> For the price and size it&#x27;s alright but do not expect anything more.  This is something you can buy at TJ Maxx or Marshall&#x27;s. the scent evaporates very quickly and do not lather well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, great dispenser, foamy. Love that it&#x27;s organic. Love saying &amp;#34;very emollient&amp;#34; for anything I like now. I&#x27;m hooked and so is my better half!</li>
            <li> Just bought it - and it is probably too soon to write but so far, it is very nice - developes a lot of soap on the body - and smells great, although light and refreshing.  Rinses nicely also.</li>
            <li> This body wash is very nice and creamy. A little goes a long way too so it will last a while. The smell is great even though it does not last long. By the time I get out of the shower, I can not smell it on me any longer but that is fine since I then put on lotion, perfume, etc. The smell is nice when you are using it though because it really wakes you up and put you in a good mood.</li>
            <li> I seem to be plagued with dry skin. The Alba Botanica Island Citrus soap is fantastic. Not only am I clean, but also I do not seem to be dusting away as quickly.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let everyone who reads this review that I am so happy and pleased with this all natural shower gel. My husband and I really wanted to get away from all the chemicals in regular soaps and gels, and this is just the answer, it is so refreshing and smells heavenly with that Island Citrus scent. We feel so clean, it is not a cheap perfume type smell. It is so emollient that you only have to use one pump to get a nice rich lather. This is something we will always have in our home.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Woodard</li>
            <li> It is ok product, I had expected more moisturizing and citrus sense,  bur it&#x27;s ok, not too bad. ship in quickly, but a little bit leaking, however it was wrapped with extra plastic bag, so I just cleaned it with water and wiped it dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful size ! I love this size and nice shower gel.  I just wished it had a smell.  Also, no animal testing product.</li>
            <li> I love Alba products, and this is no exception. The island citrus smells great--sweet but not too perfumey--and lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this shower gel.  I think it is great, too, for the price.  It has a nice scent, cleans skin well without drying it out, rinses off well, and the pump always works without fail (we&#x27;ve gone through at least a dozen of these in the last few years).  If I were crazy rich I would prefer a high-end shower gel with expensive ingredients like essential oils--the kind that smell out of this world, but of course, that would cost four times as much money so I usually only purchase those shower gels in small bottles for an occasional splurge.  This Alba gel, however, is a great everyday alternative to bar soap (which can be messy and inconvenient, and make it harder to clean your shower/tub due to soap scum) and it is also a nice alternative to less expensive grocery store shower gels (which generally smell icky and artificial).  The smell of this is clean and fresh, and it is good for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the last couple bottles we bought did not have a clean/simple label with solely orange and white colors on it.  It also had some silly looking lettering in pink which messes with the \\&quot;decor minimalism\\&quot; for those of us who care about that kind of thing. It is a minor infraction, to be sure, but something to take note of if you care about such things.  :)</li>
            <li> Well, I have been fooled a few times by reviews on Amazon and this happened to be another.  The reviews mention a good citrus scent, good cleaning and hydrating power with an economical price.  Upon getting the bottle, I opened it up to try the stuff and was unpleasantly surprised.  First off, the citrus smell is more a floral vomit citrus smell.  I decided to push through it but five days later I found that the smell went from that to a very rancid version of it.  I could not believe it, how could this go from bad to worse? Well, it did . Stay away!</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried a smaller bottle of this first. The smell is great &amp; it works well, just doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the body wash- so I feel like I&#x27;m using a lot of it.</li>
