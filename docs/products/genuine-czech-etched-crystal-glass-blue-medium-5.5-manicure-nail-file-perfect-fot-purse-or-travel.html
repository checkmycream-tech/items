            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li>This one seems superior.  </li>
            <li>so far I am very happy with my purchase :) I tried it this morning and worked wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love these too!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love this nail file!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as effective as day one.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality file, with the file part etched in rather than being sprayed on grit that falls off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, but even more important, it works beautifully!</li>
            <li>So I improvise and now keep the new one in a toothbrush travel case as is the perfect size and shape to fit the file into.</li>
            <li>I love this type of nail file.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth filing surface.</li>
            <li>Before I did, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the hype was all about</li>
            <li>Great size for a purse or shaving kit and really like the protective sleeve too.</li>
            <li>This file has lasted me a lonnnnnng time and it makes the edges of my nails so smooth!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you order one that is crystal like this one and not one that is just glazed.</li>
            <li>Very unique and durable.</li>
            <li>It felt &#x27;cheap&#x27; and it looked like a very cheap version of some others I have used.</li>
            <li>B005WTITNO Cheeky Crystal Nail Files, Set of 3 (Sun, Pink Panther and Ocean Breeze)]], are the best nail files I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>This came Just as described and works quick and leaves free edge very smooth, we will see how it hold up.</li>
            <li>Leaves nails smooth and is surprisingly strong for glass.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and sterilize.</li>
            <li>A great product - seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li>The etched glass won&#x27;t wear away (unlike some cheap Revlon or dollar-store nail files &amp; emery</li>
            <li>I originally bought some for my mom and myself from a store.</li>
            <li>I love this nail file so much that now I give these files as gifts.</li>
            <li>It will only let me file my nails in one direction which is good</li>
            <li>They were quick in their response to me and I am satisfied with the service and the nail file as it is so much easier on the nails</li>
            <li>Great color, sharp file.  </li>
            <li>Both brands file nails quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with my nails shredding at the ends, and this has really helped with that.  </li>
            <li>It took over a month to arrive but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They were great (now hard to find), but this glass file is by far nicer and works more quickly.  </li>
            <li>it seems very well made, with filing surface on both sides.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very \\&quot;smooth,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I bought this exact same file on ebay.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be how long it really lasts..</li>
            <li>The glass handles are relatively smooth and just slightly thicker than the etched part (not contoured at all), so I didn&#x27;t find it the easiest nail file to grip.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>The grit is much finer and actually polishes the ends of your nails.  </li>
            <li>The Czech version is more of a matte finish, but I found it harder to grip since it&#x27;s slightly</li>
            <li>Czech file arrived quickly from an Amazon warehouse (beware that some sellers may ship from overseas and it may take a few weeks to get).  </li>
            <li>and my last one broke because it was only in a soft case.  </li>

            <li> I love this nail file so much that now I give these files as gifts.</li>
            <li> The shipping was prompt  (with Prime) it seems very well made, with filing surface on both sides. I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and seems like it will last. I&#x27;ll update in a couple of months</li>
            <li> It took over a month to arrive but was worth the wait. I even had contacted the seller to question whether it was lost. They were quick in their response to me and I am satisfied with the service and the nail file as it is so much easier on the nails then a regular one. Works well with my Jamberry wraps as I am a consultant and offer a crystal nail file as an alternative for smoother nails.</li>
            <li> I love this type of nail file. Easy to clean and sterilize. Nice smooth filing surface. I originally bought some for my mom and myself from a store. We both broke ours. Thankfully I found these replacements on Amazon. I love these too!</li>
            <li> Great color, sharp file.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Have had a few of these type files.  This one seems superior.  The real test will be how long it really lasts..</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same file on ebay.  Before I did, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the hype was all about but I was seeing them a lot on polish painting tutorials on youtube.  I was using your standard 4-sided file from the drugstore for years.  I got mine in the mail yesterday and...wow.  The grit is much finer and actually polishes the ends of your nails.  Since the glass is etched, none of the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; is going to come off and lodge in your nail and cause splitting or peeling.  It&#x27;s very nice.  A long long time ago, I used to buy something called Ruby Stone files (they&#x27;re pink and ceramic, I think).  They were great (now hard to find), but this glass file is by far nicer and works more quickly.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Just hopes it works It will only let me file my nails in one direction which is good I think?</li>
            <li> how can she write a bad book?  she does here</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that I wish it came with a hard case.  I like to keep it in my purse and my last one broke because it was only in a soft case.  So I improvise and now keep the new one in a toothbrush travel case as is the perfect size and shape to fit the file into.</li>
            <li> Never going to need another nail file again! Great size for a purse or shaving kit and really like the protective sleeve too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the reviews.  They indicated that the filing part was imbedded throughout the glass, not just on the glass surface and therefore it would last.  I used it twice and on the second time the filing surface completely wore off, rendering the file useless.</li>
            <li> This file has lasted me a lonnnnnng time and it makes the edges of my nails so smooth!  It&#x27;s helps to prevent hangnails.</li>
            <li> A great product - seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for a friend after I picked up one for myself at a street festival. I&#x27;ve had it over a year and it&#x27;s still as effective as day one. Leaves nails smooth and is surprisingly strong for glass. Make sure you order one that is crystal like this one and not one that is just glazed.</li>
            <li> beautiful and functional! Very unique and durable.</li>
            <li> great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I have a huge problem with my nails shredding at the ends, and this has really helped with that.  This is a nice quality file, with the file part etched in rather than being sprayed on grit that falls off.  I&#x27;ve had this for months, using it a couple times a week and its still in great shape.</li>
            <li> This Czech nail file, and the very similar Cheeky crystal files [[ASIN:B005WTITNO Cheeky Crystal Nail Files, Set of 3 (Sun, Pink Panther and Ocean Breeze)]], are the best nail files I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In common to both:&lt;br /&gt;*  The etched glass won&#x27;t wear away (unlike some cheap Revlon or dollar-store nail files &amp; emery boards).&lt;br /&gt;*  Both brands file nails quickly.  Front &amp; back are etched the same, but the grain is a bit rougher towards the handle &amp; smoother towards the tip.  The Cheeky files have a similar grain variation but are a bit rougher overall.&lt;br /&gt;*  Crystal nail files are a bit thicker than metal nail files.  This Czech file is about 1/16\\&quot;.  The Cheeky is about 50% thicker (about 3/32\\&quot;), heavier, and may be a tad less fragile.&lt;br /&gt;*  The glass handles are relatively smooth and just slightly thicker than the etched part (not contoured at all), so I didn&#x27;t find it the easiest nail file to grip.  The Czech version is more of a matte finish, but I found it harder to grip since it&#x27;s slightly thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Cheeky version, I got a set of 3 for about the same price as one of these Czech files (your price may vary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that it matters, but the Cheeky version has a Cheeky brand logo printed on the handle; there is no logo on the Czech file (just a printed \\&quot;Made in Czech Republic\\&quot; label on the plastic sleeve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Czech file arrived quickly from an Amazon warehouse (beware that some sellers may ship from overseas and it may take a few weeks to get).  The Cheeky files I ordered came from overseas and were just taped together and shipped in a bubble envelope with a little extra bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> This came Just as described and works quick and leaves free edge very smooth, we will see how it hold up. so far I am very happy with my purchase :) I tried it this morning and worked wonderful. I just wish it had a harder protective case.Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s really pretty, but even more important, it works beautifully! It&#x27;s very \\&quot;smooth,\\&quot; but it definitely does the job. It&#x27;s etched to give it it&#x27;s abrasive quality. I&#x27;ve ever dropped it, but I suppose it&#x27;s breakable. It comes with a protective plastic sleeve, and I keep it in there when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> Love this nail file!  May have to order the smaller size to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to arrive in the mail.  The glass file was not as heavy as the one I previously used. It felt &#x27;cheap&#x27; and it looked like a very cheap version of some others I have used. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
