            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>this wrap is the perfect weight!</li>
            <li>and I think that the best way to wash it - is hand wash and hang to dry...to avoid tearing.</li>
            <li>This one fits great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>The length is perfect.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s perfect for my gym bag.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for cushy terry for absorbency, this is NOT the wrap.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>and she says it works great for her.</li>
            <li>She says it has great coverage.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>im happy with it</li>
            <li>You cannot see through it so for getting out of the shower then put it on for a cover up its great for that.</li>
            <li>Great for coming out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love this wrap!!  </li>
            <li>I love the color and the length is perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and airy perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>It would of been good to have it a lot thicker</li>
            <li>was not what i was looking for out of the shower..not good for petite women</li>
            <li>Again, for the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fair deal</li>
            <li>Very high quality material and fits great!  </li>
            <li>Nice bath wrap</li>
            <li>You would have to extend the Velcro on your own.</li>
            <li>I liked the color and length</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;OR for air drying on a warm day ...</li>
            <li>this wrap is very comfortable; love it!</li>
            <li>Would love to have more just like this!</li>
            <li>I love getting out of the shower and wrapping in this spa wrap.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>the addition of an adjustable closure and more overlap this would be better.</li>
            <li>although I thought it would hold up better than it has.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I wish the Velcro piece was longer so that it would be adjustable to more sizes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to go in the pool to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>but for a cover up its ok.</li>
            <li>I am also glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The top is elasticized, and is a one-size-fits-all product.</li>
            <li>However, my sister was able to wear it.</li>
            <li>All in all, there are not enough words to express what a great purchase this was!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I can add more velcro to match my size.  </li>
            <li>, I will be ordering more of these to have on hand.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I just love this spa wrap.  </li>
            <li>I love the color, the cancer emblem and length of the wrap.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived promptly and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>But for the most part the material is good and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Now, its not thick, or very good quality; but it is something I think you will enjoy, and it meets its expectation.</li>
            <li>I would be better if the Velcro strip was longer so that it would fit more sizes.  </li>
            <li>And if you are a large don&#x27;t look for this to be a good cover up...</li>
            <li>It is very soft material and very nice color.</li>
            <li>I think a more accurate description is one-size-fits-most.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a light cover up.</li>
            <li>I do like the light weight of it; I like the length, and I would have given it 5 stars if they&#x27;d made a strip so people who are size 4 or 6 could utilize the velcro without the top &#x27;falling to my knees&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>very nice and soft but would be easier to wear with Velcro.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great!!!</li>
            <li>so it is really easy to put on.</li>
            <li>this review is not for use as a drying towel, but simply as an easy to use wrap.</li>
            <li>I Love my Spa wrap, it&#x27;s light weight and comfortable</li>
            <li>so I could wear this easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easier than a robe because you keeps arms free for doing hair without flappy robe arms in the way etc&lt;</li>
            <li>so it could not be made to fit me.  </li>
            <li>this probably won&#x27;t fit you.  </li>
            <li>My wife left hers at a hotel and this was a great replacement.</li>
            <li>also wanted a light weight wrap to put in my gym bag...</li>
            <li>I purchased this wrap for 2 reasons, I love purchasing items supporting such a great cause, and deemed useful.</li>
            <li>I am 6&#x27; tall and large chested and this wrapped around perfect and even came down to my knees.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I know how to sew</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s adequate for a cover up for AFTER drying off if you want to walk from bathroom to another room</li>
            <li>Its loose fitting, very comfortable, and affordable.</li>
            <li>Would definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>Pretty color though!</li>
            <li>This was worth  the money.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a nice gift for Mother&#x27;s Day next year.</li>
            <li>The reaction I got was better than I expected, and the wrap itself was better made than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; solid, but light-weight wrap.</li>
            <li>even though the price is a lot cheaper than the some other ones, I gave it 4 star since the quality is not too good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wearing it right now.  </li>
            <li>long soft works great</li>
            <li>Thanks for your quick service.</li>
            <li>I still like it just wish it lasted longer but certainly got my monies worth out of it</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that as both were side by side in their sealed bags, this one was 1/2 the size of the Arus.  </li>
            <li>Would function better and last longer with buttons.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It is very soft and absorbent and so far has withstood many washings without fading or unraveling.</li>
            <li>The material is also not the best; very thin and not absorbent.</li>
            <li>It does make a nice cover-up to use after drying off after a shower with a good, thick towel, while you apply makeup, dry your hair, etc.  </li>
            <li>This is good for small to medium frame bodies and those with ability to sew.  </li>
            <li>but it is a bit large.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love it\\&quot; if... the wrap was a little shorter and if the velcro was a little longer so it fit more snug around me.  </li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s really meant for that.</li>
            <li>When getting ready</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re seeking something reasonably price and supports breast cancer, this is the item for you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>Not enough velcro for snugging, so do not feel secure.  </li>
            <li>Great idea but poorly made with the skimping on velcro and wrap around material.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is a see through - very thing but does the job.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item before and it is much lower quality now.</li>
            <li>Very scratchy.</li>
            <li>wash well and hold up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If someone is really large, then I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s so great either because if I match up the velcro to how they have it, not enough fabric overlaps.  </li>
            <li>Pretty light weight so it doesn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li>Very soft and machine washable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of very thin like a cheap towel.</li>
            <li>The first never arrived, the second was so small it was hilarious!  </li>
            <li>This wrap is a bit on the light side, not very absorbent.  </li>
            <li>light weight just what I wanted to take to the health club for the sauna dries fast pleanty big enough</li>
            <li>I live in Texas in a warmer climate</li>
            <li>I wanted something quick for swimming as I have to dry myself and my kids off as well.</li>
            <li>velcro tab is also very near the edges of the wrap</li>
            <li>I really like the light pink color and lightness of the material, but having a small frame (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;), this is really really large on me.  </li>
            <li>This was just what I was looking for: not too heavy and easy to wear with the Velcro closure.  </li>
            <li>The terry cloth could have been thicker if you use it as a swimsuit coverup, because it gets soaking wet too quickly, but wanted to support Susan G. Komen Foundation.</li>
            <li>Purchased this wrap as a replacement to my current one that was getting pretty old.  </li>
            <li>and I have to pull it as far as it will go.</li>
            <li>This is one gift that made her gasp out loud.</li>
            <li>but she seems to like it alot and uses it quite frequently.</li>
            <li>This wrap is quite thin, but is still a nice item.</li>
            <li>would have liked it to be a little  heavier very thin but ok for the money.</li>
            <li>The velcro section is small so it couldn&#x27;t be adjusted to fit her.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Pretty in pink....</li>
            <li>I know because it barely covers.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It is thin but as a wrap, that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>nothing special but too small only wish they had sizes</li>
            <li>Not good for drying off after a shower, but just fine as a cover-up after toweling off.</li>
            <li>The wrap iteself is pink and kind of thin, and has a velcro closure.</li>
            <li>This is made of Very rough material, obviously works fine, but not comfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>(She is not small, but not large either.)</li>

            <li> If someone is really large, then I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s so great either because if I match up the velcro to how they have it, not enough fabric overlaps.  </li>
            <li> Pretty light weight so it doesn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> Very soft and machine washable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of very thin like a cheap towel.</li>
            <li> The first never arrived, the second was so small it was hilarious!  </li>
            <li> This wrap is a bit on the light side, not very absorbent.  </li>
            <li> light weight just what I wanted to take to the health club for the sauna dries fast pleanty big enough</li>
            <li> I live in Texas in a warmer climate</li>
            <li> I wanted something quick for swimming as I have to dry myself and my kids off as well.</li>
            <li> velcro tab is also very near the edges of the wrap</li>
            <li> I really like the light pink color and lightness of the material, but having a small frame (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;), this is really really large on me.  </li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for: not too heavy and easy to wear with the Velcro closure.  </li>
            <li> The terry cloth could have been thicker if you use it as a swimsuit coverup, because it gets soaking wet too quickly, but wanted to support Susan G. Komen Foundation.</li>
            <li> Purchased this wrap as a replacement to my current one that was getting pretty old.  </li>
            <li> and I have to pull it as far as it will go.</li>
            <li> This is one gift that made her gasp out loud.</li>
            <li> but she seems to like it alot and uses it quite frequently.</li>
            <li> This wrap is quite thin, but is still a nice item.</li>
            <li> would have liked it to be a little  heavier very thin but ok for the money.</li>
            <li> The velcro section is small so it couldn&#x27;t be adjusted to fit her.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Pretty in pink....</li>
            <li> I know because it barely covers.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is thin but as a wrap, that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> nothing special but too small only wish they had sizes</li>
            <li> Not good for drying off after a shower, but just fine as a cover-up after toweling off.</li>
            <li> The wrap iteself is pink and kind of thin, and has a velcro closure.</li>
            <li> This is made of Very rough material, obviously works fine, but not comfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> (She is not small, but not large either.)</li>
            <li> Also, while it was large, there was very little overlap of material.  </li>
            <li> but too large and too small a piece of velcro</li>
            <li> I thought for my small and very slim daughter (100 pounds)</li>
            <li> There would be a large client base that would not be able to use this.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it well-constructed, but it boasts the little pink ribbon, which is a cause very near and dear to her heart.</li>
            <li> I can dry naturally and not have to worry about it falling down.</li>
            <li> Not a thick heavy terry like my other one and which I prefer.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cover-up wrap, for walking round the spa/ locker room, round your house, while getting ready doing hair and make up etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I understand why some reviews complain that the wrap is a little big.  </li>
            <li> The little pink ribbon fell off as soon as I took it out of the package, but that is the only problem I see.</li>
            <li> Functional, but the velcro tears up the towel is being washed (even when it is closed).</li>
            <li> A little on the long side</li>
            <li> Should order a larger size than you wear; it runs small.</li>
            <li> the pink ribbon reminds me to do my breast exams and get my mammograms!</li>
            <li> While the soft pink of this wrap is exactly what I had hoped for, I was not impressed with the terry quality - thin and not at all absorbent.</li>
            <li> This wrap is very thin so that you don&#x27;t get too hot wearing it</li>
            <li> My previous one was softer.</li>
            <li> For me though I just put the Velcro as tight as it will go</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; tall, so it is difficult to find a wrap that is long enough-</li>
            <li> I wish the fabric was a little heavier.</li>
            <li> The material is a little lightweight</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago but the breast cancer ribbon fell off after a few months.</li>

            <li> Weird.  </li>
            <li> Very thin terry.  </li>
            <li> It was very thin material.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> While the soft pink of this wrap is exactly what I had hoped for, I was not impressed with the terry quality - thin and not at all absorbent. It does make a nice cover-up to use after drying off after a shower with a good, thick towel, while you apply makeup, dry your hair, etc.  But if you&#x27;re looking for cushy terry for absorbency, this is NOT the wrap. Dissapointing.</li>
            <li> I love this wrap!!  The only thing I wish were different is the velcro needs to be alittle longer. Other than that it is great!!!</li>
            <li> This wrap is quite thin, but is still a nice item. Not good for drying off after a shower, but just fine as a cover-up after toweling off.</li>
            <li> This is made of Very rough material, obviously works fine, but not comfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend.</li>
            <li> Product terry cloth &amp; thin. Pink ribbon fell off after 1 washing in cold &amp; delicate.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed:(</li>
            <li> I love getting out of the shower and wrapping in this spa wrap. I can dry naturally and not have to worry about it falling down. It&#x27;s light and airy perfect for me. I love it</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.  I have washed this product twice and it is still holding up.</li>
            <li> This was worth  the money. I simply love it. I am a wheelchair user so it is really easy to put on.</li>
            <li> There are reviews for this with people disappointed it doesn&#x27;t dry well. And I would agree. However I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s really meant for that. It&#x27;s a cover-up wrap, for walking round the spa/ locker room, round your house, while getting ready doing hair and make up etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this review is not for use as a drying towel, but simply as an easy to use wrap. When getting ready it&#x27;s easier than a robe because you keeps arms free for doing hair without flappy robe arms in the way etc&lt;br /&gt;It is thin but as a wrap, that&#x27;s okay. I thought for my small and very slim daughter (100 pounds) and it&#x27;s too big for her. The velcro section is small so it couldn&#x27;t be adjusted to fit her.&lt;br /&gt;The velcro tab is also very near the edges of the wrap so it doesn&#x27;t overlap a lot, meaning you have to be strategic with where you close it as it will flap open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the addition of an adjustable closure and more overlap this would be better.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for: not too heavy and easy to wear with the Velcro closure.  Seems to be sized generously so fits a 36 D with no problem.</li>
            <li> Nice bath wrap although I thought it would hold up better than it has. I washed it and now the Velcro is bent so every time I put it on I have to turn it closer to the back so it doesn&#x27;t hurt! I still like it just wish it lasted longer but certainly got my monies worth out of it I still use it but alternate between that and a robe.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and she says it works great for her. She says it has great coverage.</li>
            <li> A little on the long side but that&#x27;s okay. I wish the Velcro piece was longer so that it would be adjustable to more sizes. Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a size lg-xlg 12-14 and this fits perfectly around me, covers all my areas! It is very soft material and very nice color. I can&#x27;t wait to go in the pool to be able to use it. Would definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Arus Women&#x27;s Turkish Cotton Bath Wrap and this Betty Dain Terry Spa Wrap. Both arrived today. The first thing I noticed was that as both were side by side in their sealed bags, this one was 1/2 the size of the Arus.  I opened it and was shocked at how thin this wrap is. It won&#x27;t dry you, it&#x27;s more of a light cover up. I tried it on and it has a bit of a gap.  If you are a thin person, it may cover you. If you just want something thin for travel then this will work.</li>
            <li> long soft works great im happy with it and i like that its breast cancer awareness perfect for out of the shower</li>
            <li> Awesome wrap - I wear it in the locker room at the gym - i hate using the towels that they provide.  Very soft and machine washable!</li>
            <li> I would be better if the Velcro strip was longer so that it would fit more sizes.  This was too big for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty light weight so it doesn&#x27;t stay closed that well</li>
            <li> The terry cloth could have been thicker if you use it as a swimsuit coverup, because it gets soaking wet too quickly, but wanted to support Susan G. Komen Foundation.</li>
            <li> The thickness is not there but for a cover up its ok. You cannot see through it so for getting out of the shower then put it on for a cover up its great for that. It would of been good to have it a lot thicker but I knew this when I bought it. I still like it. I am also glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another one if I wanted to, or for a gift.</li>
            <li> this wrap is very comfortable; love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted something quick for swimming as I have to dry myself and my kids off as well. Velcro is thick and holds well in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skinny girl, and this is just too big for me.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and almost 130lbs.  There would be a large client base that would not be able to use this.  Not a one-size-fits-all product.</li>
            <li> I would title this review, \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; if... the wrap was a little shorter and if the velcro was a little longer so it fit more snug around me.  But for the most part the material is good and the price was right.  I think this would be a nice gift for Mother&#x27;s Day next year.</li>
            <li> This wrap was too big for me. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and 145 lbs and I have to pull it as far as it will go. I bought this a while ago but the breast cancer ribbon fell off after a few months. The material is also not the best; very thin and not absorbent. It does the job though as I only wear it while I&#x27;m doing my hair once I get out of the shower before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> Fell apart around the elastic almost immediately after 1st wash.</li>
            <li> This was part of my sister&#x27;s Christmas gift and, when she saw it, she got teary-eyed. She absolutely loved it! This is one gift that made her gasp out loud. Not only is it well-constructed, but it boasts the little pink ribbon, which is a cause very near and dear to her heart. Part of the proceeds of the purchase of this wrap go to fund research for a cure. The wrap iteself is pink and kind of thin, and has a velcro closure. The top is elasticized, and is a one-size-fits-all product. I think a more accurate description is one-size-fits-most. If you are a plus-size person, this may not be the wrap for you. However, my sister was able to wear it. (She is not small, but not large either.) All in all, there are not enough words to express what a great purchase this was! The reaction I got was better than I expected, and the wrap itself was better made than I thought it would be. I have never given my sister a gift that got this reaction, but this did. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for coming out of the shower.</li>
            <li> was not what i was looking for out of the shower..not good for petite women</li>
            <li> Pretty in pink....but too large and too small a piece of velcro so it could not be made to fit me.  Also, while it was large, there was very little overlap of material.  Weird.  Pretty color though!</li>
            <li> even though the price is a lot cheaper than the some other ones, I gave it 4 star since the quality is not too good. It&#x27;s kind of very thin like a cheap towel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wrap for 2 reasons, I love purchasing items supporting such a great cause, and deemed useful. I purchased this item to use while at the gym. Its loose fitting, very comfortable, and affordable. Now, its not thick, or very good quality; but it is something I think you will enjoy, and it meets its expectation. If you&#x27;re seeking something reasonably price and supports breast cancer, this is the item for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the material...scratchy!</li>
            <li> I love the color and the length is perfect! I have been looking for one of these for over a year!</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; solid, but light-weight wrap. I live in the southwest, where it seldom gets too cold...this wrap is the perfect weight! It&#x27;s not see-through either! I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I really like the light pink color and lightness of the material, but having a small frame (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;), this is really really large on me.  If someone is really large, then I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s so great either because if I match up the velcro to how they have it, not enough fabric overlaps.  This is good for small to medium frame bodies and those with ability to sew.  Luckily I know how to sew so I can add more velcro to match my size.  I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Functional, but the velcro tears up the towel is being washed (even when it is closed). Would function better and last longer with buttons. Should order a larger size than you wear; it runs small.</li>
            <li> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PO6NRE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5</li>
            <li> I Love my Spa wrap, it&#x27;s light weight and comfortable, I will be ordering more of these to have on hand. Thanks for your quick service.</li>
            <li> I thought the velcro strips would be &#x27;longer&#x27; and reach around so I could wear this easily.  What I ended up doing is just wrapping it around like a towel in order to not &#x27;swim&#x27; in the wrap.  I do like the light weight of it; I like the length, and I would have given it 5 stars if they&#x27;d made a strip so people who are size 4 or 6 could utilize the velcro without the top &#x27;falling to my knees&#x27;.  Again, for the price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fair deal and I&#x27;m wearing it right now.  ;-)</li>
            <li> This wrap is a bit on the light side, not very absorbent.  But it does the job, runs very big.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas in a warmer climate so this is what I was looking for.  I am a size 4/6 and I understand why some reviews complain that the wrap is a little big.  For me though I just put the Velcro as tight as it will go and I have no problems.  I gave the wrap 4 stars because of the sizing though.  They should make the Velcro strip longer to accommodate smaller women.  If you are much smaller than a size 4 this probably won&#x27;t fit you.  You would have to extend the Velcro on your own.</li>
            <li> It does what it suppose to and fits well if you don&#x27;t move.  Just walking around the opening gaps and the wrap slips especially the back area.  Not enough velcro for snugging, so do not feel secure.  Great idea but poorly made with the skimping on velcro and wrap around material.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This wrap is very thin so that you don&#x27;t get too hot wearing it but it is a bit large.  I have a 36&amp;#34; chest and I still have a hard time keeping this on.  So if you are a smaller person, I would not recommned this one.</li>
            <li> Very thin terry.  Not a thick heavy terry like my other one and which I prefer.  The Velcro strip is very short so not as adjustable as I would like.  And if you are a large don&#x27;t look for this to be a good cover up...I know because it barely covers.</li>
            <li> light weight just what I wanted to take to the health club for the sauna dries fast pleanty big enough</li>
            <li> I received this product in a secured package. The fabric is a see through - very thing but does the job. I use it when I get my facials. Big enough to wrap around. I wish the fabric was a little heavier. I am yet to wash it and I think that the best way to wash it - is hand wash and hang to dry...to avoid tearing.</li>
            <li> This is my third attempt at getting a spa wrap for the gym.  The first never arrived, the second was so small it was hilarious!  This one fits great!  I am 6&#x27; tall and large chested and this wrapped around perfect and even came down to my knees.  The little pink ribbon fell off as soon as I took it out of the package, but that is the only problem I see.</li>
            <li> My wife left hers at a hotel and this was a great replacement. It is very soft and absorbent and so far has withstood many washings without fading or unraveling.</li>
            <li> would have liked it to be a little  heavier very thin but ok for the money. washes well. it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I just love this spa wrap.  I love the color, the cancer emblem and length of the wrap.  It is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped and received ahead of schedule. This was a gift for my wife. The material is a little lightweight but she seems to like it alot and uses it quite frequently.</li>
            <li> was alright nothing special but too small only wish they had sizes instead one size fits all</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  It&#x27;s a little thin, but I still like it!</li>
            <li> very nice and soft but would be easier to wear with Velcro.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before and it is much lower quality now. Very scratchy. My previous one was softer.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very high quality material and fits great!  The length is perfect.  Falls below the knee.  Would love to have more just like this!</li>
            <li> It was very thin material.  Pictures made it look nicer than it is.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order again if I knew.</li>
            <li> Works well. A little thin but that&#x27;s perfect for my gym bag. I liked the color and length so I can walk around without flashing people in the locker room.</li>
            <li> I use these robes in my spa.&lt;br /&gt;They wash well and hold up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> ... don&#x27;t expect this item to perform like a bath towel...it&#x27;s too thin...&lt;br /&gt;BUT, it&#x27;s adequate for a cover up for AFTER drying off if you want to walk from bathroom to another room&lt;br /&gt;OR for air drying on a warm day ...</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; tall, so it is difficult to find a wrap that is long enough- this one does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted a light weight wrap to put in my gym bag...this one was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Plus the pink ribbon reminds me to do my breast exams and get my mammograms!</li>
            <li> Purchased this wrap as a replacement to my current one that was getting pretty old.  The item arrived promptly and I am satisfied.</li>
