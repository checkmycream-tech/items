            <li>I live in a very dry climate and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exciting to me.</li>

            <li>Price is right and arrived promptly as promised</li>
            <li>I love the fact that a little goes a long way, it is natural and it makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great stuffâ€¦comparable to much more expensive products</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to make you look ten years younger, but it&#x27;s great stuff just the same:)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li>a bit oily feeling at first</li>
            <li>that it is measured applications as I tend to use more of a product than is necessary</li>
            <li>My first thought was that it was oiley took about 10 minutes or so to soak in</li>
            <li>I first used it under and around eyes, but now include my face.</li>
            <li>it has stopped the dry patches that I have had in the past, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>, I only spent the money because I was so impressed with even the small free sample I recieived in the mail.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This stays on the surface too much and doesn&#x27;t soak in</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle and did not notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>I think they are using too much at a time.  </li>
            <li>It stayed very oily.</li>

            <li>With one use, the dry skin flaking began to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;Using this product greatly improves general skin tone and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to find the next bottle in a larger size.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, great in this cold weather</li>
            <li>Cheaper to buy it from the company that developed it rather tha Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural.</li>
            <li>I use it all over my face each day, probably less than a pump&#x27;s worth, and it has lasted me months.  </li>
            <li>My naturally oilier areas don&#x27;t seem to handle the oils as well after constant use.</li>
            <li>but I have really dry skin, especially winter months, and this product really hydrates my face.  </li>
            <li>This is the only facial product that doesn&#x27;t dry out my 52 year old skin.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out (which some products do) and it is not full of Chemicals which is the main selling point for me.</li>
            <li> I use it as a night treatment moisturizer, mainly on my hands and a just a little on the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at other reviewers remarks about the heaviness of the oil.  </li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> but it sinks in later, definitely can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really no different than any other oil - could use baby oil with the same effect.  </li>
            <li> I am over 70 and there is nothing in the long run you can do to prevent aging</li>
            <li> But by the next day my skin is dry again (I have very average skin..not too dry, not oily).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> it seems to have made my dark spot fade somewhat.</li>
            <li> It has made my dark spot fade.</li>
            <li> I feel like I look &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and my complexion is a little brighter.</li>
            <li> A little oily, but still waiting for results.</li>
            <li> , IT IS TO OILY AND HEAVY.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy again, but like others, wish it were less expensive (hint, hint.)</li>
            <li> If you want a heavy moisturizer for night time, I&#x27;m not sure this is it.  </li>
            <li> Im still not sure what to think.</li>
            <li> its hard to control the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li> A case of personal dislike, not to be considered as an indication of a bad product.</li>
            <li> and I had to return it, so I am unable to tell it if works or not</li>
            <li> The non scented has a weird musty type smell.</li>
            <li> and I always apologize to my husband because I feel it smells weird</li>
            <li> but I have been very disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil that smells like lavender, but it does not do anything special for your face or neck.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and I really like it. It makes my skin so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels - it is an oil, but soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good time and is working well.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good hydrating moisturiser for the nighttime.  This stays on the surface too much and doesn&#x27;t soak in so I don&#x27;t feel that it is hydrating beneath the surface layers.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, great in this cold weather it has stopped the dry patches that I have had in the past, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really no different than any other oil - could use baby oil with the same effect.  Used the whole bottle and did not notice any difference.  I don&#x27;t know how I get suckered into these things.</li>
            <li> I am 92 , I have used squaline 0il products for years , people are amazed at how good my complexion looks.  They often ask me what I use .  I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees wrinkle creams and products and they are good, but not as good as Dr. Lark&#x27;s Trilane Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I prefer the Lavender Scented .</li>
            <li> It is truly the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. I like it better than the 120.00 bottle of night repair i use to use.</li>
            <li> I have been buying trilane for years but buying it on Amazon is even better because of the price.  Thanks Amazon!  This is the only facial product that doesn&#x27;t dry out my 52 year old skin.</li>
            <li> works even on my oily skin, softens and makes my skin feel good, a bit oily feeling at first but it sinks in later, definitely can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Dr. Lark&#x27;s Trilane Anti-aging moisturizer in the mail and was impressed by the healthy glow my skin had and so I ordered it from Amazon. Upon receiving my full size bottle I like that it is measured applications as I tend to use more of a product than is necessary so I won&#x27;t be wasting any. The only drawback that I can think of is that my mascara on my bottom lashes tends to melt a bit from the oil so I use a tiny bit of powder to set the makeup under my eyes and this helps.[[ASIN:B0083V8SE8 Dr. Lark&#x27;s Trilane Anti-Aging Moisturizer (Lavender Scented) 1 oz Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at other reviewers remarks about the heaviness of the oil.  I think they are using too much at a time.  A little goes a long way.  I use it all over my face each day, probably less than a pump&#x27;s worth, and it has lasted me months.  If you want a heavy moisturizer for night time, I&#x27;m not sure this is it.  A light oil that keeps my face from drying out -- that&#x27;s what I get.  The lavender scent is very light, too. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not a miracle though so it&#x27;s not going to make you look ten years younger, but it&#x27;s great stuff just the same:)</li>
            <li> Had high hopes but I have been very disappointed with this product.  I&#x27;m going back to my brand name product.  Sample worked better than purchased product.</li>
            <li> I have had a reaction to the product and I had to return it, so I am unable to tell it if works or not</li>
            <li> This does not work, and it does not have a good smell to it.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to absorb into my skin.  It stayed very oily.</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY FACE BREAKE OUT, IT IS TO OILY AND HEAVY. NOT AS GOOD AS THEY SAY. WILLNOT ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it!  Is good for more than your face.  Great for elbows and lips.</li>
            <li> Nice, light moisturizer that is almost immediately absorbed by skin.  Price is right and arrived promptly as promised</li>
            <li> Using it for years. Really works. I&#x27;m 68 but my skin has no wrinkles</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li> Best facial oil I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I received a sample and ordered the product the next day.  it does what it says it will.  Cheaper to buy it from the company that developed it rather tha Amazon.  I bought the unscented version.</li>
            <li> Had a severe allergic reaction to it, ended up in the doctors office and am now on steroids.  Shots and meds. Sores all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I didn&#x27;t like it. A case of personal dislike, not to be considered as an indication of a bad product.</li>
            <li> I do not know about the ageing part but I have really dry skin, especially winter months, and this product really hydrates my face.  I love it and will buty some more. oh, very prompt delivery service too</li>
            <li> Love this item. Makes skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used a free sample I got in the mail on my ultra-dry, chapped hands. I was sold. I use it as a night treatment moisturizer, mainly on my hands and a just a little on the face. A little really does go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product works real well for me will buy again.</li>
            <li> An excellent moisturizer, light and effective.</li>
            <li> I prefer the scented to the non scented. The non scented has a weird musty type smell. I&#x27;m use to it but I like to put it on before bed and I always apologize to my husband because I feel it smells weird (he doesn&#x27;t smell anything tho of course :) . Anyways...This is my second bottle of trilane. Im still not sure what to think. I love the silky feel of my skin after it has had a chance to soak in. But by the next day my skin is dry again (I have very average skin..not too dry, not oily). It doesn&#x27;t feel like a &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; moisturizer to me. I put it on before my makeup and then again at bedtime. Makeup goes on nicely after it has soaked it. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out (which some products do) and it is not full of Chemicals which is the main selling point for me. I believe it has improved the look and texture of my skin somewhat and on a surprising note...it seems to have made my dark spot fade somewhat. I wasn&#x27;t looking for that but just recently I started noticing that it looks lighter. That&#x27;s exciting to me. So so far, the pros are that is goes on nicely if you don&#x27;t use too much. It is all natural. It has made my dark spot fade. It moisturizes. I feel like I look &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and my complexion is a little brighter. The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t have the moisturizing effect I thought it would. Oh, and that I would prefer it not to be in Pump form..its hard to control the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Trilane. I keep saying I am going to switch to face creams, but there is a difference. This is so gentle, not greasy, great foundation for makeup, plus it makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample in the mail. My first thought was that it was oiley took about 10 minutes or so to soak in, I can&#x27;t imagine this on my face in the summer heat. Maybe in winter? Used twice and did not see any breathtaking benefits. I think you&#x27;d get the same results using coconut oil and it&#x27;s alot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great natural oils that feel great and do not remain oily on my skin. I find its best to alternate with another moisturizer.  My naturally oilier areas don&#x27;t seem to handle the oils as well after constant use. Awesome on hands and body too.&lt;br /&gt;Order was delivered on time and in good shape in original packaging.</li>
            <li> My husband told me how wonderful my skin looked after using the sample that they sent. After using it for a month now, I just love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer that lasts all day for a very &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look. Keeps my skin smooth and youthful!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in the mail.  With one use, the dry skin flaking began to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;Using this product greatly improves general skin tone and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to find the next bottle in a larger size.</li>
            <li> It is not my nature to buy overpriced cosmetics, and at 39.00 per once this falls in that category,â€¦..However, this is the one splurge I would do again, I loved it, very good product, I only spent the money because I was so impressed with even the small free sample I recieived in the mail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love it.  I live in a very dry climate and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that a little goes a long way, it is natural and it makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent arrived exactly when I needed it</li>
            <li> Great stuffâ€¦comparable to much more expensive products</li>
            <li> great product that does work.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin so much..... Would totally recommend it! Age 50&lt;br /&gt;I Love it soooo much! Buy it now!!</li>
            <li> WILL ORDER THAT AGAIN , VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> I first used it under and around eyes, but now include my face. Helps a lot with smoothing skin and fine wrinkles. Daughter also likes itNever causes skin to break out. Definitely will buy again, but like others, wish it were less expensive (hint, hint.)</li>
            <li> I used an earlier product of Dr. Larks. I like this one better. I&#x27;m pleased with what it is doing for my aged skin. I am over 70 and there is nothing in the long run you can do to prevent aging this product has helped the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Trilane Anti-Aging Moisturizer for years. It is truly an amazing product. I get many compliments on my skin, and do not wear a lot of make-up. Thank you Dr. Lark.</li>
            <li> A little oily, but still waiting for results. LOL</li>
