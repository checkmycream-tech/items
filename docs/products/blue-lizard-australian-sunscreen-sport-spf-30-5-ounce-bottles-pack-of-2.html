            <li>Best Sunscreen on the Market</li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>Best sunscreen i have ever used,</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is awesome.  </li>
            <li>This is the best Sun screen I have used.</li>
            <li>It goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; and can take a while to work in, but it does provide excellent coverage, and hasn&#x27;t discolored any of my clothes like spray-on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best that we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works great.  </li>
            <li>Since myself and two of my children are very fair skinned and burn very easy.</li>
            <li>Best sun screen available.</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen for longevity and sun protection - it&#x27;s pricey but completely worth it!</li>
            <li>Two out of three of my kids are very fair skinned and burn easily.</li>
            <li>It provides exceptional protection both in the water and out</li>
            <li>The best bet is to apply it first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have been using it for 2 years now and love it!  </li>
            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a nice tan, no burn, and no itchy rash.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best sunscreen I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>and and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found the best thing to do is apply it close to the eye below but just on the forehead above.</li>
            <li>yeah its more of a hassle putting on then a spray that others make, but protects you much better.  </li>
            <li>Most say re-apply as needed??  </li>
            <li>This  is one of the better sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time :).</li>
            <li>and when I go to tropical places I need to make sure I don&#x27;t get burnt or else my trip will be ruined.  </li>
            <li>I married into a fair skinned family where I was told that sunscreen never worked to protect their skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price and the shipping!!</li>
            <li>Greatest sunscreen I have used, Great for the kids last long, and you don&#x27;t need a lot .</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a superior product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My face, chest and stomach are all fine.  </li>
            <li>It is fine sunscreen</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Blue Lizard and I am extremely impressed!</li>
            <li>Try to be free of sweat when you apply it.</li>
            <li>We tell them it&#x27;s a great reminder that when it turns blue we should be wearing it to protect our skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Blue Lizard sunscreen for years - it is the best for really protecting your skin.</li>
            <li>Red hair and fair skin.</li>
            <li>Btw I am blonde and fair skinned.</li>
            <li>and it does a tremendous job.</li>
            <li>(FYI, I am very light skinned and do develop a tan, but burn VERY easily, in 15 min. or less.</li>
            <li>Sun burn free after a whole Sunny day at the park with just one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus my kids find it so amazing when they see the bottle turn blue when we are in the sun.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We just returned from the Caribbean with average of 90* every day and because we have traveled there for years, I have the proof now that Blue Lizard is the best!</li>
            <li>We very much rely on sunblock every time we leave the house for an outdoor event.  </li>
            <li>One of the top dematologists in the area told her about Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>once absorbed it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It seems to last about three hours at the most.</li>
            <li>Does not burn eyes on hot days.</li>
            <li>It is pretty waterproof, leaves no residue and no smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most sunscreens, so I usually go without and try to stick to the shade most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Best at staying on through all kinds of weather and all sorts of wet - ocean water, fresh water or plain on perspiration doesn&#x27;t move this protection from your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that the Baby and Sensitive versions get high marks for their lack of toxic chemicals, and we&#x27;ve used them on babies and toddlers with sensitive skin, and never had any problems, either with burning or reaction to the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Sensitive and Face versions - but the Sport is by far the most sweat resistant.</li>
            <li>This small size is great for the purse for unexpected times out in the sun.</li>
            <li>Face feels more dry, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin shiny.</li>
            <li>I searched on-line for a new sunscreen and paid top dollar for Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li>Blue Lizard needs to revise their advertising to provide accurate information.</li>
            <li>and Sun burn has been the bane of my existence my whole life.</li>
            <li>and I spend a whole day at the pond.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quickly moving to less chemically filled sun-screens.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a surfer and snowboarder who sometimes will spend as much as 5 hours in the tropical sun or the high elevations</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s true until a friend told me about Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>Medical community seems to be telling us to go for the metal-based screens like the white stuff we used to put on at the pool many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if looking for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, so I honestly believe I have tested both the waterproof and sunscreen capabilities of Blue Lizard to the extreme.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist recommended, easy to apply and stays on through extreme sweating.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I live in sunny NW Florida where sunblock is a must in everything you do all year around.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better or water resistant than any other generic brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>At that point in time, the sunscreen had to be special ordered and was even more expensive than it is now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to shake the bottle really well before applying it at least 15 to 30 minutes before hitting the water.</li>
            <li>Really waterproof - survived a week in Tahiti, snorkeling several times, without a burn.</li>
            <li>My prime interest was to eliminate the orange stain that so frequently shows up after using sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Entire days were spent on the beach, and with only one reapplication per day, I was able to come home without a trace of Sun burn.</li>
            <li>Baby and Sensitive are virtually identical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cyclist and highly recommend Blue Lizard Sport sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I also perspire a lot, especially in the heat and humidity around the Washington D.C. metro area, where we live.)</li>
            <li>I live nearer to the equator and surf on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the sport sunscreen in the water for snorkeling and general activities for hours at a time and had no problem!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t the easiest to put on, and it takes some soap and water to get it off, but until they change the formula is some significant way, Blue Lizard is head and shoulders above all the other major-brand sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried -- and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s hard to do that on trips to the Caribbean, so I took a chance, and it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li>When we came back from a day of boating and stand up paddling, my back was completely burnt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used four varieties of Blue Lizard -- Baby, Sensitive, Face, and Sport -- and I&#x27;ve posted the same review for each one.</li>
            <li>It stings the eyes a little bit when first paddling out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only half way through my first bottle</li>
            <li>Just to be clear, this review is for the Regular Blue Lizard Australian suncream spf 30</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the premium price...</li>
            <li>Sport seems to go on a little easier, but also has more potentially irritating chemicals than Sensitive or Baby (or so I&#x27;m</li>

            <li> Each version of Blue Lizard that I have tried will last through a 4+ hours of golf in direct midday sun, even when I&#x27;m perspiring heavily, and I&#x27;ll go home with NO redness or burning whatsoever.</li>
            <li> We spent a week surfing in central Mexico and he swears Blue Lizard saved his life.</li>
            <li> but because this product is not very thick, a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With a little effort goes on clear.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and if you take a few minutes to work it in, it stays put pretty well and doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone who knows me expected me to come home a lobster, but Blue Lizard literally saved my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We just recently spent eight hours in the sun at a water slide using the Blue Lizard sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was out for three and half hours yesterday and my cheeks and nose got a little too much sun.</li>
            <li> After you rub it in and let it dry for a couple of minutes, it disappears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Although you tend to look a bit like an alien until the zinc oxide gets completely rubbed in -  </li>
            <li> I still have a half of bottle left.</li>
            <li> Coming from New Jersey, a day trip to Six Flags would mean needing to apply sunscreen in the parking lot before going in, then reapplying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not unusual for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It takes a VERY small amount to completely cover your face, therefore even though it is a little pricey, 1 bottle lasts a LONG time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a sunscreen that stays on in the water and last for at least a little while.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for three weeks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually burn, but I still want to be protected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the others, but I&#x27;m not going to chance it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works if you&#x27;re alergic to the usual kinds.  </li>
            <li> I know his because I missed applying to one particular area and truly burned badly.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> I put it on thick 30 min to an hour before getting in the water, and it comes off within 30 min</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as I thought it would be and still getting tan when running.</li>
            <li> It comes out liquidy, but goes on rather thick.</li>
            <li> I posted a picture with this review to show how bad I had burned on my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by the negative reviews of this product!</li>
            <li> I was told that oxybenzone is a dangerous chemical that will soon be banned by the FDA.  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived and I read the ingredients, I was shocked and disappointed to see that the product contains the chemical oxybenzone.  </li>

            <li> Best Sunscreen on the Market</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by the negative reviews of this product! I have been using Blue Lizard for over 10 years. My wife is pharmaceutical sales rep and sold skin products for years. One of the top dematologists in the area told her about Blue Lizard. At that point in time, the sunscreen had to be special ordered and was even more expensive than it is now. It was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a surfer and snowboarder who sometimes will spend as much as 5 hours in the tropical sun or the high elevations, so I honestly believe I have tested both the waterproof and sunscreen capabilities of Blue Lizard to the extreme. I also surf with a friend who is of Irish ancestry. Red hair and fair skin. We spent a week surfing in central Mexico and he swears Blue Lizard saved his life. He didn&#x27;t get sunburned once during our trip.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It provides exceptional protection both in the water and out&lt;br /&gt;  It takes a VERY small amount to completely cover your face, therefore even though it is a little pricey, 1 bottle lasts a LONG time&lt;br /&gt;  It is not visible after application. Initially you will see a white cast where you apply it, which is actually helpful in getting it on evenly. After you rub it in and let it dry for a couple of minutes, it disappears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - It is greasy initially, not a problem after 2 or 3 minutes after application&lt;br /&gt;  It does sting if you get it in your eyes. (I&#x27;ve found the best thing to do is apply it close to the eye below but just on the forehead above. Try to be free of sweat when you apply it. The best bet is to apply it first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a superior product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen for longevity and sun protection - it&#x27;s pricey but completely worth it!</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, this review is for the Regular Blue Lizard Australian suncream spf 30+.  I live in Hawaii and I don&#x27;t usually burn, but I still want to be protected.  Out on the boat today, I slathered this on my back and used a different sunscreen for my face, chest (La Roche Posay Anthelios) and Ombrelle on my stomach.  When we came back from a day of boating and stand up paddling, my back was completely burnt.  My face, chest and stomach are all fine.  My husband and daughter, thankfully, did not use this suncream.    The ingredients are Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2%, Oxybenzone 3%, Zinc Oxide (z-cote) 6%.    I would not recommend this formulation.  I&#x27;m not sure about the others, but I&#x27;m not going to chance it.</li>
            <li> Really waterproof - survived a week in Tahiti, snorkeling several times, without a burn.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping for a sunscreen that would stay on in the water while surfing in the Southern California summer.  It is fine sunscreen but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better or water resistant than any other generic brands I have tried.  I put it on thick 30 min to an hour before getting in the water, and it comes off within 30 min or so after being in the ocean.  Not sure if it is worth the premium price...</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen i have ever used, yeah its more of a hassle putting on then a spray that others make, but protects you much better.  Most say re-apply as needed??  Why, i fish on lake 12hrs a day, never needed to reapply.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as I thought it would be and still getting tan when running.</li>
            <li> Greatest sunscreen I have used, Great for the kids last long, and you don&#x27;t need a lot .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cyclist and highly recommend Blue Lizard Sport sunscreen. Dermatologist recommended, easy to apply and stays on through extreme sweating.</li>
            <li> My prime interest was to eliminate the orange stain that so frequently shows up after using sunscreens.  Blue Lizard seemed to overcome that issue.  Although you tend to look a bit like an alien until the zinc oxide gets completely rubbed in -  once absorbed it worked very well.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome.  It is not sticky and it stays on for awhile.  Highly recommend if looking for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I recently visited my dermatologist who advised me to throw away any sunscreens containing chemicals including oxybenzone.  I was told that oxybenzone is a dangerous chemical that will soon be banned by the FDA.  I searched on-line for a new sunscreen and paid top dollar for Blue Lizard.  It is advertised as \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot;.  When the product arrived and I read the ingredients, I was shocked and disappointed to see that the product contains the chemical oxybenzone.  Blue Lizard needs to revise their advertising to provide accurate information.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and Sun burn has been the bane of my existence my whole life. Coming from New Jersey, a day trip to Six Flags would mean needing to apply sunscreen in the parking lot before going in, then reapplying throughout the day. Blue Lizard keeps me Sun burn free after a whole Sunny day at the park with just one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up on this stuff before going to Aruba for my honeymoon. Entire days were spent on the beach, and with only one reapplication per day, I was able to come home without a trace of Sun burn. Everyone who knows me expected me to come home a lobster, but Blue Lizard literally saved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I live in sunny NW Florida where sunblock is a must in everything you do all year around. About a month ago my family and I spend a whole day at the pond. Since myself and two of my children are very fair skinned and burn very easy. One of them being my handicapped son with CP, who is wheelchair bond. We very much rely on sunblock every time we leave the house for an outdoor event.  We were wearing a big name sunblock SPF 80, as well as reapplying it every 45 mins to an hour. By the end of the day we were all burnt as like we were not wearing anything. I posted a picture with this review to show how bad I had burned on my back. You can&#x27;t tell by the picture, but I had blisters around where my tan line were. A friend that lives in South Florida where it&#x27;s even hotter, suggested Blue Lizard sunscreen. I purchased two 5 oz bottles. I was worried that we would go through the bottles in one trip to the beach. To my surprise, that was not the case. It comes out liquidy, but goes on rather thick. It takes a bit to rub in. We just recently spent eight hours in the sun at a water slide using the Blue Lizard sunscreen. We reapplied it every hour. No signs of Sunburn at all. I have already used one bottle on five people four times now. I still have a half of bottle left. No one has yet to get sunburned. Plus my kids find it so amazing when they see the bottle turn blue when we are in the sun. We tell them it&#x27;s a great reminder that when it turns blue we should be wearing it to protect our skin. This by far is the best sunscreen I have ever purchased. I would recommend this to anyone that spends lots of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this brand for our family and baby. We have been using it for 2 years now and love it!  They eliminate some of the harmful chemicals found in sunscreen and include zinc!  This small size is great for the purse for unexpected times out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I married into a fair skinned family where I was told that sunscreen never worked to protect their skin. How could that be, I wondered. Well, it&#x27;s true until a friend told me about Blue Lizard. Now, it&#x27;s the ONLY thing that works and it does a tremendous job. Try it and see. It&#x27;s worth the price and the shipping!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four varieties of Blue Lizard -- Baby, Sensitive, Face, and Sport -- and I&#x27;ve posted the same review for each one. Baby and Sensitive are virtually identical. Face feels more dry, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin shiny. Sport seems to go on a little easier, but also has more potentially irritating chemicals than Sensitive or Baby (or so I&#x27;m told).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the bottom line: Each version of Blue Lizard that I have tried will last through a 4+ hours of golf in direct midday sun, even when I&#x27;m perspiring heavily, and I&#x27;ll go home with NO redness or burning whatsoever. (FYI, I am very light skinned and do develop a tan, but burn VERY easily, in 15 min. or less. I also perspire a lot, especially in the heat and humidity around the Washington D.C. metro area, where we live.) A little goes a long way, and if you take a few minutes to work it in, it stays put pretty well and doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t the easiest to put on, and it takes some soap and water to get it off, but until they change the formula is some significant way, Blue Lizard is head and shoulders above all the other major-brand sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried -- and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It&#x27;s also nice that the Baby and Sensitive versions get high marks for their lack of toxic chemicals, and we&#x27;ve used them on babies and toddlers with sensitive skin, and never had any problems, either with burning or reaction to the sunscreen. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> With a little effort goes on clear. Never been burned with this. NO irritation in the eye. This is the only stuff we use now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quickly moving to less chemically filled sun-screens.  Medical community seems to be telling us to go for the metal-based screens like the white stuff we used to put on at the pool many years ago.  Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> This  is one of the better sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. I live nearer to the equator and surf on a regular basis. I need a sunscreen that stays on in the water and last for at least a little while. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four weeks and and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It&#x27;s important to shake the bottle really well before applying it at least 15 to 30 minutes before hitting the water. It stings the eyes a little bit when first paddling out but that&#x27;s not unusual for sunscreen. It seems to last about three hours at the most. I was out for three and half hours yesterday and my cheeks and nose got a little too much sun. I&#x27;ve also used it for running and it stays on even through profuse sweating in 80 degree weather. The bottle does not seem very big but because this product is not very thick, a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. I&#x27;m only half way through my first bottle and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for three weeks.</li>
            <li> Two out of three of my kids are very fair skinned and burn easily. This is the only sunscreen I use on them and they seldom burn. I will use nothing else on my kids. I grew up in the sun as a kid on swim team and then as a lifeguard and if I had used this I wouldn&#x27;t have the wrinkles and sun damage that I have.</li>
            <li> Best sun screen available. Does not burn eyes on hot days. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Blue Lizard and I am extremely impressed! It exceeded my expectations. I believe because of the zinc oxide kept me from burning. I know his because I missed applying to one particular area and truly burned badly. We just returned from the Caribbean with average of 90* every day and because we have traveled there for years, I have the proof now that Blue Lizard is the best! Btw I am blonde and fair skinned.</li>
            <li> This is the best Sun screen I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve settled on this product for my regular use sun screen when I golf.  It goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; and can take a while to work in, but it does provide excellent coverage, and hasn&#x27;t discolored any of my clothes like spray-on sun screens do.  I&#x27;ve tried the Sensitive and Face versions - but the Sport is by far the most sweat resistant.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time :). I&#x27;ve been using Blue Lizard sunscreen for years - it is the best for really protecting your skin. I have very pale skin and when I go to tropical places I need to make sure I don&#x27;t get burnt or else my trip will be ruined.  I&#x27;ve used the sport sunscreen in the water for snorkeling and general activities for hours at a time and had no problem! None of the US brands I have tried compare to this!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works if you&#x27;re alergic to the usual kinds.  It is pretty waterproof, leaves no residue and no smell.  It&#x27;s the best that we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great.  I&#x27;m allergic to most sunscreens, so I usually go without and try to stick to the shade most of the time.  However, it&#x27;s hard to do that on trips to the Caribbean, so I took a chance, and it was so worth it!  I ended up with a nice tan, no burn, and no itchy rash.</li>
