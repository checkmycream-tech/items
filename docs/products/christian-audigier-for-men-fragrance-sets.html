            <li>i really  loved the packing and overall</li>
            <li>The scent is not as pleasant as expected.</li>
            <li>My first Men&#x27;s cologne was Paco Robonne original</li>

            <li>It has subtle tones that are neither sweet nor overly strong, just the right amount of scent.</li>
            <li>It is a counterfeit made by New Wave.</li>

            <li> Bought it as a gift and they seemed to like it very much.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If every man on this entire earth had a chance to wear this Christian Audigier  original .  I know for a fact that this is the Best Seller for all men.  Once you smell this unique scent you can not find anything else to compare with it.  The reason I say this is because I have purchase so many different Colognes and Eau de Toilettes and paid top dollar for the best name Brands. Nothing has compared to this yet!  ( I am being very truthful when I say this).  I am still looking but have not found anything that permeates the air and you who wears this scent.  I have been purchasing men Cologne and Eau de Toilette since 1979. My first Men&#x27;s cologne was Paco Robonne original and I thought that was amazing.  Purchase this for any man young or old and they will love you for this.  I know because I have purchased this as gifts.  I get sooo many thank youuuuu&#x27;s and &amp;#34; how did you know what to buy for me and etc.&amp;#34;  Just believe.  chatou</li>

            <li> Came in on time. The packaging was impressive, thought it&#x27;d be a lot smaller. Only thing missing is the film that enclose the actual product, so you can pick it up, open it and sniff. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>

            <li> I have many top men&#x27;s colognes. The scent is not as pleasant as expected. It reminds one of something burning. Scent does not last. Tommy Bahama and Cartier Sport last longer and have a better scent. I bought the product because the price was good.</li>
            <li> really recommended this kit. smells really good and a very good price. wont hesitate to buy again n recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother, and he really likes it. I also had a bottle of the spray cologne, and it smells wonderful.</li>

            <li> I gave this as a gift to my husband and he loved the scent and the price was great! (44$ total).</li>
            <li> Have been using Christian Audigier for years. It has subtle tones that are neither sweet nor overly strong, just the right amount of scent. It does wear off in 4 to 6 hours though. The gift set is a great deal as one gets the deodrant stick as well as travel size perfume bottle and body wash. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Its good for the price, has a light smell, not very strong.</li>
            <li> Great product. Product as expected. Delivery as expected.</li>
