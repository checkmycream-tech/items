            <li> these bows were pretty however they seem to me much smaller than advertise.</li>
            <li> They are pretty big.</li>
            <li> but this is no big deal as you just pull on them a little to get them back in to shape.</li>
            <li> Considered sending back, but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> They came in a little squeezed in so you will have to fluff them a little</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers said they were a little scrunched down when they got them</li>
            <li> They were just as small as the other bows that I order</li>
            <li> Sometimes when you buy a large assortment they throw in crazy combos you wouldn&#x27;t have chosen</li>
            <li> You could even use on pig tails since they are not huge bows.</li>
            <li> so i had to unbend each bow because they were crammed in one small box.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical - the price I paid (averaged at about two dollars per bow) seemed too low.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>

            <li> Dont get me wrong these bows were pretty however they seem to me much smaller than advertise. What i received in the mail was not a 4.5 bow for sure. They were just as small as the other bows that I order that was a size 3. Really disappointed. Also they were receive bent up so i had to unbend each bow because they were crammed in one small box. I normally love hipgirl bows but i wont be ordering from this supplier anymore. The bows looked just okay. Considered sending back, but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loves these bows and wears one to school every day. i may buy more for my other granddaughters.</li>

            <li> Identical to the pic shown on the listing.  The hair bows do not look as big as listed, but they&#x27;re too cute to return!  Very satisfied!  And great quality ribbon!</li>
            <li> I have 5 daughters (5-16yrs.) and this was an awesome buy. Not pricey, as most boutique would sell them. They are super cute, the size was as I expected ...great quality.....awesome choice overall!</li>
