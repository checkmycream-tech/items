            <li>/&gt;After this kit, if you want more, you can just buy the refills.  </li>
            <li>They are a better deal in some ways, but they don&#x27;t have the mouth trays.</li>
            <li>I also put a couple of cotton balls under my top lip with the tray in to keep the saliva out of the whitener.</li>
            <li>They may not have the best presentation in terms of marketing compared to other Whitening Kits but they delivered, and I saw results on my first application (30 minutes) and my teeth shade was in good place to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The trays are easy to customize and fit which was a plus.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I brush it on with an cheap art brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times on my top 6 front teeth since that&#x27;s all that shows when I smile.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty detailed with this kit.  </li>
            <li>He has tried many whitening treatment before but none of them really works and he said that this one we can see that his teeth starts to lighten up even just for the first day.</li>
            <li>Really not trying to be negative, and it sounds like most people have a great experience, I&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
            <li>Powerful teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li>The gel in this set is great and works pretty much as well as can be expected but the trays suck.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>My husband noticed a difference right away</li>
            <li>It did lighten it some, but he was only able to keep it on for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the trays are not the best and they make it difficult to distribute the gel evenly onto your teeth.</li>
            <li>If not, than first use your finger to wipe the gel onto your teeth then put the tray in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his first day to use this since we just got this today.</li>
            <li>Be sure to not get it on your gums, it will turn them white and cause some pain.  </li>
            <li>like &amp;#34;USE EXTREME CAUTION&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Use at your own risk&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend trying this as a much more economical approach to the pearly white smile ;)</li>
            <li>only downside to this product is that the gel is so strong, I can&#x27;t leave it on for the time it says-</li>
            <li>The mouth trays are fairly generic, if you&#x27;ve done sports you will be familiar with them - they can be put in hot water to soften them and shape them to teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did four separate 45 minute sessions and nothing, not so much as one shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>And they were so big they wouldn&#x27;t even fit in the case.</li>
            <li>It is not as fast as I was expecting though.</li>
            <li>noticed my teeth were much whiter and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and stick with it and see if things improve, but so far, I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>It is much stronger than any of the tooth whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I saw results after just one use, and after 4 my teeth were MUCH whiter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to keep it off of your gums.</li>
            <li>They are way too thick to ever get a good impression</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>so I have to be super careful when putting them in the tray.</li>
            <li>Was a little difficult to mold to my teeth, but that may have been more of my own error.</li>
            <li>After having completed my second treatment, I am ready to review.</li>
            <li>Do not be surprised if you have a lot of drool either.</li>
            <li>Terrific, very much, very practical</li>
            <li>like this kit because it is complete-</li>
            <li>It has a tube of whitening gel, and a tube of aftercare gel that helps keep teeth from getting sensitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After only two uses, we are already seeing a marked improvement in brightness.</li>
            <li>Do not use too often if your teeth are extra sensitive though.</li>
            <li>I tried rolling up a paper towel the first time and still ended up with drool down my face.</li>
            <li>Noticed a slight difference in whitening after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>and I have very little sensitivity the first day or two, and then it was back to normal.</li>

            <li> I also did notice it was easier to control my drooling if I laid down and tried to keep my head back (mimicking the dentist&#x27;s chair)</li>
            <li> I left the tray in for 30 minutes at a time, every other day and am already seeing results!</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount for results so this size should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Molds can be a little thinner (not a big issue</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough gel to last for probably 3 weeks, but it is hard to say, a lot depends on how you use it, and if you are careful.  </li>
            <li> which one should I have expected to perform as promised.</li>
            <li> I received this last week and was anxious to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again for an upcoming wedding in a few months!</li>
            <li> I only left it on for 20 minutes (I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the bulky feel of the trays any longer) and the difference was dramatic.</li>
            <li> and since they don&#x27;t conform well, the results are always uneven.</li>
            <li> recommend but don&#x27;t waste your time with the trays.</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> I have never used a whitening gel, always used strips in the past.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a slow whitening process happening to my teeth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s complicated and messy .</li>
            <li> The gel may work well, but the trays were so poorly made it made me not want to try the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed</li>
            <li> He said it had the bleach taste that other kits have but not the worst tasting one he has used.  </li>
            <li> The trays were impossible to melt to my mouth shape.</li>
            <li> You can always do one tray at a time and it probably won&#x27;t be as bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad, again, it is just a hint of orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am extemely disappointed</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The trays were so uncomfortable that I was drooling just trying to hold them in my mouth, that&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the product, especially after seeing the many good reviews. Unfourtunately the product did nothing to whiten my teeth, although it did temporaily whiten my gums. I did four separate 45 minute sessions and nothing, not so much as one shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extemely disappointed and I doubt I&#x27;ll be using the remainder of the product. I almost feel as though you get what you pay for. A $30 product bought online versus a $300 product bought from the dentist...which one should I have expected to perform as promised. Lesson learnt...</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I just followed all directions and I love the results. Really easy and convenient. You will not be disappointed. I did receive for review</li>
            <li> I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon) so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.  My son wanted to lighten his teeth.  The instructions are pretty detailed with this kit.  He said it had the bleach taste that other kits have but not the worst tasting one he has used.  He wiped the whitening gel off his gums and did not experience any discomfort.  It did lighten it some, but he was only able to keep it on for 20 minutes.  He said the next time he will keep it on longer.  He was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> kinda complicated for an at home treatment system, considering you have to form the trays to your mouth and the instructions make it sound like you might make your teeth fall out of your mouth if you don&#x27;t follow the directions to a T....like &amp;#34;USE EXTREME CAUTION&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Use at your own risk&amp;#34; don&#x27;t make me feel really confident in the ability of this product not to harm me. Does come with a remineralizing gel for after use to help prevent sensitivity...we&#x27;ll have to wait and see how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;**I was provided a discount to try out and review this product, but my thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> After having completed my second treatment, I am ready to review. This solution works great. The trays are easy to customize and fit which was a plus. In the package (well packaged) I received:&lt;br /&gt;Storage Case for trays&lt;br /&gt;Two trays&lt;br /&gt;Tooth whitening gel&lt;br /&gt;Remineralizing gel&lt;br /&gt;After only two uses, we are already seeing a marked improvement in brightness. I am an avid coffee drinker and this is a great product for coffee aficionados.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and when I saw the discount again I had to snatch ih! This stuff really works. The only thing I dislike is they burn the heck out of my gums so I have to be super careful when putting them in the tray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works well, but I got so frustrated just trying to get the trays molded that I completely gave up! I spend 20 minutes dipping the trays in boiling water, pressing them against my teeth, etc. and they never changed. And they were so big they wouldn&#x27;t even fit in the case. The gel may work well, but the trays were so poorly made it made me not want to try the rest. Really not trying to be negative, and it sounds like most people have a great experience, I&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a slow whitening process happening to my teeth. It is not as fast as I was expecting though. In addition, the trays are not the best and they make it difficult to distribute the gel evenly onto your teeth. I would recommend buying different trays if you can. If not, than first use your finger to wipe the gel onto your teeth then put the tray in your mouth. Do not be surprised if you have a lot of drool either. You can always do one tray at a time and it probably won&#x27;t be as bad. I have very sensitive teeth and this did not cause any sensitivity, which was great. I bought this product with a discount and I cannot wait to see the results when I am finished with it all.</li>
            <li> This product does not work! Don&#x27;t buy! The trays were so uncomfortable that I was drooling just trying to hold them in my mouth, that&#x27;s awful. Then once I got thoughthat, the product didn&#x27;t even whiten my teeth! Waste of time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband because he has been smoking and his teeth doesn&#x27;t look good. It&#x27;s his first day to use this since we just got this today. He has tried many whitening treatment before but none of them really works and he said that this one we can see that his teeth starts to lighten up even just for the first day. I will give an update after 2 weeks or a  month of using this product to see if there&#x27;s really a great difference. I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I have never used a whitening gel, always used strips in the past. I received this last week and was anxious to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I molded the mouth pieces using boiling water and fitted them to my teeth. I used a cotton swab to apply the gel to my teeth as to not get it on my gums. Inserted the mouth pieces and about 40 minutes later I took them out.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my teeth were much whiter and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This whitening kit came with a convenient carrying case, which was awesome.  Was a little difficult to mold to my teeth, but that may have been more of my own error. The syringe with the whitening solution was easy to apply into the mouth tray.  Taste was not the greatest.  Noticed a slight difference in whitening after just the first use.  Do not use too often if your teeth are extra sensitive though.</li>
            <li> Terrific, very much, very practical</li>
            <li> i got this for discounted price. but for the time i used it,it hurt my gums maybe its not for me.</li>
            <li> I just received this, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I&#x27;m a little disappointed, it&#x27;s complicated and messy . Don&#x27;t get it on your gums, it burns. I&#x27;m going to try and stick with it and see if things improve, but so far, I&#x27;m not crazy about it. I will update if  I master it and gives tips.</li>
            <li> **Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I pleasantly satisfied with this product. They may not have the best presentation in terms of marketing compared to other Whitening Kits but they delivered, and I saw results on my first application (30 minutes) and my teeth shade was in good place to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Case Mold: I like that they included a case to put your molds on.&lt;br /&gt;Easy Molding: Boiled water + tighten them for an easy and kick molding.&lt;br /&gt;Remineralizer After Care included: Allows for you to use this kit without needing or wanting extra accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Molds can be a little thinner (not a big issue thought)&lt;br /&gt;No Led accessory: The LED is not necessary for a whitening kit but it allow for a shorter application process. I did 30 minutes on this. WIth LED Kit it should reduce it to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Im getting great results with this product.  Be sure to not get it on your gums, it will turn them white and cause some pain.  Trim your tray to your gumline and dont over apply the product.  Zero sensitivity and white teeth, I love it!</li>
            <li> Product provided with promotional discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this kit because it is complete- some are not.  This one has 2 mouth trays, one for upper and one for lower.  It has a tube of whitening gel, and a tube of aftercare gel that helps keep teeth from getting sensitive.  The mouth trays are fairly generic, if you&#x27;ve done sports you will be familiar with them - they can be put in hot water to soften them and shape them to teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel WORKS.  It is much stronger than any of the tooth whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  I saw results after just one use, and after 4 my teeth were MUCH whiter.  There&#x27;s enough gel to last for probably 3 weeks, but it is hard to say, a lot depends on how you use it, and if you are careful.  I brush it on with an cheap art brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that the gel is so strong, I can&#x27;t leave it on for the time it says- it starts hurting a bit.  No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t seem to keep it off my gums.  I&#x27;d still rather use this a few times than suffer through a whole box of strips. I don&#x27;t always use the aftercare, but it is nice at times.  Oh, it smells a bit like orange.  It doesn&#x27;t taste bad, again, it is just a hint of orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this kit, if you want more, you can just buy the refills.  They are a better deal in some ways, but they don&#x27;t have the mouth trays.</li>
            <li> My dad is a dentist and this is stuff works just as well as the stuff people pay him hundreds of dollars for.  I&#x27;ve used it three times on my top 6 front teeth since that&#x27;s all that shows when I smile.  I left the tray in for 30 minutes at a time, every other day and am already seeing results! Since I haven&#x27;t done my bottom teeth, I can see a great contrast in color already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend putting it on with a q-tip. It&#x27;s much easier to keep it off of your gums. I also put a couple of cotton balls under my top lip with the tray in to keep the saliva out of the whitener. I also did notice it was easier to control my drooling if I laid down and tried to keep my head back (mimicking the dentist&#x27;s chair) so that the saliva would go to the back of my mouth and just be swallowed. I tried rolling up a paper towel the first time and still ended up with drool down my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 7 times and haven&#x27;t seen a lick of color change.  The trays were impossible to melt to my mouth shape.</li>
            <li> Powerful teeth whitening kit. Makes a huge difference.  Comes in what looks like one of those bags from the dentist, sterile inside, so that gives a good feeling right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received at discount, but opinions my own.  Definitely recommend trying this as a much more economical approach to the pearly white smile ;)</li>
            <li> whitens great. it burns if it gets on your gums tho so watch out</li>
            <li> Worked really great! My husband noticed a difference right away and I have very little sensitivity the first day or two, and then it was back to normal. Will definitely buy again for an upcoming wedding in a few months!</li>
            <li> The gel in this set is great and works pretty much as well as can be expected but the trays suck. They are way too thick to ever get a good impression and since they don&#x27;t conform well, the results are always uneven. If you use better trays, the whitening is really good. I only left it on for 20 minutes (I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the bulky feel of the trays any longer) and the difference was dramatic. It only takes a small amount for results so this size should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend but don&#x27;t waste your time with the trays.</li>
