            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so good on virgin hair.</li>

            <li>super bright.</li>
            <li>hopefully that will work the fading problem :)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more long-term commitment, option for something else.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade of red that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>love the color</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love love love the rock n roll dye.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>I had about 3/4&amp;#34; of roots when I died and while at first it stained the roots fairly well,</li>
            <li>I rated it 5 stars though because it does what it says and it&#x27;s a good vibrant color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>I pair this up with the flamingo for a bright red ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately I decided not to keep using the dye just because it would be too much hassle to have to keep coloring my roots with a permanent color and then using this over top of it</li>
            <li>It came fast and came as shown/described :)   </li>
            <li>I like this color more and my hair was much healthier after I dyed it.</li>
            <li>I loved this color because it was a truer cherry/red velvet red</li>
            <li>but i leave it on much longer for more brighter color and add heat.</li>
            <li>I HAVE RED STREAKS WITH brown and it pops soo good.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached so it washes out quickly</li>
            <li>Great color, doesn&#x27;t last too much</li>
            <li>It might depend on your hair type though, so others could have better results than me (my natural hair is golden brown and thick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW this stuff is way better.</li>
            <li>These Manic Panic are super pretty semi color</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think you&#x27;d need more than that unless you have really long hair or unless your hair is really damaged and will absorb more of the dye.</li>
            <li>That stuff was pretty rough on my hair though, so I decided to try using this over top of it for something more vibrant yet not damaging.</li>
            <li>One dyed my whole head!    </li>
            <li>So this is pretty outcome.</li>
            <li>Rock and roll red is my favorite of the three.</li>
            <li>the size was always bigger) but i am happy that it was shipped in a timely matter and that it was packed with enough tape on the envelope that there was not escaping haha</li>
            <li>It worked very well!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother unless your hair is processed or bleached, washes right out pretty much.</li>
            <li>When my daughter wants to go red, we&#x27;ll be sure to reorder this dye.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have to worry about all the bleeding except after the first wash or two.</li>
            <li>I wound up going with Ion creme in 7IR which on my hair was roughly the same shade as a more faded (yet still vibrant red) version of this, so it was a good compromise.</li>
            <li>its a bit darker, but not by much, than the wildfire.</li>
            <li>This color was still bleeding after one month (on that note though, washing with Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo really helps get a lot of the color out if anyone needs help removing this color to dye with something else).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Keep up the high standards - grateful customer!</li>
            <li>More of a pink than what I was expecting</li>
            <li>It dyed my hair very well</li>
            <li>But you MUST comb it through your hair for good results, and if you have long hair be careful, I manged to splatter paint my arms and chest</li>
            <li>so when I apply this dye, parts are very dark red and others bright.</li>
            <li>The color was vibrant and just as pictured.</li>
            <li>I also used John Frieda Radiant Red Captivating Daily Shampoo to prolong color.</li>
            <li>Red color fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and it came out as a kind of pinkish red (everything that this stained turned pink, so it&#x27;s not hard to see why).</li>
            <li>I recently went to the salon and got my hair colored red like Ariel but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>but its a fire engine red &amp; very vibrant!</li>
            <li>I had originally dyed my hair copper red with John Frieda&#x27;s Deep Copper Canyon dye.</li>
            <li>How ever I found it not that interesting because of the small size it comes in.</li>
            <li>It is a bitter sweet experience.</li>
            <li>When I first did it, I thought my hair looked more like a dark magenta than red, but everyone else said it was red, so I trust their judgment.</li>
            <li>after maybe a week or two they were pretty much completely back to the natural color.</li>
            <li>It was still pretty vibrant (though definitely faded quite a bit) a month later when I colored my hair with a permanent dye.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when applying it so either way, its the same thing.</li>
            <li>You should use an old pillowcase when sleeping and old towels when drying your hair.</li>
            <li>dye will completely fade around 10~14 wash.</li>
            <li>(Also, the Manic Panic website recommends the following after dying to help keep color from fading as fast:</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to mess with full on bleaching my hair at the moment (</li>
            <li>hot pink.</li>
            <li>Normally you&#x27;re supposed to bleach first, but I didn&#x27;t want anything quite as extreme as this over bleach blonde hair, so I figured the damage from just having dyed</li>
            <li>Looks just as red as the day I left the salon, not to mention that it conditions your hair very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying the other jar now and leaving it in much longer..</li>
            <li>Doesnt really show in dark hair.</li>

            <li> Doesnt really show in dark hair.</li>
            <li> I work at a conservative Christian school, but it&#x27;s still a university, so my hair was pretty tame compared to the students who have pink and blue hair.</li>
            <li> In the past as I rinsed my hair, it had blood red/orange tones but the last two times I&#x27;ve purchased it, the water has run hot pink like watered down beet juice and everything in sight is stained hot pink ...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark hair which has been lightened a little and some sections are naturally pure white</li>
            <li> Also, I recommend even wearing an old t-shirt or something when letting it air dry at least after the first few washings because itdid stain one of my old hoodies a bit where it dried (if your hair&#x27;s short though you probably don&#x27;t need to worry about it).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and I could leave it on a long time without any damage.</li>
            <li> (my hair length is about down to my bra clasp in the back) and I used one entire 4oz jar.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend using this dye on virgin hair and expect it to stick around for very long.</li>
            <li> I put purple shampoo on dry hair, let it sit for 30 minutes, then rinse and dry.</li>
            <li> And when it fades now it is less of a brassy red tone and is ...</li>
            <li> Definitely use vaseline or something if you&#x27;re worried about that, but it does wash off after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> i received my manic panic today, the jar was a lot smaller than i expected,(i have bought other jars of this in the past</li>
            <li> Fades faster than other colors...</li>
            <li> My dark brown hair was already slightly pre-lightened with bleach (to a brown-orangey color).</li>
            <li> Mix equal parts of white vinegar with water, try a half a cup of each and put in a bowl or cup; pour on the vinegar and water mix; comb through your hair; and rinse it out with cold water.)</li>
            <li> few warnings</li>
            <li> and I do wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> so I could hold off a few weeks of dying it.</li>
            <li> Also, for those who work in a business environment, I got a lot of comments on how vibrant my hair was (comparisons to Ariel were common), but it wasn&#x27;t too crazy, though I guess that could depend on how conservative your office environment is.</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> Even when you wash with cold water and use red shampoo, they will fade a little with every wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally dirty blonde</li>
            <li> I used splat for years but the bleach was really patchy and made my hair feel like crap, so I tried  this because it&#x27;s also vegan.</li>
            <li> preetty small soon apply it and will provide pictures !</li>
            <li> the red doesn&#x27;t fade as bad.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for 2 hours, heat up your hair every 30 minutes, then wash dye off with lukewarm water, or as cold as you can take.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using really cold water because it will give me a headache</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always wash my hair with cold water</li>
            <li> use cold water to keep color in.</li>
            <li> The staining was not that bad as I put vaseline on the sides of my skin and had no problem removing the stains that were there.</li>

            <li> its a bit darker, but not by much, than the wildfire. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when applying it so either way, its the same thing. but its a fire engine red &amp; very vibrant! I loved it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother unless your hair is processed or bleached, washes right out pretty much. I prefer punky color.</li>
            <li> My dark brown hair was already slightly pre-lightened with bleach (to a brown-orangey color). \\&quot;Rock N Roll Red\\&quot; took SO well to my hair! The color was vibrant and just as pictured. The color actually lasted longer than I thought (about 4 weeks - faded over time). I also used John Frieda Radiant Red Captivating Daily Shampoo to prolong color. I definitely plan on continuing to use this product - so great it is not harmful to your hair!!</li>
            <li> So for some reason I never took a picture of my hair when I dyed it with this, otherwise I&#x27;d add it. I had originally dyed my hair copper red with John Frieda&#x27;s Deep Copper Canyon dye. That stuff was pretty rough on my hair though, so I decided to try using this over top of it for something more vibrant yet not damaging. Normally you&#x27;re supposed to bleach first, but I didn&#x27;t want anything quite as extreme as this over bleach blonde hair, so I figured the damage from just having dyed it would let the dye absorb enough for it to stick around for a while, and it definitely did. It was still pretty vibrant (though definitely faded quite a bit) a month later when I colored my hair with a permanent dye. Also, I have longish hair and it&#x27;s pretty thick (my hair length is about down to my bra clasp in the back) and I used one entire 4oz jar. I don&#x27;t really think you&#x27;d need more than that unless you have really long hair or unless your hair is really damaged and will absorb more of the dye. The color is vibrant and it came out as a kind of pinkish red (everything that this stained turned pink, so it&#x27;s not hard to see why). When I first did it, I thought my hair looked more like a dark magenta than red, but everyone else said it was red, so I trust their judgment. Also, for those who work in a business environment, I got a lot of comments on how vibrant my hair was (comparisons to Ariel were common), but it wasn&#x27;t too crazy, though I guess that could depend on how conservative your office environment is. I work at a conservative Christian school, but it&#x27;s still a university, so my hair was pretty tame compared to the students who have pink and blue hair. I just wish they allowed that of their employees :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few warnings though:&lt;br /&gt;1. It bleeds a lot. You should use an old pillowcase when sleeping and old towels when drying your hair. Also, I recommend even wearing an old t-shirt or something when letting it air dry at least after the first few washings because itdid stain one of my old hoodies a bit where it dried (if your hair&#x27;s short though you probably don&#x27;t need to worry about it).&lt;br /&gt;2. It stains your skin. Definitely use vaseline or something if you&#x27;re worried about that, but it does wash off after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s not so good on virgin hair. I had about 3/4&amp;#34; of roots when I died and while at first it stained the roots fairly well, after maybe a week or two they were pretty much completely back to the natural color. Not a big deal for me, but I would NOT recommend using this dye on virgin hair and expect it to stick around for very long. It might depend on your hair type though, so others could have better results than me (my natural hair is golden brown and thick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I decided not to keep using the dye just because it would be too much hassle to have to keep coloring my roots with a permanent color and then using this over top of it and I don&#x27;t want to mess with full on bleaching my hair at the moment (plus I have a feeling if I bleached it, I&#x27;d wind up needing to go with vampire red or something to get away with it at work). I rated it 5 stars though because it does what it says and it&#x27;s a good vibrant color. I wound up going with Ion creme in 7IR which on my hair was roughly the same shade as a more faded (yet still vibrant red) version of this, so it was a good compromise. Plus I like that with the permanent color I don&#x27;t really have to worry about all the bleeding except after the first wash or two. This color was still bleeding after one month (on that note though, washing with Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo really helps get a lot of the color out if anyone needs help removing this color to dye with something else).</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It came fast and came as shown/described :)   I bought two. One dyed my whole head!    [...]  I left it in for 1 hour and it only lasted about 3-4 days :/  I&#x27;m trying the other jar now and leaving it in much longer..hopefully that will work the fading problem :)</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again</li>
            <li> This color is so RED! I have short hair so every time I only use about 1/5 of jar. My hair was bleached and had perm. red hair dye that I have to re-apply every 4 weeks. I use this in between dye so the red doesn&#x27;t fade as bad. Red color fades so quickly. Even when you wash with cold water and use red shampoo, they will fade a little with every wash. I wash my hair almost daily, so imagine the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Before I use Manic Panic, I use purple shampoo to get rid of the brass build up on my hair. I put purple shampoo on dry hair, let it sit for 30 minutes, then rinse and dry. Don&#x27;t use conditioner if you are going to dye your hair after. Then I put Manic Panic on my hair, use finger to rub them on hair instead of combing. I let it sit for 2 hours, heat up your hair every 30 minutes, then wash dye off with lukewarm water, or as cold as you can take. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using really cold water because it will give me a headache and it&#x27;s really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This dye will completely fade around 10~14 wash. I don&#x27;t always wash my hair with cold water and I do wash my hair everyday. So this is pretty outcome.</li>
            <li> It was a lot darker red then we were looking for.</li>
            <li> This dye...  It is a bitter sweet experience. The color (on bleached hair) is great. It looks like red velvet. BUT, when I wake up, my neck is stained from back to front. My pillow case is stained. My shirts are stained. I have not washed my hair since I colored it because I know it is doomed as soon as the water touches it. So, if you need it foe a day, go for it. If you are looking for a more long-term commitment, option for something else.</li>
            <li> I used splat for years but the bleach was really patchy and made my hair feel like crap, so I tried  this because it&#x27;s also vegan. WOW this stuff is way better. I like this color more and my hair was much healthier after I dyed it. But you MUST comb it through your hair for good results, and if you have long hair be careful, I manged to splatter paint my arms and chest</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Perfect shade of red that I was looking for. I&#x27;m naturally dirty blonde and this is perfect without stripping your hair with bleach and damaging it.</li>
            <li> I buy it every 3-4 weeks. My hair is bleached so it washes out quickly but thats what reds do!</li>
            <li> A fan of the Manic Panic brand - this is my third purchase of colour choices for reds.  Keep up the high standards - grateful customer!</li>
            <li> worked great.  love the color</li>
            <li> Bright. Color does bleed when I&#x27;m sleeping. I wear a terry cloth turban an I&#x27;m fine. It&#x27;s been about two weeks and it&#x27;s still fairly bright. More of a pink than what I was expecting but I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this color for about a year. I have naturally dark hair which has been lightened a little and some sections are naturally pure white so when I apply this dye, parts are very dark red and others bright. I loved this color because it was a truer cherry/red velvet red and I could leave it on a long time without any damage. In the past as I rinsed my hair, it had blood red/orange tones but the last two times I&#x27;ve purchased it, the water has run hot pink like watered down beet juice and everything in sight is stained hot pink ... my pillowcases, skin, etc. And when it fades now it is less of a brassy red tone and is ... you guessed it ... hot pink. I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed, but I may try another shade or try mixing the Rock n&#x27; Roll with another color. It does seem to hold about a week or two longer. (Also, the Manic Panic website recommends the following after dying to help keep color from fading as fast: Mix equal parts of white vinegar with water, try a half a cup of each and put in a bowl or cup; pour on the vinegar and water mix; comb through your hair; and rinse it out with cold water.)</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use. How ever I found it not that interesting because of the small size it comes in.</li>
            <li> These Manic Panic are super pretty semi color I pair this up with the flamingo for a bright red ..I loved it ..</li>
            <li> Easy to put in and color came out great on me.  The staining was not that bad as I put vaseline on the sides of my skin and had no problem removing the stains that were there.</li>
            <li> Put this over henna&#x27;d hair so I could hold off a few weeks of dying it. Was awesome and super bright</li>
            <li> luv it!  easy to apply, great look.  quality product.</li>
            <li> Mixed with vampire red, left on for about 12 hours. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I used rock and roll red, red passion, and psychedelic sunset and It came out beautifully. Rock and roll red is my favorite of the three. I love it. I used heat and left it in for an hour or so. Give or take.</li>
            <li> best color i have ever used. super bright. instructions say 30 mins but i leave it on much longer for more brighter color and add heat. i love love love the rock n roll dye. its amazing. will stain everything and water will run red every time you shower. use cold water to keep color in. but it last for a while if you keep up with it. i put it in every 2-3 weeks. I HAVE RED STREAKS WITH brown and it pops soo good.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, no problems, thank you!</li>
            <li> i received my manic panic today, the jar was a lot smaller than i expected,(i have bought other jars of this in the past ans the size was always bigger) but i am happy that it was shipped in a timely matter and that it was packed with enough tape on the envelope that there was not escaping haha, i am over all happy with my order</li>
            <li> I used it all of the time, It the only color I use. Wish I could find it in a permanent dye.</li>
            <li> Great color, doesn&#x27;t last too much</li>
            <li> I recently went to the salon and got my hair colored red like Ariel but it fades very quickly. I leave this in for about an hour once a week and it refreshes my color. Looks just as red as the day I left the salon, not to mention that it conditions your hair very well.</li>
            <li> Doesnt really show in dark hair.</li>
            <li> Fades faster than other colors...but that&#x27;s red for ya!  Just color it again and freshen it up!</li>
            <li> just got it. preetty small soon apply it and will provide pictures !</li>
            <li> It worked very well! Didnt even need to bleach my hair!</li>
            <li> The color on the picture looks darker but when applied to hair it looks brighter.</li>
            <li> Very nice color! Easy to apply! When my daughter wants to go red, we&#x27;ll be sure to reorder this dye.</li>
            <li> It dyed my hair very well I LOVE this&lt;br /&gt;Hair dye</li>
