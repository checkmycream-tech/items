            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>but I think its more of a silver than gold.</li>
            <li>I need more gold, but this was my Texas colour.</li>
            <li>I love ibd</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Need more glitters in my collection.</li>
            <li>Absoulutely love it.</li>
            <li>The shade I purchased is filled with glitter and so sparkly!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Should have more glitter in it.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous golden (not orangey, but lightish gold)  </li>
            <li>glitter all over the place, stunning shine.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this, as a topcoat or not.</li>
            <li>, I was very excited for this to arrive.</li>
            <li>my favorite gel color :) so pretty!</li>
            <li>Easy to use Gel Polish.  </li>
            <li>It dries quick and glitters even more than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorite polishes I&#x27;ve ever bought from them!</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast, packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a long time and is a great price.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to celebrate an anniversary, but that didn&#x27;t work out..</li>
            <li>I own 3 other of their shades and they all have amazing formulas and cure well with a cheaper led lamp, I use the sensationail one.</li>
            <li>It only looks gold if i pair it with a warm color gel polish.</li>
            <li>it includes enough glider and able to finish only 2 coat + top coat.  </li>
            <li>So much glitter!</li>
            <li>It is gorgeous with a 2 coat application over a deep red, and being a gel, it holds up for over two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Super excited to have fun with mix and match with other colors.</li>
            <li>I expected really glittery gold but is more transparent and after 2 coats that golden shine is gently visible.</li>
            <li>However it is very saturated with glitter</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic brand and this specific color is no exception.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take that many coats and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>This polish is not like other gold glitter polishes that are a gold based color polish with glitter, so you are getting the full glitter effect in this one.</li>
            <li>This is a clear based gel polish with flecks of gold glitter.</li>
            <li>The nail polish covers very well, in only two coats.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all glitter that is beautiful by its self or with a base coat I only had to use two coat by its self to get full coverage and in the sun</li>

            <li> I have searched futilely for a very fine glitter in regular nail polish, and it seems that no one but me wants just a touch of glitter on my nail base color sometimes.  </li>

            <li> I expected gold.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and sometimes want only a light glitter, not a heavy, thick, extremely flashy glitter, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Fireworks.</li>
            <li> This glitter is a heavy glitter.  </li>
            <li> Lots of small glitter flakes that cover in 1 application.</li>
            <li> I HEART ibd, their stuff has never done me wrong</li>

            <li> One of my absolute favorite polishes I&#x27;ve ever bought from them! Its a beautiful golden champagne color.</li>
            <li> I love the color but I think its more of a silver than gold. It only looks gold if i pair it with a warm color gel polish. However it is very saturated with glitter so it doesn&#x27;t take that many coats and last a very long time. I think this is the only gel Nail polish that I have doesn&#x27;t chip after weeks of wear, only having to remove it because of my nail growth, and for the price you cant beat that.</li>
            <li> The nail polish covers very well, in only two coats. It stays on for a long time and is a great price.</li>
            <li> This glitter is a heavy glitter.  I have searched futilely for a very fine glitter in regular nail polish, and it seems that no one but me wants just a touch of glitter on my nail base color sometimes.  Then I found IBD soak-off gel Fireworks, which gives me that tasteful sparkle.  It is gorgeous with a 2 coat application over a deep red, and being a gel, it holds up for over two weeks.  What isn&#x27;t to like?  If you&#x27;re like me and sometimes want only a light glitter, not a heavy, thick, extremely flashy glitter, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with Fireworks. Or, if you are in the mood for more bling on your nails, you can&#x27;t go wrong with All That Glitters.</li>
            <li> I need more gold, but this was my Texas colour.</li>
            <li> Small silver sparkles suspended in clear sparkles. I expected gold.The polish cures effectively. If it was the color described, I would have given it four stars</li>
            <li> I love ibd it&#x27;s a fantastic brand and this specific color is no exception. It&#x27;s an all glitter that is beautiful by its self or with a base coat I only had to use two coat by its self to get full coverage and in the sun it&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li> This will be great for the holidays! I cannot wait to use it then! I originally bought it to celebrate an anniversary, but that didn&#x27;t work out..</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! I find that it is best to shake it before every coat. Definitely a good idea to use a thin amount of each application as it tends to pool at the sides just a bit if it is a thick coat. It dries quick and glitters even more than I thought it would. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and wears great with Gelish products. It&#x27;s a prefect holiday choice or to accent a nail. Need more glitters in my collection.</li>
            <li> my favorite gel color :) so pretty!</li>
            <li> Easy to use Gel Polish.  it includes enough glider and able to finish only 2 coat + top coat.  This can save my time.</li>
            <li> Heckuva deal - great quality and best price I find anywhere.  Since when are the number of words required for a review?</li>
            <li> excellent product and love the color Would recommend to everyone.  I will repurchase it again.  Absoulutely love it. LLLLLLL LLL</li>
            <li> I really love this glittery polish! They weren&#x27;t kidding when they named it &amp;#34;All that Glitters&amp;#34;! This is a clear based gel polish with flecks of gold glitter. It is so pretty, the gold glitter in this polish is very nice and relective. This polish is not like other gold glitter polishes that are a gold based color polish with glitter, so you are getting the full glitter effect in this one. Definately one of my faves. This polish takes about 3 layers for a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cure well under the lamp.</li>
            <li> Very nice golden shimmer polish.  Great for accent nails and the holidays!</li>
            <li> I love IBD just gel polishes! The shade I purchased is filled with glitter and so sparkly! I own 3 other of their shades and they all have amazing formulas and cure well with a cheaper led lamp, I use the sensationail one. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more shades!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Glitter Polish that was Glitter polish, not just speckles. I HEART ibd, their stuff has never done me wrong, I was very excited for this to arrive. Shipment was fast, packaging was nice. The polish goes on GREAT, the glitter coverage is AWESOME. Super excited to have fun with mix and match with other colors.</li>
            <li> If you want glitter this is THE BEST.  So much glitter! It is amazing.  Love this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Lots of small glitter flakes that cover in 1 application. This polish does not have to be in great lighting to show the sparkle.  I get alot of compliments on my nails when I use this.</li>
            <li> Nice concentrated glitter. Sort of a cross between gold and silver...not gold and silver glitter mixed...the color doesn&#x27;t look strictly gold or silver...somewhere in between. Really nice.</li>
            <li> Should have more glitter in it. I expected really glittery gold but is more transparent and after 2 coats that golden shine is gently visible.</li>
            <li> EEK!! My favorite!! Gorgeous golden (not orangey, but lightish gold)  glitter all over the place, stunning shine.  I am in love with this, as a topcoat or not.</li>
            <li> I  loved this color can be used on it&#x27;s own or is also great when applied over another color .</li>
