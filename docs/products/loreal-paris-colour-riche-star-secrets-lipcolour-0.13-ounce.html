            <li> The other one, although still in the box, was old, gross and smelled.  </li>

            <li> When they arrived, the outside of the lipstick tubes looked dirty, and sticky Like they had been handled by multiple people!</li>
            <li> Sticky and not pleasant.</li>
            <li> The lipstick itself was brand new, but again, the tubes were in bad shape!</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> The lipstick didn&#x27;t include an expiration date, but, believe me, something was very wrong:  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed the company no longer has them.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed when it was discontinued.  </li>

            <li> I got this for my mom and she loved it.  I think they discontinued this particular color or something...  Anyway, this works just as well as the original and is lasting just the same.</li>
            <li> Lipstick was not quite the color in the photo. Sticky and not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love this color! It&#x27;s the perfect blend of neutral and color and prefect for all skin tones. I have very fair skin and get many complements when wearing this lip color. I wish this color was still in production!! I only gave it 3 stars because of the condition of the tubes. When they arrived, the outside of the lipstick tubes looked dirty, and sticky Like they had been handled by multiple people! Yuck! One of the tubes fell apart, another one wouldn&#x27;t twist up, and another one couldn&#x27;t keep the lid on. The lipstick itself was brand new, but again, the tubes were in bad shape! Overall, great product, crummy tubes!</li>
            <li> Great color!  Too expensive</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick!  The color is perfect for me and the moisture feels great on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this lipstick to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this color for several years and could not find this color in the stores. Very happy I found it online.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with this product.  Looked every where and finally I found it in e bay.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Mom who has red hair.  It looks way better on her.  I have dark brown hair with warm complexion but this was still too orange toned for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered two lipsticks.  When they arrived, one was great.  The other one, although still in the box, was old, gross and smelled.  These lipsticks were very inexpensive however, shipping was not so I just requested that they send me another one.  I guess my biggest complaint is that I never got any kind of a response from them.</li>
            <li> I totally love this lipstick and have been devasted that it was not available in stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lipstick I received had some issues with the twisting mechanism used to push the lipstick up.  The seller was SO gracious and sent me a replacement immediately.  Very pleased with the product AND very pleased with the exceptional service provided by the seller.  :)</li>
            <li> I ordered #2 tubes of lipstick.....1 of the tubes had an odor to it and did not glide on the lips at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this color and texture. Way better than lipgloss. I looked for this at my local grocery store but they didn&#x27;t sell it, am very please to have found it online!</li>
            <li> is the color I like must&lt;br /&gt;I do no to have more to say, with this is OK for me</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this colour.  Unfortunately, L&#x27;Oreal discontinued, yet another, wonderful colour. Oh, well, so glad for this Seller and Amazon.Com!</li>
            <li> This was the lipstick that I was looking for and it is just what  I ordered. It is a very pretty color</li>
            <li> I miss being able to buy this in stores!</li>
            <li> Great Deal...quick delivery...thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this shade of lipstick. Unfortunately it has been discontinued. Hopefully they will bring it back - maybe without Eva&#x27;s name on it?</li>
            <li> This L&amp;#34;oreal shade has been a favorite of mine since it was introduced.  I am disappointed the company no longer has them.  I am delighted to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and its quality.  And will purchase more in the future as this is her favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is really nice. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, the color is perfect not as dark looking as it may seem it would be. Good price too as lipsticks go.</li>
            <li> Love the rich color and moisture of this lipstick.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the delivere is very fast . The product came very safe I tell ever one to buy it</li>
            <li> The lipstick didn&#x27;t include an expiration date, but, believe me, something was very wrong:  i rubbed it on my lips  many times and it didn&#x27;t give me any color.  Also, it smelled funny.  The shade in the bar looked lovely,  but what&#x27;s the point if it never got to my lips. If i want to return it, post will cost more than the lipstick itself.  I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this color and the creaminess of this lipstick makes my lips smooth and works like chapstick.  I hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this other day and was expected to get it Wednesday to Friday and it came in on Monday! I was super excited about the fast shipping! Not only that, but the product was packaged very well, and safe! Colors are perfect and exactly what I wanted! I love the Eva&#x27;s Caramel! Such a gorgeous brown. Would definitely recommend this product and seller to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I can still purchase this color - goes well with my&lt;br /&gt;complexion  and the colors of my clothing.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  Very disappointed when it was discontinued.  Glad i found it here.  Will be ordering again.  Fast shipping.</li>
