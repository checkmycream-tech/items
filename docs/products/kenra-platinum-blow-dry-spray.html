            <li>My wife wanted this product because she found it at a salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair softer and smoother, but by the end of the day, it was fairly limp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>But it does smell really good.</li>
            <li>This is very important!</li>

            <li>It is the absolute best heat protectant I have ever used</li>
            <li>My stylist used this on my hair and it was wonderful, but I assumed it was the whole &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>The best product, it dries your hair fast and leaves it smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li>It smells very strong, but I like it as it reminds me of the beach.</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>It is very light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>But if I don&#x27;t use it, it seems that my hair feels coarser and more fly-away.</li>
            <li>i say more?  </li>
            <li>i love this product@ seller is wonder aswell</li>
            <li>Cut my drying time by approx 40% love the fact I won&#x27;t have the heat on it longer.</li>
            <li>Always make sure I have on hand.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt be happier:)</li>
            <li>, and I&#x27;m thinking of buying more of their hair products now.</li>
            <li>Bought more because I love it.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I am okay with that.  </li>
            <li>one\\&quot;!!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this spray.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but the spray nozzle is defective.  </li>
            <li>favorite thing is that I swear it reduces the damage and dryness from blow drying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really shortens blow drying time, but it is a great detangler/heat protector none-the-less</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>Better than nexus heat protexx, and easier than any serum (which weighed me down)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been useing the kenra blow-dry spray for a while I really love this product it works great and smells better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, I really believe if you use it you will love it, everytime I use it</li>
            <li>it smells great and really tames my hair with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not yet sure</li>
            <li>I love Kenra products, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>It is seriously magical.</li>
            <li>and I sort of don&#x27;t want to know, because it is magical.</li>
            <li>I am a bargain hunter and mostly use drug store products.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it protects the hair and gives it that shine.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>The best for flat ironing wavy or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The main reason I like it is that I feel that it&#x27;s a great heat damage protector for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a beachy sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I love it and works great on my hair by keeping it soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best spray on blow dry conditioners, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>This is the SINGLE BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Stuff is the best of the best...use it on towel dry hair and it smells delish!  </li>
            <li>Smells great and really does cut drying time significantly.</li>
            <li>WOW, a really great product</li>
            <li>Also, I cannot return it in good faith - I&#x27;ve used too much of it at this point.  </li>
            <li>I got a travel size of the Kenra Blow-Dry Spray as a free sample from a store, and was excited to try it!</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to order from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The smell is EXTREMELY strong.  </li>
            <li>However, the perfume it is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I have hair to my butt and it cuts down on blow-drying time, not to mention the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, but I have a lot.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, blond hair that goes to my bra line</li>
            <li>I have lots of shoulder-length, baby fine hair that tends to run on the oily side.</li>
            <li>multiple purchases - great product</li>
            <li>leaves hair silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li>but it really looks nice when I use it.</li>
            <li>leaves hair feeling smooth</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works great as protector to flat ironing/curling too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great, and really gets my hair super straight</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and works great in helping me dry my hair in half the time!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the product</li>
            <li>I have to improvise significantly when applying it.  </li>
            <li>It does cut my blow drying time significantly.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really makes your hair silky smooth and soft, without flyaways.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, sweet, candy/bubble-gum odor, that doesn&#x27;t dissipate much throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>The smell is nice &amp; it&#x27;s a good thing to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry &amp; need to blow dry fast --</li>
            <li>I ran the straightening iron over it and it straightened right out!</li>
            <li>Check it out if you need a good heat protectant, but you may want to consider something else if you&#x27;re only looking for a blow-dry speeder.</li>
            <li>The true test was here...</li>
            <li>cool product.</li>
            <li>It is light weight (no build up), helps the hair dry faster and smells good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found many things in salons that I can&#x27;t find something just as good at the drug store for less....</li>
            <li>We had a warm, humid day recently, so I was excited to try this product, to see if it kept my hair smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, smells better than any other I have tried ( my husband notices every time i spray it) and my hair dries really fast.</li>
            <li>We got the product very quickly and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It feels super silky in my hair too.  </li>
            <li>This is the best smelling, fast working product if you want your hair to dry fast.</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with fine hair or people who are sensitive to strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>Good for blow dry ....</li>
            <li>my over colored damaged hair becomes after washing, but it also help in the drying time and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my hair look as healthy, shiny and be as soft as it is now.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try?</li>
            <li>Worth the price though to continue buying...?</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I was done in just under 10 minutes, and couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised.</li>
            <li>So I guess it could be worth it to some.</li>
            <li>and I gave 3 ponytails worth).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely something worth trying if you have to rush in the morning</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this stuff does anything other than make my hair smell so good.  </li>
            <li>Perfect stuff really does live up to its claims and you just need a few pumps.</li>
            <li>but I guess I&#x27;m always hoping for something much more amazing to happen to my fine, thin damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It kinda smells like strong cheap pre-teen perfume but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair its only when you first spray it.</li>
            <li>I just baught this and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This not only protects your hair from heat, but it also dtangles better than any detangler I have ever baught.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, and makes your hair realllly soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Exactly as listed would buy again</li>
            <li>If anyone wants my leftovers, let me know!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>and they look so funny when I tell them that</li>
            <li>I was definitely skeptical, but I used it yesterday and was so impressed.</li>
            <li>and I just get so hot.</li>
            <li>Creates a sleek, soft appearance and the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smoothes your hair without any heavy oil or residue and smells good too.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product to leave you with a great blow dry, I would definitely try this.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really works to get my hair super straight.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the good reviews, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work for me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Smells good and really does cut blowdry time in half!</li>
            <li>I have also found that I have to use less hairspray because I am not trying to tame as many fly aways or unruly pieces.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and helps my hair dry quicker</li>
            <li>This blow dry spray helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>Not an alcohol smell like most blow dry sprays.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with fine hair that wants to protect it from heat.</li>
            <li>I just have not seen a huge cut back in time but perhaps my one spray is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really does so substantially, but maybe by a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>I think the jojoba oil in it really helps with that, and I think I have fewer fly-aways, too.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t find it to be too much.</li>
            <li>But in all honesty, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>This spray works very well.  </li>
            <li>I also hair oily hair and know that too much would just cause it to need to be washed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who has problems with their hair being real fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to use as much conditioner, and this stuff detangles like a dream.</li>
            <li>It really protects your hair.</li>
            <li>It really does work quite well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>far I love the Kenra line, I want to try their shampoo &amp; conditioner for Color Treated Hair next!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and definitely cuts down on blow dry time.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and heat serums just weigh it down and make it feel oily.</li>
            <li>This spray doesn&#x27;t do that, it smells great, and it has the added bonus of seriously shortening my blow-dry time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need the flat iron nearly as much to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>but I have super fine hair and it tends to make it feel a bit heavy a tad greasy(ish)</li>
            <li>I need to be able to dry my hair quickly and to not have to use a million other products to make it manageable and pretty.</li>
            <li>It never took more than 10 minutes to dry my hair completely and with the spray</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>This spray has transformed my fine, dry hair!</li>
            <li>Less than 3 minutes later, my past-shoulders, incredibly thick/course hair was dry.</li>
            <li>I suspect that this product would be great for people with thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prone to being very oily pretty quickly, so I&#x27;m hesitant to use anything other than shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my hair lady used it on me, and it didn&#x27;t take long at all for her to dry it, my hair was not as full, frizzy or poofy like it normally is after blow drying, and it was super silky!</li>
            <li>I am not in love with the scent, it is a little perfumey for my tastes</li>
            <li>I used this product and my hair became a little more shiner than before.</li>
            <li>So I went in and bought some, tried it the next day, and it&#x27;s the spray that really makes such a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed directions on bottle  (which I don&#x27;t normally do because I have an attitude</li>
            <li>Cuts hair drying time by more than half!  </li>
            <li>Really protects hair from hot hair dryers, curlers, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, I do not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I just ran out of this product and need a new bottle now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very low maintenance girl, and I rarely finish off a product before it gets old.</li>
            <li>This light-weight spray helps my processed hair dry quickly and keeps it silky.</li>
            <li>I have natural thin frizzy curly hair,  this is good.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft when I use this product.</li>
            <li>Because it is a spray its easy to get evenly distributed throughout the back of my long hair.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Makes it so soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>I was advised by the person I purchased my first bottle from to only do 3 squirts-</li>
            <li>I have to be ready to leave for work every day by 6:30am, and so anything that can let me stay in bed a few minutes longer is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was using that famous oil ( starts with a M - won&#x27;t name names) that was $20+ for a small bottle.</li>
            <li>it cuts your blow dry time in half , smells amazing and still protects your hair from the heat damage.</li>
            <li>This is one of the very few Kenra products that I love.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, and with a 2 yr old boy at home, every single minute I have to myself is precious.</li>
            <li>As previous reviewers mentioned, this product does smell good and it&#x27;s helpful if I use a little bit -</li>
            <li>Takes a small amount to give your hair the needed spray to prevent static when drying hair and  makes hair ready for curling or flat iron when done.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft, without making it feel greasy, and it protects it.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work well thus far.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick, so the spray really helps the speed of drying!</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly/wavy hair that weights down easily with most products leaving my hair flat.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised how fast my hair dried the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really leaves my hair sooooo soft, as long as I use the blow dryer...</li>
            <li>I will add that after using it, if using enough, it makes my hair soooo soft!!</li>
            <li>I can tell you, I have very think long hair and it takes forever to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff definitely cut the drying time down significantly.</li>
            <li>Really does help me dry my hair faster</li>
            <li>could not believe how fast this product helped dry my hair with the blow dryer...</li>
            <li>It really does help my hair dry faster</li>
            <li>bought the giant bottle, and three months later, still have more than half left....</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find a bigger bottle here.</li>
            <li>I thought it made my hair extra soft too.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair (like I donated it to locks for love once</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice any big difference with frizz or dry time.</li>
            <li>Prepare for your hair to dry 500000x faster than normal.</li>
            <li>However, I have fine, slightly wavy hair, but a LOT of it, and it takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li>Use it on my hair before I dry it and even after to give it very soft and silky finish.</li>
            <li>humidity will make my hair get extremely frizzy and large, I do plan to try it again when the weather gets hot and humid, to see if that helps tame my hair.  </li>
            <li>While it did seem to work--my hair dried a bit faster than normal--it didn&#x27;t have the same lasting power as what I was given at the salon (and by that I mean that amazing smell wore off almost immediately, as opposed to my salon &#x27;</li>
            <li>I blow dry almost every day, and I noticed a difference in how soft my hair is after using this product.  </li>
            <li>hair is very thick (as in I have a lot of hair), but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have fine, dry hair, which is especially hard to handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super long right now, at least a couple inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>It also causes my hair to be so shiny and soft whether I am going to flat iron or simple blow dry.</li>

            <li> It just smells so dang good.</li>
            <li> I started using it when my hairdresser used it on my hair and loved how my hair felt.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this product because she found it at a salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair softer and smoother, but by the end of the day, it was fairly limp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> But it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> This is very important!</li>

            <li> It is the absolute best heat protectant I have ever used</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair and it was wonderful, but I assumed it was the whole &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> The best product, it dries your hair fast and leaves it smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li> It smells very strong, but I like it as it reminds me of the beach.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li> It is very light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> But if I don&#x27;t use it, it seems that my hair feels coarser and more fly-away.</li>
            <li> i say more?  </li>
            <li> i love this product@ seller is wonder aswell</li>
            <li> Cut my drying time by approx 40% love the fact I won&#x27;t have the heat on it longer.</li>
            <li> Always make sure I have on hand.</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt be happier:)</li>
            <li> , and I&#x27;m thinking of buying more of their hair products now.</li>
            <li> Bought more because I love it.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I am okay with that.  </li>
            <li> one\\&quot;!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this spray.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the spray nozzle is defective.  </li>
            <li> favorite thing is that I swear it reduces the damage and dryness from blow drying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really shortens blow drying time, but it is a great detangler/heat protector none-the-less</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> Better than nexus heat protexx, and easier than any serum (which weighed me down)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been useing the kenra blow-dry spray for a while I really love this product it works great and smells better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, I really believe if you use it you will love it, everytime I use it</li>
            <li> it smells great and really tames my hair with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not yet sure</li>
            <li> I love Kenra products, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> It is seriously magical.</li>
            <li> and I sort of don&#x27;t want to know, because it is magical.</li>
            <li> I am a bargain hunter and mostly use drug store products.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I seriously love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it protects the hair and gives it that shine.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> The best for flat ironing wavy or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The main reason I like it is that I feel that it&#x27;s a great heat damage protector for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a beachy sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I love it and works great on my hair by keeping it soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best spray on blow dry conditioners, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> This is the SINGLE BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Stuff is the best of the best...use it on towel dry hair and it smells delish!  </li>
            <li> Smells great and really does cut drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> WOW, a really great product</li>
            <li> Also, I cannot return it in good faith - I&#x27;ve used too much of it at this point.  </li>
            <li> I got a travel size of the Kenra Blow-Dry Spray as a free sample from a store, and was excited to try it!</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient to order from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The smell is EXTREMELY strong.  </li>
            <li> However, the perfume it is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> I have hair to my butt and it cuts down on blow-drying time, not to mention the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, but I have a lot.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, blond hair that goes to my bra line</li>
            <li> I have lots of shoulder-length, baby fine hair that tends to run on the oily side.</li>
            <li> multiple purchases - great product</li>
            <li> leaves hair silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li> but it really looks nice when I use it.</li>
            <li> leaves hair feeling smooth</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great as protector to flat ironing/curling too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells great, and really gets my hair super straight</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works great in helping me dry my hair in half the time!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product</li>
            <li> I have to improvise significantly when applying it.  </li>
            <li> It does cut my blow drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really makes your hair silky smooth and soft, without flyaways.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong, sweet, candy/bubble-gum odor, that doesn&#x27;t dissipate much throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> The smell is nice &amp; it&#x27;s a good thing to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry &amp; need to blow dry fast --</li>
            <li> I ran the straightening iron over it and it straightened right out!</li>
            <li> Check it out if you need a good heat protectant, but you may want to consider something else if you&#x27;re only looking for a blow-dry speeder.</li>
            <li> The true test was here...</li>
            <li> cool product.</li>
            <li> It is light weight (no build up), helps the hair dry faster and smells good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found many things in salons that I can&#x27;t find something just as good at the drug store for less....</li>
            <li> We had a warm, humid day recently, so I was excited to try this product, to see if it kept my hair smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, smells better than any other I have tried ( my husband notices every time i spray it) and my hair dries really fast.</li>
            <li> We got the product very quickly and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It feels super silky in my hair too.  </li>
            <li> This is the best smelling, fast working product if you want your hair to dry fast.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with fine hair or people who are sensitive to strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Good for blow dry ....</li>
            <li> my over colored damaged hair becomes after washing, but it also help in the drying time and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my hair look as healthy, shiny and be as soft as it is now.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try?</li>
            <li> Worth the price though to continue buying...?</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I was done in just under 10 minutes, and couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised.</li>
            <li> So I guess it could be worth it to some.</li>
            <li> and I gave 3 ponytails worth).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely something worth trying if you have to rush in the morning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff does anything other than make my hair smell so good.  </li>
            <li> Perfect stuff really does live up to its claims and you just need a few pumps.</li>
            <li> but I guess I&#x27;m always hoping for something much more amazing to happen to my fine, thin damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It kinda smells like strong cheap pre-teen perfume but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair its only when you first spray it.</li>
            <li> I just baught this and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This not only protects your hair from heat, but it also dtangles better than any detangler I have ever baught.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, and makes your hair realllly soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed would buy again</li>
            <li> If anyone wants my leftovers, let me know!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> and they look so funny when I tell them that</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical, but I used it yesterday and was so impressed.</li>
            <li> and I just get so hot.</li>
            <li> Creates a sleek, soft appearance and the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smoothes your hair without any heavy oil or residue and smells good too.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product to leave you with a great blow dry, I would definitely try this.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really works to get my hair super straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work for me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Smells good and really does cut blowdry time in half!</li>
            <li> I have also found that I have to use less hairspray because I am not trying to tame as many fly aways or unruly pieces.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and helps my hair dry quicker</li>
            <li> This blow dry spray helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Not an alcohol smell like most blow dry sprays.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with fine hair that wants to protect it from heat.</li>
            <li> I just have not seen a huge cut back in time but perhaps my one spray is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really does so substantially, but maybe by a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> I think the jojoba oil in it really helps with that, and I think I have fewer fly-aways, too.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t find it to be too much.</li>
            <li> But in all honesty, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> This spray works very well.  </li>
            <li> I also hair oily hair and know that too much would just cause it to need to be washed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who has problems with their hair being real fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to use as much conditioner, and this stuff detangles like a dream.</li>
            <li> It really protects your hair.</li>
            <li> It really does work quite well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> far I love the Kenra line, I want to try their shampoo &amp; conditioner for Color Treated Hair next!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and definitely cuts down on blow dry time.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and heat serums just weigh it down and make it feel oily.</li>
            <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t do that, it smells great, and it has the added bonus of seriously shortening my blow-dry time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need the flat iron nearly as much to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> but I have super fine hair and it tends to make it feel a bit heavy a tad greasy(ish)</li>
            <li> I need to be able to dry my hair quickly and to not have to use a million other products to make it manageable and pretty.</li>
            <li> It never took more than 10 minutes to dry my hair completely and with the spray</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> This spray has transformed my fine, dry hair!</li>
            <li> Less than 3 minutes later, my past-shoulders, incredibly thick/course hair was dry.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this product would be great for people with thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prone to being very oily pretty quickly, so I&#x27;m hesitant to use anything other than shampoo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> my hair lady used it on me, and it didn&#x27;t take long at all for her to dry it, my hair was not as full, frizzy or poofy like it normally is after blow drying, and it was super silky!</li>
            <li> I am not in love with the scent, it is a little perfumey for my tastes</li>
            <li> I used this product and my hair became a little more shiner than before.</li>
            <li> So I went in and bought some, tried it the next day, and it&#x27;s the spray that really makes such a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed directions on bottle  (which I don&#x27;t normally do because I have an attitude</li>
            <li> Cuts hair drying time by more than half!  </li>
            <li> Really protects hair from hot hair dryers, curlers, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, I do not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I just ran out of this product and need a new bottle now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very low maintenance girl, and I rarely finish off a product before it gets old.</li>
            <li> This light-weight spray helps my processed hair dry quickly and keeps it silky.</li>
            <li> I have natural thin frizzy curly hair,  this is good.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Because it is a spray its easy to get evenly distributed throughout the back of my long hair.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Makes it so soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> I was advised by the person I purchased my first bottle from to only do 3 squirts-</li>
            <li> I have to be ready to leave for work every day by 6:30am, and so anything that can let me stay in bed a few minutes longer is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was using that famous oil ( starts with a M - won&#x27;t name names) that was $20+ for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> it cuts your blow dry time in half , smells amazing and still protects your hair from the heat damage.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few Kenra products that I love.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, and with a 2 yr old boy at home, every single minute I have to myself is precious.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers mentioned, this product does smell good and it&#x27;s helpful if I use a little bit -</li>
            <li> Takes a small amount to give your hair the needed spray to prevent static when drying hair and  makes hair ready for curling or flat iron when done.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft, without making it feel greasy, and it protects it.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well thus far.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick, so the spray really helps the speed of drying!</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly/wavy hair that weights down easily with most products leaving my hair flat.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how fast my hair dried the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really leaves my hair sooooo soft, as long as I use the blow dryer...</li>
            <li> I will add that after using it, if using enough, it makes my hair soooo soft!!</li>
            <li> I can tell you, I have very think long hair and it takes forever to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely cut the drying time down significantly.</li>
            <li> Really does help me dry my hair faster</li>
            <li> could not believe how fast this product helped dry my hair with the blow dryer...</li>
            <li> It really does help my hair dry faster</li>
            <li> bought the giant bottle, and three months later, still have more than half left....</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find a bigger bottle here.</li>
            <li> I thought it made my hair extra soft too.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair (like I donated it to locks for love once</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any big difference with frizz or dry time.</li>
            <li> Prepare for your hair to dry 500000x faster than normal.</li>
            <li> However, I have fine, slightly wavy hair, but a LOT of it, and it takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Use it on my hair before I dry it and even after to give it very soft and silky finish.</li>
            <li> humidity will make my hair get extremely frizzy and large, I do plan to try it again when the weather gets hot and humid, to see if that helps tame my hair.  </li>
            <li> While it did seem to work--my hair dried a bit faster than normal--it didn&#x27;t have the same lasting power as what I was given at the salon (and by that I mean that amazing smell wore off almost immediately, as opposed to my salon &#x27;</li>
            <li> I blow dry almost every day, and I noticed a difference in how soft my hair is after using this product.  </li>
            <li> hair is very thick (as in I have a lot of hair), but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have fine, dry hair, which is especially hard to handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super long right now, at least a couple inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It also causes my hair to be so shiny and soft whether I am going to flat iron or simple blow dry.</li>
            <li> Norm dry time is st least a full ten minutes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and I really feel like it protects my hair through a blow dry and a curling iron.</li>
            <li> and this spray really cuts down my blow dry time.</li>
            <li> (I have pretty thick, red hair that goes to just above the middle of my back).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t timed myself, so I&#x27;m not sure how much time it saves but its definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> It also fastens the dry time of my hair naturally without having to blow dry or spend a lot of time waiting around for my hair to completely dry.</li>
            <li> Kenra blow dry spray really cuts the blow dry time in half.</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoy this product, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the price can be a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who blow dries or flat irons their hair.</li>
            <li> I either flat iron or curl my hair every day and either way</li>
            <li> Also use before my flat iron or curling wand.</li>
            <li> It also works well using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> ( I also use the goody quick dry half round brush which makes my blowout</li>
            <li> before I blow dry- use a different flat iron spray when I flat</li>
            <li> This cut down my prep time by at least 50%...which is much welcomed early in the morning!</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is a heat protector,  my hair doesnt seem as dry as it did before i starting using.  </li>
            <li> Cuts blowdrying in half and makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> This does not have the same effect if you do not blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> It really does cut down on blow drying time and does not weigh down my hair or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a lot, especially if you towel dry well before blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I use this product after working out and when I can&#x27;t go back to work with wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I do have pretty thin hair, maybe someone with thicker hair would notice a bigger difference.</li>
            <li> Normally I am too lazy to blow dry my hair because it takes like 45 minutes</li>
            <li> While it does not cut blowdry time in half, it definitely shaves a few minutes off somehow, and leaves hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Blow dry or air dry.  </li>
            <li> this product does help dry my hair faster, not lightening speed mind you but its definately faster.</li>
            <li> with Kenra blow dry spray</li>
            <li> my dry time is now about 20 min.</li>
            <li> and I use it to get my hair to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> and I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Cuts my dry time to under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> However this stuff seems to lose the smell once dry</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would protect my hair since I blow dry and straighten it every day.  </li>
            <li> It does dry faster, straighter, softer, shinier.  </li>
            <li> Helps to dry your hair faster.</li>
            <li> I had to have several deep heat therapies after using this for a few wks.</li>
            <li> I used to dread drying my hair because it took so long and left it feeling dry and not clean.</li>
            <li> It does cut your hair drying time in half, I normaly take about 20min to dry my hair and with this stuff it only took about 10min!</li>
            <li> cannot say that it helps cut down on drying time and that is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It definitely cuts down on the blow drying time</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this will last me quite a while...</li>
            <li> I have long natural textured hair and blow drying can take at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair acted exactly the same as it would have without the product - frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li> it probably takes roughly 7 minutes to dry my hair now.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that&#x27;s naturally curly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps remove the tangled mess</li>
            <li> A few sprays of it on my damp hair leaves my thick long hair ( to my lower back), Sooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thick and stick straight.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times, in vary amounts, but I couldn&#x27;t make it work.</li>
            <li> Use it with heat spray and big fat round</li>
            <li> The next day I washed and dried and poof.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser gave me an almost empty bottle to try.  </li>
            <li> I used a timer the last time I dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughters thick natural hair</li>
            <li> Cuts blow dry time in half and also Leaves your hair with a silky shine too....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three spritzes and my hair is dry in half the time.</li>
            <li> and it literally cuts my blow dry time in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, I purchased on a friends recommendation, and she has completely different hair than I do.</li>
            <li> It cuts my blow dry time in half.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way though-</li>
            <li> I wish it were less expensive, but it&#x27;s so worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I spray it on wet hair before brushing and it works as a detangler so well!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but a lot of people were âswearing by itâ and considering blowdrying my hair is rather time consuming, I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li> but I tried it today and it did speed the dry time and made my hair a little straighter after blow drying..</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and it usually takes me 15-20 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It almost made me feel like I had to hurry and blow dry my head before my hair dried</li>
            <li> and my hair tends to hold moisture and usually takes a long time to blow dry; I would say it cuts the time in half.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly - only complaint is that one was slightly leaking when received.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m forever looking for products that will moisturize it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It visibly smooths out the hair cuticle but without flattening or weighing down the hair.  </li>
            <li> and it does cut down on my drying time.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair feeling weighted down and lifeless.</li>
            <li> and it usually takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> However, The Kenra Plantinum blow dry spray ROCKS!!!!  </li>
            <li> (half price in fact)</li>
            <li> I do notice that it cuts down on the drying time a little, but</li>
            <li> and it was a mess,</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be cutting down drying time that much.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on and immediately got nervous because it seemed a little slimy in my hair</li>
            <li> It is a little oily.  </li>
            <li> maybe I needed to keep rewetting the sections before I dried?  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my stylist and bought it at the salon a few times before coming to Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper.</li>
            <li> spray one spray into my hand and the distribute throughout my hair when it is towel dried.  </li>
            <li> Cuts drying time in half!</li>
            <li> to my surprise I blow dried my hair (in 5 minutes-it usually takes 10) and there were no tangles.</li>
            <li> (I have thin, brittle hair that gets oily after 12 hours, unless I put dry shampoo in it)</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and down past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Not sure it this was meant for Permed hair</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> I usually have to run a straightener over the lumps in my hair before bedtime or it takes me forever to straighten in the morning to get all of the creases and lumps out of it</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this product, not really sure what it would do.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dried faster, easier to style, softer, smoother, shinier, etc!</li>
            <li> I will say that since it is silicon based I sometimes have to wipe my hands on a towel as I am styling because my hands get slick, so be mindful of that.</li>
            <li> honesty don&#x27;t even need to curl or straighten my hair if I use enough of this which is just crazy for my unruly, THICK and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Some mornings I&#x27;m running late.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick.</li>
            <li> for thick hair</li>
            <li> or if you have thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> I have kinky and thick AA hair</li>
            <li> I mean, it just smells</li>
            <li> and it keeps my blow-out for a few days!!</li>
            <li> A total waste :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair</li>

            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is just too oily for my hair, and made it feel greasy and look stringy.</li>
            <li> brush--  straightens and tames my crazy hair.  </li>
            <li> But this does not make my hair greasy like I was afraid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much trouble finding a heat protectant that wasn&#x27;t greasy or made my hair feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> knotted :(</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This spray is the best! It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps remove the tangled mess my over colored damaged hair becomes after washing, but it also help in the drying time and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy...WOW, a really great product</li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder this product.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and I really feel like it protects my hair through a blow dry and a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Not sure it this was meant for Permed hair but I tried it today and it did speed the dry time and made my hair a little straighter after blow drying.. It almost made me feel like I had to hurry and blow dry my head before my hair dried knotted :( maybe I needed to keep rewetting the sections before I dried?  Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again I believe it  probably works best on unpermed hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and what it does for my hair. A few sprays of it on my damp hair leaves my thick long hair ( to my lower back), Sooo soft and shiny. It also fastens the dry time of my hair naturally without having to blow dry or spend a lot of time waiting around for my hair to completely dry. Overall I really enjoy this product, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the price can be a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I love it and works great on my hair by keeping it soft and sleek. I have natural thin frizzy curly hair,  this is good.</li>
            <li> Stuff is the best of the best...use it on towel dry hair and it smells delish!  Cuts drying time in half! Blow dry or air dry.  Detangles and protects and makes your hair feel fresh for at least 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this product based on a review in Self magazine that said it would help speed up blow-dry time.  I don&#x27;t know if it really does so substantially, but maybe by a couple of minutes.  The main reason I like it is that I feel that it&#x27;s a great heat damage protector for my hair.  I blow dry almost every day, and I noticed a difference in how soft my hair is after using this product.  I think the jojoba oil in it really helps with that, and I think I have fewer fly-aways, too.  Check it out if you need a good heat protectant, but you may want to consider something else if you&#x27;re only looking for a blow-dry speeder.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do the job....making hair smoother.  I don&#x27;t see that my hair dries any quicker however.  But if I don&#x27;t use it, it seems that my hair feels coarser and more fly-away.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting my hair done at the salon and googling furiously to see what they used. While it did seem to work--my hair dried a bit faster than normal--it didn&#x27;t have the same lasting power as what I was given at the salon (and by that I mean that amazing smell wore off almost immediately, as opposed to my salon &#x27;do managing to hold its scent for two days).</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this.  WOW!  My hair used to have a lot of frizz to it. I don&#x27;t know why.  I take vitamins, have tried every product under the sun, get regular haircuts, etc.. However, The Kenra Plantinum blow dry spray ROCKS!!!!  I&#x27;ve never had my hair look as healthy, shiny and be as soft as it is now.  I don&#x27;t have very thick hair so drying time is not an issue for me.  However, my girl friend who recommended it does. She said it speeds up the drying process also. This is the SINGLE BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;ve ever used. EVER!  BUY IT NOW and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I spray it on wet hair before brushing and it works as a detangler so well! I have very long, thick hair and it also saves me quite a bit of time blow drying. It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;ve only used this product once...last night after getting out of the shower. I sprayed it on and immediately got nervous because it seemed a little slimy in my hair (I have thin, brittle hair that gets oily after 12 hours, unless I put dry shampoo in it) so I was thinking that I had been dooped and I&#x27;d have to wash my hair again....to my surprise I blow dried my hair (in 5 minutes-it usually takes 10) and there were no tangles. The true test was here...I usually have to run a straightener over the lumps in my hair before bedtime or it takes me forever to straighten in the morning to get all of the creases and lumps out of it, I didn&#x27;t last night. This morning I got up and it was a mess, like I&#x27;d anticipated! I ran the straightening iron over it and it straightened right out! This cut down my prep time by at least 50%...which is much welcomed early in the morning! Smells pleasant too! Try it!</li>
            <li> Its Kenra.  Need i say more?  this product does help dry my hair faster, not lightening speed mind you but its definately faster. I have medium texture hair.   It feels super silky in my hair too.  I also like the fact that it is a heat protector,  my hair doesnt seem as dry as it did before i starting using.  I use it everyday.  If there is a bigger size than the 3.4oz I will buy it next time.  Get it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> Kenra blow dry spray really cuts the blow dry time in half. I have long natural textured hair and blow drying can take at least an hour. with Kenra blow dry spray my dry time is now about 20 min. 10 min if i get my friend to do it for me. it also smells really nice. However it does leave a oil like residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! My hair dresser uses this on me. It smells so good and I use it to get my hair to dry quicker. My hair is super thick, so the spray really helps the speed of drying!</li>
            <li> Really does help me dry my hair faster and my hair tends to hold moisture and usually takes a long time to blow dry; I would say it cuts the time in half.  Also helps the condition of my hair with using a straightener a lot.  My hair feels very soft when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this product, not really sure what it would do.  But I guess it is a &amp;#34;fast drying&amp;#34; solution when blow drying your hair.  I can tell you, I have very think long hair and it takes forever to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe how fast this product helped dry my hair with the blow dryer...amazing.  I would buy this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too...Vanilla!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use their Silkening Gloss, which I have used before and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I love the Kenra line, I want to try their shampoo &amp; conditioner for Color Treated Hair next!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a beauty salon and let me say that im obsessed with this product is magical it cuts your blow dry time in half , smells amazing and still protects your hair from the heat damage. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> i love this product@ seller is wonder aswell</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick. Cut my drying time by approx 40% love the fact I won&#x27;t have the heat on it longer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best spray on blow dry conditioners, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It smoothes your hair without any heavy oil or residue and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and definitely cuts down on blow dry time. Love Kenra products!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST smelling hair product I have ever used... Kind of a beachy sweet smell. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Makes it so soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years. I have very fine hair, and heat serums just weigh it down and make it feel oily. This spray doesn&#x27;t do that, it smells great, and it has the added bonus of seriously shortening my blow-dry time! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with fine hair that wants to protect it from heat. I was advised by the person I purchased my first bottle from to only do 3 squirts- one on each side and one on the back. This is very important! If you over use the product, it will definitely leave a residue. With my 3 squirts and a comb, I&#x27;m a happy girl!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!  Cuts hair drying time by more than half!  Always make sure I have on hand.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and helps my hair dry quicker</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have fine, dry hair, which is especially hard to handle. I&#x27;m forever looking for products that will moisturize it without weighing it down. Unfortunately, this product is just too oily for my hair, and made it feel greasy and look stringy. I only used it a few times, in vary amounts, but I couldn&#x27;t make it work. A total waste :(</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who blow dries or flat irons their hair. It&#x27;s the perfect product for keeping it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I followed directions on bottle  (which I don&#x27;t normally do because I have an attitude problem)-- but I did and I love this stuff.  The scent is great and the outcome is wonderful.  Use it with heat spray and big fat round brush--  straightens and tames my crazy hair.  I love this!!!</li>
            <li> multiple purchases - great product</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly - only complaint is that one was slightly leaking when received.</li>
            <li> Perfect stuff really does live up to its claims and you just need a few pumps. My hair is thick and down past my shoulders. Maybe 10 min blow dry...cut the time in almost 1/2.</li>
            <li> I just baught this and used it for the first time. It is the absolute best heat protectant I have ever used and I have tried a lot of them! This not only protects your hair from heat, but it also dtangles better than any detangler I have ever baught. It smells fantastic, and makes your hair realllly soft and silky. It does cut your hair drying time in half, I normaly take about 20min to dry my hair and with this stuff it only took about 10min! I couldnt be happier:)</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer for my hair.  It visibly smooths out the hair cuticle but without flattening or weighing down the hair.  I either flat iron or curl my hair every day and either way this product improves the look my of hair.  Even though my hair is smoother the curls hold just as well.  I have also found that I have to use less hairspray because I am not trying to tame as many fly aways or unruly pieces.  Because it is a spray its easy to get evenly distributed throughout the back of my long hair.  I do notice that it cuts down on the drying time a little, but not dramatically (only reason I gave it 4 stars). Use as directed and you will love it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but a lot of people were âswearing by itâ and considering blowdrying my hair is rather time consuming, I figured I would try it. While it does not cut blowdry time in half, it definitely shaves a few minutes off somehow, and leaves hair very soft and shiny. It smells very strong, but I like it as it reminds me of the beach. Worth a try? Yes. Worth the price though to continue buying...? That is still up for debate.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Kenra.  Takes a small amount to give your hair the needed spray to prevent static when drying hair and  makes hair ready for curling or flat iron when done.  Easy and convenient to order from Amazon.  Will tell others about this.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair and it was wonderful, but I assumed it was the whole &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t make my hair look as good as a pro can,&amp;#34; thing. The next day I washed and dried and poof. So I went in and bought some, tried it the next day, and it&#x27;s the spray that really makes such a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick (as in I have a lot of hair), but it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s prone to being very oily pretty quickly, so I&#x27;m hesitant to use anything other than shampoo. But this does not make my hair greasy like I was afraid. I&#x27;m a very low maintenance girl, and I rarely finish off a product before it gets old. I just ran out of this product and need a new bottle now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is wonderful. All around awesome product, and I&#x27;m thinking of buying more of their hair products now.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my stylist and bought it at the salon a few times before coming to Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper. (half price in fact) This light-weight spray helps my processed hair dry quickly and keeps it silky. I also LOVE the way it smells! I will order more of this when I run out because I can&#x27;t imagine my morning routine without it!</li>
            <li> Helps protect hair from heat of blow dryer.  Continually changing hair color/highlights, so I need all the help I can get</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells wonderful and works great in helping me dry my hair in half the time! also wonderful at untangling hair!. Also use before my flat iron or curling wand.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works just like it says.  My hair is shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works like a charm. This is a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Hope they never stop making this!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Prepare for your hair to dry 500000x faster than normal. Smells amazing. Bought more because I love it.</li>
            <li> The best product, it dries your hair fast and leaves it smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li> This product Works great! Cuts blow dry time in half and also Leaves your hair with a silky shine too.... this time around bought the big bottle and the spray nozzle does not work. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. Really protects hair from hot hair dryers, curlers, flat irons, etc. Also smells divine.</li>
            <li> Smells good and really does cut blowdry time in half! I use it on my daughters thick natural hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff does anything other than make my hair smell so good.  I am okay with that.  It just smells so dang good.</li>
            <li> I have hair to my butt and it cuts down on blow-drying time, not to mention the wonderful smell. I use&amp;#34; It&#x27;s A 10 first&amp;#34;, (which smells great too) then a couple of pumps of this and I dry my hair. Silky and shiny hair every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my hair dresser used this when I got my hair done.  It smells wonderful. I also have very thick hair and it does cut down on my drying time.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed would buy again</li>
            <li> Bless you, Kenra!!! This spray has transformed my fine, dry hair! I use three sprays (one spray at a time into my hands and  run through each side and the back) so I don&#x27;t find it to be too much. I&#x27;ve fInally found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;!!! :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product and it was recommended by my hairdresser. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. But in all honesty, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be cutting down drying time that much.</li>
            <li> This product smells delightful!  It seems to control frizz (and I have a lot!).  I will definitely continue to use!</li>
            <li> Love this spray. It really does cut down on blow drying time and does not weigh down my hair or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really does help my hair dry faster and it smells great. It also lasts a really long time. I started using it when my hairdresser used it on my hair and loved how my hair felt. Been using it ever since!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Cuts my dry time to under 5 minutes. Norm dry time is st least a full ten minutes. Awesome.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this product because she found it at a salon and loved it.  We got the product very quickly and it was exactly what I ordered. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This spray works very well.  It is a little oily.  I know some like that in a blow-dry spray.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really does cut drying time significantly. I bought the smaller size to see if it worked. Now that I know it does, I&#x27;ll be ordering the larger size when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the spray nozzle is defective.  I have to improvise significantly when applying it.  I guess I could have returned the item, but didn&#x27;t want to bother with the hassle.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the obvious...It is Kenra therefore it smells GREAT! However this stuff seems to lose the smell once dry but that&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray one spray into my hand and the distribute throughout my hair when it is towel dried.  I have longer hair but this is plenty for me. I also hair oily hair and know that too much would just cause it to need to be washed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that it helps cut down on drying time and that is why I only gave it 4 stars. I just have not seen a huge cut back in time but perhaps my one spray is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing is that I swear it reduces the damage and dryness from blow drying. It also causes my hair to be so shiny and soft whether I am going to flat iron or simple blow dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I will buy it over and over again</li>
            <li> cool product. the hair dresser turned me on to this. makes my hair soft and smells good. i don&#x27;t know that it actually dries my hair any faster but i like it anyway.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this product would be great for people with thick, coarse hair.  However, I have fine, slightly wavy hair, but a LOT of it, and it takes a long time to dry. I bought this product based on the good reviews, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work for me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- It did not shorten my drying time significantly.&lt;br /&gt;- It did make my hair softer and smoother, but by the end of the day, it was fairly limp.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is EXTREMELY strong.  It has a very strong, sweet, candy/bubble-gum odor, that doesn&#x27;t dissipate much throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because humidity will make my hair get extremely frizzy and large, I do plan to try it again when the weather gets hot and humid, to see if that helps tame my hair.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with fine hair or people who are sensitive to strong smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  We had a warm, humid day recently, so I was excited to try this product, to see if it kept my hair smooth and frizz-free.  Unfortunately, my hair acted exactly the same as it would have without the product - frizzy and unruly. I had such high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, I do not recommend this product.  Also, I cannot return it in good faith - I&#x27;ve used too much of it at this point.  If anyone wants my leftovers, let me know!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.. my hairstylist uses this and i had to buy some.. your hair smells soooo good after a shower! Its AMAZING! I don&#x27;t think it really shortens blow drying time, but it is a great detangler/heat protector none-the-less</li>
            <li> great product. leaves hair silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li> It does cut my blow drying time significantly. Its not sticky and does not leave a residue feeling. Kenra has wonderful products that leaves your hair feeling healthy, bouncy, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this item. Recommend to anyone who has problems with their hair being real fuzzy.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve had so much trouble finding a heat protectant that wasn&#x27;t greasy or made my hair feel disgusting. This product makes my hair so soft, without making it feel greasy, and it protects it. TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser gave me an almost empty bottle to try.  It leaves your hair feeling smooth and soft.  It also works well using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would protect my hair since I blow dry and straighten it every day.  My hairdresser recommended this and I like it.  I think that it has worked to make my hair healthier.  Of course it was cheaper on Amazon than I could get in the salon.  I have tried a variety of products that say they protect the hair and this is the only one that I have come across that actually works.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair, so I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, but I have a lot. I color my hair and was looking for something that would work to protect it from heat, and this is it. Better than nexus heat protexx, and easier than any serum (which weighed me down)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three spritzes and my hair is dry in half the time. My hair is soft and healthy. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to use as much conditioner, and this stuff detangles like a dream. My hair has body and bounce. I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need the flat iron nearly as much to smooth it out. ( I also use the goody quick dry half round brush which makes my blowout amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the giant bottle, and three months later, still have more than half left.... Don&#x27;t need a lot, especially if you towel dry well before blowing it dry. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been useing the kenra blow-dry spray for a while I really love this product it works great and smells better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, I really believe if you use it you will love it, everytime I use it and I&#x27;m in line anywhere I get asked what Purfume I&#x27;m wearing and it&#x27;s not purfume it&#x27;s my hair and they look so funny when I tell them that but then they smell my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling, fast working product if you want your hair to dry fast. It&#x27;s smaller then I wanted it to be, but I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome. A little goes a long way and this will last me quite a while... it smells great and really tames my hair with the blow dryer. I still see a lot of split ends, etc so I&#x27;m not yet sure how well it actually protects my hair but it really looks nice when I use it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I don&#x27;t notice a decrease in the drying time.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly/wavy hair that weights down easily with most products leaving my hair flat. With this product and the Kenra Platinum Finishing Spray 26, it is all I need for great hair. Bye bye hair gels and mousse. It does make my hair straighter so I don&#x27;t use on curly days. With these 2 products my hair hold great and is perfect all day.</li>
            <li> Good for blow dry ....for thick hair</li>
            <li> This blow dry spray helps keep my hair healthy. It is light weight (no build up), helps the hair dry faster and smells good.</li>
            <li> I would buy and recommend again and to every one that needs one!&lt;br /&gt;Made of good material and quality and designed to work!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It really protects your hair. IÂ´ve been using it for about a year and it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!! It smells great and really makes your hair silky smooth and soft, without flyaways. A little does go a long way though- I have a lot of fine, blond hair that goes to my bra line and I only use 4 sprays. This stuff is worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I switched from the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum to this and haven&#x27;t looked back. I love Kenra products, so I thought I would give this a try. It definitely cuts down on the blow drying time and I think it also helps detangle. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I used this at my salon and brought home the travel bottle. I was pleasantly surprised to find a bigger bottle here. Smells good works great.</li>
            <li> great product.  smells great.  leaves hair feeling smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, smells better than any other I have tried ( my husband notices every time i spray it) and my hair dries really fast.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this for a while before I went ahead and bought some and all I can say is - WHY DID I WAIT? It is seriously magical. I used a timer the last time I dried my hair. After sitting with a towel on my head for 5ish minutes, I sprayed 4-5 pumps of Kenra on my hair, brushed it through and got to blow drying. Less than 3 minutes later, my past-shoulders, incredibly thick/course hair was dry. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have no idea what this stuff is made of and I sort of don&#x27;t want to know, because it is magical. I am not in love with the scent, it is a little perfumey for my tastes but I actually have been complimented on the scent of my hair so it&#x27;s probably just me.</li>
            <li> I am a bargain hunter and mostly use drug store products.  I haven&#x27;t found many things in salons that I can&#x27;t find something just as good at the drug store for less.... but this is my splurge.  I love it.  It makes a huge difference when I blow dry.  It does dry faster, straighter, softer, shinier.  It also smells wonderful.  I came to find it on amazon because I ran out between salon visits.  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I adore, simply adore this product!!! The smell alone, to die!!! I mean, it just smells SO good!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this product bc my hair lady used it on me, and it didn&#x27;t take long at all for her to dry it, my hair was not as full, frizzy or poofy like it normally is after blow drying, and it was super silky! I will add that after using it, if using enough, it makes my hair soooo soft!! And manageable! I seriously love this product. I wish it were less expensive, but it&#x27;s so worth it to me. I have long hair, and with a 2 yr old boy at home, every single minute I have to myself is precious. I need to be able to dry my hair quickly and to not have to use a million other products to make it manageable and pretty. This one along with John Frieda Luxurious Volume Mousse (I WILL not use another mousse!!!) make my hair at its best.&lt;br /&gt;I honesty don&#x27;t even need to curl or straighten my hair if I use enough of this which is just crazy for my unruly, THICK and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thick and stick straight. It&#x27;s super long right now, at least a couple inches past my shoulders. I tried a sample of this stuff, and now I&#x27;m hooked. I spray it all through my damp hair when I get out of the shower, comb it through and it literally cuts my blow dry time in half. I was so surprised how fast my hair dried the first time I used this product. It has a great smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day. I used to dread drying my hair because it took so long and left it feeling dry and not clean. This leaves my hair soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t use a straightener so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product to leave you with a great blow dry, I would definitely try this.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it protects the hair and gives it that shine.  Love it</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few Kenra products that I love.  It has a great smell, it does a great job of protecting your hair.  It is a little pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice! Helps to dry your hair faster.</li>
            <li> It really does work quite well and I have a lot of hair.  I do think it is a tad bit overpriced though.</li>
            <li> I got a travel size of the Kenra Blow-Dry Spray as a free sample from a store, and was excited to try it! I was definitely skeptical, but I used it yesterday and was so impressed. I have very long hair, and it usually takes me 15-20 minutes to dry my hair. Yesterday I was done in just under 10 minutes, and couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised. I thought it made my hair extra soft too. I have to be ready to leave for work every day by 6:30am, and so anything that can let me stay in bed a few minutes longer is worth it! I will definitely be buying a full-size of this product and using it regularly.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers mentioned, this product does smell good and it&#x27;s helpful if I use a little bit - but I have super fine hair and it tends to make it feel a bit heavy a tad greasy(ish) after a day.  I still use it but I guess I&#x27;m always hoping for something much more amazing to happen to my fine, thin damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any big difference with frizz or dry time. But it does smell really good. So I guess it could be worth it to some. I do have pretty thin hair, maybe someone with thicker hair would notice a bigger difference.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice &amp; it&#x27;s a good thing to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry &amp; need to blow dry fast -- but it&#x27;s drying. Said it adds moisture but my hairdresser told me to quit using it. I had to have several deep heat therapies after using this for a few wks. Won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product!! Cuts blowdrying in half and makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I was using that famous oil ( starts with a M - won&#x27;t name names) that was $20+ for a small bottle. This is great! I spray before I blow dry- use a different flat iron spray when I flat iron- then last step I will spray just 2-3 sprays in my hair of this when I am done. it smells great and you DON&#x27;T need alot. I have short hair to about my sholders and 3-4 sprays before blow drying and maybe 1-2 to finish up.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair feeling weighted down and lifeless. Creates a greasy feeling on my hair as well. I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, I purchased on a friends recommendation, and she has completely different hair than I do.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. I use this product after working out and when I can&#x27;t go back to work with wet hair.  It cuts my blow dry time in half. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I used this product and my hair became a little more shiner than before.However, the perfume it is too strong for my taste. Fast shipping though. 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have lots of shoulder-length, baby fine hair that tends to run on the oily side. My stylist used this product on me and I immediately noticed a difference! My hair was dried faster, easier to style, softer, smoother, shinier, etc! I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out so this product will help keep the heat damage to a minimum which is so great! I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this; so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I use this as a substitute for Oribe&#x27;s blow out spray because I&#x27;m on a budget.  Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Use it on my hair before I dry it and even after to give it very soft and silky finish. It&#x27;s works great as protector to flat ironing/curling too. LOVE the smell!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well thus far. I have used it 5 times while blow drying and my hair seems straighter then when I blowdry without the spray. It never took more than 10 minutes to dry my hair completely and with the spray it probably takes roughly 7 minutes to dry my hair now. (I have pretty thick, red hair that goes to just above the middle of my back).</li>
            <li> Sells amazing! Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair (like I donated it to locks for love once and I gave 3 ponytails worth). Normally I am too lazy to blow dry my hair because it takes like 45 minutes and I just get so hot. This stuff definitely cut the drying time down significantly. I haven&#x27;t timed myself, so I&#x27;m not sure how much time it saves but its definitely noticeable. It kinda smells like strong cheap pre-teen perfume but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair its only when you first spray it. I read some reviews before I bought it and some mentioned a greasy residue, I haven&#x27;t experienced that yet but I&#x27;ve also only used it a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely something worth trying if you have to rush in the morning or if you have thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair the last time I was there, and I knew I had to get some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and really gets my hair super straight and it keeps my blow-out for a few days!! I have long, thick hair that&#x27;s naturally curly and this stuff really works to get my hair super straight. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. I have kinky and thick AA hair and it usually takes forever to dry and this spray really cuts down my blow dry time. Not a lot of product is needed and it smells really great. I will say that since it is silicon based I sometimes have to wipe my hands on a towel as I am styling because my hands get slick, so be mindful of that. I will definitely repurchase this product when I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff really leaves my hair sooooo soft, as long as I use the blow dryer... all the way.  Some mornings I&#x27;m running late. This does not have the same effect if you do not blow dry it.  Thats what it is for, though.</li>
            <li> The best for flat ironing wavy or frizzy hair. Creates a sleek, soft appearance and the scent is fantastic. Not an alcohol smell like most blow dry sprays.</li>
