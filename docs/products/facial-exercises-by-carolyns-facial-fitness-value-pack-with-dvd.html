            <li>Excellent.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the DVD at all.</li>
            <li>I ended up with baggy, puffy undereyes and my undereyes were perfect before.</li>
            <li>Carolyn&#x27;s program is comprehensive and excellent!  </li>
            <li>It is a marvelous way to maintain a youthful appearance.</li>

            <li>but you have to kind of figure these out for yourself as to what seems to work best.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Her skin products are amazing, too!</li>
            <li>Interesting and great response!</li>
            <li>Yeah, good luck even getting a grip on your cheek by pulling on the inside of the mouth...</li>
            <li>I found Carolyn to be very supportive, if you have any questions.    </li>
            <li>I am very pleased that the cording I had on my neck went away; but in stead, I found my neckline got saggy.</li>
            <li>And I can promise that if you don&#x27;t start using it, I&#x27;ll always look better then YOU!</li>
            <li>It is like a meditation, as it centers me for the rest of the day...and makes me look better too!</li>
            <li>Once you do get it right-you will notice awesome results, but make certain you realize it will take time to achieve your goals.</li>
            <li>&gt; I have since seen results with my own exercise creations and some otheres</li>
            <li>another program while creating my own and see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not explained that well per exercise, so you will need to figure that out on your own.  </li>
            <li>I honestly think that just the cards at a lower cost(or</li>
            <li>I honestly think that just the cards at a lower cost(or</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a nice looking lady, but she looks her age, so</li>
            <li>Looking at my face in the mirror feels nice, not horrifying like before.</li>
            <li>Easy exercises with amazing results.</li>
            <li>They are primarily organic; and they defoliate, clean, moisten and nourish the skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write more if I see ANY changes.</li>
            <li>I look better than my friends who have had facelifts, botox, fillers etc.  </li>
            <li>Carolyn is a wonderful person who will help you as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Carolyn&#x27;s facial exercises are the best!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many competitor&#x27;s kits.  </li>
            <li>Better than cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li>I love her products.  </li>
            <li>I will have to hear it many times to get all the information.</li>
            <li>This Facial Fitness Program is excellent.  </li>
            <li>perhaps a hardcover book), would be the most beneficial.</li>
            <li>I have adapted many of the exercises and have not given up yet however - use caution with this product.  </li>
            <li>He thinks my exercises are funny, but he likes the results!!!</li>
            <li>I had purchased Carol Maggio&#x27;s DVD years earlier and absolutely loved it, so thought I would give her competitor a fair try.  </li>
            <li>These days, people frequently tell me that I&#x27;m so lucky, I have &#x27;good skin&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>2)  Carolyns voice on the CD is easy on the ears, even after all these years.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that she went to fast with her explanations, but just keep doing them, and you will see the most amazing results!</li>
            <li>I will give it more time, but I don&#x27;t expect anything tremendous or even noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to see some great results so I could recommend it to my patients before they try more drastic and invasive procedures, but so far (2 months into it), I have seen no improvements at all.</li>
            <li>You will see, as I have, fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>Hi,  I´ve been doing these fantastic exercises for about 1 year now.</li>
            <li>She is absolutely fantastic when returning emails should you need to contact her.</li>
            <li>hope these exercises are very useful for all who use them and wish you success!</li>
            <li>was excited  for this product while staying based in reality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what Carolyn is by profession, but she is not a doctor or scientist and it&#x27;s evident by some of these wacky &amp;#34;exercises.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I would say that if you haven&#x27;t done facial exercises before, or you are under 45, this is probably a good system for you to start with.</li>
            <li>perhaps a hardcover book), would be the most beneficial.made; it doesn&#x27;t help much, either does the online info.</li>
            <li>Still working on those, but making tremendous progress.  </li>
            <li>And lastly but most important: 5) I won&#x27;t ever have to go under the knife!  </li>
            <li>When people tell me how &#x27;lucky&#x27; I am, I always confess that I do face exercises.  </li>
            <li>I would LOVE to see more exercises that are for rounding and filling out the check and facial area.</li>
            <li>but again, its flat and smooth, but the wrinkle lines are still there, kind of like a scar.</li>
            <li>The exercises are easy to do, not to much time consuming, and I when you finish them, you also have massaged your all face.  </li>
            <li>Apart from that, I love the exercises, and I can say quite truthfully, that after a few months my face has filled and smoothed out.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overnight, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>My husband sometimes makes me smile so he can pinch my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>(just poking fun.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this set when I noticed that my smile lines were beginning to creep over towards crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited for her, because although she has a very good chin-line, the rest of her face could use more aliveness, and fullness; those artificial fillers just don&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li>Although the learning curve takes some time; once you have it, it makes sense and feels right.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely not go there any more!   </li>
            <li>These look as if a class of 12 years olds made them in craft class.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 DVDs advertised?&lt;br /&gt;The first one she races through the exercises.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a cheap and non professional look to it.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  I now look in the mirror and say, \\&quot;Thanks, Carolyn!  </li>
            <li>pretty much GONE!  </li>
            <li>It only would have taken another 30 seconds for most of the exercises.</li>
            <li>You don´t see immediate results, but if you are consistent, resultsa will progressly appear.  </li>
            <li>the actual DVD - getting me acquainted with the exercises to come.  </li>
            <li>Carolyn demonstrates the exercise, tells you how many times to do it, and then goes on the the next exercise.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I did notice that within the first two weeks, the crows feet exercise made my wrinkles flatten out</li>
            <li>I had been having &#x27;sculptra&#x27; or &#x27;radiesse&#x27;, which I liked, to begin with, but seemed very much to depend on the skill of the injector, who got it right sometimes, and other times my face ended up lop sided!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 2 other facial exercise series, but Carolyn&#x27;s are the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Make certain you understand and do the exercises EXACTLY as she demonstrates.  </li>
            <li>I´m 51, and becoming younger every day.</li>
            <li>Carolyn&#x27;s system is easy to learn, takes only 15 minutes a day and rescued me from looking way older then my age!</li>
            <li>I could have bypassed the empty CD if the others were worthwhile or if she seemed to put any quality into the paper book and cards at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I really thought this would work.</li>
            <li>Carolyn is like a close friend who really cares about your progress and questions.</li>
            <li>Very prompt response.</li>
            <li>But, it will take learning and understanding how the muscles work and build to really understand the exercises.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it works.</li>
            <li>Seven years ago, as I was turning 50, I was fit, but my face was starting to droop and wrinkle a lot.</li>
            <li>It really is.  </li>
            <li>She is so devotional to her  product and what she does and really presents it very well.  </li>
            <li>These  exercises really work</li>
            <li>I really get it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what all the rage is about.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know that I&#x27;d follow her system if I didn&#x27;t buy it already.</li>
            <li>so honestly, it was a waste of time and money</li>
            <li>Carolyn&#x27;s facial fitness DVD goes through each exercise extremely quick; at first I thought it was just a preview</li>
            <li>However, I am committed to continuing for at least 1 more month to give it a full 3 month trial.</li>
            <li>I have been doing facial exercises as well as total body exercises for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this program.   </li>
            <li>One Customer Service member of staff informed me that a particular facial exercise principal  got far too many emails to answer any individual questions!</li>
            <li>The literature was very informative and professionally done.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, God, for leading me to this woman&#x27;s exercise program!\\&quot;   I am 47 years old, and I used to smoke.  </li>
            <li>These exercises may work, but I haven&#x27;t been able to tolerate the dvd long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li>My smile lines are bigger and</li>
            <li>If you are serious about facial exercise and are willing to stick with it, then, this is a great Facial Fitness program.</li>
            <li>After telling her that yes, indeed, I do it for 15 minutes, 3-5 times a week, she finally became interested in using the CFF program I bought her years ago.  </li>
            <li>I look younger now, than when I first started doing the exercises.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other facial exercise programmes, the main compliment I would like to pay is that if you email Carolyn she not only replies to you (which none of the others did, ever), but also how quickly she does it, despite the amount of email she must get a day, and she thoughtfully works out exercises and programmes for you on any area which you might consider to be a weak point in your own face.   </li>
            <li>However, after going through the entire DVD, Carolyn did not complete each exercise in its entirety with the user; you are left on your own to get all the repetitions in (or else re-run the DVD several times in order to get the needed repetitions).  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that will clear up with the neck exercises.</li>
            <li>purchased the complete kit with the flashcards, mirror and after a year did not see any change while doing these faithfully .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>you really want to try this, just buy the basic CD or check her out on YouTube</li>
            <li>My husband took a baseline picture and each month after and so far, no change at all.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I just think that the DVD should have professionally made.</li>
            <li>Once in a while I&#x27;ll buy some high-end product that my sisters recommend, but so far I always prefer the quality and price of CFF products.</li>
            <li>far l haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li>Also, God bless her, but I don&#x27;t really think Carolyn looks that much younger than her 65 years, or however hold she is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with the results, even though I had to stop using the program following a thyroidectomy with a few complications.</li>
            <li>if not more, do them AGAIN in front of the mirror, to make sure you are doing them properly!</li>
            <li>if not more, do them AGAIN in front of the mirror, to make sure you are doing them properly!</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to get results and you have to really stick with it and want to do it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I found that it started to give me more wrinkles next to my smile lines and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>However, now that I am back to my feeling normal</li>
            <li>This regime is only 15 minutes or so, but she gives you a few advanced exercises for problem areas, to add if you like.  </li>
            <li>Why couldn&#x27;t she just do them with you so that you could make it through the whole dvd, instead of constant stopping and starting?  </li>
            <li>I think this was a mistake, because my face went backwards so much, it seems to have taken quite a long time to get back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of time 3 - 5 days a week doing something simple like this to have that youthful, natural look.</li>
            <li>they suggest that you do them laying down after the first week.</li>
            <li>they suggest that you do them laying down after the first week.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest that you spend at least 3-4 weeks doing the exercises in front of a MIRROR, so that you are doing them properly, even tho</li>

            <li> I will absolutely not go there any more!   </li>
            <li> These look as if a class of 12 years olds made them in craft class.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 DVDs advertised?&lt;br /&gt;The first one she races through the exercises.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a cheap and non professional look to it.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  I now look in the mirror and say, \\&quot;Thanks, Carolyn!  </li>
            <li> pretty much GONE!  </li>
            <li> It only would have taken another 30 seconds for most of the exercises.</li>
            <li> You don´t see immediate results, but if you are consistent, resultsa will progressly appear.  </li>
            <li> the actual DVD - getting me acquainted with the exercises to come.  </li>
            <li> Carolyn demonstrates the exercise, tells you how many times to do it, and then goes on the the next exercise.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I did notice that within the first two weeks, the crows feet exercise made my wrinkles flatten out</li>
            <li> I had been having &#x27;sculptra&#x27; or &#x27;radiesse&#x27;, which I liked, to begin with, but seemed very much to depend on the skill of the injector, who got it right sometimes, and other times my face ended up lop sided!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 other facial exercise series, but Carolyn&#x27;s are the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Make certain you understand and do the exercises EXACTLY as she demonstrates.  </li>
            <li> I´m 51, and becoming younger every day.</li>
            <li> Carolyn&#x27;s system is easy to learn, takes only 15 minutes a day and rescued me from looking way older then my age!</li>
            <li> I could have bypassed the empty CD if the others were worthwhile or if she seemed to put any quality into the paper book and cards at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I really thought this would work.</li>
            <li> Carolyn is like a close friend who really cares about your progress and questions.</li>
            <li> Very prompt response.</li>
            <li> But, it will take learning and understanding how the muscles work and build to really understand the exercises.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it works.</li>
            <li> Seven years ago, as I was turning 50, I was fit, but my face was starting to droop and wrinkle a lot.</li>
            <li> It really is.  </li>
            <li> She is so devotional to her  product and what she does and really presents it very well.  </li>
            <li> These  exercises really work</li>
            <li> I really get it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what all the rage is about.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know that I&#x27;d follow her system if I didn&#x27;t buy it already.</li>
            <li> so honestly, it was a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Carolyn&#x27;s facial fitness DVD goes through each exercise extremely quick; at first I thought it was just a preview</li>
            <li> However, I am committed to continuing for at least 1 more month to give it a full 3 month trial.</li>
            <li> I have been doing facial exercises as well as total body exercises for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this program.   </li>
            <li> One Customer Service member of staff informed me that a particular facial exercise principal  got far too many emails to answer any individual questions!</li>
            <li> The literature was very informative and professionally done.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, God, for leading me to this woman&#x27;s exercise program!\\&quot;   I am 47 years old, and I used to smoke.  </li>
            <li> These exercises may work, but I haven&#x27;t been able to tolerate the dvd long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li> My smile lines are bigger and</li>
            <li> If you are serious about facial exercise and are willing to stick with it, then, this is a great Facial Fitness program.</li>
            <li> After telling her that yes, indeed, I do it for 15 minutes, 3-5 times a week, she finally became interested in using the CFF program I bought her years ago.  </li>
            <li> I look younger now, than when I first started doing the exercises.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other facial exercise programmes, the main compliment I would like to pay is that if you email Carolyn she not only replies to you (which none of the others did, ever), but also how quickly she does it, despite the amount of email she must get a day, and she thoughtfully works out exercises and programmes for you on any area which you might consider to be a weak point in your own face.   </li>
            <li> However, after going through the entire DVD, Carolyn did not complete each exercise in its entirety with the user; you are left on your own to get all the repetitions in (or else re-run the DVD several times in order to get the needed repetitions).  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that will clear up with the neck exercises.</li>
            <li> purchased the complete kit with the flashcards, mirror and after a year did not see any change while doing these faithfully .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> you really want to try this, just buy the basic CD or check her out on YouTube</li>
            <li> My husband took a baseline picture and each month after and so far, no change at all.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I just think that the DVD should have professionally made.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I&#x27;ll buy some high-end product that my sisters recommend, but so far I always prefer the quality and price of CFF products.</li>
            <li> far l haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li> Also, God bless her, but I don&#x27;t really think Carolyn looks that much younger than her 65 years, or however hold she is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with the results, even though I had to stop using the program following a thyroidectomy with a few complications.</li>
            <li> if not more, do them AGAIN in front of the mirror, to make sure you are doing them properly!</li>
            <li> if not more, do them AGAIN in front of the mirror, to make sure you are doing them properly!</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get results and you have to really stick with it and want to do it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found that it started to give me more wrinkles next to my smile lines and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, now that I am back to my feeling normal</li>
            <li> This regime is only 15 minutes or so, but she gives you a few advanced exercises for problem areas, to add if you like.  </li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t she just do them with you so that you could make it through the whole dvd, instead of constant stopping and starting?  </li>
            <li> I think this was a mistake, because my face went backwards so much, it seems to have taken quite a long time to get back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of time 3 - 5 days a week doing something simple like this to have that youthful, natural look.</li>
            <li> they suggest that you do them laying down after the first week.</li>
            <li> they suggest that you do them laying down after the first week.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest that you spend at least 3-4 weeks doing the exercises in front of a MIRROR, so that you are doing them properly, even tho</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest that you spend at least 3-4 weeks doing the exercises in front of a MIRROR, so that you are doing them properly, even tho</li>
            <li> While I like the program, it seems that it takes a long time to get substantial facial differences, even by looking at the on line pics and the time it took the women.</li>
            <li> But she speaks too quickly ( for foreign people, at least).</li>
            <li> It becomes old hat after a few times of practicing.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison between the way the two women demonstrate their facial exercises.  </li>
            <li> I did go back to some of my original/former exercises, because I couldn&#x27;t stand the saggy and hollow look my face had taken on and didn&#x27;t feel the exercises would/were adressing those areas.</li>
            <li> Not only that, some of these exercises are completely ridiculous and I highly doubt they are effective--for instance, the &amp;#34;jowl smoother&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> One of my two sisters, who have had face-lifts, botox, etc.,  looked at me with a critical eye the other day and said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I had been using another facial exercise system for a number of years and just felt I had reached a plateau.(spelling?).I started this system and per carolyn&#x27;s suggestion completly stopped the other system.</li>
            <li> However, if you, like myself, had been doing other programs for facial fitness, you might want to incorporate this program with what you are doing now.</li>
            <li> and you will have to be extremely patient, as the program seems to be somthing that can take about a year to see alot of results, while seeing smaller results sooner.</li>
            <li> Carol Maggio&#x27;s DVD walks you through each and every exercise and does every single repetition with you.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I would have expected some quality.</li>
            <li> I promise, after a few weeks, you will notice enough difference to KEEP GOING.  </li>
            <li> I look wide awake, and my cheeks are lifted.</li>
            <li> I do agree, the DVD is poorly made; it doesn&#x27;t help much, either does the online info.</li>
            <li> I found that my face was hollow, raggedy looking and saggy by stopping the other system to start this one.</li>
            <li> There are long spaces on The DVD where you are supposed to be doing your exercises and then every few minutes she will say the name of the exercise&lt;br /&gt;Crow</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see improvement in any other part of my face after 1.5 years,</li>
            <li> I can not recommend it for the average consumer.</li>
            <li> I understand the concept of facial exercise--it&#x27;s common sense that exercising will improve tone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;AN empty CD save for her saying the name of the exercise every few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then the pacing CD is used to lie down and do the exercises as you learned them on the DVD.  </li>
            <li> they think they would make me look 20 again in a few</li>
            <li> pull  no sound....</li>
            <li> She just gives a few counts and tell you to continue the excercise out, up to 40, depending on the excercise.</li>
            <li> I have not made time to do it everyday like recommended.  </li>
            <li> I do also suggest, that even after you know them and do them laying down that at least every two weeks</li>

            <li> /&gt;The book is cheaply made plastic spiral with the worst illustrations ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just an unbelievable program!  </li>

            <li> No one tells me I look tired anymore.  </li>
            <li> Truly disappointed in this product; don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it.</li>
            <li> she says, you may be bored listening to me talking</li>
            <li> I find it very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It is also very EXPENSIVE</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been doing facial exercises as well as total body exercises for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited  for this product while staying based in reality.&lt;br /&gt;I spoke with Carolyn several times  as well&lt;br /&gt;I wished for some toning and am excellent at waiting and working at exercises for some time. I did no they think they would make me look 20 again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the complete kit with the flashcards, mirror and after a year did not see any change while doing these faithfully .&lt;br /&gt; I have since seen results with my own exercise creations and some otheres I ahve noted below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is cheaply made plastic spiral with the worst illustrations ever.&lt;br /&gt;The flash cards are no better. For the price, I would have expected some quality. These look as if a class of 12 years olds made them in craft class.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 DVDs advertised?&lt;br /&gt;The first one she races through the exercises.&lt;br /&gt;The second one she counts them out so you get a sense of timing and cadence:&lt;br /&gt;Crow&#x27;s feet 12345&lt;br /&gt;22345 etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third one is blank. There are long spaces on The DVD where you are supposed to be doing your exercises and then every few minutes she will say the name of the exercise&lt;br /&gt;Crow&#x27;s feet  no sound-nothing&lt;br /&gt;Browline pull  no sound....nothing etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AN empty CD save for her saying the name of the exercise every few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;She calls in the final CD.&lt;br /&gt;This bit of rip off turned me off entirely&lt;br /&gt;As she says, you may be bored listening to me talking and you know the exercise and the counts so why bother to count them on the cd?&lt;br /&gt;Really? Wow&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to try this, just buy the basic CD or check her out on YouTube&lt;br /&gt;Most of her exercises are silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just my opinions. I could have bypassed the empty CD if the others were worthwhile or if she seemed to put any quality into the paper book and cards at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the exercises are silly and just ineffective, especially pulling the inside of your cheeks. If this product works, where are all the proud before and after pictures?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began another program while creating my own and see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out [...]&lt;br /&gt;Check out Tom Hagerty system [...]&lt;br /&gt;Check out Jack Lalane as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these exercises are very useful for all who use them and wish you success!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to see some great results so I could recommend it to my patients before they try more drastic and invasive procedures, but so far (2 months into it), I have seen no improvements at all. My husband took a baseline picture and each month after and so far, no change at all. Wow. I really thought this would work. However, I am committed to continuing for at least 1 more month to give it a full 3 month trial. I&#x27;ll write more if I see ANY changes.</li>
            <li> Carolyn is like a close friend who really cares about your progress and questions. Very prompt response. Easy exercises with amazing results.</li>
            <li> You will see, as I have, fantastic results.  But, it will take learning and understanding how the muscles work and build to really understand the exercises.  It&#x27;s not explained that well per exercise, so you will need to figure that out on your own.  Make certain you understand and do the exercises EXACTLY as she demonstrates.  Once you do get it right-you will notice awesome results, but make certain you realize it will take time to achieve your goals. It&#x27;s not overnight, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I look better than my friends who have had facelifts, botox, fillers etc.  Just an unbelievable program!  Excellent.  Carolyn is a wonderful person who will help you as much as possible.</li>
            <li> The literature was very informative and professionally done.  I just think that the DVD should have professionally made. It has a cheap and non professional look to it.  Also , Carolyn should consider completing out each excercise to follow through with.  She just gives a few counts and tell you to continue the excercise out, up to 40, depending on the excercise. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the DVD at all.</li>
            <li> I regret ever trying this product. Please don&#x27;t try it unless you have nothing to lose. I ended up with baggy, puffy undereyes and my undereyes were perfect before. Carolyn advised me to keep doing all the exercises and things would improve, but they never did. I didn&#x27;t see improvement in any other part of my face after 1.5 years, so honestly, it was a waste of time and money and I ended up looking worse than before.</li>
            <li> I find it boring, I think for what you pay the production should have been better. I do the excersices but I don&#x27;t see results yet. I really hope it works.</li>
            <li> Carolyn&#x27;s facial exercises are the best!  I have tried many competitor&#x27;s kits.  Some don&#x27;t offer any resistance-if you&#x27;ve ever been into bodybuilding, you will know that this is a must-and some are SO longgggg!  This regime is only 15 minutes or so, but she gives you a few advanced exercises for problem areas, to add if you like.  The DVD is to teach you the exercises.  You learn what they are called, and how to perform each move.  It becomes old hat after a few times of practicing.  Then the pacing CD is used to lie down and do the exercises as you learned them on the DVD.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.  I promise, after a few weeks, you will notice enough difference to KEEP GOING.  I&#x27;ve been at it for almost 10 months.  My face is so different, I don&#x27;t even remember what it felt like to look in the mirror and say, \\&quot;Oh, my gosh, I am looking so old!\\&quot;  I now look in the mirror and say, \\&quot;Thanks, Carolyn!  Thanks, God, for leading me to this woman&#x27;s exercise program!\\&quot;   I am 47 years old, and I used to smoke.  The lines on my lips?  GONE!  The gross lines under my eyes?  GONE!  The gathering of nasty looking folds under my neck?  almost GONE!  Still working on those, but making tremendous progress.  My naso labial folds?  pretty much GONE!  No one tells me I look tired anymore.  And I got told that almost every day!!!!  I look wide awake, and my cheeks are lifted. My husband sometimes makes me smile so he can pinch my cheeks.  He thinks my exercises are funny, but he likes the results!!! I will never quit using this program.  Never.  And I can promise that if you don&#x27;t start using it, I&#x27;ll always look better then YOU! (just poking fun.  Do yourself a favor, try this product!)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I could see a difference after three weeks, and it only takes 15 minutes to do. Better than cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> I think it will probably help.  I have not made time to do it everyday like recommended.  It does not work in one of my computers. the dvd is not compatable with the dvd reader. I have played numersous dvd&#x27;s on the same computer and never had that problem before.  I agree with others that I wish she would do the entire excercise. I find myself pausing the dvd with my hands on my face and then having to resume.  Very  awkward. It only would have taken another 30 seconds for most of the exercises.</li>
            <li> Seven years ago, as I was turning 50, I was fit, but my face was starting to droop and wrinkle a lot. After trying various face exercise programs, I found Carolyn&#x27;s Facial Fitness. Hallelujah! I&#x27;m 57 now, and I look quite a bit younger than I did when I started the program. Looking at my face in the mirror feels nice, not horrifying like before. These days, people frequently tell me that I&#x27;m so lucky, I have &#x27;good skin&#x27;!  One of my two sisters, who have had face-lifts, botox, etc.,  looked at me with a critical eye the other day and said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re face looks good!  Are you still doing those face exercises?\\&quot; After telling her that yes, indeed, I do it for 15 minutes, 3-5 times a week, she finally became interested in using the CFF program I bought her years ago.  I&#x27;m excited for her, because although she has a very good chin-line, the rest of her face could use more aliveness, and fullness; those artificial fillers just don&#x27;t do it.  I&#x27;ve heard that the CFF program works wonders after face-lifts too!  What I prefer about this program to the others is: 1) Although the learning curve takes some time; once you have it, it makes sense and feels right. 2)  Carolyns voice on the CD is easy on the ears, even after all these years.  3) I love her products.  They are primarily organic; and they defoliate, clean, moisten and nourish the skin very effectively. Once in a while I&#x27;ll buy some high-end product that my sisters recommend, but so far I always prefer the quality and price of CFF products. And lastly but most important: 5) I won&#x27;t ever have to go under the knife!  When people tell me how &#x27;lucky&#x27; I am, I always confess that I do face exercises.  I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of time 3 - 5 days a week doing something simple like this to have that youthful, natural look.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very good. I haven&#x27;t practice yet. But she speaks too quickly ( for foreign people, at least). I will have to hear it many times to get all the information.</li>
            <li> This Facial Fitness Program is excellent.  The deep wrinkles around my mouth flattened out and at times seem to disappear.  The shape of my face has changed - it is no longer drooping, but has firmed up. I look younger now, than when I first started doing the exercises.  Carolyn&#x27;s system is easy to learn, takes only 15 minutes a day and rescued me from looking way older then my age! I usually do the exercises in the morning - I call it my face yoga! It is like a meditation, as it centers me for the rest of the day...and makes me look better too! I highly recommend this program.   I found Carolyn to be very supportive, if you have any questions.    S.Schenker-Skye</li>
            <li> Hi,  I´ve been doing these fantastic exercises for about 1 year now. I´m 51, and becoming younger every day.The exercises are easy to do, not to much time consuming, and I when you finish them, you also have massaged your all face.  You don´t see immediate results, but if you are consistent, resultsa will progressly appear.  Thanksa Carolyn, I no longer fear ageing.</li>
            <li> My face has shown alot of improvement since I started doing these exercises.</li>
            <li> Carolyn&#x27;s program is comprehensive and excellent!  It is a marvelous way to maintain a youthful appearance. She is absolutely fantastic when returning emails should you need to contact her. Buy with confidence. Her skin products are amazing, too!</li>
            <li> This is a must buy.  It really is.  She is so devotional to her  product and what she does and really presents it very well.  These  exercises really work and she sends updates by email at no extra   cost.</li>
            <li> I have tried other facial exercise programmes, the main compliment I would like to pay is that if you email Carolyn she not only replies to you (which none of the others did, ever), but also how quickly she does it, despite the amount of email she must get a day, and she thoughtfully works out exercises and programmes for you on any area which you might consider to be a weak point in your own face.   Carolyn answers questions and makes suggestions.  Apart from that, I love the exercises, and I can say quite truthfully, that after a few months my face has filled and smoothed out.   I had been having &#x27;sculptra&#x27; or &#x27;radiesse&#x27;, which I liked, to begin with, but seemed very much to depend on the skill of the injector, who got it right sometimes, and other times my face ended up lop sided!  It is also very EXPENSIVE ++.  I will absolutely not go there any more!   One Customer Service member of staff informed me that a particular facial exercise principal  got far too many emails to answer any individual questions!</li>
            <li> seem to be working...easy to do...but do it!</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;So far l haven&#x27;t seen any results&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing exercises now for 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I will continue with it and hopefully see some results soon&lt;br /&gt;Ann</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.  I had purchased Carol Maggio&#x27;s DVD years earlier and absolutely loved it, so thought I would give her competitor a fair try.  There is absolutely no comparison between the way the two women demonstrate their facial exercises.  Carolyn&#x27;s facial fitness DVD goes through each exercise extremely quick; at first I thought it was just a preview the actual DVD - getting me acquainted with the exercises to come.  However, after going through the entire DVD, Carolyn did not complete each exercise in its entirety with the user; you are left on your own to get all the repetitions in (or else re-run the DVD several times in order to get the needed repetitions).  Carol Maggio&#x27;s DVD walks you through each and every exercise and does every single repetition with you.  Truly disappointed in this product; don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother to review my purchases, but I wanted to confirm what I read in another review.  These exercises may work, but I haven&#x27;t been able to tolerate the dvd long enough to find out.  Carolyn demonstrates the exercise, tells you how many times to do it, and then goes on the the next exercise.  This requires stopping the dvd between each exercise in order to perform the rest of the exercises!  Why couldn&#x27;t she just do them with you so that you could make it through the whole dvd, instead of constant stopping and starting?  I find it very frustrating.  Hopefully I will get to the point where I know how to do the exercises, and I can quit using the dvd all together.</li>
            <li> I had been using another facial exercise system for a number of years and just felt I had reached a plateau.(spelling?).I started this system and per carolyn&#x27;s suggestion completly stopped the other system. I think this was a mistake, because my face went backwards so much, it seems to have taken quite a long time to get back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. I found that my face was hollow, raggedy looking and saggy by stopping the other system to start this one. That being said, I did notice that within the first two weeks, the crows feet exercise made my wrinkles flatten out - they did not go away, mind you - but they are smoother now. another two weeks after that, the deep \\&quot;11\\&quot; wrinkle between my eyes flattened out. but again, its flat and smooth, but the wrinkle lines are still there, kind of like a scar. I did go back to some of my original/former exercises, because I couldn&#x27;t stand the saggy and hollow look my face had taken on and didn&#x27;t feel the exercises would/were adressing those areas. While I like the program, it seems that it takes a long time to get substantial facial differences, even by looking at the on line pics and the time it took the women. I am very pleased that the cording I had on my neck went away; but in stead, I found my neckline got saggy. I am hoping that will clear up with the neck exercises. I would LOVE to see more exercises that are for rounding and filling out the check and facial area. It seesm a majority of them focus on the jowl line, which I don&#x27;t have a problem with. so I would say that if you haven&#x27;t done facial exercises before, or you are under 45, this is probably a good system for you to start with. However, if you, like myself, had been doing other programs for facial fitness, you might want to incorporate this program with what you are doing now. and you will have to be extremely patient, as the program seems to be somthing that can take about a year to see alot of results, while seeing smaller results sooner. I do agree, the DVD is poorly made; it doesn&#x27;t help much, either does the online info. I would strongly suggest that you spend at least 3-4 weeks doing the exercises in front of a MIRROR, so that you are doing them properly, even tho they suggest that you do them laying down after the first week. I do also suggest, that even after you know them and do them laying down that at least every two weeks if not more, do them AGAIN in front of the mirror, to make sure you are doing them properly! The cards and the booklet are helpful; but then again, there are differences between the two even for the same exercises, which do not match what is done/said on the DVD! but you have to kind of figure these out for yourself as to what seems to work best. I honestly think that just the cards at a lower cost(or perhaps a hardcover book), would be the most beneficial.made; it doesn&#x27;t help much, either does the online info.

            <li> Have been doing face exercises for about 10 days. My face feels firmer and tingly when I am done . Would recommend</li>
            <li> Interesting and great response!</li>
            <li> I am a yoga teacher and looked forward to trying this DVD.  Unfortunately I found that it started to give me more wrinkles next to my smile lines and around my eyes.  My smile lines are bigger and deeper then when I started and after almost a year, are not going away as the marketing suggests.  I have adapted many of the exercises and have not given up yet however - use caution with this product.  I can not recommend it for the average consumer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I really get it. If you are serious about facial exercise and are willing to stick with it, then, this is a great Facial Fitness program. It takes a long time to get results and you have to really stick with it and want to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 other facial exercise series, but Carolyn&#x27;s are the best by far.  At first I thought that she went to fast with her explanations, but just keep doing them, and you will see the most amazing results!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set when I noticed that my smile lines were beginning to creep over towards crow&#x27;s feet. Learning to do the exercises correctly took a bit of time so to speed up the process I made myself a chart for each one. I simply drew a circle and added eyes, nose and mouth and then wrote in arrows that showed the directions my fingers should travel. I also wrote the number of times and the number of sets. I slipped these into page protectors and voila I had my reference sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleased with the results, even though I had to stop using the program following a thyroidectomy with a few complications. However, now that I am back to my feeling normal I plan to re-incorporate these exercise into my daily fitness routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what all the rage is about.  I understand the concept of facial exercise--it&#x27;s common sense that exercising will improve tone.  I bought CFF and have been doing it for about a month now, and have taken photos before/after.  I notice no difference at all.  I will give it more time, but I don&#x27;t expect anything tremendous or even noticeable.  Also, God bless her, but I don&#x27;t really think Carolyn looks that much younger than her 65 years, or however hold she is.  She&#x27;s a nice looking lady, but she looks her age, so I don&#x27;t really know that I&#x27;d follow her system if I didn&#x27;t buy it already. Not only that, some of these exercises are completely ridiculous and I highly doubt they are effective--for instance, the &amp;#34;jowl smoother&amp;#34; where you stick you fingers in your mouth and pull at your cheek? Yeah, good luck even getting a grip on your cheek by pulling on the inside of the mouth...I don&#x27;t know what Carolyn is by profession, but she is not a doctor or scientist and it&#x27;s evident by some of these wacky &amp;#34;exercises.&amp;#34;</li>
