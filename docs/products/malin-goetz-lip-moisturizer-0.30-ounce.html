            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>One for each purse :)</li>
            <li>I love this lip moisturizer but some reason the seller will not send to Australia.</li>
            <li>I cannot remember but I fell in love with the feeling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have purchased so many of these products over the years.</li>
            <li>It is more a lip treatment.</li>
            <li>I put this on every night and my lips have never, ever been better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this lip moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Works very well... much better that anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li>Best Lip Moisturizer for me, only down side is the glowing shine lip is a bit too much for a male.&lt;br /&gt;Overall still a good buy.</li>
            <li>It cures chapped lips quickly.  </li>
            <li>its about 12.00 and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I originally got a sample on an airplane and now can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>No weird tastes.</li>
            <li>At first it gives you the feeling of cotton mouth.</li>
            <li>I got this product in Delta travel bag, i was amazed, the lip moisturizer really works!</li>
            <li>and i really travel a lot and tried many many lip balms but such effect i never had with other brands.</li>
            <li>Also, although I can&#x27;t be certain, the tube looks a bit flattened as if the product had already been used.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really a daytime, keep in your purse moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel very moist.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed some dead skin buildup since I began using--you know the stuff that you need to scrub off in a warm shower.</li>
            <li>Completely different than anything I have ever used and by far better.</li>
            <li>Looks like women&#x27;s lip gloss, if you&#x27;re okay with that (like vaseline on the lips), but it repairs chapped dry lips swiftly and like no other.</li>
            <li>My husband first got it on an international Delta flight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic-- the moisturizing effects last long after the gloss is gone.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I buy at least 3 tubes at a time!  </li>
            <li>I wear it every night and wake up to soft lips.</li>
            <li>This tube has lasted almost a whole year, with daily usage.</li>
            <li>It had a sticker label pasted on it, marked as .35 Oz.  </li>
            <li>Kind of obsessed with this lip balm… goes on smoothly and instantly heals my dry lips.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, lasts a long while and works extremely well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, yes, but really worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lip product that doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, it actually moisturizes!</li>
            <li> long lasting.</li>
            <li> If you have dry peeling lips, exfoliate them one or twice a week with a homemade brew of olive oil, sugar and a tooth brush and use this emollient lubricant gold once a day and your lips will be as kissable as a baby&#x27;s.....cheek</li>
            <li> My lips get very dry in the Colorado weather and this product takes care of this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about this on a FB group as a terrific product for taking care of your lips during those harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s extremely shiny/sticky (almost like lip gloss for women)</li>
            <li> All other  moisturizers break my lips out.</li>
            <li> I put this on, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!....</li>
            <li> I get my lips extremely chap every winter.</li>
            <li> It is slightly tacky feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough paying $12.00 for a small qty of lip balm, but to only get about 1/2 of the advertised amount is an outrage.</li>
            <li> but she considers that a small price to pay for the benefits.</li>
            <li> Very poor.</li>

            <li> Good stuff...long lasting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe my obsession with this product.  I originally got a sample on an airplane and now can&#x27;t live without it.  I buy it in multiples of 2-4 at a time out of fear that I may run out.</li>
            <li> Received this as part of a gift bag, it is by far the best lip moisturizer ever.  Apply with finger.  Not sticky. No weird tastes. Heals wind burn. Actually moisturizes and heals chapped lips. The best product I have ever used at 30+ I feel like I have tried everything. I will buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> Kind of obsessed with this lip balm… goes on smoothly and instantly heals my dry lips.  Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Just amazing!!! Best stuff on the planet!</li>
            <li> I am a medical esthetician and I only use malin and goetz in my treatment rooms.  This is also the only lip balm i use on my lips as well.  I love it so much I buy at least 3 tubes at a time!  One for each purse :)</li>
            <li> Hope I never have to use another lip treatment.</li>
            <li> Expensive  but lovely feel and shine</li>
            <li> I love this lip moisturizer but some reason the seller will not send to Australia. I had to have it posted to my son who then posted it on to me. Very poor.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product with two cons. It is very moisturizing, lasts a long while and works extremely well BUT it&#x27;s extremely shiny/sticky (almost like lip gloss for women) and I have noticed some dead skin buildup since I began using--you know the stuff that you need to scrub off in a warm shower. I&#x27;d say this is a good product for anyone who likes shiny lips.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lip balm! I had a same come from either Birchbox or Ipsy - I cannot remember but I fell in love with the feeling. You can always count on Amazon for items as I bought two tubes from here!!</li>
            <li> Looks like women&#x27;s lip gloss, if you&#x27;re okay with that (like vaseline on the lips), but it repairs chapped dry lips swiftly and like no other. I will use this when alone and never touch chapstick or Burt&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip moisturizer!  It&#x27;s the only lip product that doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, it actually moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I got this lip moisturizer from Delta when we went to Europe.  It&#x27;s fantastic-- the moisturizing effects last long after the gloss is gone.  I wear it every night and wake up to soft lips. Wear it over lip stain or lipstick.  It cures chapped lips quickly.  It&#x27;s expensive, yes, but really worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever used.i hope they never stop selling it. I absolutely love this stuff. All other  moisturizers break my lips out. I love it. It&#x27;s goes on smooth and makes my lips feel so good. It instantly heal cracked, peeling, irritated lips. Buy it please!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> Best Lip Moisturizer for me, only down side is the glowing shine lip is a bit too much for a male.&lt;br /&gt;Overall still a good buy.</li>
            <li> My wife got a sample, in an airline goodie bag. She liked because it moisturizer and healed her chapped lips. She especially likes it because it stays on and she does not eat it off. It is slightly tacky feeling but she considers that a small price to pay for the benefits. I think it has helped her lips and I notice the waxiness only during osculation.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip moisturizer I have found and I have purchased so many of these products over the years. My lips get very dry in the Colorado weather and this product takes care of this problem. Use in the morning and before bedtime. It isn&#x27;t really a daytime, keep in your purse moisturizer. It is more a lip treatment.</li>
            <li> The product I received is 0.20oz, not 0.35oz as stated in the description.  Also, although I can&#x27;t be certain, the tube looks a bit flattened as if the product had already been used. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It makes your lips feel very moist.  I would recommend this product to a friend.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about this on a FB group as a terrific product for taking care of your lips during those harsh winter months. Oh My Gosh! its about 12.00 and worth every penny. In the winter my upper lip peels until it bleeds. I put this on, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!.... I put this on every night and my lips have never, ever been better. This tube has lasted almost a whole year, with daily usage. If you have dry peeling lips, exfoliate them one or twice a week with a homemade brew of olive oil, sugar and a tooth brush and use this emollient lubricant gold once a day and your lips will be as kissable as a baby&#x27;s.....cheek</li>
            <li> At first it gives you the feeling of cotton mouth. You get used to it after a while.</li>
            <li> I get my lips extremely chap every winter. This product is helping a lot.</li>
            <li> Completely different than anything I have ever used and by far better.</li>
            <li> Works very well... much better that anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this lip moisturizer.  My husband first got it on an international Delta flight.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this great moisturizer</li>
            <li> Product was advertised as containing .35 Oz.  However, the actual tube of product only contained .20oz. It had a sticker label pasted on it, marked as .35 Oz.  It&#x27;s bad enough paying $12.00 for a small qty of lip balm, but to only get about 1/2 of the advertised amount is an outrage. I don&#x27;t know how this is not fraud.</li>
            <li> I got this product in Delta travel bag, i was amazed, the lip moisturizer really works! and i really travel a lot and tried many many lip balms but such effect i never had with other brands. I sincerely recommend this product!.</li>
