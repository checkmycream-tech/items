            <li>I enjoy doing business with Amazon.</li>

            <li>I was very pleased and surprised.</li>

            <li>When I wear it , it feels good on my skin and never pills up like so many other products .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to get rid of any wrinkles (I don&#x27;t have many except around my mouth), but I&#x27;m happy with at least a smooth, dewy, hydrated look.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>He said \\&quot;you do not look the age of ALL your friends\\&quot; and speaks to me how much my skin looks so youthful  : )</li>
            <li>I love and highly recommend Anew products, because the eye and face cream produce results.</li>
            <li>I have used both the Day and Night creams in the Platinum line, and believe they are well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a quick deliver to seller.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>PLATINUM REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li>YOUR NECK FOR REAL!  </li>
            <li>I AM  STILL USING MY FIRST JAR OF THIS STUFF,   </li>
            <li>This does and looks exactly what my $50 one does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting any younger, so it may take more than this to keep things in check</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It just became to much to spend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see too much difference in my skin</li>
            <li>THANKS TO AVON FOR THE PLATINUM LINE  </li>
            <li>AND HOW FAST IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I am using the whole platinum line and am very please.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this cream has really helped to minimize the wrinkles in my face.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very protective of my skin and value the SPF 25 of this product.</li>
            <li>This product really works at protecting my face from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Nice for daytime, not too heavy,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older lady who is always trying new wrinkle creams.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in past and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good daytime cream to add to their daily regimen.</li>
            <li>Anew Platinum Day Cream SPF 25 instantly lifts my face to decrease laugh lines, reduce the size of my pores, and erase forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I need to remember to save all the packaging until after I have smelled new products.</li>
            <li>I even bought the eye cream which I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where the sun shines every day, and I have elderly skin and a history of skin cancer . . .</li>
            <li>I have found that this is as good as if not better in the long run.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face under my foundation all day long, never feels greasy or dry .</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old</li>
            <li>This cream smelled old.</li>
            <li>Much less expensive than many department store face creams, and of course, better pricing through Amazon than buying directly from Avon.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference when comparing other products, which did not produce the same noticeable results.</li>
            <li>and my skin stays soft all day long even as we have a home in the Mohave dessert.</li>
            <li>I apply a light layer of powdered mineral base SPF 20 over that, and the two combined give me good invisible protection that looks glamourous and natural, not at all thick, greasy, or &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> I love avon anew its the best moisturizer I have ever used,so rich and creamy and my skin stays soft all day long even as we have a home in the Mohave dessert. My face never gets burnt with the sun as it has SPF 25.just love it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast! The ceam was too thick for me and the smell is bad! I didn&#x27;t see too much difference in my skin (I&#x27;m 63) but the price on Amazon is great! I won&#x27;t order again though.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find avon procuts that are so reasonable, love the product and will certaintly order again.The service was fast and items arrived in good shape,</li>
            <li> I do not care for the product.  I do not like the scent and will not use Avon Anew Platinum Day Cream SPF 25 or buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  THE PRICES AT AMAZON ARE AMAZINGLY LOW COMPARED TO DEALING  WITH A REGULAR AVON LADY AT REGULAR PRICES.  PLATINUM REALLY WORKS!  IT MELTS  AWAY WRINKLES AND FIRMS YOUR NECK FOR REAL!  TRY IT ON THE BACK OF YOUR HANDS  AND SEE THE WRINKLES VANISH THERE TOO!  THANKS TO AVON FOR THE PLATINUM LINE  AND MOST OF ALL AMAZON FOR INCREDIBLY LOWER PRICES.  COULDN&#x27;T AFFORD THIS IF  IT WASN&#x27;T OFFERED AT AMAZON.  IT ALSO DIMINISHES SPOTS EVENTUALLY. I AM  TRULY AMAZED AT THE EFFECTIVENESS AND HOW FAST IT WORKS.  THANK YOU! I AM  STILL USING MY FIRST JAR OF THIS STUFF,   THAT&#x27;S HOW FAST AND EFFECTIVE IT IS!  I&#x27;VE TRIED LOTS OF OTHER PRODUCTS BUT THIS ONE PUT THEM ALL TO SHAME.  SINCERELY,  TIGHTCURLS69</li>
            <li> this did nothing for my skin or wrinkles.  I saw no change or difference at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Another product I&#x27;ve been meaning to try for several years.  I&#x27;d rate this as one of the best compared to other higher priced creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older lady who is always trying new wrinkle creams.  I&#x27;ve even tried some expensive ones that ended up being too drying for my skin.  But this Avon Anew Platinum with SPF25 leaves my skin hydrated all day and it gives my skin a beautiful dewy look.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to get rid of any wrinkles (I don&#x27;t have many except around my mouth), but I&#x27;m happy with at least a smooth, dewy, hydrated look.  I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation anymore.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> The Anew Platinum Day Cream is a very nice product because it helps the wrinkles under and around my eyes. It makes my skin feel smooth and is not greasy and slimy. It lasts at least a couple of months for me.</li>
            <li> I love and highly recommend Anew products, because the eye and face cream produce results. Anew Platinum Day Cream SPF 25 instantly lifts my face to decrease laugh lines, reduce the size of my pores, and erase forehead wrinkles. It’s an alternative to Botox. I really noticed a difference when comparing other products, which did not produce the same noticeable results. The Day Cream is an excellent moisturizer that hydrates my skin and provides SPF protection from the sun. It makes an excellent foundation for my makeup, which gives my skin and makeup a smooth radiant appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the price of Anew products on Amazon. At first I was a little worried, because the same product and size sold for double on other Web sites.  However, the product is authentic; and I’m impressed with the fast delivery. I enjoy doing business with Amazon. I never had faster service from another company. (nlr)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it is wonderful.  My skin does look more lifted.  I am using the whole platinum line and am very please.  The prices here are better than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It was nice but interfered with my makeup. Made my face appear to be shedding. Great if not using makeup.</li>
            <li> I love Anew products. But with this product I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell. I have trouble with floral smells. In fact I had to air out my house after using it. I need to remember to save all the packaging until after I have smelled new products. In case I need to send them back. I was able to give this to my daughter, who was delighted to get it.</li>
            <li> It smells disgusting like its old or something!!!!! I have used this product for many years so I know what its suppose to smell like. I threw it away and ordered another directly from Avon and it was perfect</li>
            <li> Avon Anew Platinum Night Cream, Avon Anew Platinum Serum and Avon Anew Platinum Day Cream leaves skin burns! Dangerous products!</li>
            <li> I have used it for over 14 days and I have not seen any difference in my skin texture, so I demoted it to just a regular moisturizer. I would not  reorder when it is done.</li>
            <li> I have used this products since Avon came out with it. I am able to purchase it at AMAZON at a much better price. I am 69 years old and I can tell you that this cream has really helped to minimize the wrinkles in my face. My face feels moisturized after I apply it but it is not greasy.  Love it! and Love the Amazon cost!</li>
            <li> This cream smelled old. When something does not smell pleasant&lt;br /&gt;it is impossible for me to use it on my face!!!</li>
            <li> I have always liked this moisturizer. When I wear it , it feels good on my skin and never pills up like so many other products . I like that it has sun protection too. I feel so comfortable in it , I have often gone out with no foundation at all on but  this product . Yes, I will buy it again....</li>
            <li> I love that this has sunscreen in it.  I use it under my make up or even when I go barefaced.  Very comfortable, never greasy.  I use it on my face, neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer. I have very dry skin And like to feel moisturized after it is applied. This does and looks exactly what my $50 one does. I was very pleased and surprised. I even bought the eye cream which I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> This cream has a horrible smell to it.  A little goes a long way but the smell stays with you after you put it on!</li>
            <li> This product is a very pleasant consistancy.  Nice for daytime, not too heavy,  I&#x27;m not getting any younger, so it may take more than this to keep things in check</li>
            <li> I have used both the Day and Night creams in the Platinum line, and believe they are well worth the cost.  Much less expensive than many department store face creams, and of course, better pricing through Amazon than buying directly from Avon.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft, I really liked it. Did not make my skin greasy at all. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this crème in the mornings and as a moisturizer under my make up. I like it very much. Not greasey and absorbs immediately into my skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT ~~ GREAT PRICES ON AMAZON!! The \\&quot;Night Cream\\&quot; is even better in the Platinum..a little dab will do ya.. and it works on wrinlkes even better than the day cream!  My husband is in awe at my skin, and I will be 63 on AUG 1st! He said \\&quot;you do not look the age of ALL your friends\\&quot; and speaks to me how much my skin looks so youthful  : ) He&#x27;s only 55, so I guess I need to look younger!! LOL! ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the sun shines every day, and I have elderly skin and a history of skin cancer . . . so I&#x27;m very protective of my skin and value the SPF 25 of this product. I use it as my base layer, my moisturizer. It&#x27;s light and odorless, glides on easily and absorbs right away. I wear it every day and am happy with the way my skin looks and feels. I apply a light layer of powdered mineral base SPF 20 over that, and the two combined give me good invisible protection that looks glamourous and natural, not at all thick, greasy, or &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product really works at protecting my face from the sun.  It helps keep my skin soft and smooth.  I use it faithfully every day before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product and I plan on using it forever. I love the way it feels on my face under my foundation all day long, never feels greasy or dry .</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WORKS PERFECTLY WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL MY FAMILY AND FRINEDS. THANK YOU. VIRGINIA RESECH..KEEEP GOING GGERBER---------YOU ARE DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a quick deliver to seller. Love this day cream, also purchased the night cream. Both smell clean and I am happy with both. The night tingles which means it is doing what it should.</li>
