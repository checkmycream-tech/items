            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>He was so happy I could get it for him!  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair groom I have used</li>
            <li>The best part is that it can do all this, and is not greasy/oily at all.  </li>
            <li>He was very happy to get it.  </li>
            <li>I have happily used PROTEIN 29 Groom for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>A bit pungent, but very effective.</li>
            <li>Good product if you can find it.  </li>
            <li>it is good and on time..</li>
            <li>Good consistency and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Excellent light grooming liquid.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and shipped promptly - very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with product and the way it controls my flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job at taming fly-aways while making the hair smooth with a strong shine.  </li>
            <li>Greaseless, effective, natuaral looking.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea since it&#x27;s clearly the best &#x27;hair oil&#x27; (not oily!)</li>
            <li>This is nice to put some on your hands and just go over the top of your hair or rub into the hair if that&#x27;s the way a person likes to use it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my dad who has been using it for MANY years and now cannot find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I had used this product for 10 years or more and ran out but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>but now cannot buy it in the stores any more..  </li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine ever since I tried it many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more years than I can remember</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 40 years - its the best hair productfor men.  </li>
            <li>WHAT MORE COULD I SAY.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it arrived as soon as it did.  </li>
            <li>and you will smell so clean that you will swear that you are still standing in the shower!    </li>
            <li>then I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and switched to Vitalis which is very good.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see it available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I found it washes off the hands easily when you&#x27;re done grooming the hair.  </li>
            <li>Great men&#x27;s hair product, that is not available in stores, surprisingly.  </li>
            <li>The cherry on top for me is that it has a very pleasant, soft and clean scent that does not project far.  </li>
            <li>My hair is more silver than white, to many a nice color even if it shows my age - and</li>
            <li>tonight started to look to see if the preparation is still available.  </li>
            <li>available.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>the Protein 29 hair oil gives my hair a soft shine and a general softness that reminds me of my great hair before the my many years of living</li>
            <li>I have tried other hair products but this is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I really think more people would use it if they knew about it.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has beautiful, thick, Mexican hair that always looks great...</li>
            <li>Tried Amazon there I got lucky.</li>
            <li>thanks to Protein 29!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can finally buy it at a reasonable price (free shipping!)</li>
            <li>I like it because it is not greasy and gives the right amount of body and sheen.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Vitalis and only prefer my Lucky Tiger 3 Purposes to this one.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look nice all day long.</li>
            <li>The hair is left very manageable and holds a nice side part all day.  </li>
            <li>So I looked at the label and saw that the main ingredient was alcohol!!  </li>
            <li>Doubt very much whether I would order this product again.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase this product locally anymore</li>
            <li>It is definitely a \\&quot;tonic\\&quot; as it is the consistency of a runny liquid and is alcohol based like most hair tonics.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite hair product for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>Prior to the grey hair I liked my soft easy to manage hair - no need for an hair oil...</li>
            <li>high rating of the product is based on my experience using it on grey hair many years after the product was purchased.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it and has been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon we found it again.</li>
            <li>It has not been available in stores for several years, used to drive around trying to find it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>The gel version is similar in consistency and performance to Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li>I am lucky because there is one local drug store chain in my area that still stocks it.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if years on the shelf makes the product different than some fresh from the manufacturer, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li>It goes in light and does not weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li>Well I put a few drops on my skin and watched it almost immediately evaporated leaving a cool sensation, as if it was made of pure alcohol.  </li>
            <li>little dab will do the fine job of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found some existing stock on line and purchased enough to last several years.</li>
            <li>They also stock the gel version, which I have used too, but I do not like near as well as this product.  </li>
            <li>Pair this with Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue aftershave</li>
            <li>I have used this for quite a while and am not too wild about the hair sprays but use them occasionally if it&#x27;s windy out.  </li>
            <li>Now very hard to find in stores, but readily available on-line.  </li>

            <li> Now very hard to find in stores, but readily available on-line.  </li>
            <li> I received this product unsealed first thing, with a piece of tape securing the cover in place, very odd!  </li>
            <li> I have had a small bottle of Protein 29 hair oil by Stephan for many years, I&#x27;ll guess at least 20.  </li>
            <li> It was about 1/3 gone when I decided I need something to improve the management of my now almost fully grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I find it does \\&quot;wonders\\&quot; for my grey hair.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT THAT LONG MUST PROVE SOMETHING.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for my husband for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this it allows him to style his hair without leaving it greasy and combs those few hairs that stick out in back occasionally.</li>
            <li> Package was wet and greasy.  </li>
            <li> It did the job, not available  in our local stores</li>
            <li> I much prefer massaging a thin liquid into my scalp and hair instead of a heavier cream or pomade.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money, if you don&#x27;t like unsealed products with lots of alcohol for your hair, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> The lid was loose on one bottle and one half of the product was gone.</li>
            <li> Protein 29 can be had for about $2.00 less than the price shown ($5.85) on other sites.</li>
            <li> Outdated and so old it lost the scent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is hard to find in stores, and the offers on Amazon all seem to be on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> This is the only type hair dressing Ill use because it is not and will not leave a greasey residue on anything, plus it keeps my hair in place.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store anymore.  </li>
            <li> Not a good hold on hair.</li>
            <li> They are very slow in responding to inquiries, so I cancelled after waiting for three weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this is difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I hate what I call Greasy Kid Stuff.  </li>

            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.  We can&#x27;t even find it in stores anymore, so he has me order it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived in two days as advertised!!</li>
            <li> Outdated and so old it lost the scent.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  I mix this 50/50 with water in a spray bottle.  Holds hair well, without being too sticky.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my dad who has been using it for MANY years and now cannot find it in the stores.  He was so happy I could get it for him!  It was packaged well and shipped promptly - very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had a small bottle of Protein 29 hair oil by Stephan for many years, I&#x27;ll guess at least 20.  It was about 1/3 gone when I decided I need something to improve the management of my now almost fully grey hair.  As any person old enough to have grey hair knows, grey hair isn&#x27;t just a change in color, it is a change in the hair itself.  Prior to the grey hair I liked my soft easy to manage hair - no need for an hair oil...so the Protein 29 just sat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am using it again I find it does \\&quot;wonders\\&quot; for my grey hair.  My hair is more silver than white, to many a nice color even if it shows my age - and the Protein 29 hair oil gives my hair a soft shine and a general softness that reminds me of my great hair before the my many years of living took it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tonight started to look to see if the preparation is still available.  The product is listed on Amazon and the picture of the bottle looks just like the one I have.  So, I assume it is the same stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My high rating of the product is based on my experience using it on grey hair many years after the product was purchased.  I do not know if years on the shelf makes the product different than some fresh from the manufacturer, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now.  I am very satisfied with product and the way it controls my flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I have happily used PROTEIN 29 Groom for over 30 years. It is the only non oil hair control product I ever recommend to others and I was upset when I could not find it in local stores several years ago. Fortunately, I found some existing stock on line and purchased enough to last several years. I made the recent purchase when I  discovered Stephan had resumed production.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and can no longer find it in the local stores so I went online and found it.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It does not give you a glued on look and yet keeps your hair in place.  It makes your hair look nice all day long.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has beautiful, thick, Mexican hair that always looks great... thanks to Protein 29!! He&#x27;s been using it now for almost 30 years and he won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Same product I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Did not meet up to my expectations.  Doubt very much whether I would order this product again.  Not a good hold on hair.</li>
            <li> Received items promptly.  The lid was loose on one bottle and one half of the product was gone. Package was wet and greasy.  Emailed company twice and have not had a response.</li>
            <li> Good product if you can find it.  I recently ordered some from America Rx and never received it.  They are very slow in responding to inquiries, so I cancelled after waiting for three weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my brother. He absolutely loves it and has been using it for years. Can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore. Thanks to Amazon we found it again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this hair groom product for years. He says it&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;ve had no personal experience, but take his word - if he says so, it&#x27;s so.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for 10 years or more and ran out but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Tried Amazon there I got lucky. I have tried other hair products but this is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. A bit pungent, but very effective. I like it better than Vitalis and only prefer my Lucky Tiger 3 Purposes to this one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this on Amazon keeping shopping. Protein 29 can be had for about $2.00 less than the price shown ($5.85) on other sites. I love this product, but it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I do 2 mi. on the treadmill every day before breakfast and so have to wash my hair daily.  I hate what I call Greasy Kid Stuff.  I have used Protein 29 for perhaps 40 yrs. but now cannot buy it in the stores any more..  Why?  I have no idea since it&#x27;s clearly the best &#x27;hair oil&#x27; (not oily!) available.  Puts everything else in the shade.  I&#x27;m glad I can finally buy it at a reasonable price (free shipping!) through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Greaseless, effective, natuaral looking.  This has been my favorite hair product for as long as I can remember.  Now very hard to find in stores, but readily available on-line.  Buy a bottle or two, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It did the job, not available  in our local stores&lt;br /&gt;A little dab will do the fine job of grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite a while and am not too wild about the hair sprays but use them occasionally if it&#x27;s windy out.  This is nice to put some on your hands and just go over the top of your hair or rub into the hair if that&#x27;s the way a person likes to use it.  I found it washes off the hands easily when you&#x27;re done grooming the hair.  This has been a favorite of mine ever since I tried it many years ago.</li>
            <li> Great men&#x27;s hair product, that is not available in stores, surprisingly.  Jim Tavegia</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase this product locally anymore so I was pleased to see it available on Amazon.  I like it because it is not greasy and gives the right amount of body and sheen.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair groom I have used and I have used a lot of different products.  It is definitely a \\&quot;tonic\\&quot; as it is the consistency of a runny liquid and is alcohol based like most hair tonics.  I much prefer massaging a thin liquid into my scalp and hair instead of a heavier cream or pomade.  It goes in light and does not weigh down your hair.  It does a wonderful job at taming fly-aways while making the hair smooth with a strong shine.  The hair is left very manageable and holds a nice side part all day.  The best part is that it can do all this, and is not greasy/oily at all.  The cherry on top for me is that it has a very pleasant, soft and clean scent that does not project far.  Pair this with Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue aftershave and you will smell so clean that you will swear that you are still standing in the shower!    It&#x27;s a shame that this is difficult to find in stores.  I am lucky because there is one local drug store chain in my area that still stocks it.  I really think more people would use it if they knew about it.  They also stock the gel version, which I have used too, but I do not like near as well as this product.  The gel version is similar in consistency and performance to Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more years than I can remember so I knew all I needed to know before ordering. It has not been available in stores for several years, used to drive around trying to find it. Fortunately it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this it allows him to style his hair without leaving it greasy and combs those few hairs that stick out in back occasionally.</li>
            <li> it is good and on time..Adrian</li>
            <li> I received this product unsealed first thing, with a piece of tape securing the cover in place, very odd!  Well I put a few drops on my skin and watched it almost immediately evaporated leaving a cool sensation, as if it was made of pure alcohol.  So I looked at the label and saw that the main ingredient was alcohol!!  So I&#x27;ll use it on a wig, not on my hair.  Such a waste of money, if you don&#x27;t like unsealed products with lots of alcohol for your hair, don&#x27;t buy this. They need a liquor license to sell this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 40 years - its the best hair productfor men.  It manages your hair without leaving that grasy look.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find in stores, and the offers on Amazon all seem to be on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years then I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and switched to Vitalis which is very good.  But the Protein 29 put nutrients in my hair that it needs.  One of the things that causes problem with hair  is lack of protein.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING  PROTEIN FOR OVER 60 YEARS ,  WHAT MORE COULD I SAY. TO KEEP USEING  THIS PRODUCT THAT LONG MUST PROVE SOMETHING.</li>
            <li> This is the only type hair dressing Ill use because it is not and will not leave a greasey residue on anything, plus it keeps my hair in place.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it arrived as soon as it did.  I have been looking for this for my husband for a long time.  He was very happy to get it.  It is not sold in our local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store anymore.  Good consistency and fragrance.  Manly, yes.  Recommend to those using this type product.</li>
            <li> Excellent light grooming liquid. Especially after shampooing.</li>
