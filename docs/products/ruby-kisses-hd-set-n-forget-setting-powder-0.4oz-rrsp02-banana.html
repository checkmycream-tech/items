            <li>Love the product and price!</li>
            <li>This setting powder is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Good better when setting your highlight.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look young and flawless!</li>
            <li>I think I would like to try one that matches my skin tone better, I bought this because they said that it would work with any skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it was ok...</li>
            <li>and i am satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I know it may be my ignorance, and I&#x27;ll adjust after I&#x27;m able to play with it more and hopefully make it work for me.</li>
            <li>but I whish I will cover more .</li>
            <li>It let me some spots without coverage by the areas  most need it</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it under my foundation to prevent my face from becoming oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as finely milled as Ben bye.</li>
            <li>it was fine</li>
            <li>the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>The name is fitting you actually set and forget.</li>
            <li>say pretty much</li>
            <li>I really like this powder just don&#x27;t take pictures with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this powder it makes my skin looked airbrush</li>
            <li>It really does set your make up and prevent shine all day and night.</li>
            <li>However, when I take a picture with a flash while wearing it, it is extremely bright and is very hard to adjust after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, I&#x27;ll do some more research before I believe that it was money wasted.</li>
            <li>I barely use it because it seems like it&#x27;s really ashy</li>
            <li>My issue is that it&#x27;s highly reflective but not detectable to the naked eye.</li>

            <li> not much in quality, but for the price I guess that&#x27;s what you get...</li>
            <li> Although it lasts all day, it&#x27;s very rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> In other words, when I look in the mirror, I cannot see the powder, nor does my undereye area look lighter (I have dark circles and bags under my eyes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other negative reviews and don&#x27;t understand because I don&#x27;t get a white cast or drying effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned</li>
            <li> Not good at all hard to get out, and poor quality.</li>
            <li> Unless im applying it wrong.</li>

            <li> I really like this powder just don&#x27;t take pictures with it. It will give you a white cast like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> not much in quality, but for the price I guess that&#x27;s what you get...</li>
            <li> This product , I used one time, I didn&#x27;t like it. I feel that it made me look some what ashy. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. I think I would like to try one that matches my skin tone better, I bought this because they said that it would work with any skin tone. maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, I&#x27;ll do some more research before I believe that it was money wasted.</li>
            <li> Love the product and price!</li>
            <li> i am yet to use use this! reason why, i am always at work and never get the chance to create the look i want... i tried it once and it was ok... i never used ben nye so i cant compare the finishes... i bought this cuz it was cheaper and i used the ruby kisses hd creator and it was the boss! the shipping was super fast i must also note.. second time buying from this seller @createtrend and i am satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will do a follow up review...!</li>
            <li> This setting powder is amazing. The name is fitting you actually set and forget. I purchased a couple weeks ago, and have used daily with no touch up needed through out the day. I&#x27;ve read other negative reviews and don&#x27;t understand because I don&#x27;t get a white cast or drying effect. It&#x27;s just as finely milled as Ben bye. So, if your looking for an inexpensive dupe, by ruby kiss you wont regret! JM OP</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned and it&#x27;s very dry. I barely use it because it seems like it&#x27;s really ashy ok. Thanks</li>
            <li> It didnt cover up how i wanted it to.  Unless im applying it wrong. Not satisfied&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out, before investing in the more expensive Ben Nye banana powder. My issue is that it&#x27;s highly reflective but not detectable to the naked eye. In other words, when I look in the mirror, I cannot see the powder, nor does my undereye area look lighter (I have dark circles and bags under my eyes). However, when I take a picture with a flash while wearing it, it is extremely bright and is very hard to adjust after it&#x27;s applied. I gave it two stars, b/c I know it may be my ignorance, and I&#x27;ll adjust after I&#x27;m able to play with it more and hopefully make it work for me.</li>
            <li> I ran out of Ben Nye banana powder so I got this at my local beauty store. Although it lasts all day, it&#x27;s very rough on the skin. It also becomes cakey. I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it under my foundation to prevent my face from becoming oily.</li>
            <li> Excellent sitting powder</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Makes your skin look young and flawless!</li>
            <li> Great item as good as Ben Nye&#x27;s Banana powder.. Great seller wld but again..</li>
            <li> well when i applied.it ..it was fine not too white nothing..until my cousin and i took a picture it looked like i had two big wgite patches</li>
            <li> Good better when setting your highlight.</li>
            <li> I  like this but I whish I will cover more . It let me some spots without coverage by the areas  most need it</li>
            <li> Not good at all hard to get out, and poor quality.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder it makes my skin looked airbrush and it does last like all say pretty much and I sweat lol.</li>
            <li> For the cost, this powder is awesome.  It really does set your make up and prevent shine all day and night.</li>
            <li> Just as described! Works Great! I recommend!</li>
