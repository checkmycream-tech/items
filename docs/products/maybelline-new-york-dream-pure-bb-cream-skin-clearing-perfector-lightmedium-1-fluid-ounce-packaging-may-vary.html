    <ol>
            <li>Coverage is awesome.</li>
            <li>So I would say it lasts about 3 months if worn continuously, which is great considering the price!</li>

            <li>Light/Medium worked great for me.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage though I&#x27;d recommend 2 layers and using a concealer on any problem areas you may have with any skin conditions.</li>
            <li>Coverage is not the best, you have to have really good skin for it to be really good.</li>
            <li>This foundation works amazingly!</li>
            <li>My skin looks nice!</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant sent, and it does not feel oily on my skin</li>
            <li>I tend to use it for days when I am just running errands or just want to feel good around the house.</li>
            <li>If you use a good amount, the product does give you an even look.</li>
            <li>Gets a good toxicity rating by the Environmental Working Group, a must for anything going on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like Olay moisturizers, which can be nothing special to some, and wonderful to others.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still perfect for the summer months when it&#x27;s too hot out to want heavier makeup on</li>
            <li>I absolutely love BB creams!</li>
            <li>Nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice product .</li>
            <li>This prodcut went on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything.</li>
            <li>I actually first tried a sample I got in a magazine, and the light/medium color it came in fit me perfectly, which is also-freakin&#x27; amazing.</li>
            <li>Out of the three this one is my favorite is gives nice even coverage without overdoing it and looking cakey.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light coverage</li>
            <li>Great to pop on days you don&#x27;t have time for a full face or just want a light makeup day.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, this is def my favorite product for this month, and I look foward to more BB products in Maybeline&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li>Love the coverage</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Its not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love the BB foundation</li>
            <li>I follow it with a MAC mineralizing powder (LOVE)</li>
            <li>and I get a flawless but simple look for the workday.</li>
            <li>I picked this product out because it&#x27;s suppose to be safe for those with acne (it has salicylic in it).  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS bb cream.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but i love this</li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>It was okay but made me breakout</li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t have many blemishes often</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very impressed that this line carries a deeper toned version as well, considering a lot of BB Creams only come in lighter colors.</li>
            <li>You can also just build up the product if you want more coverage.</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>do love that it doesn&#x27;t go and clog up pores, and that it has blemish fighting power.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it will be ok for someone who does not use sunscreen, however i do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline is my favorite drugstore makeup brand</li>
            <li>But it never hurts to give it a try though! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair and the fair/medium shade is just right.</li>
            <li>and I must say this BB Cream is pretty good for a drugstore brought item.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soooo soft love love love it!!</li>
            <li>On me, it gives a light/medium coverage, it gives me very nice natural look which I truly like ! :)</li>
            <li>I only need a fairly light foundation coverage and this cream is perfect.</li>
            <li>The most it does is even out my skin tone lightly when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Great for young girls...</li>
            <li>I also love that it has acne fighting properties in it and the fact that it pretty much is a foundation for a great price.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Rubs off easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It has a very yellow tinge to it, which I think looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Matched my skin color perfectly, but after putting on even a light coat, my face became extremely caked up!</li>
            <li>I think that sunscreen is the best part of bb creams, specially in one that has an active in it.</li>
            <li>What makes this so great though is that I&#x27;ve actually noticed my skin clearing up!</li>
            <li>It gives me a light coverage but even when I have a blemish or two it does</li>
            <li>I had a sample of Origins BB cream w/ SPF 15  in both light and medium.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and feels light and weightless.</li>
            <li>the coverage is light.</li>
            <li>It is light and works well with my blending sponge.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, and although the coverage is quite sheer, it evens out skin tone very nicely.</li>
            <li>Its super duper moisturizing and blends easily in seconds.</li>
            <li>I finish with ELF makeup setting spray (super cheap @ Walmart) and I still have my face on at 5:00.</li>
            <li>I learned how to properly clean and condition all my brushes.</li>
            <li>The colors is great for my light, slightly pink skin tone</li>
            <li>COOL.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over standard foundation because it&#x27;s lighter but offer good coverage.</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>give you great results that will save you some money for other things like Perfume or something blingy!</li>
            <li>I used this on top of Ponds moisturizer for dry skin and my face looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t exclude the good things about drug store items that cost less</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s so yellow is what allows it to do such a great job of correcting redness.</li>
            <li>It gives light to medium coverage but looks natural.</li>
            <li>And by all means if your higher end product that works is on SALE.. go for it.</li>
            <li>Think Pretty Be Pretty.....</li>
            <li>so it was more for simple covering and tone correcting, but</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, you really should!</li>
            <li>NOW I am ready to get the older yet better me back!!</li>
            <li>I usually have a hard time with BBs because they tend to be too pink-tinted but this one has a great neutral, almost warm, tone.</li>
            <li>The maybes line dream pure BB 8-in-1 beauty balm skin clearing perfector.</li>
            <li>Be a smart shopper ladies, and go for it.</li>
            <li>Along with my skin getting more and more parched as the winter days progress, I&#x27;m getting less sleep as my sexy late night sessions with my textbooks increase.</li>
            <li>However, this little cream did the trick even after the recommended treatment I should use by my own dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest if your using it for acne you reconsider and try the one with sunscreen in it first.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>i love this,works as expected</li>
            <li>Thanks to the girls on YT</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and blends very well.</li>
            <li>and the thing is you don&#x27;t even need to use that much.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Many other powders and foundations caused me to break out (high end MAC!)</li>
            <li>and I needed something that not only provided some light coverage, but also helped clear out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have decent skin, and now</li>
            <li>It covers some of my acne scars decently too.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face too oily and I actually break out more than I do with the regular bb cream with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to fine good products that actually do the trick without feeling cakey or having people notice that you actually have make-up on.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this to people with normal skin, but it might work a charm for those with oily.</li>
            <li>You live and learn.</li>
            <li>Which is why I was looking for a new BB cream.</li>
            <li>Works Ok and is a cheap alternative to expensive BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, and not oily.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the concentration of salicylic acid is too high for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is just a little oily but pretty normal, and I am a light tan skintone (think Mexican but in the winter).</li>
            <li>A product that has helped me immensely with these problems is Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Pure BB 8-in-1 Beauty Balm Skin Clearing Perfector.</li>
            <li>Ilovejeff de that this contains salycilic acid and when I use it, my skin is almost always clear.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have acne as is, only here and there</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and acne prone.</li>
            <li>This covers but makes me look natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different BB creams (Garnier for oily skin, one from Loreal) and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After a couple months of using this somewhat frequently my skin became noticeably irritated.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin that is very acne prone.</li>
            <li>and actually it lasts pretty long throughout the day.</li>
            <li>, I had major breakouts again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different bb creams, one being Loreal Magic Skin Beautifier and the second Physicians Formula bb cream and the third Smashbox by cream.</li>
            <li>years threw out the old stuff, and open the new products I bought and never used or used only once.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing this little tube again when mine is empty. :)</li>
            <li>After applying the BB cream I applied Bare Minerals concealer and matte foundation and mineral veil....</li>
            <li>The only thing I would suggest is using a tiny bit of moisturizer before applying this because it has 2% salicylic acid to treat acne, and this could dry up certain areas.</li>
            <li>Now I am a girl who&#x27;s spent mucho dinero at places like Sephora on high end products, and what I am learning is you can achieve the look you want from your local drug store</li>
            <li>It goes on really greasy, so I had to learn to use a lot less of it</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin, it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>Though if you use just a little, it&#x27;ll give you that even look, but unless you use a lot, the  redness doesn&#x27;t really fade and the same goes for hiding those blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I highly suggest if your using it for acne you reconsider and try the one with sunscreen in it first.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> i love this,works as expected</li>
            <li> Thanks to the girls on YT</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and blends very well.</li>
            <li> and the thing is you don&#x27;t even need to use that much.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Many other powders and foundations caused me to break out (high end MAC!)</li>
            <li> and I needed something that not only provided some light coverage, but also helped clear out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have decent skin, and now</li>
            <li> It covers some of my acne scars decently too.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face too oily and I actually break out more than I do with the regular bb cream with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to fine good products that actually do the trick without feeling cakey or having people notice that you actually have make-up on.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to people with normal skin, but it might work a charm for those with oily.</li>
            <li> You live and learn.</li>
            <li> Which is why I was looking for a new BB cream.</li>
            <li> Works Ok and is a cheap alternative to expensive BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, and not oily.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the concentration of salicylic acid is too high for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is just a little oily but pretty normal, and I am a light tan skintone (think Mexican but in the winter).</li>
            <li> A product that has helped me immensely with these problems is Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Pure BB 8-in-1 Beauty Balm Skin Clearing Perfector.</li>
            <li> Ilovejeff de that this contains salycilic acid and when I use it, my skin is almost always clear.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have acne as is, only here and there</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and acne prone.</li>
            <li> This covers but makes me look natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different BB creams (Garnier for oily skin, one from Loreal) and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After a couple months of using this somewhat frequently my skin became noticeably irritated.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that is very acne prone.</li>
            <li> and actually it lasts pretty long throughout the day.</li>
            <li> , I had major breakouts again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different bb creams, one being Loreal Magic Skin Beautifier and the second Physicians Formula bb cream and the third Smashbox by cream.</li>
            <li> years threw out the old stuff, and open the new products I bought and never used or used only once.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this little tube again when mine is empty. :)</li>
            <li> After applying the BB cream I applied Bare Minerals concealer and matte foundation and mineral veil....</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is using a tiny bit of moisturizer before applying this because it has 2% salicylic acid to treat acne, and this could dry up certain areas.</li>
            <li> Now I am a girl who&#x27;s spent mucho dinero at places like Sephora on high end products, and what I am learning is you can achieve the look you want from your local drug store</li>
            <li> It goes on really greasy, so I had to learn to use a lot less of it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin, it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Though if you use just a little, it&#x27;ll give you that even look, but unless you use a lot, the  redness doesn&#x27;t really fade and the same goes for hiding those blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this was a test being that I never used a BB cream and haven&#x27;t wore make up in years due to my battle with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I had read mixed reviews on this, especially for people with dry skin like me</li>
            <li> It lasts all day for me, especially if I use a powder after applying the BB and letting it dry.</li>
            <li> i have vary dry skin an</li>
            <li> It felt dry, itch, and looked blotchy.</li>
            <li> It took away the redness, the dryness, and even healed my pimples, and helped my complexion within only a few short days</li>
            <li> I mixed the two because I am slightly tanned being that it is summer time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not full but can be built up to a medium coverage especially if you set it with a powder.</li>
            <li> but I havent had a single breakout in over a week!</li>
            <li> Usually I use high performance Foundations to cover up imperfections (freckles, redness, uneven skin tone) but this bb cream seems to do the job</li>
            <li> I definitely do recommend this product and any other BB products!!</li>
            <li> I have no skin irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lighter than I expected so</li>
            <li> and then my face gets too red or the slight blemish, and sometimes uneven tone.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a mattifier in it though other then my daughter an</li>
            <li> I also notice the cream made my face shiny due to the SPF ingredient.</li>
            <li> November in Cali isn&#x27;t as cold as other places in the U.S., but it can get pretty dry.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so hard to find foundation that&#x27;s not too yellow).</li>
            <li> just was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had very small pimples, maybe one or two on my face at a time, while using this product</li>
            <li> and I tried it out and within less than a week</li>
            <li> Though after a couple hours it feels kinda heavy on my skin for a BB Cream, but than again that just may be me and my skin.</li>
            <li> and it shocked me at first</li>
            <li> It tends to be a lil slick for my liking</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and icky when on</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> This stuff clogs my pores and makes me break out worse than I did before in my T zone.</li>
            <li> and it seemed that no matter what treatment I tried my pores/pimples and even cold sores,</li>
            <li> it works on cold sores too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, it smears, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Matched my skin color perfectly, but after putting on even a light coat, my face became extremely caked up! I do not recommend this to people with normal skin, but it might work a charm for those with oily.</li>
            <li> This is a great make up. I have very oily skin. This doesn&#x27;t make my face shine at all. My skin looks nice! Not overly mat like a mask, but not shiny. That makes no sense; my skin looks like ME! Glides on easily. Coverage is awesome. Lasts all day. I have no skin irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lighter than I expected so I will go to the next up color when I order again.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I didn&#x27;t realize it says it&#x27;s formulated to treat acne, which I don&#x27;t need and would rather have a tinted moisturizer. But that&#x27;s my mistake. It&#x27;s still perfect for the summer months when it&#x27;s too hot out to want heavier makeup on and I&#x27;ll definitely use it up. I&#x27;m fair and the fair/medium shade is just right. Also, of course, I like the price.</li>
            <li> November in Cali isn&#x27;t as cold as other places in the U.S., but it can get pretty dry. Along with my skin getting more and more parched as the winter days progress, I&#x27;m getting less sleep as my sexy late night sessions with my textbooks increase. A product that has helped me immensely with these problems is Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Pure BB 8-in-1 Beauty Balm Skin Clearing Perfector. Its super duper moisturizing and blends easily in seconds. I actually first tried a sample I got in a magazine, and the light/medium color it came in fit me perfectly, which is also-freakin&#x27; amazing. It smells like Olay moisturizers, which can be nothing special to some, and wonderful to others. All-in-all, this is def my favorite product for this month, and I look foward to more BB products in Maybeline&#x27;s line.  http://browneyes918franki.wix.com/be-you-tiful</li>
            <li> just was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage it&#x27;s not full but can be built up to a medium coverage especially if you set it with a powder. Great to pop on days you don&#x27;t have time for a full face or just want a light makeup day.</li>
            <li> This stuff clogs my pores and makes me break out worse than I did before in my T zone. It&#x27;s oily, it smears, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different bb creams, one being Loreal Magic Skin Beautifier and the second Physicians Formula bb cream and the third Smashbox by cream. Out of the three this one is my favorite is gives nice even coverage without overdoing it and looking cakey. Usually I use high performance Foundations to cover up imperfections (freckles, redness, uneven skin tone) but this bb cream seems to do the job but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a lot of coverage this probably isn&#x27;t for you. It gives light to medium coverage but looks natural. What makes this so great though is that I&#x27;ve actually noticed my skin clearing up! Granted I don&#x27;t really have acne as is, only here and there but I havent had a single breakout in over a week!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love this BB cream. It&#x27;s very soft, and not oily.</li>
            <li> Its not my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on all day. Rubs off easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love the BB foundation Bc it leaves you with a perfect look and it works on many diff skin types! When I ordered this product I knew that it was gonna do wonders on my face. There&#x27;s some products that CAN NOT beat BB. I definitely do recommend this product and any other BB products!!</li>
            <li> Nice coverage.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream for an everyday look. On me, it gives a light/medium coverage, it gives me very nice natural look which I truly like ! :)</li>
            <li> i love this,works as expected</li>
            <li> I just ran out of my BB cream that I got in my stocking for Christmas. I wore it about twice a week until the beginning of April when I started wearing it every workday. So I would say it lasts about 3 months if worn continuously, which is great considering the price! It gives me a light coverage but even when I have a blemish or two it does it&#x27;s job and covers those up. I follow it with a MAC mineralizing powder (LOVE) and I get a flawless but simple look for the workday. I finish with ELF makeup setting spray (super cheap @ Walmart) and I still have my face on at 5:00. My skin is just a little oily but pretty normal, and I am a light tan skintone (think Mexican but in the winter). Light/Medium worked great for me.</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant sent, and it does not feel oily on my skin what so ever.  I picked this product out because it&#x27;s suppose to be safe for those with acne (it has salicylic in it).  I absolutely love BB creams!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS bb cream. I will never use another product. I have sensitive skin, and acne prone. This covers but makes me look natural and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> The maybes line dream pure BB 8-in-1 beauty balm skin clearing perfector. It is a nice product . You can wear alone or under makeup . I wish it had a mattifier in it though other then my daughter an I love it</li>
            <li> I am a newbie when it comes to BB creams, I didn&#x27;t even know what BB creams were, until recently. But as I am looking to update my make up practices, I thought it would be benefital to me and my skin to use and multi-purpose cream that concels, hydrates, primes as well as fits acne! COOL. I went even further to go on YouTube and watch tons of videos on drugstore make up products, including this one. So I went into my make up bag I haven&#x27;t opened in atleast 3+ years threw out the old stuff, and open the new products I bought and never used or used only once. Thanks to the girls on YT I learned how to properly clean and condition all my brushes. I had a sample of Origins BB cream w/ SPF 15  in both light and medium. I mixed the two because I am slightly tanned being that it is summer time. I initially noticed the cream gave me color and it shocked me at first but this was a test being that I never used a BB cream and haven&#x27;t wore make up in years due to my battle with adult acne. NOW I am ready to get the older yet better me back!! I also notice the cream made my face shiny due to the SPF ingredient. After applying the BB cream I applied Bare Minerals concealer and matte foundation and mineral veil.... Its been alil I wasn&#x27;t sold upon finishing this look, but I can tell you after the make up settled in... I was digging myself! And I am BACK on the make up horse.... Now I am a girl who&#x27;s spent mucho dinero at places like Sephora on high end products, and what I am learning is you can achieve the look you want from your local drug store but you have to be open minded. And by all means if your higher end product that works is on SALE.. go for it. but don&#x27;t exclude the good things about drug store items that cost less give you great results that will save you some money for other things like Perfume or something blingy! Be a smart shopper ladies, and go for it. Think Pretty Be Pretty.....</li>
            <li> Omg best bb cream ever iv only tryed the priginal for maybilline an this but i love this i have vary dry skin an it makes my skin soooo soft love love love it!!</li>
            <li> Coverage is not the best, you have to have really good skin for it to be really good. But I still love it. It is not sticky and icky when on and actually it lasts pretty long throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different BB creams (Garnier for oily skin, one from Loreal) and this one is my favorite so far. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for those of us wih combination skin and acne well into their 20&#x27;s, but I do think it has helped manage my breakouts. I&#x27;ve only had very small pimples, maybe one or two on my face at a time, while using this product and they&#x27;ve gone away within a day or two! It lasts all day for me, especially if I use a powder after applying the BB and letting it dry. The color is great too! I usually have a hard time with BBs because they tend to be too pink-tinted but this one has a great neutral, almost warm, tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of my blemish prone skin.  Many other powders and foundations caused me to break out (high end MAC!) and I needed something that not only provided some light coverage, but also helped clear out my skin.  Ilovejeff de that this contains salycilic acid and when I use it, my skin is almost always clear.  I Was give. another brand bbcream (smashbox) and I tried it out and within less than a week, I had major breakouts again.  You live and learn. If something works, stick with it,  and this works for me. I reordered it so i don&#x27;t run out.  I prefer this over standard foundation because it&#x27;s lighter but offer good coverage.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a lil slick for my liking but I just have to set it with a setting powder. I also love that it has acne fighting properties in it and the fact that it pretty much is a foundation for a great price. I tend to use it for days when I am just running errands or just want to feel good around the house.</li>
            <li> It was okay but made me breakout so I switched back to Garnier BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream. Granted, I don&#x27;t have many blemishes often so it was more for simple covering and tone correcting, but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect with a BB cream. I&#x27;m also very impressed that this line carries a deeper toned version as well, considering a lot of BB Creams only come in lighter colors. The cream is very light coverage but I can definitely see a difference when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is one of my holy grail makeup products! It actually does wonders for my skin! I only need a fairly light foundation coverage and this cream is perfect. It goes on really smooth and feels light and weightless. It has a very yellow tinge to it, which I think looks beautiful. The fact that it&#x27;s so yellow is what allows it to do such a great job of correcting redness. You can also just build up the product if you want more coverage. The only thing I would suggest is using a tiny bit of moisturizer before applying this because it has 2% salicylic acid to treat acne, and this could dry up certain areas. But not if you use moisturizer. If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, you really should!</li>
            <li> This product was okay. I have decent skin, and now and then my face gets too red or the slight blemish, and sometimes uneven tone. This prodcut went on nicely, and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything. If you use a good amount, the product does give you an even look. Though if you use just a little, it&#x27;ll give you that even look, but unless you use a lot, the  redness doesn&#x27;t really fade and the same goes for hiding those blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love that it doesn&#x27;t go and clog up pores, and that it has blemish fighting power. It&#x27;s hard to fine good products that actually do the trick without feeling cakey or having people notice that you actually have make-up on.</li>
            <li> I had read mixed reviews on this, especially for people with dry skin like me so I was hesitant To buy it but I decided to go a head and try it out and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I have dry skin that is very acne prone. Which is why I was looking for a new BB cream. I used this on top of Ponds moisturizer for dry skin and my face looked so healthy. It is lightweight and blends very well. It covers some of my acne scars decently too. The  salicylic acid helps with my acne too. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i saw in some videos and blogs that it has spf 15 (very low but something), but i guess this is a different version. I think that sunscreen is the best part of bb creams, specially in one that has an active in it. I tought i could use it with my facial sunscreen and it didn&#x27;t matter wheter i applied it before or after the sunscreen it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It did not cause me any disconfort, i like the finish and it&#x27;s unscented. I think it will be ok for someone who does not use sunscreen, however i do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this years ago. I have extremely sensitive skin and it seemed that no matter what treatment I tried my pores/pimples and even cold sores, Yes I&#x27;ve said it, FYI it works on cold sores too. I could never find one that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin to wear I would break out constantly. However, this little cream did the trick even after the recommended treatment I should use by my own dermatologist. It didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin, it did the complete opposite. It took away the redness, the dryness, and even healed my pimples, and helped my complexion within only a few short days and the thing is you don&#x27;t even need to use that much. I will definitely be purchasing this little tube again when mine is empty. :)</li>
            <li> I love the BB cream.  It blends well with my skin color.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell but I wish it had SPF</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about the best BB for acne, and decided on this. I mean it&#x27;s alright. It goes on really greasy, so I had to learn to use a lot less of it the coverage is light. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s helped my acne. The most it does is even out my skin tone lightly when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Maybelline is my favorite drugstore makeup brand and I must say this BB Cream is pretty good for a drugstore brought item. It gives great coverage though I&#x27;d recommend 2 layers and using a concealer on any problem areas you may have with any skin conditions. I use the Loreal Crayon Concealer. It does not make me look orange or cakey and it matches my skin tone. Though after a couple hours it feels kinda heavy on my skin for a BB Cream, but than again that just may be me and my skin. But it never hurts to give it a try though! :)</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, and although the coverage is quite sheer, it evens out skin tone very nicely. The colors is great for my light, slightly pink skin tone (it&#x27;s so hard to find foundation that&#x27;s not too yellow). Gets a good toxicity rating by the Environmental Working Group, a must for anything going on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a couple months of using this somewhat frequently my skin became noticeably irritated. It felt dry, itch, and looked blotchy. I suspect that the concentration of salicylic acid is too high for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything it claims to do, at last not for me.  Gave my skin an almost chalky look. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Works Ok and is a cheap alternative to expensive BB&#x27;s. I did order a lighter color so I&#x27;ll need to repurchase a darker shade.</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but i prefer the garnier&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face too oily and I actually break out more than I do with the regular bb cream with sunscreen in it. I highly suggest if your using it for acne you reconsider and try the one with sunscreen in it first.</li>
            <li> Great for young girls...</li>
            <li> This foundation works amazingly! It is light and works well with my blending sponge. It does a lot of coverage and does not cause breakouts! I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
