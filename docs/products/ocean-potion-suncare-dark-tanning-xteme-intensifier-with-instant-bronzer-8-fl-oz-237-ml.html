            <li>I love tanning indoors and outdoors.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s saying a lot for Illinois sun :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I order every summer and will keep on ordering it :)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products out there, from $90-$5</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s a lotion therefore non-oily.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon has it</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else out there.</li>
            <li>Many people comment on how tan I am and ask if I go to the beach a lot.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was impressed with how good it actually worked on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the lack of strong perfume in this product.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well and has a mild but nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Smell is average but results are great!</li>
            <li>super cheap, you can buy it at Wal-mart, or other stores and it works great!</li>
            <li>and this is better than any of the higher end products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Ocean potion products in general are good.</li>
            <li>I have tried a great deal of other products, but am stuck on this.  </li>
            <li>and I still have great dark</li>
            <li>Nice smelling, great moisturizing, just a little hint of extra color that isn&#x27;t streaky and enhances the summer glow.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>The price is right, and I have not looked anywhere else than Amazon.</li>
            <li>so I use Designer Skin Black indoor tanning lotion now and it works SO MUCH BETTER. :)</li>
            <li>love the nice bronze color  great for when you have a base tan and need some xtra color</li>
            <li>This intensifies in the sun and/or a tanning bed but the color looks like you have been in the carribean within the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>everyone&#x27;s skin is different but for $6.00 if it doesn&#x27;t work who cares better than trying an $80 product that sux.</li>
            <li>we met Ocean Potion first time in the Carribbean on our holidays&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good alternative to more expensive tanning products.</li>
            <li>You did have to rub it in really well so that it would not streak</li>
            <li>This stuff was very watery, and sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It also left streaks down my leg that were BRIGHT ORANGE.</li>
            <li>The smell is decent, reminds me of an orange creamsicle.&lt;br /&gt;After tanning</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t reccomend this product, the bronzer rinses right off and your tan fades several hours after tanning.. if you don&#x27;t moisturize NON-STOP afterwards.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and dries quickly not leaving you feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It gave me decent color, a little orange, but it made my skin feel smooth and soft all day after I tanned.  </li>
            <li>am naturally olive skinned</li>
            <li>I do not use it on my face as I cover up and use a bronzer instead but have not had any problems as far as breakout and it does not leave you with that wanting to get in the shower feeling either.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only reason why I orderd it online was because Wal-Mart didn&#x27;t have it in yet (too early in season).</li>
            <li>I have bought this previously and it can be used in sun or tanning bed, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to get very dark anyway, and this lotion really helps.  </li>

            <li> if your head is shaved ,this product will put a natural ,dark hue to the head and used in conjunction w/ocean potion&#x27;s protective #8 tanning for UV/UA protection</li>

            <li> Recently my local drug store either stopped carrying it or removed it from the shelves due to the off-season.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I get an instant dark tan with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It has given me a deep, dark, and even tan.</li>
            <li> dry faster and feel like silk in humid weather!</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve just spent the money because this gave me a RASH all over my body and face.</li>
            <li> The lotion is dark colored, and while others find it sticky, I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It made one part of my leg tan and the other part pale.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Potions Xtreme Tanning lotion w/Bronzer for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>

            <li> I have been using Ocean Potions Xtreme Intensifier lotion w/Bronzer for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I recently started tanning and didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> I used to only use JWOWW&#x27;S black bronzer but got sick of paying the steep price.</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical because I usually buy lotions from the salon.  </li>
            <li> For those on a budget for $6.00 you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Too bad a tan can&#x27;t hide my oozing sores!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well and creates a glowing tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin streaky once I got out of the tanning booth. It made one part of my leg tan and the other part pale. It also left streaks down my leg that were BRIGHT ORANGE. D: I don&#x27;t reccomend this product, the bronzer rinses right off and your tan fades several hours after tanning.. if you don&#x27;t moisturize NON-STOP afterwards. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it so I use Designer Skin Black indoor tanning lotion now and it works SO MUCH BETTER. :)</li>
            <li> My aunt gave me this lotion when she stopped tanning and I was a little skeptical because I usually buy lotions from the salon.  The first time I used it I was impressed with how good it actually worked on my skin.  It gave me decent color, a little orange, but it made my skin feel smooth and soft all day after I tanned.  You did have to rub it in really well so that it would not streak but for the price, it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Potions Xtreme Tanning lotion w/Bronzer for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;Its super cheap, you can buy it at Wal-mart, or other stores and it works great! Even better then a lot of expensive lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I am naturally olive skinned and I get an instant dark tan with this lotion. It spreads easily and dries quickly not leaving you feeling greasy at all. The smell is decent, reminds me of an orange creamsicle.&lt;br /&gt;After tanning this lotion did not leave me smelling AT ALL. Its the second day since I tanned and I still have great dark coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I definetly recommend this lotion to anyone who tans!</li>
            <li> I recently started tanning and didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive bottle of lotion. I should&#x27;ve just spent the money because this gave me a RASH all over my body and face. Too bad a tan can&#x27;t hide my oozing sores! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love tanning indoors and outdoors. This is the only lotion I will use outside. It&#x27;s amazing and works better than anything else I have ever tried. I don&#x27;t think it works as best indoors though. Some tanning oils and lotions for outside have given me heat rash but not this one. It smells nice, it&#x27;s moisturizing and darkens your skin instantly - that&#x27;s saying a lot for Illinois sun :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Got a great golden tan</li>
            <li> Good alternative to more expensive tanning products.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, I get the best tan with this.  I order every summer and will keep on ordering it :)</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed. This stuff was very watery, and sticky on my skin. I used it twice, and saw no difference in color. Probably would not buy again...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products out there, from $90-$5 and this is better than any of the higher end products I have ever tried. I am fair skin and I get a very nice color from it from the first use. It is not orange and I love that it&#x27;s a lotion therefore non-oily. I do not use it on my face as I cover up and use a bronzer instead but have not had any problems as far as breakout and it does not leave you with that wanting to get in the shower feeling either. That being said it is not a self tanner so if you are looking for that in a couple of hours you will have a tan that will not happen. This intensifies in the sun and/or a tanning bed but the color looks like you have been in the carribean within the first couple of uses. For those on a budget for $6.00 you cannot go wrong. I have found them at Rite-Aid. Like anything else everyone&#x27;s skin is different but for $6.00 if it doesn&#x27;t work who cares better than trying an $80 product that sux.</li>
            <li> we met Ocean Potion first time in the Carribbean on our holidays&lt;br /&gt;we cannot purchase this beautifull crème in Europe&lt;br /&gt;so I am very happy that I found this item in your programm</li>
            <li> using it and look great</li>
            <li> Best suncare tanning lotion for my skin</li>
            <li> Love this lotion for years! So glad Amazon has it</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else out there. I&#x27;ve tried a few. The instant bronzer is a plus. The store I used to buy it at closed, so now I can only find it here.</li>
            <li> This is the best sun lotion on the market. It gives you the beautiful bronze tan you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Potions Xtreme Intensifier lotion w/Bronzer for a few years now. I have tried a great deal of other products, but am stuck on this.  The lotion is dark colored, and while others find it sticky, I don&#x27;t.  It gives great coverage.  I have a tendency to get very dark anyway, and this lotion really helps.  I love the lack of strong perfume in this product.  The price is right, and I have not looked anywhere else than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ocean potion products in general are good. This cream can be used for indoor salon tanning and outdoors. It smells good.</li>
            <li> one of the best tan lotions that ive ever used. PLUS it smells great for summer &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Makes you nice and tan.  I use it with in side tanning and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my go-to summer products!  Nice smelling, great moisturizing, just a little hint of extra color that isn&#x27;t streaky and enhances the summer glow.  Absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t mess your clothes!</li>
            <li> Fits the tanning program great!</li>
            <li> love the nice bronze color  great for when you have a base tan and need some xtra color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. I was lighter when I got done tanning than before I went in. Watery &amp; sticky too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now. Recently my local drug store either stopped carrying it or removed it from the shelves due to the off-season.&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well for extending or enhancing the tan you might already have or putting down a good base for future tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I currently use it 2-3 times a week at my local tanning salon. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I get around 10-12 tans per 8.5 oz bottle. Buying 3 of them should literally keep me covered for several months for a fraction of what tanning salons charge for their products. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Super dark after only a few hours in the sun</li>
            <li> Great product! Not greasy. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I have bought this previously and it can be used in sun or tanning bed, I really like it.</li>
            <li> if your head is shaved ,this product will put a natural ,dark hue to the head and used in conjunction w/ocean potion&#x27;s protective #8 tanning for UV/UA protection</li>
            <li> smell like cupcake after applied on. non-greasy or feel sticky on my skin. dry faster and feel like silk in humid weather! 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Love that it is a Bronzer and Intensifier in one! Smell is average but results are great!</li>
            <li> I used to only use JWOWW&#x27;S black bronzer but got sick of paying the steep price. I looked in Walmart and by chance seen this product and tried it. It works just as well and has a mild but nice scent to it. It has given me a deep, dark, and even tan. Many people comment on how tan I am and ask if I go to the beach a lot. This is a wonderful product with a wonderful price. I will continue to use this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Only reason why I orderd it online was because Wal-Mart didn&#x27;t have it in yet (too early in season). But, good product for indoor tanning (&amp; outdoor)</li>
