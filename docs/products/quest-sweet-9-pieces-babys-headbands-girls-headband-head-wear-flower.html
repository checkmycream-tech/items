            <li> These headbands were perfect for our baby girl.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed! It looks just like on the photos (last time I bought from diff company, it looked nothing like the photo and I was extremely disappointed) and the quality is supreme. There&#x27;s sparkle cubics on 8 out of 9 hairbands, and absolutely gorgeous all within its own unique design. I&#x27;ll highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous. My babies get complements on them all the time. Beautiful and great price for the buy</li>
            <li> I love it! Fit my newborn perfectly</li>

            <li> very cute. I like it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all different and very cute! Good deal.</li>
            <li> We lived these hairbands! There was obe out of the nine we weren&#x27;t in live with but other than that they are cute and just the right size.  Loving these on my 2 month old.</li>
            <li> Nice. . But wish they add some white color band too... monotonous colors</li>
            <li> loved it. Headbands for every outfit. I just wished they also have headbands in blue</li>
            <li> Great quality! You certainly get more than what you pay for. The headbands look well made and are so much fun. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I recommend</li>

            <li> These headbands are the BEST!  Believe me!  I have a 20 month old daughter with super curly coily hair which cannot be combed through or put into pony tails.  All we can do for now is to put headbands on her hair.  Therefore she wears headbands everyday and I&#x27;m always looking for different styles and colors.  Most sets offer the same type of headband in various colors.  However, this set gives you both in various colors, and styles.  They are also made very well, not cheaply made, like some I have ordered online. Now, I will tell you the headbands have an awful smell when they arrive.  I just hung set them outside and let them air out for a day or two.  I also sometimes gently dip the headbands in a sink full of soapy water, rinse them well, then let them air dry. So if you are a girls headband fanatic, like me, these are a must have!</li>
            <li> Better than I could have imagined. I understand that you get what you pay for, but in this case these are worth much more than what I paid. I would recommend to anyone who likes the head band for babies.</li>
            <li> Adorable and loved them! I purchased them for my grand daughter who is 11 months old and the fit and look great!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Great quality!</li>
