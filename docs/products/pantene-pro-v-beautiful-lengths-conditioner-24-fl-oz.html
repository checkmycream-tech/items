            <li>Awesome price here.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>DOESNT SMELL VERY GOOD</li>
            <li>Gives beautiful results.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels moisturized after I use it, and it&#x27;s GREAT at getting tangles out in the shower.</li>
            <li>And I seemed to have fewer fly</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>An all around good product.</li>
            <li>The best part about this conditioner is how cheap you can get it when it&#x27;s on sale with an e-coupon on Amazon.</li>
            <li>And in the beginning I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too!  </li>
            <li>but it tends to buildup on my hair and eventually my hair ended up kind of oily.  </li>
            <li>My go to conditioner - works great on my hair, leaving it strong, shiny, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product it works excellent</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves your hair with much fewer tangles.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>I have bleached hair and need something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY conditioners, most of which are too watery and don&#x27;t work through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Feels good after i shower but the smell wasnt as good as the old Pantene products.</li>
            <li>conditioning is just ok</li>
            <li>I like Pantene, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love Pantene conditioners.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, &amp; I feel like I can get most of it out of the bottle without wasting a bunch at the end.</li>
            <li>This conditioner always makes my hair look healthy, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel good.</li>
            <li>I liked this product at first</li>
            <li>I have donated 8+ inches hair to Pantene Beautiful Lengths twice since starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>I have less split ends and the shampoo smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I think I like the new one better, which is great, but I have yet to find a conditioner that has enough slip to easily get out my knots!</li>
            <li>but my hair does feel more lively and smooth!</li>
            <li>was ok, but not what to get for damaged hair as it does nothing to help really.</li>
            <li>it quickly turns into a mass of knots.</li>
            <li>I went back to Pantene Pro V Agua Light clean rinse conditioner and everything was fine.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I am so glad Pantene is making this conditioner again, although it is a bit different than before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.excellent price.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is thick and leaves my hair so silky, smooth, shiny, and tangle free!  </li>
            <li>But long term, for long hair, it isn&#x27;t a good option.</li>
            <li>, I used to only buy Pantene , but I&#x27;ve found much better drug store conditioners for my frizzy hair such as Tresseme, Dove, etc.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Normally, I like this stuff, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, I ordered it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have hair down to my backside this shampoo keeps it strong.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe I had my bottles too long</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>FYI, my hair is very easily weighed down (a side effect of long hair), but this somehow doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>bottle just what i expected fast delivery</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> My go to conditioner - works great on my hair, leaving it strong, shiny, and healthy.  I won&#x27;t buy other brands.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this conditioner.  I find that it&#x27;s slimy and heavy.  It takes forever to rinse out of my hair.  I also find that my hair is hard to handle after using this conditioner.  It&#x27;s almost paradoxical, how can it be slimy leave my hair feeling like straw.  I will definitely be using a different brand.</li>
            <li> Gives beautiful results.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves your hair with much fewer tangles. Smells good. A little bit goes a long way unlike cheaper conditioners. An all around good product.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I always use it in combination with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just okay. What one would expect from pantene or other grocery store brands. I have bleached hair and need something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner makes your hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I liked this product at first but it tends to buildup on my hair and eventually my hair ended up kind of oily.  I went back to Pantene Pro V Agua Light clean rinse conditioner and everything was fine.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and I go through shampoo and Conditioner like crazy!  I&#x27;ve tried MANY conditioners, most of which are too watery and don&#x27;t work through my hair.  This conditioner is thick and leaves my hair so silky, smooth, shiny, and tangle free!  I love the scent too!  It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; like other conditioners can be.</li>
            <li> Feels good after i shower but the smell wasnt as good as the old Pantene products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Pantene conditioner. My wife loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my hair actually is stronger or not... that&#x27;s a difficult test to achieve but my hair does feel more lively and smooth!</li>
            <li> Pantene changed their scent.  I went to Target and smelled them all.  No notification of the change.  I have 5 huge bottles now that I hate the smell of.  Pantene used to smell wonderful.  No longer.  Now it smells acidic and acrid.  At first I thought maybe I had my bottles too long and it deteriorated.  Not so.  THEY CHANGED THE SCENT AND IT&#x27;S AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I am so glad Pantene is making this conditioner again, although it is a bit different than before. I think I like the new one better, which is great, but I have yet to find a conditioner that has enough slip to easily get out my knots!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to for conditioner.  I have been using it for years. Awesome price here. Very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend this product. My hairdresser says it&#x27;s crap, but I use it and love it! I think he hates it because his salon doesn&#x27;t sell it!</li>
            <li> conditioning is just ok, I used to only buy Pantene , but I&#x27;ve found much better drug store conditioners for my frizzy hair such as Tresseme, Dove, etc. The best part about this conditioner is how cheap you can get it when it&#x27;s on sale with an e-coupon on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like Pantene, but this is my favorite. It really makes my hair feel good. It&#x27;s soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Normally, I like this stuff, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, I ordered it on amazon.  I got a bad batch and the maker of it wouldn&#x27;t let me return it or give me a refund.  Ordering it from Amazon doesn&#x27;t make sense since you&#x27;d have to pay to return it if it&#x27;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair greasy and feel dirty.</li>
            <li> bottle just what i expected fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is the conditioner that I keep coming back to. My hair always feels moisturized after I use it, and it&#x27;s GREAT at getting tangles out in the shower. I have long hair that I have a bad habit of throwing into buns without combing first...it quickly turns into a mass of knots. Using this conditioner and just raking my fingers through my hair in the shower while the conditioner is in gets out the majority of knots. FYI, my hair is very easily weighed down (a side effect of long hair), but this somehow doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my backside this shampoo keeps it strong. I have less split ends and the shampoo smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love Pantene conditioners. They don&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, &amp; I feel like I can get most of it out of the bottle without wasting a bunch at the end.</li>
            <li> DOESNT SMELL VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> was ok, but not what to get for damaged hair as it does nothing to help really.</li>
            <li> I used both the shampoo and the conditioner.  And in the beginning I loved it.  My hair felt soft and silky.  And I seemed to have fewer fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a week I noticed that my hair was almost gummy.  It felt like it hadn&#x27;t been rinsed.  But no matter how long I rinsed, the feeling didn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using a clarifying shampoo and conditioner for a week to get all of the gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work, if you want to use it for a day or so.  But long term, for long hair, it isn&#x27;t a good option.</li>
            <li> This conditioner always makes my hair look healthy, shiny and smooth. I have donated 8+ inches hair to Pantene Beautiful Lengths twice since starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.excellent price. As far as the product it works excellent but I&#x27;ve noticed my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny switching from tresseme</li>
