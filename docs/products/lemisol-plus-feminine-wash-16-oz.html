            <li> I could not imagine using anything else! I have been using this since I was 15 and I love it! It makes you feel truly clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  Keeps my PH balance in check and smells and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This product is alright, nothing to cry home to mommy about. I prefer to use hibicleanse because it actually removes the odor causing bacteria from the body. Hibicleanse is perfect espeacially in the summer time. This product is like the normal body cleansers; the only difference is the tingle from the menthol which give you the illustion that you are super clean.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome ! I have been using it since the age of 21, I am now 38 and still using it. Keeps you clean and confident all day long ! It&#x27;s great for men and women. They also have a kiddie version that&#x27;s just great for kids. It has a minty fresh feeling. Ladies mark my words \\&quot;use it\\&quot; you and your friend won&#x27;t regret it. :-))</li>
            <li> Lemisol is a complete solution for feminine confidence. It&#x27;s cool minty fresh solution balances a women&#x27;s pH during her time of the month when she may need a little something extra. This is a product I recommend for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet effective. I have very sensitive skin and this refreshes and cleans. Great product.I will definantely buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> all women get an odor at some point, so i suggest to always keep this item at hand. Lets just say cookie on ice (how if feels after applying)</li>
            <li> Its awesome! I feel so...fresh everytime I use it!! Feels like a peppernint in ur mouth, but instead in the area that is much more needed! ;)</li>
            <li> This feminine wash doesn&#x27;t upset my PH balance (which soap, body wash does). It does leave a cool feeling when you use it, which is great for the summer months. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome fresh feeling.  Been using for years must have for vag. Ph balance. . Must have...</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple years. The bottle lasts for a long time. Gives very clean feeling after the use. No allergic reactions with it. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, there is not other product like it and since I don&#x27;t live in a market that they carry it locally I&#x27;ve alwasy had to stock up when I traveled to NY, Florida or Dominican Republic.  My sister first ordered from here and told me about and I can&#x27;t be more happy, it arrived quickly and was less expesive than I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it I&#x27;ll buy tons of it over the coarse of the following year</li>
            <li> After reading review, I sprang for a bottle of Lemisol. I can&#x27;t get really excited about a feminine hygiene product, but I am pleased with the way it works. As others have said, it has a fresh fragrance and a cooling effect that I really like. And a little goes a long way. That said, I think a good antibacterial shower gel works every bit as well as this product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I love it. The reviews are right on the money, and give the best information that I could have asked for.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation from a friend!!  I absolutely love how clean and fresh you feel after using this !!  Every women should be using this.  Just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I will never use soap again on my lady parts. This keeps you fresh and balanced. On my second bottle</li>
            <li> I USUALLY BUY THIS AT MY LOCAL CVS, BUT THEY ALWAYS RUN OUT QUICK. SO I FIGURED ITS BETTER TO BUY IT ONLINE, I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THAT I COULD GET IT ONLINE 4 CHEAP. I GOT MY LEMISOL ON TIME, WHICH WAS PERFECT, BUT I GOT A LEMISOL GOLD..I NEVER SEEN THAT IN THE STORES OR ONLINE, SO I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE GAVE ME A FAKE LEMISOL IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE...</li>
            <li> I am pretty sensitive and heard this was gentle so I gave it a shot.  What I like about it is that you barely have to use any. I imagine this bottle is going to last me a very long time.</li>
