            <li>Good stuff from PM.</li>
            <li>To those of you looking for a good deal: DO NOT BE FOOLED</li>
            <li>I then detangled with a comb to see if it is good for that.</li>
            <li>i got a good price on it from Amazon and that&#x27;s why I bought it here.</li>
            <li>Along with the original shampoo, this is one of the best detanglers out there.</li>
            <li>I could not stop touching my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>Now I have switched to Nexxus condition from Costco and it works 100 times better!</li>

            <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take alot to detangle, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it has buildup.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is the wash-out kind, not the leave-in.</li>
            <li>I would honestly have to do another test to see its detangling capabilities, but I won&#x27;t bother because it didn&#x27;t even condition my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has a tendency to get snarls easily, like myself !</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in my time and this is one of the ones I swear by.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a must buy for those looking for a quality lightly scented conditioner that does the job!</li>
            <li>Many products CLAIM it&#x27;ll help detangle hair, but don&#x27;t even come close to doing so.</li>
            <li>After trying The Detangler, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioning rinse and detangler.  </li>
            <li>We love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse thoroughly and you will love the results.  </li>
            <li>and it is the same wonderful Detangler I have come to know and love.</li>
            <li>Make sure you stay away from their eyes</li>
            <li>I love Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>I love all of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I always use it and have not found a better product for my longish-thick hair.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this works great at keeping my curls at bay until the really humid weather comes</li>
            <li>I love the rich texture that makes up this conditioner</li>
            <li>And easy to comb without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a light-to-medium conditioner that made it easy to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>Both products are very mildly scented.</li>
            <li>Detangler is yellow and smells so nice, mine was very old, BUT very quickly I received a replacement which was perfect</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years now, with beautiful results, always</li>
            <li>when I am being cheap- what can I say?  </li>
            <li>This one leaves her hair smooth, shiny, &amp; frizz-free (even in TX humidity), without the use of a blow dryer or styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stayed at a great hotel and they had tiny bottles of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This detangler is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This works perfectly and I have been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>one thing I can say is that Amazon was really great about providing me with a refund since the product I received is clearly not what is advertised here.</li>
            <li>It was also filled too full and exploded in the package.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is a rinse- through conditioner that rinses clean</li>
            <li>I love it so much and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>The Detangler is excellent for really thick &amp; curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Paul Mitchell products before and they were great, but I don&#x27;t understand how THIS product came from them.  </li>
            <li>Which is awesome because over washing for African American hair or people with</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the detangler was genuine.</li>
            <li>A great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>So soft and silky and so easy to manage!  </li>
            <li>This detangler, works so great, I end up losing much less hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to say goodbye to tangles easily!</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell&#x27;s \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; hair conditioner leaves my fine hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The best part of The Detangler is that you only use a little bit.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled easy ,been using the product for years it is the only product that helps my hair worth it!</li>
            <li>I used a dime-sized amount on a decent sized section of clean, damp hair (how I always condition).</li>
            <li>This is the first time I did not buy the product from a hair salon</li>
            <li>I first tried it a hotel</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair and protect it from heat, but it makes it smoother and more manageable too.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not detangle my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Only about a teaspoon is good enough to work through your hair and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>but I really do think they should lower there price in the future I will be purchasing more affordable formulas</li>
            <li>the paul Mitchell detanglerr is soooo good when its not so old its now white and smells old....</li>
            <li>My fine hair has always been easy to get knots in - since I was a little girl - and this product removes all tangles in the shower.  </li>
            <li>And does NOT have such a strong smell that drives one away.  </li>
            <li>When I use other conditioners, my hair turns out really smooth and full of body.  </li>
            <li>The main point is that it has not helped with the issue of my hair being so tangled after washing!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy feel some conditioners do Love the way it leaves my hair, smooth, soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Have used these products for a while and are smoothing and really nourish the hair.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair instantly de tangled and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell like Paul Mitchell and the product was very runny.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
            <li>It did not give me much slip.</li>
            <li>I finger detangled and that wasn&#x27;t very productive with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>#34;weighed down&amp;#34; by too much product in your hair</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps my hair from becoming a single dreadlock after two days of not being washed.</li>
            <li>large size from Amazon is about 3 times the size of the in-store size, but only costs about 50 percent more -- a savings of about one-half overall.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, it&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I was happy to find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have short coarse hair that does not respond well to most conditioner</li>
            <li>As I get older, and my hair is longer the tangles and hair loss was worrisome.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is more like old lotion than conditioner which matches the texture on wet</li>
            <li>My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I understand that it is a high quality product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you are &amp;</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t care much for the scent of it, which reminded me a bit of the old Flex conditioners from the 80s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before and this is not the normal smell.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight hair that is not particularly dry or damaged.</li>
            <li>Was recommended by my hairdresser in place of conditioner as I have a good crop of hair but the hair is thin.  </li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite product was getting too expensive due to me having to wash my hair more often because I am working out a lot more.</li>
            <li>It is not &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34; but she&#x27;ll live (and close her eyes).</li>
            <li>It depends where you live.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and my curls are defined.</li>
            <li>First off, the bottle I ordered is slightly different than the bottle in the picture.  </li>
            <li>This is the only detangler that really works !  </li>
            <li>It was disappointing, because I love other PM products (The Conditioner, Awapuhi Mist), which have left my hair conditioned, moisturized, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday conditioner that should be used in a small amount at the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>It was the yellow color people talked about and my daughter&#x27;s long hair was smooth after applying it.</li>
            <li>most weigh her hair down and leave it \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling by the 2nd day.  </li>
            <li>only positive thing I can say about this is the scent.</li>
            <li>For Moms of \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; girls, we also occasionally use the Johnson &amp; Jonson leave-in spray detangler - the only \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair without a sticky build-up &amp; you can use it on dry hair too. :-)</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you purchase directly from your hair care provider but would not recommend purchasing this item from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>so I need as much volume as possible.</li>
            <li>compliments!)it made my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>so I think it was just old.</li>
            <li>My curly hair tangles naturally...</li>
            <li>I like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance.</li>
            <li>buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paul mitchell&#x27;s website lists.</li>
            <li>I have super curly and very dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>But if we live a gain in an area with soft water I will go back to using in a heart beat.</li>
            <li>you really try NOT to sacrifice essential items for your personal maintenance.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter has fine, thick, naturally wavy hair and this one of the only conditioners that leaves her hair manageable (meaning that I can comb through it without any tears).</li>
            <li>As described in other reviews - this item smells nothing like the exact item sold in salons.</li>
            <li>No other conditioner has worked like that.</li>
            <li>the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The picture clearly says &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; on it and the bottle I received had yellow writing with the word &amp;</li>
            <li>and I can barely get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t oder it from so far away next time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly heavy on the hair, but is so worth it because it makes my hair manageable</li>
            <li>(I alternate between my heavier and significantly more expensive Pureology conditioner) and it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and detangled.</li>
            <li>When I used this product from the salon it was blue and smelled nice, I believe this is a fake unless Paul Mitchell totally changed it.</li>
            <li>The creme is soft and silky and leaves your hair soft and silly and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>It is the only product that keeps my long thick hair snag free.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was also filled too full and exploded in the package.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is a rinse- through conditioner that rinses clean</li>
            <li> I love it so much and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> The Detangler is excellent for really thick &amp; curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Paul Mitchell products before and they were great, but I don&#x27;t understand how THIS product came from them.  </li>
            <li> Which is awesome because over washing for African American hair or people with</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the detangler was genuine.</li>
            <li> A great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> So soft and silky and so easy to manage!  </li>
            <li> This detangler, works so great, I end up losing much less hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to say goodbye to tangles easily!</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell&#x27;s \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; hair conditioner leaves my fine hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The best part of The Detangler is that you only use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled easy ,been using the product for years it is the only product that helps my hair worth it!</li>
            <li> I used a dime-sized amount on a decent sized section of clean, damp hair (how I always condition).</li>
            <li> This is the first time I did not buy the product from a hair salon</li>
            <li> I first tried it a hotel</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my hair and protect it from heat, but it makes it smoother and more manageable too.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not detangle my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Only about a teaspoon is good enough to work through your hair and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> but I really do think they should lower there price in the future I will be purchasing more affordable formulas</li>
            <li> the paul Mitchell detanglerr is soooo good when its not so old its now white and smells old....</li>
            <li> My fine hair has always been easy to get knots in - since I was a little girl - and this product removes all tangles in the shower.  </li>
            <li> And does NOT have such a strong smell that drives one away.  </li>
            <li> When I use other conditioners, my hair turns out really smooth and full of body.  </li>
            <li> The main point is that it has not helped with the issue of my hair being so tangled after washing!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy feel some conditioners do Love the way it leaves my hair, smooth, soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Have used these products for a while and are smoothing and really nourish the hair.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair instantly de tangled and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell like Paul Mitchell and the product was very runny.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
            <li> It did not give me much slip.</li>
            <li> I finger detangled and that wasn&#x27;t very productive with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> #34;weighed down&amp;#34; by too much product in your hair</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps my hair from becoming a single dreadlock after two days of not being washed.</li>
            <li> large size from Amazon is about 3 times the size of the in-store size, but only costs about 50 percent more -- a savings of about one-half overall.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I was happy to find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have short coarse hair that does not respond well to most conditioner</li>
            <li> As I get older, and my hair is longer the tangles and hair loss was worrisome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is more like old lotion than conditioner which matches the texture on wet</li>
            <li> My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I understand that it is a high quality product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you are &amp;</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t care much for the scent of it, which reminded me a bit of the old Flex conditioners from the 80s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and this is not the normal smell.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair that is not particularly dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my hairdresser in place of conditioner as I have a good crop of hair but the hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite product was getting too expensive due to me having to wash my hair more often because I am working out a lot more.</li>
            <li> It is not &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34; but she&#x27;ll live (and close her eyes).</li>
            <li> It depends where you live.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and my curls are defined.</li>
            <li> First off, the bottle I ordered is slightly different than the bottle in the picture.  </li>
            <li> This is the only detangler that really works !  </li>
            <li> It was disappointing, because I love other PM products (The Conditioner, Awapuhi Mist), which have left my hair conditioned, moisturized, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday conditioner that should be used in a small amount at the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> It was the yellow color people talked about and my daughter&#x27;s long hair was smooth after applying it.</li>
            <li> most weigh her hair down and leave it \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling by the 2nd day.  </li>
            <li> only positive thing I can say about this is the scent.</li>
            <li> For Moms of \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; girls, we also occasionally use the Johnson &amp; Jonson leave-in spray detangler - the only \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair without a sticky build-up &amp; you can use it on dry hair too. :-)</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you purchase directly from your hair care provider but would not recommend purchasing this item from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> so I need as much volume as possible.</li>
            <li> compliments!)it made my hair unbelievably soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> so I think it was just old.</li>
            <li> My curly hair tangles naturally...</li>
            <li> I like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance.</li>
            <li> buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paul mitchell&#x27;s website lists.</li>
            <li> I have super curly and very dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> But if we live a gain in an area with soft water I will go back to using in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> you really try NOT to sacrifice essential items for your personal maintenance.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter has fine, thick, naturally wavy hair and this one of the only conditioners that leaves her hair manageable (meaning that I can comb through it without any tears).</li>
            <li> As described in other reviews - this item smells nothing like the exact item sold in salons.</li>
            <li> No other conditioner has worked like that.</li>
            <li> the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The picture clearly says &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; on it and the bottle I received had yellow writing with the word &amp;</li>
            <li> and I can barely get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t oder it from so far away next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly heavy on the hair, but is so worth it because it makes my hair manageable</li>
            <li> (I alternate between my heavier and significantly more expensive Pureology conditioner) and it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and detangled.</li>
            <li> When I used this product from the salon it was blue and smelled nice, I believe this is a fake unless Paul Mitchell totally changed it.</li>
            <li> The creme is soft and silky and leaves your hair soft and silly and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> It is the only product that keeps my long thick hair snag free.  </li>
            <li> and I can comb right through my thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who has long hair that tangles after shampooing despite the use of regular conditioners.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so gross to touch when it&#x27;s dry-</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair black hair.</li>
            <li> You only need a dime sized drop on your hand, so I&#x27;m thinking with washing my hair every other day, it should last about a year.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long the product was stored before it was sold.</li>
            <li> it is absolutely not the same conditioner that I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Use this for my 3-year-old&#x27;s long hair prone to knots.  </li>
            <li> It took a really long time to get here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far, and both times my hair has come out frizzy, limp, and damaged looking.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Lanza&#x27;s Detangler for years because it is the only thing that seems to work so that I can actually comb my hair without pulling half of it out.</li>
            <li> Based on some of the other reviews I am starting to wonder if I received the product advertised.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day, but I would think that the Detangler could be used daily without a lot of build-up.  </li>
            <li> Only wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product a little earlier.</li>
            <li> Frizzy, dry, damaged, breaking hair</li>
            <li> I have long-straight, dry hair.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman, with non-chemically treated hair, a TRUE detangler is difficult to find.</li>
            <li> On the picture &amp; title it says &amp;#34;the detangler&amp;#34; under the description further down below says &amp;#34;the conditoner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair is still a big tangled mess.</li>
            <li> When you are tight on cash especially in today&#x27;s economy...</li>
            <li> After washing my hair and then applying it, and letting it sit on my hair until I am done washing my body, I&#x27;d take a wide toothed comb and comb out my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner regularly, and usually grab it from JC Penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on two little girls with very long hair, it removes the tangles and the screaming from the brushing process, YAY!</li>
            <li> something is just not right.  </li>
            <li> The review didn&#x27;t let me down this time.</li>
            <li> As a result, conditioners were weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> The detangler is a pale yellow, smells pretty bad</li>
            <li> and I saw less breakage.</li>
            <li> and I have considerably less breakage now since using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> crispy.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to seriously scrub my hair to get the layer off so that I can properly condition it with something else.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> Our little girl tangles my wifes hair</li>
            <li> A little of this</li>
            <li> this stuff ruins my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked other Paul Mitchell products in the past, but this was the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I ended up not even using all of this product up, so I feel like it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This was either too old or it is fake stuff in Paul Mitchell bottle.</li>
            <li> also use it on my color-treated hair a few times a week</li>
            <li> Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels WORSE after using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It helps to detangle my hair without making it heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thin and flat hair</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> No More Tears -</li>
            <li> it was a yellow, and weird smell to it, didn&#x27;t do crap for my hair really, and I use to use this stuff</li>
            <li> Medusa locks I like to call them strips the hair of its natural oils making it impossible to manage!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can hardly pull my fingers through it without ripping tons of hair out.  </li>
            <li> Though now in Germany I cannot use the product anymore because the water is way too hard</li>
            <li> The Detangler is the only condtioner that does not leave a sticky film on your hair or make it feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> It was quite confusing when ordering since the description lead me to believe I was buying &amp;#34;the conditioner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> But the second order they sent me a fake!</li>
            <li> texture once the hair drys feels like a thin layer of wax which is weird because under that layer the hair feels dry and</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower it is very hard to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve read the other bad bad bad reviews first!</li>
            <li> It smells like it is really old and makes my hair smell terrible.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake and got the wrong Paul Mitchell conditioner</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not satisifed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this so-called detangler didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible and it is a different color.</li>
            <li> this was horrible smelling and not only did it not detangle my hair</li>
            <li> It is a fake!</li>
            <li> It is hands down the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. :-(</li>
            <li> I will be returning this product and will now be very skeptical about buying hair products from Amazon.....</li>
            <li> So I immediately went on Amazon, without even reading any of the bad reviews (which I have done now that I bought it) …..</li>
            <li> and I am extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Content was disgustingly stinky.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles horribly, and I use this as a leave-in conditioner</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very curly hair. It tends to frizz. This conditioner is great</li>
            <li> It was ok.  I made a mistake and got the wrong Paul Mitchell conditioner so it was my fault not the provider</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product... but not what I had thought I was purchasing. On the picture &amp; title it says &amp;#34;the detangler&amp;#34; under the description further down below says &amp;#34;the conditoner&amp;#34;. I bought this as a leave in product. This is a rinse out conditioner. Works well, but not what I had wanted</li>
            <li> AS PURCHASED FROM AMAZON - As described in other reviews - this item smells nothing like the exact item sold in salons. It smells like it is really old and makes my hair smell terrible. I purchased this because I like the product and wanted the convenience of delivery, but the product is not as it should be. There are several buying options - I purchased the item fulfilled by Amazon - purchase from a different seller! I am guessing that the reviews that refer to this problem also chose the item fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> A great product that I have used for over 25 years.  I like it because it is a rinse- through conditioner that rinses clean; I do not prefer a leave- in conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled easy ,been using the product for years it is the only product that helps my hair worth it!</li>
            <li> Use this regularly. Its he best detangler out there, if pricy.</li>
            <li> Have used these products for a while and are smoothing and really nourish the hair. A must have product. Great!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I love it so much and use it all the time. HOWEVER, DO NOT LEAVE IT IN THE SUN!!! it still works, but not as well, and it turns yellow. This is a great product I would reccomend for any hair type. Also, it does not take the place of my conditioner. I use it IN ADDITION to my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not satisifed with this product.  Based on some of the other reviews I am starting to wonder if I received the product advertised.  The detangler is a pale yellow, smells pretty bad and I can barely get it out of the bottle.  Not sure what to think.  The main point is that it has not helped with the issue of my hair being so tangled after washing!  I have even tried combing in the shower while the conditioner is still in.  My hair is still a big tangled mess.</li>
            <li> Just buy it.   Frizzy, dry, damaged, breaking hair - you can&#x27;t not have this product.    You need this. It lowers the ph of your cuticle.  This should be your last step before you leave the shower as part of your conditioning routine.    Apply the product  Leave it on for a few minutes, to adust down your hair ph.   Rinse and continue on with your routine.    This is probably the best of the \\&quot;detanglers\\&quot; out there on the market.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!  Worth the $$$  Doesn&#x27;t take alot to detangle, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it has buildup.  I straighten my hair, and I seemed to notice that its silkier and lays straighter after using this detangler.</li>
            <li> This product does detangle but has a rancid odor. I&#x27;ve used the product before and this is not the normal smell. Don&#x27;t know how long the product was stored before it was sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in my time and this is one of the ones I swear by. Thank the gods I found this again.. Online as my local beauty stores haven&#x27;t been carrying it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair from becoming a single dreadlock after two days of not being washed. Which is awesome because over washing for African American hair or people with curly/wavey/frizz- Medusa locks I like to call them strips the hair of its natural oils making it impossible to manage!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair with baby shampoo  J&amp;J&#x27;s No More Tears - when I am being cheap- what can I say?  I&#x27;m a college student. Or when I cough up the money- Paul Mitchell&#x27;s One or Awapaui Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy for those looking for a quality lightly scented conditioner that does the job!</li>
            <li> Normaly this product is very good but I purchased some from Amazon and it was not the same product that you would purchase at your hair care provider.  I believe it is an immitation product.  I recommend this product if you purchase directly from your hair care provider but would not recommend purchasing this item from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft. And easy to comb without feeling greasy. Very light. It doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy feel some conditioners do Love the way it leaves my hair, smooth, soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair that is not particularly dry or damaged. It does, however, seem to get a bit snarled at the ends sometimes after shampooing and wrapping it up in a towel.  I was hoping for a light-to-medium conditioner that made it easy to comb through my hair. Unfortunately, this so-called detangler didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference at all.  In fact, regular conditioners like Aussie Moist or Neutrogena left my hair easier to comb out than this stuff.   I also didn&#x27;t care much for the scent of it, which reminded me a bit of the old Flex conditioners from the 80s.  I ended up not even using all of this product up, so I feel like it was a waste of money.  I&#x27;ve liked other Paul Mitchell products in the past, but this was the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Best cream rinse I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> When you are tight on cash especially in today&#x27;s economy...you really try NOT to sacrifice essential items for your personal maintenance. As an African-American woman, with non-chemically treated hair, a TRUE detangler is difficult to find. Many products CLAIM it&#x27;ll help detangle hair, but don&#x27;t even come close to doing so. Even with products SUPPOSEDLY designed for AA hair. I&#x27;ve known about The Detangler for years, but never tried it. I thought I&#x27;d go ahead after looking for some inexpensive detangling alternatives. My ultimate favorite product was getting too expensive due to me having to wash my hair more often because I am working out a lot more. After trying The Detangler, I fell in love with it. After washing my hair and then applying it, and letting it sit on my hair until I am done washing my body, I&#x27;d take a wide toothed comb and comb out my hair. After I rinsed the conditioner out, my hair is detangled and a breeze to style. The Detangler is excellent for really thick &amp; curly hair. I just wish I could purchase the gallon size locally without having to order the product on-line.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell&#x27;s \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; hair conditioner leaves my fine hair very soft and manageable.  I use this hair conditioner and Shampoo-Two.  Both products are very mildly scented.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner regularly, and usually grab it from JC Penny. Getting it Prime on Amazon was cheaper and obviously easier. This conditioner is the wash-out kind, not the leave-in.</li>
            <li> I have long-straight, dry hair. When I get out of the shower it is very hard to comb through my hair. This didn&#x27;t detangle my hair at all and, I think it smells like melted plastic. I have been using Lanza&#x27;s Detangler for years because it is the only thing that seems to work so that I can actually comb my hair without pulling half of it out. I only bought this to give my hair a break but it definitely didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  It truly is a detangler while it conditions your hair.  I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have thick hair.  For whatever reason this product reminds me of the inexpensive mane &amp; tail conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good stuff from PM. Our little girl tangles my wifes hair and she swears by this stuff. She really likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on two little girls with very long hair, it removes the tangles and the screaming from the brushing process, YAY!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great seller.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioning rinse and detangler.  Great value for the size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell products for a while and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The Detangler is the only condtioner that does not leave a sticky film on your hair or make it feel dirty.  The creme is soft and silky and leaves your hair soft and silly and feeling clean.  The best part of The Detangler is that you only use a little bit.  You do not need to use a lot of the creme to get the results that you want.  Only about a teaspoon is good enough to work through your hair and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel amazing!  So soft and silky and so easy to manage!  Combine The Detangler with one of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s shampoos and you will feel and notice the difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> Content was disgustingly stinky. This was either too old or it is fake stuff in Paul Mitchell bottle. I have used this same product bought from grocery store as well as from hair Salons, so I know what it is supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter has fine, thick, naturally wavy hair and this one of the only conditioners that leaves her hair manageable (meaning that I can comb through it without any tears). We wash her hair 3-4 times a week and have tried LOTS of different conditioners - most weigh her hair down and leave it \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling by the 2nd day.  This one leaves her hair smooth, shiny, &amp; frizz-free (even in TX humidity), without the use of a blow dryer or styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my color-treated hair a few times a week (I alternate between my heavier and significantly more expensive Pureology conditioner) and it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and detangled. I wash my hair every other day, but I would think that the Detangler could be used daily without a lot of build-up.  We love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For Moms of \\&quot;tangled\\&quot; girls, we also occasionally use the Johnson &amp; Jonson leave-in spray detangler - the only \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair without a sticky build-up &amp; you can use it on dry hair too. :-)</li>
            <li> I stayed at a great hotel and they had tiny bottles of this conditioner.  It made my hair feel AMAZING!! I had to have it! So I immediately went on Amazon, without even reading any of the bad reviews (which I have done now that I bought it) ….. it is absolutely not the same conditioner that I had been using.  First off, the bottle I ordered is slightly different than the bottle in the picture.  Second, when I use it, it is way runnier than the hotel version if it.  Same color and everything, but something is just not right.  It makes my hair so gross to touch when it&#x27;s dry- like it is covered in a layer of wax.  I can hardly pull my fingers through it without ripping tons of hair out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this! I wish I would&#x27;ve read the other bad bad bad reviews first! It is hands down the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. :-(</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  It leaves your hair instantly de tangled and smooth.  Be sure to rinse thoroughly and you will love the results.  Adds lots of shine!</li>
            <li> Along with the original shampoo, this is one of the best detanglers out there. A great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. I have thin and flat hair so I need as much volume as possible. This is a great everyday conditioner that should be used in a small amount at the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the Paul Mitchell Detangler for years.  It is the only product that keeps my long thick hair snag free.  It has always worked so well.  This is the first time I did not buy the product from a hair salon and I am extremely disappointed.  The bottle I got from Amazon is not the same product.  It smells horrible and it is a different color. The Detangler should be a yellow color.  The one sent from Amazon is white.  The bottle I received even looks different.  It does not look like the bottle pictured on the Amazon page nor does it look like a bottle found at a salon.  Yesterday I went out and bought another bottle from a salon and it is the same wonderful Detangler I have come to know and love. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon again.  If you shop around at the mall, you can find it even cheaper.  I went to three places and found it for $13 (all others were at $21)</li>
            <li> The stuff that works!  And does NOT have such a strong smell that drives one away.  Actually, the smell is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Nicholson</li>
            <li> Use this for my 3-year-old&#x27;s long hair prone to knots.  It is not &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34; but she&#x27;ll live (and close her eyes).</li>
            <li> This is the only detangler that really works !  I would recommend this to anyone that has a tendency to get snarls easily, like myself !</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner set from my local salon after recalling using it as a child. I love the rich texture that makes up this conditioner and I like the smell (I got compliments!)it made my hair unbelievably soft and manageable. I have short coarse hair that does not respond well to most conditioner so the results were great! I could not stop touching my hair! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price. It cost 25 dollars for the two of them! I understand that it is a high quality product but I really do think they should lower there price in the future I will be purchasing more affordable formulas</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I first tried it a hotel and it worked a treat in getting the knots out of my daughter&#x27;s haair, she&#x27;s two so all sorts of things get rubbed in.  Make sure you stay away from their eyes</li>
            <li> I have super curly and very dry, coarse hair.  As I get older, and my hair is longer the tangles and hair loss was worrisome.  This detangler, works so great, I end up losing much less hair.</li>
            <li> I love Paul Mitchell. This product doesn&#x27;t smell like Paul Mitchell and the product was very runny.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
            <li> I refill the purse size bottles from this and have enough to last me well over a year.</li>
            <li> Honestly the BEST detangler I&#x27;ve ever found.  I have been using it faithfully for over 20 years and would not use anything else.  My fine hair has always been easy to get knots in - since I was a little girl - and this product removes all tangles in the shower.  It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> It depends where you live. In NC that is all that I needed for my hair.  I did not use a conditioner but only the detangler.  Though now in Germany I cannot use the product anymore because the water is way too hard and I did have to go back to a conditioner.  But if we live a gain in an area with soft water I will go back to using in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted me MONTHS. It was a lot cheaper than buying it at a salon. I love all of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> this was horrible smelling and not only did it not detangle my hair but it didn&#x27;t even help soften my hair. When I used this product from the salon it was blue and smelled nice, I believe this is a fake unless Paul Mitchell totally changed it. I returned this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful detangler for my luscious locks!</li>
            <li> It is a fake! I am so pissed. The first time I bought the detangler was genuine. It was the yellow color people talked about and my daughter&#x27;s long hair was smooth after applying it. But the second order they sent me a fake! The color was white and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. My daughter&#x27;s hair would still be like hay after applying it. Can&#x27;t believe Amazon allows such practice! Now I have switched to Nexxus condition from Costco and it works 100 times better!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I have naturally curly hair black hair. So far, I love it. I was the difference immediately. My hair is very soft and my curls are defined. I could comb through my hair and I saw less breakage. So far so good.</li>
            <li> it was a yellow, and weird smell to it, didn&#x27;t do crap for my hair really, and I use to use this stuff a lot off the shelf so I think it was just old.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who has long hair that tangles after shampooing despite the use of regular conditioners. This product is described by my granddaughter and her mother as &amp;#34;the good stuff&amp;#34; because it works!</li>
            <li> My hair tangles horribly, and I use this as a leave-in conditioner - it&#x27;s the only way I can get a pick through it after washing!  Wonderful formula.</li>
            <li> This detangler is fantastic.  I always use it and have not found a better product for my longish-thick hair.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome! I literally can&#x27;t get my fingers through my hair after shampooing, unless I use The Detangler! It&#x27;s slightly heavy on the hair, but is so worth it because it makes my hair manageable and I have considerably less breakage now since using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> To those of you looking for a good deal: DO NOT BE FOOLED&lt;br /&gt;The picture here says Paul Mitchell - The Detangler - Original&lt;br /&gt;I assure you that it is NOT.  Upon receiving my bottle I discovered that the label did NOT match the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The picture clearly says &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; on it and the bottle I received had yellow writing with the word &amp;#34;Condition&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is more like old lotion than conditioner which matches the texture on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;The texture once the hair drys feels like a thin layer of wax which is weird because under that layer the hair feels dry and crispy.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to seriously scrub my hair to get the layer off so that I can properly condition it with something else.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I can say is that Amazon was really great about providing me with a refund since the product I received is clearly not what is advertised here.</li>
            <li> the paul Mitchell detanglerr is soooo good when its not so old its now white and smells old.... which is what I received&lt;br /&gt;The Detangler is yellow and smells so nice, mine was very old, BUT very quickly I received a replacement which was perfect&lt;br /&gt;velinad</li>
            <li> Great product but I wouldn&#x27;t oder it from so far away next time. It took a really long time to get here.</li>
            <li> The review didn&#x27;t let me down this time. Only wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product a little earlier.</li>
            <li> This product does not look like, smell or behave like the product that I have purchase in person.  I suspect that it may be counterfeit.  It was also filled too full and exploded in the package.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product.  My curly hair tangles naturally...add hairspray and washing it is a challenge.  This detangler is a lifesaver.  Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to say goodbye to tangles easily!</li>
            <li> 3c/4a coily curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is lackluster. I used a dime-sized amount on a decent sized section of clean, damp hair (how I always condition). It did not give me much slip. I finger detangled and that wasn&#x27;t very productive with this conditioner. I then detangled with a comb to see if it is good for that. The comb glided through, but I suspect only because I had already finger-detangled. I would honestly have to do another test to see its detangling capabilities, but I won&#x27;t bother because it didn&#x27;t even condition my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not condition my hair at all. I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water. My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized. It was disappointing, because I love other PM products (The Conditioner, Awapuhi Mist), which have left my hair conditioned, moisturized, and beautiful. After rinsing this detangler out I followed up with a cowash with Herbal Essences Hydralicious, which defines my hair and leaves it well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say about this is the scent. It is neutral, and smells like baby powder to me. I like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance. The consistency is medium-thick, and it is yellow in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paul mitchell&#x27;s website lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner i have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT CHEAPER THEN WHERE I GOT MY BEFORE</li>
            <li> MY HAIR LOOKS LIKE SPAGHETTI AFTER WASHING, THIS PRODUCT GETS THE JOB DONE.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  Best price on Amazon</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my hairdresser in place of conditioner as I have a good crop of hair but the hair is thin.  As a result, conditioners were weighing my hair down and I had no volume.  This works perfectly and I have been using it for a few years. I would highly recommend it if you are &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; by too much product in your hair</li>
            <li> My barber turned me on to this product, which works well as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This large size from Amazon is about 3 times the size of the in-store size, but only costs about 50 percent more -- a savings of about one-half overall.</li>
            <li> Even though this is listed as &amp;#34;the det angler&amp;#34; I still purchased because the description has it listed as &amp;#34;the conditioner&amp;#34; and boy was I dissappointed!!!! The detangler is a rinse out conditioner and I didn&#x27;t need that. It was quite confusing when ordering since the description lead me to believe I was buying &amp;#34;the conditioner&amp;#34; which is blue and a leave in conditioner. I will be returning this product and will now be very skeptical about buying hair products from Amazon..... VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little of this and I can comb right through my thick, long hair.  No other conditioner has worked like that.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now, with beautiful results, always</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it. Not only does it make my hair and protect it from heat, but it makes it smoother and more manageable too. i got a good price on it from Amazon and that&#x27;s why I bought it here.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used other Paul Mitchell products before and they were great, but I don&#x27;t understand how THIS product came from them.  First of all, it does not detangle my hair at all.  My hair actually feels WORSE after using this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far, and both times my hair has come out frizzy, limp, and damaged looking.  When I use other conditioners, my hair turns out really smooth and full of body.  I&#x27;m throwing out the rest of the bottle and getting something else before this stuff ruins my hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I was happy to find it here on amazon. It helps to detangle my hair without making it heavy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this works great at keeping my curls at bay until the really humid weather comes</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo, and this conditioner, but paid no attention to the size.  It&#x27;s about a liter.  You only need a dime sized drop on your hand, so I&#x27;m thinking with washing my hair every other day, it should last about a year.  Not so with the smaller sized shampoo.  Next time I&#x27;ll read the info on size, but I like the idea of buying the larger bottle, and not being concerned that it will run out soon.</li>
