    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is a great product!</li>
            <li>best thing about Surya is its ease of application.</li>
            <li>Excellent as always.</li>
            <li>Love it, I will use it now forever!!!</li>
            <li>it was very bright and beautiful, but it washes out and the color is almost gone out.</li>
            <li>.. been in my hair for 4 days now, still great.</li>
            <li>Color is great.  </li>
            <li>A great alternative to hair dye, which I am allergic to.</li>
            <li>If it still doesn&#x27;t work, I will try out Light Mountain which is rated excellent on the EWG.org Cosmetic Safety Database!  </li>
            <li>Price is good and it doesn&#x27;t sting any part of me.  </li>
            <li>you know, I let this sit on my head covered with the provided plastic cap for over an hour on a nice warm day.  </li>
            <li>I have never dyed my own hair.</li>
            <li>Ta da, the results are nice.     </li>
            <li>It is quite nice to me, esp.</li>
            <li>This does not damage your hair like store bought permanent hair colors might, and it gives the hair a nice shine.      </li>
            <li>so wanted to find a dye I could use that would give me nice colour but not ruin my hair again.</li>
            <li>The conditioning and scent of the Surya line is really nice though.</li>
            <li>Besides that I loved it, great smell, it leaves your hair feeling incredible, it&#x27;s good for your hair unlike the other hair coloring products.</li>
            <li>Surya Henna Cream is very easy to apply and the waiting period, after application, is about 30-45 minutes, depending on the color results you are trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li>and the color turned out pretty great  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use &amp; if you rinse it out really good the first time, it will not rub off on your clothes or pillow.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would add some interesting color to my hair &amp; it did.  </li>
            <li>I love this Henna.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It looks so much better to have those blah grays colored.   </li>
            <li>Surya now can add me to their list of satisfied customers.    </li>
            <li>So much better than henna</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>The end result is lovely.</li>
            <li>I will probably be re-dying my hair every week, however this isn&#x27;t a *huge* problem as it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This was AMAZING, no bad smells, easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it washes out very quickly, I want something that will stay in my hair longer.</li>
            <li>The cream is really easy to use as opposed to the powder that you have to prepare yourself.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to apply this product.</li>
            <li>Which is fine.  </li>
            <li>A super alternative!</li>
            <li>tried the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; color--and can report that it&#x27;s certainly a bright red (while I&#x27;m more \\&quot;strawberry\\&quot; or \\&quot;sandy\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>Still I like the color, and  it makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li>is hair that is a gorgeous, healthy, and bright shade of natural red.</li>
            <li>for the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>in all, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, natural colour that won&#x27;t ruin your hair, and are prepared to dye it often and put up with it washing out every time you have a shower, this is for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ready-mixed, no-drip cream that goes on easily, and rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product...</li>
            <li>However at a fraction of the cost it is worth it!</li>
            <li>but if I did, this product is what I would use on my roots for in-between times of full coloring (which I would use another product do do).  </li>
            <li>Great natural product that leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>however the older I get, the more brown I have.</li>
            <li>a quick look at the box or a google search will reveal.</li>
            <li>Surya Henna Cream provided me with good gray coverage and a beautiful shade of red hair, plus my hair also felt soft and looked healthy and shiny after it dried.  </li>
            <li>For sure it is not 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you dye your hair weekly with this product, it will remain healthy and soft regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much more convenient than Natural Henna if you don&#x27;t mind some chemicals.</li>
            <li>I must admit I am spoiled at the salon so not quite as fun as coloring my hair at home.</li>
            <li>And the process and results are generally superior to other drugstore-aisle coloring preparations.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>A really natural red colour, the dye works with your natural highlights, so the resulting colour looks great and not artificial at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty for the first day, and after that it fades out super fast.</li>
            <li>first off says mahogany on the box.    </li>
            <li>I am enjoying my red highlights instead of gray highlights.</li>
            <li>I have naturally light brown/strawberry blond hair and have been dying it since I was about 12 years old.</li>
            <li>and I used a lot more of the red to cover all of my hair than I had to use of the Surya burgundy to cover all of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something more red and brighter than the burgundy</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I think of my hair was a more blonde color the red would have popped more.</li>
            <li>When I first put it in my hair</li>
            <li>This is my first time using henna.</li>
            <li>I even used it on my eyebrows and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Then you apply this stuff, which is super easy to apply because they&#x27;ve done all the hard work of mixing it for you, after about 35 minutes or more</li>
            <li>However the next day I dyed my hair again and left the product on for just over an hour - results were GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stumble upon this.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a more vibrant red color, though.</li>
            <li>I came across Surya Henna Cream in Red when searching for a pre-mixed henna that was easy to apply (no mixing, waiting hours for the color to develop, etc).</li>
            <li>Another big plus is the fact that it rinses out easily, unlike powdered hennas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried powdered henna products in the past, and while I love the color I&#x27;ve gotten with them, they are messy to use and you need to leave the henna paste on your hair for several hours or even overnight for the best results.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to have a easier henna product to use rather than the much messier stuff.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is relatively light, the directions on the box instruct to leave the product in for only 30-40 minutes, however, I leave it in for an hour.</li>
            <li>This will ensure that all of the superfluous color is rinsed out, otherwise your end result will be an INTENSE shade of vermillion.</li>
            <li>The beneficial thing about henna is that you can use as much as you want as often as you desire...</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair and still manage to apply it reasonably well by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is most definitely NOT all natural though, it does have some chemicals</li>
            <li>This product is very simple to use, with less mess and fuss, smells lovely, and leaves the hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>The second time I left it in for 2 hours and the results were much better.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended this product.</li>
            <li>the previously long ago bleached parts are much brighter red  but not TOO bright,     I noticed it everytime my hair gets wet, the water is colored..  </li>
            <li>I would leave it in my hair and just dry it in, and it would be fine because henna is like a natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with a more natural permanent red to get the very red, but not neon hair that I like.  </li>
            <li>i tried it at different times leaving it on for as long as 3 hours, however, the color still was mostly gone in a week.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>No irritants, as I have sensitive skin to all things!</li>
            <li>But after several shampooings, the color degraded, with mild pinkish tones emerging, that I personally found undesirable.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon sells it because I have a heck of a time finding a lot of natural products around here.</li>
            <li>It could be the color, because red always washes out fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO SOFT and it literally gleams with richness now.</li>
            <li>Will also do wonders on natural curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead</li>
            <li>But the resulting color is not as intense as I get from powdered red hennas</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strong  very easy to use, not to runny .</li>
            <li>I bought the surya henna cream in red and depending on what you want it is a decent product.</li>
            <li>After the second shampoo my colored scalp looked normal.  </li>
            <li>You have to wash your hair first minus conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I would wear plastic gloves when drying, because I would probably scruntch my hair as I dried it with the hair drier and the left in creme would most likely color my fingers if I didn&#x27;t wear gloves.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention, the color being a certain shade of bright auburn would fade dramatically after the first few days, leaving me with brittle strands and disappointment.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is dirty strawberry blonde, and I have always wanted to become a true redhead as far back as I am able to recall.</li>
            <li>Consequently, henna&#x27;s benefits are more muted in this product--notably, less shine and thickening of the hair than you&#x27;d obtain in using conventional henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I love everything about it except the fact that it last no more than a week!</li>
            <li>By the 4th shampoo I imagine my old lady strands will be rather obvious.  </li>
            <li>far, Surya (in another color) has been a \\&quot;good-enough\\&quot; product where its convenience has kept me coming back.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I left it on an hour which turned out not to be long enough.</li>
            <li>I used harsh permanent dyes that dried out my hair and have spent the last two years growing it all out and getting my hair back into good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I required two full bottles to cover my thick hair which is just below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, and less messy than powdered hennas.  </li>
            <li>very quickly got bored of my natural hair colour,</li>
            <li>Several years ago, I broke down and purchased the more expensive Surya henna at a \\&quot;Whole</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strong  very easy to use, not to runny .</li>
            <li> I bought the surya henna cream in red and depending on what you want it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> After the second shampoo my colored scalp looked normal.  </li>
            <li> You have to wash your hair first minus conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I would wear plastic gloves when drying, because I would probably scruntch my hair as I dried it with the hair drier and the left in creme would most likely color my fingers if I didn&#x27;t wear gloves.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, the color being a certain shade of bright auburn would fade dramatically after the first few days, leaving me with brittle strands and disappointment.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dirty strawberry blonde, and I have always wanted to become a true redhead as far back as I am able to recall.</li>
            <li> Consequently, henna&#x27;s benefits are more muted in this product--notably, less shine and thickening of the hair than you&#x27;d obtain in using conventional henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I love everything about it except the fact that it last no more than a week!</li>
            <li> By the 4th shampoo I imagine my old lady strands will be rather obvious.  </li>
            <li> far, Surya (in another color) has been a \\&quot;good-enough\\&quot; product where its convenience has kept me coming back.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I left it on an hour which turned out not to be long enough.</li>
            <li> I used harsh permanent dyes that dried out my hair and have spent the last two years growing it all out and getting my hair back into good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I required two full bottles to cover my thick hair which is just below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and less messy than powdered hennas.  </li>
            <li> very quickly got bored of my natural hair colour,</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I broke down and purchased the more expensive Surya henna at a \\&quot;Whole</li>
            <li> a certain age,\\&quot; who has used henna (from raw ground henna, to every type of formulated henna product) for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I have used several chemical hair color preparations and have been turned off by the odors and by the way they had left my hair dry and brittle, and often had \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; color effects which took a while to wash out.  </li>
            <li> downside is it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft but it made my hair a little darker than what I was going for.</li>
            <li> Basically, I would use a little brush (like a touch-up brush, an eyebrow brush or even an old toothbrush) to dip in to this Henna Red Cream Surya Nature bottle (which has a little squeeze spout lid, but I would twist it off and never use it) and then apply this directly to the in-coming gray roots...</li>
            <li> but if you have long hair, you might want to consider using two.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I found odd, was that the color was different shades of red on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to try one other color (burgundy) before giving up on this brand entirely.  </li>
            <li> This Henna lasts for a while for me due to my short hair.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to the fact that my hip-length hair is lighter on the ends and darker at the roots and somewhere in the middle in between.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it tended to dry my hair out, not condition it as it claims to.</li>
            <li> This stuff costs way too much to last only a few washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so every single gray/white strand glows on my head.  </li>
            <li> highlights brigthen up my dark brunette to a red tint in the sun  </li>
            <li> (When I switched to the \\&quot;Dark Reddish Blond\\&quot; color, I eventually encountered the same thing, after repeated applications.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color will last about a week or slightly longer, depending solely on how often you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for about ten years and wanted to find something that would give me the color and gray coverage I want without the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> According to the directions, if you have any product left over you can reseal the bottle and use it at another time, so no worries about waste.  </li>

            <li> The quantity is small, so if you are coloring long hair you might need 2 bottles.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have nearly black hair so every single gray/white strand glows on my head.  I thought this would add some interesting color to my hair &amp; it did.  It is very easy to use &amp; if you rinse it out really good the first time, it will not rub off on your clothes or pillow.  My scalp was pinkish red from the dye which sucked, but what can ya do?  After the second shampoo my colored scalp looked normal.  By the third shampoo I can already see gray/white coming through.  By the 4th shampoo I imagine my old lady strands will be rather obvious.  This is a huge disappointment.  This stuff costs way too much to last only a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you know, I let this sit on my head covered with the provided plastic cap for over an hour on a nice warm day.  I didn&#x27;t rush the process in the least.  I did not wash my hair after, just put in some conditioner as instructed &amp; then rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every other day.  I don&#x27;t know if the problem is this red color.  I am going to try one other color (burgundy) before giving up on this brand entirely.  I was really hoping to have a easier henna product to use rather than the much messier stuff.  If it still doesn&#x27;t work, I will try out Light Mountain which is rated excellent on the EWG.org Cosmetic Safety Database!  Thankfully Amazon sells it because I have a heck of a time finding a lot of natural products around here.</li>
            <li> For safety, convenience, ease-of-use, and for how well it works, I recommend this product.  I have used several chemical hair color preparations and have been turned off by the odors and by the way they had left my hair dry and brittle, and often had \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; color effects which took a while to wash out.  I switched to powder henna, but found, although natural-looking and smelling, it could be messy to prepare and apply, and also can take a long time before reaching the desired color effect. This product is very simple to use, with less mess and fuss, smells lovely, and leaves the hair in good condition. A super alternative!</li>
            <li> I love this Henna. For sure it is not 100% natural. Still I like the color, and  it makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li> It is a great product!, I love everything about it except the fact that it last no more than a week!, it washes out very quickly, I want something that will stay in my hair longer. It could be the color, because red always washes out fast. Besides that I loved it, great smell, it leaves your hair feeling incredible, it&#x27;s good for your hair unlike the other hair coloring products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work on my hair.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dirty strawberry blonde, and I have always wanted to become a true redhead as far back as I am able to recall. After using permanent red dye from various brands several times, I was dissatisfied with the drying effect that it had on my hair. Not to mention, the color being a certain shade of bright auburn would fade dramatically after the first few days, leaving me with brittle strands and disappointment. I came across Surya Henna Cream in Red when searching for a pre-mixed henna that was easy to apply (no mixing, waiting hours for the color to develop, etc). I have now used the hair color several times, I stock up on several boxes at a time, and will be a devoted customer to Surya Henna Red Cream for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-length hair, and if your hair is any longer in length, I recommended purchasing at least 2 boxes in order to fully saturate your entire head. Since my hair is relatively light, the directions on the box instruct to leave the product in for only 30-40 minutes, however, I leave it in for an hour. Cover your head with the cap provided until the hour is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsing, wash your hair twice with a small amount of moisturizing shampoo, lathering both the dye and shampoo. This will ensure that all of the superfluous color is rinsed out, otherwise your end result will be an INTENSE shade of vermillion. Apply conditioner that&#x27;s specific purpose is to be used after coloring hair. Leave it in for a few minutes, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you are left with is hair that is a gorgeous, healthy, and bright shade of natural red. The color will last about a week or slightly longer, depending solely on how often you wash your hair. The beneficial thing about henna is that you can use as much as you want as often as you desire... Therefore, if you dye your hair weekly with this product, it will remain healthy and soft regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommended this product. You cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have never dyed my own hair. This was AMAZING, no bad smells, easy to use. I literally gasped with glee when I looked at my fire blood red hair when I was done rinsing it. No irritants, as I have sensitive skin to all things! My hair is SO SOFT and it literally gleams with richness now. Love it, I will use it now forever!!!</li>
            <li> first off says mahogany on the box.    used it anyways because I was desperate for some hair dye    Doesn&#x27;t smell bad or strong  very easy to use, not to runny . comes with showercap and gloves.  and the color turned out pretty great  highlights brigthen up my dark brunette to a red tint in the sun  the previously long ago bleached parts are much brighter red  but not TOO bright,     I noticed it everytime my hair gets wet, the water is colored..  Ill post more when the color comes out.. been in my hair for 4 days now, still great.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for about ten years and wanted to find something that would give me the color and gray coverage I want without the harsh chemicals.  I have tried powdered henna products in the past, and while I love the color I&#x27;ve gotten with them, they are messy to use and you need to leave the henna paste on your hair for several hours or even overnight for the best results.  Surya Henna Cream is very easy to apply and the waiting period, after application, is about 30-45 minutes, depending on the color results you are trying to achieve.  Another big plus is the fact that it rinses out easily, unlike powdered hennas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair and one bottle was sufficient to color it but if you have long hair, you might want to consider using two.  According to the directions, if you have any product left over you can reseal the bottle and use it at another time, so no worries about waste.  The package also includes a pair of non-latex gloves and a \\&quot;shower cap\\&quot; to cover your hair after applying the cream.  Surya Henna Cream provided me with good gray coverage and a beautiful shade of red hair, plus my hair also felt soft and looked healthy and shiny after it dried.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Wish it had a more vibrant red color, though.</li>
            <li> Great natural product that leaves the hair soft and shiny. The cream is really easy to use as opposed to the powder that you have to prepare yourself. Will also do wonders on natural curly and frizzy hair. I basically use it as a deep treatment, not even for the color. Shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead \\&quot;of a certain age,\\&quot; who has used henna (from raw ground henna, to every type of formulated henna product) for over 40 years.  Several years ago, I broke down and purchased the more expensive Surya henna at a \\&quot;Whole Foods\\&quot; store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about Surya is its ease of application. It&#x27;s a ready-mixed, no-drip cream that goes on easily, and rinses out quickly. And the process and results are generally superior to other drugstore-aisle coloring preparations.  But note that \\&quot;henna\\&quot; is mentioned about three-fourths of the way down a long list of ingredients. This is a hair dye that includes a very small amount of henna--rather than a henna product (such as \\&quot;Rainbow Henna\\&quot;) that might include some additional coloring agents. Consequently, henna&#x27;s benefits are more muted in this product--notably, less shine and thickening of the hair than you&#x27;d obtain in using conventional henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; color--and can report that it&#x27;s certainly a bright red (while I&#x27;m more \\&quot;strawberry\\&quot; or \\&quot;sandy\\&quot;).  Which is fine.  But after several shampooings, the color degraded, with mild pinkish tones emerging, that I personally found undesirable. (When I switched to the \\&quot;Dark Reddish Blond\\&quot; color, I eventually encountered the same thing, after repeated applications.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, Surya (in another color) has been a \\&quot;good-enough\\&quot; product where its convenience has kept me coming back. But I think I&#x27;ll be returning to regular henna.</li>
            <li> You have to wash your hair first minus conditioning.  Then you apply this stuff, which is super easy to apply because they&#x27;ve done all the hard work of mixing it for you, after about 35 minutes or more you can then wash it out and condition.  Ta da, the results are nice.     I have dark hair with strands of gray.  My gray has turned to like a cherry-red color.  It is quite nice to me, esp. for the cheap price.  There were a few grays that I missed and boy can you notice the difference!  It looks so much better to have those blah grays colored.   This does not damage your hair like store bought permanent hair colors might, and it gives the hair a nice shine.      I&#x27;m glad I stumble upon this. Surya now can add me to their list of satisfied customers.    Note:  The quantity is small, so if you are coloring long hair you might need 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping and product just as described!  Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to apply this product. I wanted to change my hair color without using toxic hair dyes. The first time I used this product, I left it on an hour which turned out not to be long enough. The second time I left it in for 2 hours and the results were much better. I am enjoying my red highlights instead of gray highlights.</li>
            <li> I have naturally light brown/strawberry blond hair and have been dying it since I was about 12 years old. I used harsh permanent dyes that dried out my hair and have spent the last two years growing it all out and getting my hair back into good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very quickly got bored of my natural hair colour, so wanted to find a dye I could use that would give me nice colour but not ruin my hair again. I got the Red shade of Surya. I was disappointed after my first application - I left the dye on for half an hour and my hair just looked orange and uneven afterwards. However the next day I dyed my hair again and left the product on for just over an hour - results were GORGEOUS. A really natural red colour, the dye works with your natural highlights, so the resulting colour looks great and not artificial at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is it doesn&#x27;t last long. I will probably be re-dying my hair every week, however this isn&#x27;t a *huge* problem as it&#x27;s very easy to use. I have waist length hair and still manage to apply it reasonably well by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, natural colour that won&#x27;t ruin your hair, and are prepared to dye it often and put up with it washing out every time you have a shower, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This Henna lasts for a while for me due to my short hair.  I mix it with a more natural permanent red to get the very red, but not neon hair that I like.  Price is good and it doesn&#x27;t sting any part of me.  Much more convenient than Natural Henna if you don&#x27;t mind some chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and less messy than powdered hennas.  But the resulting color is not as intense as I get from powdered red hennas and I used a lot more of the red to cover all of my hair than I had to use of the Surya burgundy to cover all of my hair.  I wanted something more red and brighter than the burgundy but this just doesn&#x27;t have the pop I was seeking.  The conditioning and scent of the Surya line is really nice though.</li>
            <li> Color is great.  So much better than henna powders- no grit, no mud head, no mud clumps all over the bathroom  Doesn&#x27;t stink.  Creamy application.  love it.</li>
            <li> If I had gray hair, which I am not saying I do...but if I did, this product is what I would use on my roots for in-between times of full coloring (which I would use another product do do).  Basically, I would use a little brush (like a touch-up brush, an eyebrow brush or even an old toothbrush) to dip in to this Henna Red Cream Surya Nature bottle (which has a little squeeze spout lid, but I would twist it off and never use it) and then apply this directly to the in-coming gray roots...then I would just leave it in (doing this just after shampooing) and dry my hair as usual.  I would wear plastic gloves when drying, because I would probably scruntch my hair as I dried it with the hair drier and the left in creme would most likely color my fingers if I didn&#x27;t wear gloves.  Yes! I would leave it in my hair and just dry it in, and it would be fine because henna is like a natural conditioner.  Just sayin&#x27;...of course, I don&#x27;t have gray hair...I have red hair, so you don&#x27;t have to take my recommendation or advice if you don&#x27;t want to. ;)</li>
            <li> my hair became orange and not red D:</li>
            <li> Blessings in Holy Sound-Yeshua....&lt;br /&gt;Surya Red is.....really red !......and it wears off after several shampoos....so....enjoy ?!&lt;br /&gt;Namaste,&lt;br /&gt;Omody</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft but it made my hair a little darker than what I was going for. I think of my hair was a more blonde color the red would have popped more. I don&#x27;t recommend for anyone with dark hair colors. It would be a waste of money</li>
            <li> Excellent as always. A great alternative to hair dye, which I am allergic to.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product...When I first put it in my hair it was very bright and beautiful, but it washes out and the color is almost gone out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using henna. I typically go to the salon and color roots/grays in between visits. I am a natural redhead however the older I get, the more brown I have. It is so difficult to keep the red tone in not to mention keeping the grays hidden. I used the red on the roots and then used the blondish red on the rest of my hair. I required two full bottles to cover my thick hair which is just below my shoulders. The end result is lovely. My hair feels very soft. I even used it on my eyebrows and it worked pretty well. It is a bit messy. Coconut oil around the scalp/forehead area and ears helped from staining the skin. I must admit I am spoiled at the salon so not quite as fun as coloring my hair at home. However at a fraction of the cost it is worth it! Hope the color stays in for a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought the surya henna cream in red and depending on what you want it is a decent product. It is most definitely NOT all natural though, it does have some chemicals a quick look at the box or a google search will reveal. I have really bad skin allergies and anything that is not completely chemical free makes me itch and bleed like mad, and this cream did just that. I also noticed that it tended to dry my hair out, not condition it as it claims to. The color is really pretty for the first day, and after that it fades out super fast. I tried following the time chart and when that hardly colored my hair i tried it at different times leaving it on for as long as 3 hours, however, the color still was mostly gone in a week. Another thing I found odd, was that the color was different shades of red on my hair. This may be due to the fact that my hip-length hair is lighter on the ends and darker at the roots and somewhere in the middle in between. So I would say if you don&#x27;t mind having to touch up often, or mind that it is not chemical-free, then I would recommend this product, otherwise I just can&#x27;t give it a thumbs up.</li>
