            <li>Of course the sanding bands made by Dremel fit perfectly.  </li>

            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>very happy to get great quantity at reasonable price!</li>
            <li>When Dremel is selling 6 for $5, 100 at $7 don&#x27;t have to be all that great to make it worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li>I love these sanding bands they work so great with my electric file</li>
            <li>Maybe these work for people who are more experienced but not for me.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>They work great and came really quick in the mail I love them and had great service</li>

            <li>Arrived timely and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>but they work nicely when I use them for a pedicure.</li>
            <li>Great bands for the price,it is worth it if you do your nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to get these in stores, Anazon is the best happy customer üëç</li>
            <li>I have been looking for these sanding bands for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>It was okay when installing.</li>
            <li>BUT AM SURE IT WILL TAKE SOME PRACTICE-HUSBAND</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t run out of these blighters for a while :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>great buy for a much needed product.</li>
            <li>It makes my hobby easier and much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>but im glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>I would make sure</li>
            <li>Was totally surprised that the fit was perfect &amp; works well.</li>
            <li>I will surely order them again when needed.</li>
            <li>Great and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use the emmery replacement tips &amp; be safe.</li>
            <li>Great product, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>There are so many here that it will take forever for me to use them in my one-person shop.</li>
            <li>However, I love the price for the quantity.</li>
            <li>They fit better than the one&#x27;s that came with the Manicurist vogue pro nail kit.</li>
            <li>These sanding bands work great on natural nails.</li>
            <li>Glad I originally these .</li>
            <li>price maybe could get better deal but these shipped right to me!</li>
            <li>The grit is pretty smooth and that&#x27;s what my customers love!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I like the fine for my nails.</li>
            <li>Fit my nail drill just fine and will keep me supplied for some time.</li>
            <li>i got these for free with the pedicure kit</li>
            <li>Should not say it does fit Dremel in the description.</li>
            <li>Maybe I can find some in the bag that fit</li>
            <li>Would like finer grit available</li>
            <li>back up for my drill they work great</li>
            <li>really  fit  </li>
            <li>Im happy with my machine for home use only.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for someone .It has not been used yet but does fit the tool it was bought for</li>
            <li>A quick call to Dremel support confirmed that this has never happened.</li>
            <li>you know the kind of drill bits these fit and not waste your time.</li>
            <li>These filers work great, they are what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy again!very please with product. :)</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>They come well wrapped and quite quickly.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It came quickly</li>
            <li>I use these bands for grinding my dogs&#x27; toenails, so I go through them quickly.</li>
            <li>More then one (At Least Me) can use in a long time but a good price for use with the Vogue Electric Nail File (Also A Good Price) Works well and is easy to put on and use.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how cheap and &amp;#34;Unclassy&amp;#34; this item is.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with what I got and would purchase this again!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with special needs kids!</li>
            <li>They fit on my drill very well.</li>
            <li>, The bands are cheap, you will go through 5 or 6 trying to get them on, and just when your ready to work they rip and disintegrate.</li>
            <li>and it is economical to buy this package.</li>
            <li>The person i gave them to said that she really liked them and that they were going to last for quite awhile, even on the acrylic nails..</li>
            <li>It also helps get that glitter polish off and is very friendly to the natural nail.</li>
            <li>And &amp;#34; Bargain Sources &amp;#34; is on the ball with sending the orders out right away.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you apply the right pressure, getting nail polish off is a breeze.</li>
            <li>These are just the right grit for my callouses as well as my toe nails.</li>
            <li>and they are the same kind that you pay for at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I got them as an extra with the order of a full set of bits for my nail machine, &amp; I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>shipping was quick, price good..will be back for more when needed.</li>
            <li>USED IT ON MY TOENAILS AND SEEMS PRETTY POWERFUL</li>
            <li>I am just starting to use this with the manicurist so far so good.</li>
            <li>It was just what I needed and very reasonable.</li>
            <li>HAVEN&#x27;T USED VERY MUCH YET -SEEMS</li>
            <li>come on and off with ease but stay securely on while sanding, great for shaping, loved them nothing bad to say will buy again and would recommend!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and Yes i did count them and there were 100 exactly</li>
            <li>These MAY fit a fingernail machine, but this seller should take the \\&quot;FITS DREMEL\\&quot; out of the description as it is clearly a lie.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a package of five of these for the Dremmel for more than I paid for this set of 100.</li>
            <li>That way I won&#x27;t be using the same equipment on more then one person.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re not expensive</li>
            <li>Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.</li>
            <li>Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.</li>
            <li>One I&#x27;m not sure where to go &amp; get more &amp; now I have a large stash &amp; they are SO much better</li>
            <li>I m. Looping for a more professional machine .with √† little more power.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I use the very much and was afraid not to find them when I run out of them, very happy</li>
            <li>They did not fit the size it says, but they did fix it right away and even without notice by sending me the peice that would fit them and it does, thank you so much, and would order again!!!</li>
            <li>so they were certainly work a try.</li>
            <li>I found that going above roughly half speed on my dremel greatly reduced the durability.  </li>
            <li>These little sanding bands have made themselves useful in so many ways.  </li>
            <li>, what can I really say?  </li>
            <li>They leave your feet feeling absolutely like baby skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Didnt really need all of this</li>
            <li>Sturdy enough to use on light wood working projects (but not recommended for it, I&#x27;d still use them for that purpose).</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I assumed these would fit a standard drill head, but</li>
            <li>Very helpful for toenail fungus reduction.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>save your money and go to a beauty supply store and get the right product for a little more money.</li>
            <li>Strong bands that last long and also fit for my dremel bits.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit the rubber center piece very well.</li>
            <li>Economy  pack I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>no  hard  work  anymore.</li>
            <li>I use them to file acrylic nails but they can also be used for fine detail sanding of wood and any other soft material.</li>
            <li>They fit a little tight,but you don&#x27;t have to worry about them sliding off while doing your nails.</li>
            <li>This certainly was an Amazon disappointment after years of good service.  </li>
            <li>Think I will take the info directly from a Dremel employee as the factual information.&lt;br</li>
            <li>completely hygenic, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Well enough made to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>bought these to replace some old files that I had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and straight forward ...</li>
            <li>Very well working and cheaper than any local retailer offered.</li>
            <li>Bloody brilliant!</li>
            <li>I truly believe in being clean &amp; as sterrel as possible so that my customers don&#x27;t have to worry about getting infections or fugges issuesfrom other people that I work on.</li>
            <li>Dremel sanding sleeves are tight ... they NEED to be stretched some to make them fit  ...</li>
            <li>I found that the size of these bands were too large and they keep slipping off the grinder head when you try to use them.</li>
            <li>natural nails and have recently started to use them to exfoliate my heels.</li>
            <li>really havent tried any other</li>
            <li>I also ran into one that was slightly too large and kept spinning off the drum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those little sanding bans work very well cleaning your heels.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The grit is pretty smooth and that&#x27;s what my customers love!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I like the fine for my nails.</li>
            <li> Fit my nail drill just fine and will keep me supplied for some time.</li>
            <li> i got these for free with the pedicure kit</li>
            <li> Should not say it does fit Dremel in the description.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can find some in the bag that fit</li>
            <li> Would like finer grit available</li>
            <li> back up for my drill they work great</li>
            <li> really  fit  </li>
            <li> Im happy with my machine for home use only.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone .It has not been used yet but does fit the tool it was bought for</li>
            <li> A quick call to Dremel support confirmed that this has never happened.</li>
            <li> you know the kind of drill bits these fit and not waste your time.</li>
            <li> These filers work great, they are what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy again!very please with product. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> They come well wrapped and quite quickly.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It came quickly</li>
            <li> I use these bands for grinding my dogs&#x27; toenails, so I go through them quickly.</li>
            <li> More then one (At Least Me) can use in a long time but a good price for use with the Vogue Electric Nail File (Also A Good Price) Works well and is easy to put on and use.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how cheap and &amp;#34;Unclassy&amp;#34; this item is.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with what I got and would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with special needs kids!</li>
            <li> They fit on my drill very well.</li>
            <li> , The bands are cheap, you will go through 5 or 6 trying to get them on, and just when your ready to work they rip and disintegrate.</li>
            <li> and it is economical to buy this package.</li>
            <li> The person i gave them to said that she really liked them and that they were going to last for quite awhile, even on the acrylic nails..</li>
            <li> It also helps get that glitter polish off and is very friendly to the natural nail.</li>
            <li> And &amp;#34; Bargain Sources &amp;#34; is on the ball with sending the orders out right away.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you apply the right pressure, getting nail polish off is a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are just the right grit for my callouses as well as my toe nails.</li>
            <li> and they are the same kind that you pay for at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I got them as an extra with the order of a full set of bits for my nail machine, &amp; I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> shipping was quick, price good..will be back for more when needed.</li>
            <li> USED IT ON MY TOENAILS AND SEEMS PRETTY POWERFUL</li>
            <li> I am just starting to use this with the manicurist so far so good.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T USED VERY MUCH YET -SEEMS</li>
            <li> come on and off with ease but stay securely on while sanding, great for shaping, loved them nothing bad to say will buy again and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and Yes i did count them and there were 100 exactly</li>
            <li> These MAY fit a fingernail machine, but this seller should take the \\&quot;FITS DREMEL\\&quot; out of the description as it is clearly a lie.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a package of five of these for the Dremmel for more than I paid for this set of 100.</li>
            <li> That way I won&#x27;t be using the same equipment on more then one person.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not expensive</li>
            <li> Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.</li>
            <li> Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.</li>
            <li> One I&#x27;m not sure where to go &amp; get more &amp; now I have a large stash &amp; they are SO much better</li>
            <li> I m. Looping for a more professional machine .with √† little more power.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I use the very much and was afraid not to find them when I run out of them, very happy</li>
            <li> They did not fit the size it says, but they did fix it right away and even without notice by sending me the peice that would fit them and it does, thank you so much, and would order again!!!</li>
            <li> so they were certainly work a try.</li>
            <li> I found that going above roughly half speed on my dremel greatly reduced the durability.  </li>
            <li> These little sanding bands have made themselves useful in so many ways.  </li>
            <li> , what can I really say?  </li>
            <li> They leave your feet feeling absolutely like baby skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Didnt really need all of this</li>
            <li> Sturdy enough to use on light wood working projects (but not recommended for it, I&#x27;d still use them for that purpose).</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I assumed these would fit a standard drill head, but</li>
            <li> Very helpful for toenail fungus reduction.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> save your money and go to a beauty supply store and get the right product for a little more money.</li>
            <li> Strong bands that last long and also fit for my dremel bits.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit the rubber center piece very well.</li>
            <li> Economy  pack I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> no  hard  work  anymore.</li>
            <li> I use them to file acrylic nails but they can also be used for fine detail sanding of wood and any other soft material.</li>
            <li> They fit a little tight,but you don&#x27;t have to worry about them sliding off while doing your nails.</li>
            <li> This certainly was an Amazon disappointment after years of good service.  </li>
            <li> Think I will take the info directly from a Dremel employee as the factual information.&lt;br</li>
            <li> completely hygenic, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Well enough made to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> bought these to replace some old files that I had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and straight forward ...</li>
            <li> Very well working and cheaper than any local retailer offered.</li>
            <li> Bloody brilliant!</li>
            <li> I truly believe in being clean &amp; as sterrel as possible so that my customers don&#x27;t have to worry about getting infections or fugges issuesfrom other people that I work on.</li>
            <li> Dremel sanding sleeves are tight ... they NEED to be stretched some to make them fit  ...</li>
            <li> I found that the size of these bands were too large and they keep slipping off the grinder head when you try to use them.</li>
            <li> natural nails and have recently started to use them to exfoliate my heels.</li>
            <li> really havent tried any other</li>
            <li> I also ran into one that was slightly too large and kept spinning off the drum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those little sanding bans work very well cleaning your heels.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> There is no question that the Dremel products last longer and in fact, 6 Dremel&#x27;s may last as long as 100 of these.  </li>
            <li> Lots of pieces this should last a long time depending on the amount of use.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to have extras, as I don&#x27;t know how long they last yet.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last very long they come apart</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy and eliminates the need for clippers which they didn&#x27;t like and were afraid of!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 5 out of the bag so far and all are too tight to slide over the rubber mandrel.  </li>
            <li> be careful not to stay too long at the same spot as you&#x27;ll burn yourself....</li>
            <li> have now a supply for a very long time.</li>
            <li> These DO NOT FIT Dremel standard 1/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It somehow does not fit properly.</li>
            <li> Does not fit standard Dremel mandrel.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> It works, but I have to be careful while grinding or the band will fall off or tear off.</li>
            <li> Shipping on this order was as expected.</li>
            <li> A little hard to put on my particular Dremel device</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;re just a tad too small, so it&#x27;s an extremely tight fit.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single father of two autistic boys!</li>
            <li> I wish they made the black ones with the heavier grit.</li>
            <li> Just a little too tight.  </li>
            <li> A little hint to try.  </li>
            <li> The girls at the nail shop always wrap a little piece of paper towel around the stem of the tool before applying the sanding band to snug it up and prevent this problem.</li>
            <li> These drums DO NOT FIT A DREMEL 1/4 inch sanding drum.</li>
            <li> I saw some comments that people have trouble with these working off the tool while in use.</li>
            <li> The replacement sanding rounds did not fit anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my nails a few times with one band</li>
            <li> I received all 1/4 inch bands and they do NOT fit the Dremel 1/4 inch mandrel.</li>
            <li> Don&amp;#34;t waste you money</li>
            <li> I like it because it comes with a lot of the little files replacement parts!</li>
            <li> i was worried about the band not fitting my drill</li>
            <li> When we tried it the rotator failed to rotate and operated in very slow useless jerks, each not completing a rotation.&lt;br /&gt;We ended up just throwing it away--not worth repacking and sending.  </li>
            <li> My complaint was not addressed by the supplier</li>
            <li> No more anxiety for them about getting their nails done!</li>
            <li> The paper is coming unraveled on almost every one I&#x27;ve used so far :(</li>
            <li> A LITTLE DIFFICULT</li>
            <li> You either need to be working on your money game instead of shopping because you&#x27;re broke as hell or&lt;</li>
            <li> but these are sso POORLY MANUFACTURED that if you try to stretch them, they disintegrate.</li>
            <li> Had a time getting them to stay on the rod, but finallt found out the secret</li>
            <li> All bands were in order and none broken.</li>
            <li> WIth your silly , nitpicking ass.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is my bad or lack of knowledge.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i got these for free with the pedicure kit so i can&#x27;t complain. i didn&#x27;t use these at all so i can&#x27;t tell you if they work</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do. i was worried about the band not fitting my drill but theyre perfect!!</li>
            <li> This is a really good bargain. It goes with the Vogue Pro.</li>
            <li> These DO NOT FIT Dremel standard 1/4\\&quot; drums!&lt;br /&gt;These are not meant for hobby use! Do not buy unless you use Vogue nail sanders.</li>
            <li> Thank you for delivering this in a timely matter and in tact and in the condition described.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered these! They fit better than the one&#x27;s that came with the Manicurist vogue pro nail kit.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these sanding bands for more than a year.  Every place that sells Dermal supplies did not have them.  E-bay did not have them.  I was so happy to find them I bought two boxes.  I will order them again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this! I&#x27;m a single father of two autistic boys! I use this on them! It&#x27;s fast and easy and eliminates the need for clippers which they didn&#x27;t like and were afraid of! No more anxiety for them about getting their nails done! Myself included! Highly recommend for anyone with special needs kids!</li>
            <li> It was okay when installing. It somehow does not fit properly. It kept breaking and pealing off. I needed instructions how to assemble.</li>
            <li> More then one (At Least Me) can use in a long time but a good price for use with the Vogue Electric Nail File (Also A Good Price) Works well and is easy to put on and use.</li>
            <li> The best sanding bands I&#x27;ve ever used...I will purchase them again. They are a perfect fit for my nail drill!</li>
            <li> i HAVEN&#x27;T USED VERY MUCH YET -SEEMS A LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT AM SURE IT WILL TAKE SOME PRACTICE-HUSBAND USED IT ON MY TOENAILS AND SEEMS PRETTY POWERFUL WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li> Great for my use in acrylic nails</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Worked great with my nail file.</li>
            <li> Not the best and when you use it I guess they shrink because its stuck on my bit and I cant get it off</li>
            <li> There are only 2 things I have to say about someone who needs to read a review before buying this item:&lt;br /&gt;1. You either need to be working on your money game instead of shopping because you&#x27;re broke as hell or&lt;br /&gt;2. You know how everybody has that one person at school or work that they want to beat the hell out of because they get on everyone&#x27;s nerves? It&#x27;s you!! WIth your silly , nitpicking ass.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly with my Dremel tool. I wish they made the black ones with the heavier grit.</li>
            <li> Bloody brilliant! Won&#x27;t run out of these blighters for a while :)</li>
            <li> 100 bands for $7, what can I really say?  When Dremel is selling 6 for $5, 100 at $7 don&#x27;t have to be all that great to make it worthwhile.  I have used about 4-5 of these already, if you are using a variable speed rotary tool, keep these guys on the low settings.  I found that going above roughly half speed on my dremel greatly reduced the durability.  The sanding band would pull away from the drum.  That&#x27;s how 2 or 3 of mine were destroyed.  There is no question that the Dremel products last longer and in fact, 6 Dremel&#x27;s may last as long as 100 of these.  I also ran into one that was slightly too large and kept spinning off the drum.  So... quality control is lacking as well.  Fact is, though, out of 100 drums, all you need is 1 or 2 to last a while and it is economical to buy this package.</li>
            <li> These sanding bits were perfect. and Yes i did count them and there were 100 exactly :) so I&#x27;m very satisfied Thank you</li>
            <li> very happy to get great quantity at reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Ordered those sanding bands, as I am using one of those electrical manicure sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those little sanding bans work very well cleaning your heels.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to stay too long at the same spot as you&#x27;ll burn yourself....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now a supply for a very long time. Great deal!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the Vogue power tool but these bands slide off. The tool is the same brand name but it still didn&#x27;t stay on the power drill.</li>
            <li> Great company to do business with. Product as described.</li>
            <li> These sanding bands work great on natural nails.They fit a little tight,but you don&#x27;t have to worry about them sliding off while doing your nails.Great bands for the price,it is worth it if you do your nails alot.I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Lots of pieces this should last a long time depending on the amount of use. My wife does not use them often so this should last her.</li>
            <li> Fit my nail drill just fine and will keep me supplied for some time.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Good product as described!</li>
            <li> I have multiple packages of these bands and wondered just how I would use them all for my personal use. I of course use them for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my natural nails and have recently started to use them to exfoliate my heels. They leave your feet feeling absolutely like baby skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy for a much needed product.</li>
            <li> These filers work great, they are what I expected.  they work on multiple tools I have.  I would recommend them and I would purchase them again</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product. Strong bands that last long and also fit for my dremel bits. Give these a try and you&#x27;ll be very glad you did!</li>
            <li> They are awesome and can&#x27;t beat the price. Quality is really good and it works great with my machine, Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Does not fit standard Dremel mandrel. Should not say it does fit Dremel in the description. I received an email stating that Dremel changed their design, and it was not their fault (from the seller). A quick call to Dremel support confirmed that this has never happened. Think I will take the info directly from a Dremel employee as the factual information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason... my earlier review simply vanished. I suppose there is a good reason for this Amazon?</li>
            <li> Good buy, lots of sizes.</li>
            <li> Would have been a great deal.  I&#x27;ve tried about 5 out of the bag so far and all are too tight to slide over the rubber mandrel.  Just a little too tight.  Of course the sanding bands made by Dremel fit perfectly.  Maybe I can find some in the bag that fit so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> These drums DO NOT FIT A DREMEL 1/4 inch sanding drum. Maybe I should have taken a hint when all the advertising info on it&#x27;s webpage only talked about fingernails, but the page title says \\&quot;FITS DREMEL\\&quot; ... and they DO NOT!! Dremel sanding sleeves are tight ... they NEED to be stretched some to make them fit  ... but these are sso POORLY MANUFACTURED that if you try to stretch them, they disintegrate. These MAY fit a fingernail machine, but this seller should take the \\&quot;FITS DREMEL\\&quot; out of the description as it is clearly a lie.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price!  I got these as an add-on deal for a manicure set.  I also intend to use them for my Dremmel tool.  I recently bought a package of five of these for the Dremmel for more than I paid for this set of 100. Quality seems to be the same as the name brand.  I saw some comments that people have trouble with these working off the tool while in use. A little hint to try.  The girls at the nail shop always wrap a little piece of paper towel around the stem of the tool before applying the sanding band to snug it up and prevent this problem.</li>
            <li> Can never have enough at these prices.</li>
            <li> great price and they are the same kind that you pay for at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to have extras, as I don&#x27;t know how long they last yet. Price is excellent. And &amp;#34; Bargain Sources &amp;#34; is on the ball with sending the orders out right away. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very good product. It makes my hobby easier and much more enjoyable. completely hygenic, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Didnt really need all of this but im glad I bought them. I like the product really havent tried any other</li>
            <li> Great, but couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the coarseness (I bought alll three)</li>
            <li> perfect use for my dremel use for dog grooming to file dogs nails.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love these sanding bands they work so great with my electric file they work wonderful and get the job done</li>
            <li> I am just starting to use this with the manicurist so far so good. makes trimming nails alot easier. great</li>
            <li> Well enough made to do the job very well. Sturdy enough to use on light wood working projects (but not recommended for it, I&#x27;d still use them for that purpose).</li>
            <li> Great price and product seems like 1st quality. Arrived timely and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly.  good quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Prepared for manicures and pedicures</li>
            <li> They ae doing the job.  Had a time getting them to stay on the rod, but finallt found out the secret</li>
            <li> They work well with the MED2191 Turbo File Pro Electric Nail Filing System.</li>
            <li> Would like finer grit available</li>
            <li> bought these to replace some old files that I had. shipping was quick, price good..will be back for more when needed. thanks</li>
            <li> These worked great and are perfectly sized for my rotary nail sander.</li>
            <li> These sanding bands are just what I needed.  The handheld nail sanding devise uses these perfectly and I am pleased to have them.  They come well wrapped and quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Mom received as a Xmas gift, says she loves them and that they work perfectly with her vogue nail manicurist!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and straight forward ... This item just is what it is! ... And ... It just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do ... File</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is my bad or lack of knowledge. I assumed these would fit a standard drill head, but no luck.  I would make sure you know the kind of drill bits these fit and not waste your time.</li>
            <li> The grit is pretty smooth and that&#x27;s what my customers love! It also helps get that glitter polish off and is very friendly to the natural nail.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Was totally surprised that the fit was perfect &amp; works well. Would absolutely buy again!very please with product. :)</li>
            <li> come on and off with ease but stay securely on while sanding, great for shaping, loved them nothing bad to say will buy again and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely&lt;br /&gt;looking to purchase a variety pack next time different grits&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly&lt;br /&gt;was just what was needed</li>
            <li> The paper is coming unraveled on almost every one I&#x27;ve used so far :(</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for this one! Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with what I got and would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> This Product is great! Works well! I would recommend it to anyone!  Love it! Im happy with it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  All bands were in order and none broken. Have been using them with no problem.  Item was just as described and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> needed the extra bands just in case I could not find them again. ( over causios). would recommend for whatever you need them for</li>
            <li> Very helpful for toenail fungus reduction.  I use regularly instead of going to podiatrist every time I need to trim my nails.</li>
            <li> I use the very much and was afraid not to find them when I run out of them, very happy</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit the rubber center piece very well. I use these bands for grinding my dogs&#x27; toenails, so I go through them quickly. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re just a tad too small, so it&#x27;s an extremely tight fit. I can only get them about 2/3 of the way onto the rubber piece. It works, but I have to be careful while grinding or the band will fall off or tear off.</li>
            <li> back up for my drill they work great</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last very long they come apart</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace the ones that came with the sander.  I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I like the fine for my nails.</li>
            <li> Fit the dremmel perfect and there were a lot of them!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GOOD REPLACEMENTS FOR YOUR FILE!!!</li>
            <li> The battery powered nail trimmer/shaper was a piece of junk.  The replacement sanding rounds did not fit anyway.  I threw all of it in the trash!</li>
            <li> These little sanding bands have made themselves useful in so many ways.  I use them on my dogs&#x27; nails; on my nails (different bands); on my callouses on my feet.  Well I think you get the idea.  They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> These sanders that are for the electric nail file came in a timely manner. They were a gift. The person i gave them to said that she really liked them and that they were going to last for quite awhile, even on the acrylic nails..</li>
            <li> Received this item before estimated delivery date and they exceed my expectations. Very well working and cheaper than any local retailer offered. I will surely order them again when needed. I use them to file acrylic nails but they can also be used for fine detail sanding of wood and any other soft material. I&#x27;ve done my nails a few times with one band it it hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s grit nor did it fall off while sanding leaving the nail discolored or anything. EXCELLENT product and great bargain!</li>
            <li> A little hard to put on my particular Dremel device but they work nicely when I use them for a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I found that the size of these bands were too large and they keep slipping off the grinder head when you try to use them. My complaint was not addressed by the supplier</li>
            <li> Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.Thanks got here quickly and was what I was wanting thanks again.</li>
            <li> Glad I originally these .</li>
            <li> Perfect. They fit on my drill very well. I use them to file off my gel polish. It works like a charm. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you apply the right pressure, getting nail polish off is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality Thanks A Lot</li>
            <li> They did not fit the size it says, but they did fix it right away and even without notice by sending me the peice that would fit them and it does, thank you so much, and would order again!!!</li>
            <li> They are good, thank you.</li>
            <li> Items says 1/4 and 1/2 sanding bands. I received all 1/4 inch bands and they do NOT fit the Dremel 1/4 inch mandrel. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> great! I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Great and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> A needful item for the machine to control overgrown toenails.</li>
            <li> not worth the money. very disappointed with the product. save your money and go to a beauty supply store and get the right product for a little more money.</li>
            <li> I got them as an extra with the order of a full set of bits for my nail machine, &amp; I&#x27;m glad that I did. One I&#x27;m not sure where to go &amp; get more &amp; now I have a large stash &amp; they are SO much better then emerry boards. &amp; they are disposable. That way I won&#x27;t be using the same equipment on more then one person. I truly believe in being clean &amp; as sterrel as possible so that my customers don&#x27;t have to worry about getting infections or fugges issuesfrom other people that I work on. I know that a lot of salons use the same metel bits over &amp; over on every customer. Me... I&#x27;d rather use the emmery replacement tips &amp; be safe.</li>
            <li> this  really  fit  for  my  nail.  no  hard  work  anymore. save  time  and  money.  il  keep  this  for  a while</li>
            <li> These fit my cordless dremel perfectly.  For use on callouses, fingernails, etc.  Great product, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will work well. Good price</li>
            <li> These are just the right grit for my callouses as well as my toe nails. Need a bit finer for fingernails,though.</li>
            <li> I still have it and I still use it!  I like it because it comes with a lot of the little files replacement parts!</li>
            <li> Im happy with my machine for home use only. I m. Looping for a more professional machine .with √† little more power. Thank you. Amazon.com</li>
            <li> They work great and came really quick in the mail I love them and had great service it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&amp;#34;t waste you money, The bands are cheap, you will go through 5 or 6 trying to get them on, and just when your ready to work they rip and disintegrate.</li>
            <li> Happy with this item. It&#x27;s really hard to get these in stores, Anazon is the best happy customer üëç</li>
            <li> delivered promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Maybe these work for people who are more experienced but not for me. I just didn&#x27;t think they worked. But they&#x27;re not expensive so they were certainly work a try.</li>
            <li> great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Economy  pack I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Shipping on this order was as expected.It was a gift for someone .It has not been used yet but does fit the tool it was bought for</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34;  for nails and callouses was purchased for a severely handicapped person who cannot do it herself.  The first thing I noticed was how cheap and &amp;#34;Unclassy&amp;#34; this item is. The so called one page user&#x27;s manual had mispellings .  When we tried it the rotator failed to rotate and operated in very slow useless jerks, each not completing a rotation.&lt;br /&gt;We ended up just throwing it away--not worth repacking and sending.  This certainly was an Amazon disappointment after years of good service.  What added to the irony--it was made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;Robert E. Yim M.D.</li>
            <li> they are efficient for the work intended. price maybe could get better deal but these shipped right to me! good find!</li>
            <li> Cumple con cada uno de los requerimientos que estaba solicitando, el tiempo de entrega ha sido muy bueno, recomiendo este producto</li>
            <li> There are so many here that it will take forever for me to use them in my one-person shop. However, I love the price for the quantity.</li>
