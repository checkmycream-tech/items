    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The thing I like best about this pill box is the ability to pull out each day&#x27;s pills.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Just an  excellent product</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Great feature  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>That fact that words are raised are great.  </li>
            <li>If you can figure out how to use this without the covers, this is a great pill organizer for you.  </li>
            <li>Great price, great seller.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a couple of these sets and it works great.</li>
            <li>But for the price its a fair product.</li>
            <li>While this organizer is a great idea, the plastic hinges on the compartments are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This works great and will eliminate many problems in my life</li>
            <li>The compartments are a great size, for she has many meds</li>
            <li>This product makes it very easy to help the parents set up their Meds</li>
            <li>This is the best pill box I&#x27;ve found so far for folks like my mom and me, who have to take a lot of medication.</li>
            <li>Works great, but some of the doors broke off right away.  </li>
            <li>Convenient size for my many medications.</li>
            <li>I do like being able to pull out dosage for a day and throw it in my purse if I&#x27;m going to be gone overnight.  </li>
            <li>The price was great as was the fast service.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that each day&#x27;s pill organizer can be removed to slip into your purse, etc.</li>
            <li>There has to be a better quality choice out there.</li>
            <li>I love the size of this product.  </li>
            <li>I take many pills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the days of the week are across the top of the organizer AND on each pill stick as well.</li>
            <li>Better yet, let me write on them myself.)</li>
            <li>The people I caregive for have tried several types of pill compartments, and for one of them this one works perfectly for what she needs.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these to set up meds for more than a day at a time.  </li>
            <li>HE WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED &amp; VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li>Pretty pleased with this organizer!</li>
            <li>Opens easily</li>
            <li>Being able to take a days pills out and put it next to my chair or in my purse is a great asset.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my Mom has had trouble keeping up with her meds, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill</li>
            <li>This is nice &amp; large.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s just a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>and they all fit.  </li>
            <li>We liked it so much that I got two.  </li>
            <li>Now 50percent of morning box available for growth.</li>
            <li>Next time I will pay more to get good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OK, it isn&#x27;t my ideal, but it&#x27;s big enough and nicely organized.</li>
            <li>I WENT TO AMAZON.COM, &amp; HAD SUCCESS!  </li>
            <li>THE MOST &amp;#34;USABLE &amp; VERSATILE&amp;#34; LARGE PILL CHEST</li>
            <li>This lets me carry a full days pills in one, compartamentalized container without a problem.  </li>
            <li>Love it; now I can sort all of my pills for a whole week no matter what size they are.</li>
            <li>Exceptional product for those who really have a large amount of pills to manage (holds very large amount) or for those with dexterity problems (easier to handle).  </li>
            <li>Very large compartments that fit everything, including doctor-ordered supplements/vitamins.</li>
            <li>The size is nice but the lids do not stay shut securely and will come open with handling and all your pills spill out.  </li>
            <li>The compartments are nice and big, which was primarily what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Well made, quick ship, would buy again.  </li>
            <li>and they love the fact that they can take one day meds with them and not the whole week worth</li>
            <li>This is so cheap, the first time I opened the compartments to put pills in, some of the lids broke.  </li>
            <li>this  is a good , sturdy and effective item that should last  several years.</li>
            <li>Fast easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>Good product but not as great since its hard to open the container</li>
            <li>Nice and big.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sized pill organizer, but given that it has 28 compartments, that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that the compartments are roomy enough for my husbands meds.</li>
            <li>Clear plastic  makes it easy to see that she&#x27;s taken the medicine.</li>
            <li>and I was very gentle.</li>
            <li>Two tops broke off the first time I opened them</li>
            <li>On the first week of use, two of the hinged covers for pill compartments broke.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Have used our first one for years.</li>
            <li>Big problem when you have to take so many meds.</li>
            <li>I already had one of these pill organizers and really wanted two more of the same.</li>
            <li>If a compartment does just happen to open, it sure beats trying to put a week&#x27;s worth of meds back in the right compartments!</li>
            <li>Most 4X7  setups are single units  </li>
            <li>so I bought the large and its quite large.  </li>
            <li>In large print , also has brail.  </li>
            <li>I like the removable days and large compartments.  </li>
            <li>I take a pretty complete vitamin regemin, including thrice-a-day Flaxseed and CLA, which are very large pills.  </li>
            <li>This really helped her, she has commented how much she likes using it</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad and it has really helped him keep track of things.</li>
            <li>Having the four different times of day available was in</li>
            <li>Like the bigger size, I can fit all my supplements.  </li>
            <li>I had too many pills for my old smaller pill container.  </li>
            <li>Ours came clear white which was fine.</li>
            <li>Was glad to find it again, and bought several for extra weeks and for family.</li>
            <li>But, still haven&#x27;t found anything this big that you can port with you daily after two years searching, so got some more of these</li>
            <li>If you find one that is easy to open they arent&#x27; large enough to handle the multitude of meds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this pill box and hope they keep on making them.</li>
            <li>This is not only like my old one but better, the compartments are larger.</li>
            <li>Drawbacks are that the lids open backwards and they open up easily when you carry them around in your pocketbook, causing pills to spill everywhere.</li>
            <li>As I am using this for someone with extreme memory loss consistency is important to him and me.</li>
            <li>Amazon provided a replacement, but the hinges on the new one are breaking off, as well.</li>
            <li>I used scotch tape to make a new &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; for them.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT 3 NEW ONES, SO</li>
            <li>I think this one was the one that was pretty big,  holds those fish oil pills with no problem.  </li>
            <li>We had an organizer very similar, but smaller and his pills just keep getting bigger and more</li>
            <li>as importantly, I can carry my plethora of cardiac, kidney, prostate and arthritis medications in one daily container when I go golfing, fishing, hunting or canoeing.  </li>
            <li>Large enough for all my RXs &amp; vitamins and minerals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, my ideal sorter would have a different color for each compartment - Yellow where you have MORN, green where you have NOON, pink where you have EVE, and blue where you have BED.</li>
            <li>The compartments open easily and the days and times are marked clearly (and haven&#x27;t worn down).</li>
            <li>They open from left to right.</li>
            <li>I had one of the new ones because I could not find one like this and the compartments were always popping open and pills falling on the floor.</li>
            <li>The large size compartments hold all my pills without them being jammed together.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the basic clear.  </li>
            <li>to have the daily units and the holder having the weekday marked on both.  </li>
            <li>But the hinges on each of the little boxes is so flimsy that they break right away.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 4 large Medi-Chests a year and a half ago to compare them to the Medi-Planner II.  </li>
            <li>My only gripes are that the closure is very minimal, resulting in open compartments in my pockets sometimes, and that I had to pay as much to ship the darn thing as I did to buy it.</li>

            <li> But the hinges on each of the little boxes is so flimsy that they break right away.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 4 large Medi-Chests a year and a half ago to compare them to the Medi-Planner II.  </li>
            <li> My only gripes are that the closure is very minimal, resulting in open compartments in my pockets sometimes, and that I had to pay as much to ship the darn thing as I did to buy it.</li>
            <li> I outlined the arrow with a black sharpie, so far none have snapped off.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and will use them until they wear out which won&#x27;t be long.  </li>
            <li> You need long finger nails.</li>
            <li> The tops are a little hard to open at first --</li>
            <li> Some of the pill bin lids were broken shoddy construction for sure, did not want a replacement of this item.</li>
            <li> I bought one med and one large, the med was a little too small</li>
            <li> In the past, the aides would snap one off occasionally then tape it back on.  </li>
            <li> It will be harder to find a singular &amp;#34;Wed&amp;#34; than it was to find a single stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the lids do not close tightly so when I put a day in my purse, I must use a zip bag just in case.  </li>
            <li> It does its job well and has worked as expected with no problems.</li>
            <li> I know it wasn&#x27;t expensive, but come on, the first time?  </li>
            <li> and sometimes it sticks to the other compartments.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where they were on the other sticks, but also, it&#x27;s easier for a right-handed person to put pills into the compartments if the compartment opens on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the plastic is thin the hinges are thinner and won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> They still snap shut tightly and no compartments have lost their tops due to stress fatigue from opening and closing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> EITHER OF OURS BREAKS DOWN</li>
            <li> They all are difficult to open- this one is no different.</li>
            <li> I had a couple instances with the previous organizer where the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; broke and I needed to replace one stick.</li>

            <li> He sometimes gets confused by the &amp;#34;BED&amp;#34;, because his bedtime pills come from a different sorter altogether.</li>

            <li> That reminds me, if you do that and live in a humid climate, these compartments don&#x27;t seal as tightly as the smaller ones I&#x27;ve used the past 18 years since I got sick and started having to take medication.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice and big.  Opens easily</li>
            <li> The larger size allows easier use and ease of opening for my arthritic hands.  Convenient size for my many medications.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!  This is so cheap, the first time I opened the compartments to put pills in, some of the lids broke.  I know it wasn&#x27;t expensive, but come on, the first time?  It&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s just a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough for this pill box. The large size compartments hold all my pills without them being jammed together. Being able to take a days pills out and put it next to my chair or in my purse is a great asset. I had one of the new ones because I could not find one like this and the compartments were always popping open and pills falling on the floor. You had to pick up that big thing and tip it to get pills out. It was hard to fill. I am so thankful that I found this one. The compartments were too small and my gels got squashed. This is not only like my old one but better, the compartments are larger. I highly recommend this pill box and hope they keep on making them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced there is no perfect pill box for the elderly.  They all are difficult to open- this one is no different. If you find one that is easy to open they arent&#x27; large enough to handle the multitude of meds. I choose the snack baggies option</li>
            <li> These pill boxes are made with thin plastic.  The size is nice but the lids do not stay shut securely and will come open with handling and all your pills spill out.  Since the plastic is thin the hinges are thinner and won&#x27;t last long.  I ordered 2 of these and will use them until they wear out which won&#x27;t be long.  Next time I will pay more to get good quality.</li>
            <li> Good product but not as great since its hard to open the container and sometimes it sticks to the other compartments.  But for the price its a fair product.</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about this pill box is the ability to pull out each day&#x27;s pills.  It helps when you don&#x27;t have to carry the entire pill box with you when you go somewhere for a day.</li>
            <li> I got this to help organize my grandmother&#x27;s medications.  She was getting confused with all of them. This really helped her, she has commented how much she likes using it and she can just day one day out with her.  I think this one was the one that was pretty big,  holds those fish oil pills with no problem.  I bought one med and one large, the med was a little too small so I bought the large and its quite large.  I thought the med was a small size.</li>
            <li> Had to replace the wife&#x27;s medicine sort box for 11 pills&amp; vitamins taken through out the day.  Great feature  to have the daily units and the holder having the weekday marked on both.  Clear plastic  makes it easy to see that she&#x27;s taken the medicine. Most 4X7  setups are single units  don&#x27;t  permit pulling the day&#x27;s pill sets out -or - several if you go out  for the weekend.  Overall this  is a good , sturdy and effective item that should last  several years.</li>
            <li> The compartments are nice and big, which was primarily what I was looking for.  I take a pretty complete vitamin regemin, including thrice-a-day Flaxseed and CLA, which are very large pills.  This lets me carry a full days pills in one, compartamentalized container without a problem.  My only gripes are that the closure is very minimal, resulting in open compartments in my pockets sometimes, and that I had to pay as much to ship the darn thing as I did to buy it.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t have the blue tops -- it&#x27;s just the basic clear.  The tops are a little hard to open at first -- BUT after you&#x27;ve used it a little while they loosen up.  I do like being able to pull out dosage for a day and throw it in my purse if I&#x27;m going to be gone overnight.  I&#x27;d buy it again if this one got damaged or something.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I would buy again.  Con-The lid cover is difficult to pop open.  You need long finger nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 large Medi-Chests a year and a half ago to compare them to the Medi-Planner II.  As promised, I am publishing my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have met the test!  They still snap shut tightly and no compartments have lost their tops due to stress fatigue from opening and closing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as importantly, I can carry my plethora of cardiac, kidney, prostate and arthritis medications in one daily container when I go golfing, fishing, hunting or canoeing.  If a compartment does just happen to open, it sure beats trying to put a week&#x27;s worth of meds back in the right compartments!</li>
            <li> I had too many pills for my old smaller pill container.  This works great and will eliminate many problems in my life</li>
            <li> I love this product, my Mom has had trouble keeping up with her meds, this is perfect.  The compartments are a great size, for she has many meds and they all fit.  We liked it so much that I got two.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The plastic that holds the top to the base is too thin.  Two tops broke off the first time I opened them and I was very gentle.</li>
            <li> This is nice &amp; large.  Large enough for all my RXs &amp; vitamins and minerals.  The price was great as was the fast service.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s easy to fill and I love the fact that each day&#x27;s pill organizer can be removed to slip into your purse, etc., if you&#x27;re going to be away from home. It&#x27;s a good sized pill organizer, but given that it has 28 compartments, that&#x27;s to be expected. It does its job well and has worked as expected with no problems. The compartments open easily and the days and times are marked clearly (and haven&#x27;t worn down). Pretty pleased with this organizer!</li>
            <li> I already had one of these pill organizers and really wanted two more of the same. The containers I got were not like the one pictured. They do not open the same direction as the one pictured, nor like the one I have been using. As I am using this for someone with extreme memory loss consistency is important to him and me.</li>
            <li> Holds alot of pills. Days of week etc. In large print , also has brail.  Just an  excellent product</li>
            <li> While this organizer is a great idea, the plastic hinges on the compartments are very cheaply made. Upon arrival, three of the compartments had their hinges broken off, either before or during shipping. Amazon provided a replacement, but the hinges on the new one are breaking off, as well. When the hinge breaks, the pills go everywhere. There has to be a better quality choice out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and it has really helped him keep track of things. Big bonus that you can pop out the day to take with you!</li>
            <li> I love the size of this product.  That fact that words are raised are great.  But the hinges on each of the little boxes is so flimsy that they break right away.  If you can figure out how to use this without the covers, this is a great pill organizer for you.  For me it was a waste of money.  :-(</li>
            <li> On the first week of use, two of the hinged covers for pill compartments broke. I would not recommend it to anyone. I gave it one star only because I cannot pick zero star!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Fast easy transaction.  Great price, great seller.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product for those who really have a large amount of pills to manage (holds very large amount) or for those with dexterity problems (easier to handle).  Well made, quick ship, would buy again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> We bought two of these for a short trip we&#x27;re taking, only for a couple days. Having the four different times of day available was in</li>
            <li> Ours came clear white which was fine. Have used our first one for years. Was glad to find it again, and bought several for extra weeks and for family.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I take many pills. Was overflowing standard pillbox. Now 50percent of morning box available for growth.</li>
            <li> Works great, but some of the doors broke off right away.  I used scotch tape to make a new &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; for them.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that the compartments are roomy enough for my husbands meds. We had an organizer very similar, but smaller and his pills just keep getting bigger and more numerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the days of the week are across the top of the organizer AND on each pill stick as well. I had a couple instances with the previous organizer where the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; broke and I needed to replace one stick. It will be harder to find a singular &amp;#34;Wed&amp;#34; than it was to find a single stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I wish they had put the hinges on the left. That&#x27;s where they were on the other sticks, but also, it&#x27;s easier for a right-handed person to put pills into the compartments if the compartment opens on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it isn&#x27;t my ideal, but it&#x27;s big enough and nicely organized. The hinge looks sturdy, so I&#x27;m hopeful I won&#x27;t be replacing many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, my ideal sorter would have a different color for each compartment - Yellow where you have MORN, green where you have NOON, pink where you have EVE, and blue where you have BED. Skip the days of the week on the stick and forget the MORN, NOON, etc. labels. (My husband needs pills sorted into 5 times per day, so our 4 slots are for 7:00 am, 11:30 am, 3:00 pm, and 6:30 pm. He sometimes gets confused by the &amp;#34;BED&amp;#34;, because his bedtime pills come from a different sorter altogether. The colors would be easier for him to understand. Better yet, let me write on them myself.)</li>
            <li> This is the best pill box I&#x27;ve found so far for folks like my mom and me, who have to take a lot of medication. Very large compartments that fit everything, including doctor-ordered supplements/vitamins. Drawbacks are that the lids open backwards and they open up easily when you carry them around in your pocketbook, causing pills to spill everywhere. Big problem when you have to take so many meds. The backward-opening lids are especially a problem for my brain-injured mother, who still gets confused by them after two years using this brand of pill box. It&#x27;s still a pain for me, too, and I&#x27;m 20 years younger. But, still haven&#x27;t found anything this big that you can port with you daily after two years searching, so got some more of these so we could fill up our meds three weeks at a time. That reminds me, if you do that and live in a humid climate, these compartments don&#x27;t seal as tightly as the smaller ones I&#x27;ve used the past 18 years since I got sick and started having to take medication.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these sets and it works great. I use for vitamins and this way can put all of a days supply at one time in the medichest and not have to bother with the individual bottles of varies vitamins that I take.</li>
            <li> Like the bigger size, I can fit all my supplements.  I just use the daily boxes.  Don&#x27;t need the trays.</li>
            <li> Some of the pill bin lids were broken shoddy construction for sure, did not want a replacement of this item.</li>
            <li> The people I caregive for have tried several types of pill compartments, and for one of them this one works perfectly for what she needs. The size holds all of her meds and they are easier to fill. They open from left to right.</li>
            <li> THE MOST &amp;#34;USABLE &amp; VERSATILE&amp;#34; LARGE PILL CHEST I COULD HAVE EVER FOUND BY ACCIDENT!  10 YEARS AGO, I FOUND THIS TYPE OF PILL CONTAINER, IN A MAGAZINE, WHILE I WAS GOING THRU SOME &amp;#34;JUNK&amp;#34; MAIL OF MY MOM&#x27;S.  I PURCHASED ONE FOR MYSELF &amp; ONE FOR MY HUSBAND.  RECENTLY MY SON SAID HE CHECKED ALL OF THE PHARMACIES &amp; RETAILERS IN TOWN, BUT NO ONE HAD THE TYPE WITH THE &amp;#34;REMOVABLE&amp;#34; COMPARTMENTS.  I WENT TO AMAZON.COM, &amp; HAD SUCCESS!  I BOUGHT 3 NEW ONES, SO IF &amp; WHEN EITHER OF OURS BREAKS DOWN, WE HAVE AN EXTRA ON HAND.  THE 3RD ONE, I GAVE TO MY SON AS PART OF HIS BIRTHDAY GIFT.  HE WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED &amp; VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> Two months ago I purchased this for my Dad, he takes a lot of medications.  Perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $8.20.  Perfect price.&lt;br /&gt;I like that each compartment has an arrow so that my Dad&#x27;s home healthcare aides know which side to open up.  In the past, the aides would snap one off occasionally then tape it back on.  I outlined the arrow with a black sharpie, so far none have snapped off.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I like the removable days and large compartments.  The only problem is that the lids do not close tightly so when I put a day in my purse, I must use a zip bag just in case.  Once, one of the compartments opened in the bag.</li>
            <li> Love it; now I can sort all of my pills for a whole week no matter what size they are.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these to set up meds for more than a day at a time.  We like the size.  This replaces identical ones we purchased years ago.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product makes it very easy to help the parents set up their Meds and they love the fact that they can take one day meds with them and not the whole week worth</li>
