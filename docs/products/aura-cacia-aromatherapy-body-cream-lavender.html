            <li>This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found yet for treating dry skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing like soothing cool lavender cream to help aromatherapy yourself, your elbows hands and heels!</li>
            <li>It helps me to sleep easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;a special product that stands out in an already top line.  </li>
            <li>But it is better than the sickeningly sweet versions produced by companies like &amp;#34;Bath and Body Works&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this cream feels great and has such a strong smell of lavender</li>
            <li>I needed something with a pleasant but not overpowering natural fragrance and this will fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pure and the texture of my skin felt amazingly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I liked this so much that I bought it for my mother in law as well for her to have.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great</li>
            <li>so light it can be used anywhere, even on your facd</li>
            <li>This cream is light and goes on well with no greacy leftover feeling.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic......</li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy and not sticky or pasty like some.</li>
            <li>even if I don&#x27;t use it for my intended purpose, I know I will enjoy it myself as a hand cream.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed very quickly into the skin and let&#x27;s it breath.  </li>
            <li>I am happy that it is paraben free and uses 100% pure essential oil</li>
            <li>I bought the aura cacia room spray prior to this, and loved it as well.</li>
            <li>This lotion has same wonderful, clean lavender smell that I&#x27;ve come to expect from aura-cacia&#x27;s natural essential oil products, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lotion itself is really great.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorite items.</li>
            <li>My favorite ever has become a new nighttime ritual.  </li>
            <li>I use it often before bed and will definitely get more!</li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy and is quickly absorbed by your skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel my stress melt away, and my peace of mind envelope me in a lovely cloud of natural scent as I slather on this soothing cream;  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It manages to walk that really nice middle path where it&#x27;s creamy but not greasy, but also doesn&#x27;t have that eventual gummy aspect that a lot of the lighter Aveeno-type lotions have when you try to rub them in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs into your skin right away</li>
            <li>the feeling that you get from applying it to your feet is like a cool drink of water when you are very thirsty.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous types of hand creams, and this one is by far superior to all the others.</li>
            <li>Not very strong so for me is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Aura Cacia products never fail to please.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before even the color was different, more yellow-beige.  </li>
            <li>I think it has more shea butter, which I actually hate.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>and i am very selective!</li>
            <li>A real treat!  </li>
            <li>I love the Aura Cacia brand of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>When you apply the cream, the lavender scent is strong initially, but after the lotion is absorbed by the skin, it gives off an almost &amp;#34;glue-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is pure and so relaxing.  </li>
            <li>since I like their lavender pure oil).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and isn&#x27;t greasy either.</li>
            <li>This soothing cream which is so nicely absorbed, leaving soft, not greasy skin in</li>
            <li>, it is also buttery smooth and provides lasting nourishment to the skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing scent.</li>
            <li>Certainly not chemical free but better than a standard lotion.</li>
            <li>It has the most lovely relaxing smell, very subtle, and</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy an aromatherapy cream with a strong, pure lavender scent (not muddled with hints of vanilla or any other tones), so I gave this brand of cream a try (</li>
            <li>It helps their dry skin get silky smooth</li>
            <li>Smells great, and a little product goes a long way to leaving my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any lavender lover.</li>
            <li>This product smells as pure and natural as lying in a lavender field, sans the dirt and bugs....</li>
            <li>It has an intense lavender scent but does not smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li>I have found that a jar of this cream will last me a year (and it stays fresh until the bottom of the jar).</li>
            <li>I really like this as it has a nice lavender smell, but not overwhelming at the same time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the new lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>After using this productfor 14 days I have noticed a marked improvement!  </li>
            <li>Great fragrance, thick moisturizer---will not buy any other brand ever again!</li>
            <li>Soothing and soft.</li>
            <li>My young children use this now before bed instead if the johnsons bed time lotion.</li>
            <li>Aura Cacia has such a reputation for high quality and consistency that they&#x27;ve created&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, the lavender scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes (even when applying generously).</li>
            <li>i got used to the new formula or they changed it back</li>
            <li>all at such a reasonable price for such luxury.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone as long as they like the lavender scent.</li>
            <li>so dry skin has become a major problem - particularly during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I recommend Aura Catia products in general.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use during meditation at the end of practice (I teach yoga classes and like to dab a tiny dot of natural, aromatic balm or lotion on my students brow during meditation. )</li>
            <li>And Amazon&#x27;s prices are extremely reasonable compared to just about every other aromatherapy retailer I&#x27;ve deal with over the years.</li>
            <li>My skin looks shiny and not dry any longer.</li>
            <li>The lavender smell was an added bonus and made me feel like a queen, if only for 15 minutes, since I am a mother of 3 very busy school aged kids.</li>

            <li> I have found that a jar of this cream will last me a year (and it stays fresh until the bottom of the jar).</li>
            <li> I really like this as it has a nice lavender smell, but not overwhelming at the same time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the new lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> After using this productfor 14 days I have noticed a marked improvement!  </li>

            <li> Soothing and soft.</li>

            <li> Overall, the lavender scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes (even when applying generously).</li>
            <li> i got used to the new formula or they changed it back</li>
            <li> all at such a reasonable price for such luxury.</li>

            <li> so dry skin has become a major problem - particularly during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I recommend Aura Catia products in general.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use during meditation at the end of practice (I teach yoga classes and like to dab a tiny dot of natural, aromatic balm or lotion on my students brow during meditation. )</li>

            <li> The lavender smell was an added bonus and made me feel like a queen, if only for 15 minutes, since I am a mother of 3 very busy school aged kids.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked this so much that I bought it for my mother in law as well for her to have.  Very light on the skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It gets absorbed very quickly into the skin and let&#x27;s it breath.  My skin looks shiny and not dry any longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. Nice lavender scent. Certainly not chemical free but better than a standard lotion.</li>
            <li> This smells SO good~  It sinks into your skin and leaves no residue.  My skin feels soft and smells wonderful.  LOVE this and have ordered more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, true lavender fragrance !! Soothing and soft. I really love it !</li>
            <li> A must have for lovers of lavender!  The cream is not greasy and is quickly absorbed by your skin.  I&#x27;m in my fifties so dry skin has become a major problem - particularly during the winter months.  After using this productfor 14 days I have noticed a marked improvement!  And the scent is just heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Aura Acacia lavender lotion without reservation.  In fact, I recommend Aura Catia products in general.  And Amazon&#x27;s prices are extremely reasonable compared to just about every other aromatherapy retailer I&#x27;ve deal with over the years.</li>
            <li> I love this lavender cream better than any cream or lotion that I have ever tried.  I keep a jar on my bedside table, and every night before I turn out the lights, I rub in onto the bottoms of my feet.  It has the most lovely relaxing smell, very subtle, and the feeling that you get from applying it to your feet is like a cool drink of water when you are very thirsty. It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs into your skin right away so it won&#x27;t get on your sheets or clothes. I have found that a jar of this cream will last me a year (and it stays fresh until the bottom of the jar).</li>
            <li> Nothing like soothing cool lavender cream to help aromatherapy yourself, your elbows hands and heels!</li>
            <li> As I LOVE lavender, this was a great choice for me; it is hydrating and smells wonderful.  I use it along with the essential oil or a lavender spray.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have tried numerous types of hand creams, and this one is by far superior to all the others.</li>
            <li> soothing, wonderful scent</li>
            <li> A little while after applying this I found myself saying &amp;#34;I have not felt this relaxed in months.&amp;#34; My boyfriend replied, &amp;#34;maybe it&#x27;s the new lotion&amp;#34;. I think he&#x27;s 100% correct. I bought the aura cacia room spray prior to this, and loved it as well. When I have insomnia, I would spray it repeatedly and it&#x27;d put me to sleep.</li>
            <li> I really like this as it has a nice lavender smell, but not overwhelming at the same time. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and isn&#x27;t greasy either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body cream. A friend introduced me to it 3 or 4 years ago and I was immediately hooked. High quality. Smells wonderful. Have bought it over and over again for years now. I would highly recommend it to anyone as long as they like the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender scent and this rich, creamy skin treatment!  I need one tub at home and one more in my gym bag.  A great gift for my family and friends who love lavender as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, very calming, I use it at night  before bed time, this is the third time I order it and I will keep ordering</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  It helps me to sleep easy.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and a little product goes a long way to leaving my skin soft and silky. I use it after soaking my feet using &amp;#34;Purely Northwest Lavender Foot and Body Soak with Epsom Salt&amp;#34; this is the cherry on top for my once tired &amp; achy feet!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and  this cream smelt like lavender and actually moisten my hand, it stayed on without the greasy feel.  I am impressed.</li>
            <li> cured my eczema, been using for 5 years now and have had such relief from dry skin - induced eczema.  I have been using now for almost 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found yet for treating dry skin. It feels silky and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  But of course I knew that I would.  Aura Cacia products never fail to please.  This product smells as pure and natural as lying in a lavender field, sans the dirt and bugs....I feel my stress melt away, and my peace of mind envelope me in a lovely cloud of natural scent as I slather on this soothing cream;  This soothing cream which is so nicely absorbed, leaving soft, not greasy skin in it&#x27;s wake, facilitates relaxation, and makes me feel pampered....all at such a reasonable price for such luxury.</li>
            <li> This stuff is dreamy creamy and I love it! Does not leave a greasy feeling and skin nourishing.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells and feels amazing. I use this before going to sleep</li>
            <li> The scent from this product is glorious and the cream is so silky.  I absolutely LOVE it.  Goes a long way.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> By far the best body cream I have ever used - smells great and can see result within days.  I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I love lavender scent and the scent in this body cream is perfect so calming and relaxing.  I rub it all over at bedtime and am in a wonderful cocoon of relaxation. It is not greasy. I will definitely buy it again .</li>
            <li> My son has trouble sleeping at night, he is prescribed several things to take to help him sleep.  I decided I don&#x27;t like him taking all of those drugs and wanted to try something I know always helped me sleep when I needed it.  So I have been rubbing this on him at bedtime every night and he has stayed asleep longer on a regular basis! This has been going on for a couple of weeks. :) he also has eczema, and this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his skin at all. Try it!</li>
            <li> I use it often before bed and will definitely get more!</li>
            <li> Wonderful body cream :-0  Great fragrance, thick moisturizer---will not buy any other brand ever again!</li>
            <li> This cream feels great!!! My young children use this now before bed instead if the johnsons bed time lotion. It helps their dry skin get silky smooth and they sleep SO much better when they smell lavender all night. It is so calming and so moisturizing; not sticky or greasy. It has a fluffy feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorite items. I use it all the time before I go to bed and it instantly relaxes me. Not only does it smell great, it is also buttery smooth and provides lasting nourishment to the skin. The smell lasts a long time after application without being overpowering. It smells exactly like the pure essential oil I use for aromatherapy, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like fake chemicals at all. When I run out I will purchase again, but it&#x27;s a very big tub and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This body cream WAS great, but now they changed the ingredients, and i don&#x27;t like it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before even the color was different, more yellow-beige.  Now it is very white and smells different.  I think it has more shea butter, which I actually hate.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it smells of cheese or something similar.  I will endure using up the jar I have, but will not be buying anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was a bad batch? One cannot return it back to amazon as per policy ;//&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:&lt;br /&gt;either i got used to the new formula or they changed it back, i am not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i keep buying this lotion, have not found a better one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is the only thing i would use for my body cream. and i am very selective!</li>
            <li> Really good smell and moisturizes great</li>
            <li> I love this cream it smells wonderful. It has an intense lavender scent but does not smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li> Very soothing scent. Works well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great body cream! It smells excellent (just like natural lavender, yum!) and feels great on my skin. Shipping was a small issue though. I have Prime shipping but this item was delivered late...</li>
            <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to review this so I can keep it all to myself and it&#x27;ll never be out of stock. But if no one else buys it, it&#x27;ll be discontinued and then I&#x27;ll be extra sad.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. I bought it because I have always loved aura-cacia&#x27;s lavender room and pillow spray and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 15 years. This lotion has same wonderful, clean lavender smell that I&#x27;ve come to expect from aura-cacia&#x27;s natural essential oil products, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lotion itself is really great. It manages to walk that really nice middle path where it&#x27;s creamy but not greasy, but also doesn&#x27;t have that eventual gummy aspect that a lot of the lighter Aveeno-type lotions have when you try to rub them in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Well done. I&#x27;ve found my daily hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li> this cream feels great and has such a strong smell of lavender you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re in the garden.  so light it can be used anywhere, even on your facd</li>
            <li> Great quality cream that I would recommend for anyone looking for a thicker lotion-like body cream.  The lavender smell was an added bonus and made me feel like a queen, if only for 15 minutes, since I am a mother of 3 very busy school aged kids.</li>
            <li> Best body cream i have ever used! The ingredients are pure and the texture of my skin felt amazingly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Even bought some for my husband to use. The smell is lulling. LOVE It!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  The lavender scent is pure and so relaxing.  I even put some on my toddlers faces to help them sleep at nite.  Highly recommend for any lavender lover.</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia has such a reputation for high quality and consistency that they&#x27;ve created&lt;br /&gt;a special product that stands out in an already top line.  Wonderful addition to all my&lt;br /&gt;cremes.</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia Lavender, Aromatherapy Body Cream, 8-Ounce Jar smells really good.  This cream is light and goes on well with no greacy leftover feeling. I like it alot and love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> A real treat!  My favorite ever has become a new nighttime ritual.  I want to give this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love these lotions - all the scents! I use this one at night for the calming/soothing lavender effect.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells fantastic......</li>
            <li> Wonderful smooth lotion, delicious scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy an aromatherapy cream with a strong, pure lavender scent (not muddled with hints of vanilla or any other tones), so I gave this brand of cream a try (since I like their lavender pure oil). When you apply the cream, the lavender scent is strong initially, but after the lotion is absorbed by the skin, it gives off an almost &amp;#34;glue-like&amp;#34; scent and feels sticky on the skin. Overall, the lavender scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes (even when applying generously). But it is better than the sickeningly sweet versions produced by companies like &amp;#34;Bath and Body Works&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love lavender and just fell in love with this cream.  I love the Aura Cacia brand of essential oils.  Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I love all of Aura Cacia&#x27;s products. Their lotion is smooth, smells wonderful and makes my skin feel great. I have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy and not sticky or pasty like some. Not very strong so for me is a good thing. Goes on great and my skin feels moisturized..</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery and packaged perfectly. I bought this to use during meditation at the end of practice (I teach yoga classes and like to dab a tiny dot of natural, aromatic balm or lotion on my students brow during meditation. ) I needed something with a pleasant but not overpowering natural fragrance and this will fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am happy that it is paraben free and uses 100% pure essential oil but I&#x27;m a little offput by the long ingredient list, will need to dissect all the ingredients before sharing this with my class.  I have still given this 5 stars because it does smell wonderful and is luxurious feeling, goes on well and the smell does last, even if I don&#x27;t use it for my intended purpose, I know I will enjoy it myself as a hand cream.</li>
            <li> This lovely cream smells divine and goes on smoothly and feels great! I put it on my subscribe and save list!</li>
