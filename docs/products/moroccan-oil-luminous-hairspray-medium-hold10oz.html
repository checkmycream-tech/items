            <li>I take good care of my things and even tried soaking the spray head and cleaning it out.  </li>
            <li>I can not say if it works good or not.</li>
            <li>And it smells soooooo good.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t provide good hold.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE this hairspray because it smells great</li>
            <li>The smell is great and the way the product conditions your hair is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is the best product line right now.</li>
            <li>I tried it out and instead of having a beautiful smell like I Iove, it has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Love these Morroccan Oil Products!</li>
            <li>all time favorite!</li>
            <li>This spray is perfect with hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I paid $3 more (to include shipping) for x2 cans than buying this product at the hair salon!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I really liked it at the time,</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many people have mentioned how good the hairspray smells.</li>
            <li>The Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray Aero has a nice smell also.</li>
            <li>I use my heavier hairspray as I&#x27;m styling then use this at the very end as I&#x27;m getting to walk out the door, can&#x27;t beat the smell (it&#x27;s wonderful)</li>
            <li>I have ordered it many times and have loved it</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shine as well.  </li>
            <li>It has medium hold and is very easy to comb or brush through.</li>
            <li>nice and light!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells nice, and it&#x27;s not as drying as most hairsprays.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a refund quickly though which was great customer service on Amazon&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li>The mist is very fine, so you don&#x27;t get doused.</li>
            <li>Love love love this hairspray!  </li>
            <li>I like the hairspray, it has a great smell and very light, flexible hold which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The large size is great</li>
            <li>The smell is better than most too.  </li>
            <li>she says &#x27;i love this&#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li>told me to keep it glad</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Moroccan Oil products.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray,holds style,and no product build up.</li>
            <li>I love the hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love all the products by Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is best for those who want extra hold without the smell of hairspray!</li>
            <li>1st time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Ok, Glamazons, listen up.</li>
            <li>I like using this hairspray for a nice light hold.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve sent people here to grab it, told many a person and word of mouth must be earned, this stuff earns every word.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a shine spray than a hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the smell which is probably the reason I buy it.  </li>
            <li>If my sprayer would work better, I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hairspray, does not leave my hair feeling sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Better than arguing with Perfumes World.  </li>
            <li>Very nice hair spray, it holds where you want it to and smells really</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice hairspray, combats the frizz in my humid climate very well.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It smelled pretty darn good, but wait.  </li>
            <li>this hair spray has the perfect amount of hold without my hair getting crunchy or dry</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful, light fragrance and you actually can brush through your hair and still have control.</li>
            <li>Lighter hold than expected but perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>Creates a soft look and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and brushes right out.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairspray ... holds really well and has a wonderful light clean fragrant scent ... will continue to order it and recommend it highly</li>
            <li>but if you move it it gets knotted easy.</li>
            <li>If you want strong hold, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>I messed up and ordered the medium hold which I prefer the strong hold.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It was fine.  </li>
            <li>Hold is fine</li>
            <li>The smell is also a soft pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this hairspray keeps me hooked as well as its super hold!  </li>
            <li>The medium hold handles fly aways but doesn&#x27;t hold that strongly when you need that extra hold.  </li>
            <li>This hair spray has the best fragrance, hands down!  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing softly scented hairspray I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a cheap perfume from a drug store.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything!This one is smooth,</li>
            <li>light and hair looks fabulous!I had John Fried before</li>
            <li>It was so light and airy, like not having hairspray on at all.  </li>
            <li>It is a Fairly light spray-I like that .</li>
            <li>I was hoping for that fabulous Moroccan oil scent</li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found - it doesn&#x27;t get crunchy, is easy to brush through, and hardly feels like you&#x27;re wearing any.</li>
            <li>This spray had a good hold &amp; left some shine,  but the odor was way too strong.  </li>
            <li>The price of this hair spray may be a bit steep but the smell and touchability is well worth it!</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant and hair does not feel stiff.</li>
            <li>it smells good and does not dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price was just right!</li>
            <li>rather than a full wash, which seems to be required after I use the spray.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this product, and it works really well to keep my hair the way i want it</li>
            <li>Can was full but would not spray.  </li>
            <li>It also had  some sort of language that is not on true product.  </li>
            <li>Love the whole line of Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>The actual product of the hairspray is good but the sprayer stopped working quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am more impressed by the entire Moroccanoil line than I have ever been with any other hair product line!</li>
            <li>And the seller was extremely quick in getting the products to me--</li>
            <li>The hairspray left my hair still soft, and yet, still holds the shape beautifully.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised how many people like</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most amazing hairspray to hit the market.</li>
            <li>light hairspray, recommend for hair that doesn&#x27;t require much hairspray to keep a curl in.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can brush out my hair and create a more natural soft curl when I want.</li>
            <li>but give you a more natural styling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth it though.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice hold without feeling like regular hairspray.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a residue, smells great, but not a long lasting hold.</li>
            <li>This is not a typical hold the nozzle under hot water because one day it will spray great and the next not so much.  </li>
            <li>but the hair spray does not weigh my hair down and holds pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I am a very fickle person when it comes to product, too!</li>
            <li>I love all the morrocanoil products and I repurchase them constantly.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This was used on my hair for the first time at the salon</li>
            <li>It did the job of keeping down the fly always but looked and felt natural.  </li>
            <li>Good amount of hold even with my straight, fine hair that generally likes to revert back to its old ways within minutes of curling.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep loose curls/waves intact all day, it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Looking for the large M in the aqua bottle.</li>
            <li>but it is very highly scented...</li>
            <li>expected better Amazon, thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>the hairspray does not come out in a mist but with too much force.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like what I remembered from the salon; in fact it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything</li>
            <li>Could it really work?  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what that was until I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Dang</li>
            <li>Really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>It is now available in 3 different strengths.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray, however it has a tendency to not want to spray.  </li>
            <li>, it holds VERY well and has Morroccan oil in it</li>
            <li>Works better than any other spray that I have used for frizz.</li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my hair soft and shines all day long.  </li>
            <li>It goes on dry, is never sticky and it makes your hair small great.  </li>
            <li>I would order this product again and recommend it highly to orthers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered medium hold, should of ordered strong, as this is hold is not strong enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>it smells pretty strong and doesn&#x27;t really smell like other products of the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It will not leave your hair stiff like so many others.  </li>
            <li>Love the hold without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a huge force spray and range like you&#x27;d find in other brand hairsprays.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my curls from falling out and is very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more spendy than I usually go</li>
            <li>Since there is only ONE place in this city that I can go to, all the way on the other side of the city, to get this, being able to buy it online, and no charge for delivery with Prime...rocks.</li>
            <li>so it makes my hair really soft!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally spent a lot on hair care products;, mid-range at the super market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light</li>
            <li>and gives you a professional look.</li>
            <li>like to use organic moroccan argan essential oil straight from the bottle for added moisture and heat damage protection.  </li>
            <li>It costs four times what my old stuff used to cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>Wait until it drys completely before spraying again.</li>
            <li>hair softly.  </li>
            <li>But if you used to much, hair was left greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday; I put a curl former in my hair last night  and my hair is so curly and volumous this morning as if i used more than one curl former, and not stiff or crispy at all!!!!</li>
            <li>product itself is a light hold, not strong hold.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray has the perfect hold without being heavy or making my hair feel dirty.  </li>
            <li>Left white residue in my hair and very sticky would not buy again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and actually is one of the few that works...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, because it&#x27;s deemed hazardous, I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Spend some extra bucks and buy it directly from your local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair in place as well as does not dry it out or make it sticky.  </li>
            <li>I find it nauseating and am not normally overly sensitive to smells.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t provide good hold.  </li>
            <li> GOOD HAIRSPRAY!!&lt;br /&gt;HOLDS</li>
            <li> This spray could be a body cologne it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and the condtion of my hair after using this.  </li>
            <li> A light, shiny, wonderful smelling hold is what you get.  </li>
            <li> I like the light weight feel of this spray and the great shine it gives my hair!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product has great shine and the hold is very light and leaves hair touchable.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairspray because it smells great</li>
            <li> The smell is great and the way the product conditions your hair is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is the best product line right now.</li>
            <li> I tried it out and instead of having a beautiful smell like I Iove, it has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Love these Morroccan Oil Products!</li>
            <li> all time favorite!</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect with hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I paid $3 more (to include shipping) for x2 cans than buying this product at the hair salon!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I really liked it at the time,</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many people have mentioned how good the hairspray smells.</li>
            <li> The Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray Aero has a nice smell also.</li>
            <li> I use my heavier hairspray as I&#x27;m styling then use this at the very end as I&#x27;m getting to walk out the door, can&#x27;t beat the smell (it&#x27;s wonderful)</li>
            <li> I have ordered it many times and have loved it</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shine as well.  </li>
            <li> It has medium hold and is very easy to comb or brush through.</li>
            <li> nice and light!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells nice, and it&#x27;s not as drying as most hairsprays.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a refund quickly though which was great customer service on Amazon&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> The mist is very fine, so you don&#x27;t get doused.</li>
            <li> Love love love this hairspray!  </li>
            <li> I like the hairspray, it has a great smell and very light, flexible hold which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The large size is great</li>
            <li> The smell is better than most too.  </li>
            <li> she says &#x27;i love this&#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li> told me to keep it glad</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Moroccan Oil products.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray,holds style,and no product build up.</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love all the products by Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is best for those who want extra hold without the smell of hairspray!</li>
            <li> 1st time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Ok, Glamazons, listen up.</li>
            <li> I like using this hairspray for a nice light hold.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve sent people here to grab it, told many a person and word of mouth must be earned, this stuff earns every word.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a shine spray than a hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the smell which is probably the reason I buy it.  </li>
            <li> If my sprayer would work better, I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray, does not leave my hair feeling sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Better than arguing with Perfumes World.  </li>
            <li> Very nice hair spray, it holds where you want it to and smells really</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice hairspray, combats the frizz in my humid climate very well.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It smelled pretty darn good, but wait.  </li>
            <li> this hair spray has the perfect amount of hold without my hair getting crunchy or dry</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, light fragrance and you actually can brush through your hair and still have control.</li>
            <li> Lighter hold than expected but perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Creates a soft look and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and brushes right out.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairspray ... holds really well and has a wonderful light clean fragrant scent ... will continue to order it and recommend it highly</li>
            <li> but if you move it it gets knotted easy.</li>
            <li> If you want strong hold, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I messed up and ordered the medium hold which I prefer the strong hold.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> It was fine.  </li>
            <li> Hold is fine</li>
            <li> The smell is also a soft pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this hairspray keeps me hooked as well as its super hold!  </li>
            <li> The medium hold handles fly aways but doesn&#x27;t hold that strongly when you need that extra hold.  </li>
            <li> This hair spray has the best fragrance, hands down!  </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing softly scented hairspray I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a cheap perfume from a drug store.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything!This one is smooth,</li>
            <li> light and hair looks fabulous!I had John Fried before</li>
            <li> It was so light and airy, like not having hairspray on at all.  </li>
            <li> It is a Fairly light spray-I like that .</li>
            <li> I was hoping for that fabulous Moroccan oil scent</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found - it doesn&#x27;t get crunchy, is easy to brush through, and hardly feels like you&#x27;re wearing any.</li>
            <li> This spray had a good hold &amp; left some shine,  but the odor was way too strong.  </li>
            <li> The price of this hair spray may be a bit steep but the smell and touchability is well worth it!</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant and hair does not feel stiff.</li>
            <li> it smells good and does not dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price was just right!</li>
            <li> rather than a full wash, which seems to be required after I use the spray.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this product, and it works really well to keep my hair the way i want it</li>
            <li> Can was full but would not spray.  </li>
            <li> It also had  some sort of language that is not on true product.  </li>
            <li> Love the whole line of Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> The actual product of the hairspray is good but the sprayer stopped working quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am more impressed by the entire Moroccanoil line than I have ever been with any other hair product line!</li>
            <li> And the seller was extremely quick in getting the products to me--</li>
            <li> The hairspray left my hair still soft, and yet, still holds the shape beautifully.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised how many people like</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most amazing hairspray to hit the market.</li>
            <li> light hairspray, recommend for hair that doesn&#x27;t require much hairspray to keep a curl in.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can brush out my hair and create a more natural soft curl when I want.</li>
            <li> but give you a more natural styling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth it though.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice hold without feeling like regular hairspray.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a residue, smells great, but not a long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> This is not a typical hold the nozzle under hot water because one day it will spray great and the next not so much.  </li>
            <li> but the hair spray does not weigh my hair down and holds pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I am a very fickle person when it comes to product, too!</li>
            <li> I love all the morrocanoil products and I repurchase them constantly.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This was used on my hair for the first time at the salon</li>
            <li> It did the job of keeping down the fly always but looked and felt natural.  </li>
            <li> Good amount of hold even with my straight, fine hair that generally likes to revert back to its old ways within minutes of curling.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep loose curls/waves intact all day, it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Looking for the large M in the aqua bottle.</li>
            <li> but it is very highly scented...</li>
            <li> expected better Amazon, thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> the hairspray does not come out in a mist but with too much force.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like what I remembered from the salon; in fact it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything</li>
            <li> Could it really work?  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what that was until I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Dang</li>
            <li> Really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> It is now available in 3 different strengths.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray, however it has a tendency to not want to spray.  </li>
            <li> , it holds VERY well and has Morroccan oil in it</li>
            <li> Works better than any other spray that I have used for frizz.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair soft and shines all day long.  </li>
            <li> It goes on dry, is never sticky and it makes your hair small great.  </li>
            <li> I would order this product again and recommend it highly to orthers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered medium hold, should of ordered strong, as this is hold is not strong enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty strong and doesn&#x27;t really smell like other products of the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It will not leave your hair stiff like so many others.  </li>
            <li> Love the hold without being stiff.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a huge force spray and range like you&#x27;d find in other brand hairsprays.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my curls from falling out and is very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more spendy than I usually go</li>
            <li> Since there is only ONE place in this city that I can go to, all the way on the other side of the city, to get this, being able to buy it online, and no charge for delivery with Prime...rocks.</li>
            <li> so it makes my hair really soft!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally spent a lot on hair care products;, mid-range at the super market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light</li>
            <li> and gives you a professional look.</li>
            <li> like to use organic moroccan argan essential oil straight from the bottle for added moisture and heat damage protection.  </li>
            <li> It costs four times what my old stuff used to cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smell</li>
            <li> Wait until it drys completely before spraying again.</li>
            <li> hair softly.  </li>
            <li> But if you used to much, hair was left greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday; I put a curl former in my hair last night  and my hair is so curly and volumous this morning as if i used more than one curl former, and not stiff or crispy at all!!!!</li>
            <li> product itself is a light hold, not strong hold.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray has the perfect hold without being heavy or making my hair feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> Left white residue in my hair and very sticky would not buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and actually is one of the few that works...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because it&#x27;s deemed hazardous, I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Spend some extra bucks and buy it directly from your local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair in place as well as does not dry it out or make it sticky.  </li>
            <li> I find it nauseating and am not normally overly sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> This makes your hair flat.</li>
            <li> not really a stiff hold at all, for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair - this does not weigh it down or dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped it would help my dry hair</li>
            <li> I recommend it along with all of the Aveda Moroccan Oil products for curing your dry hair woes.</li>
            <li> The finish is firm, but pliable, but my hair needs to be totally washed the next day.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for concrete hard hold, this is NOT the hairspray for you.</li>
            <li> She had a familiarization from her stylist, and came here to grab some, she uses this when straightening and placing a single curl, or two, at the bottom...</li>
            <li> This may not matter to a younger woman who washes her hair everyday anyway.</li>
            <li> but does not give the shine I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less toxic than this hairspray and it is available from other less expensive suppliers.</li>
            <li> but this is soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the other reviewers regarding the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down .....</li>
            <li> Not very strong hold</li>
            <li> Product is not original.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a hairspray otherwise and, without it, my hair is refreshable each morning with a little water and blowdry...</li>
            <li> a little pricey for not holding well.</li>
            <li> I always use it as a finishing spray and sometimes even just to add a little texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and prefer to not wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Note: none are really firm......</li>
            <li> I use the firm hold for everything.</li>
            <li> If you want firm hold, you will have to layer this product on.</li>
            <li> It is a firm hold</li>
            <li> This clogs up every time you use it and just plain stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> After less than 10 uses no more hair spray would come out.</li>
            <li> It also holds your style without making it feel stiff.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, nor does it leave hair feeling or looking stiff.</li>
            <li> Anyone want a very slightly used hairspray?</li>
            <li> so I usually use a lighter hold spray, but this one is not very effective.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, leaves your hair feeling sticky and terrible.</li>
            <li> Not sure of spelling.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is going on with this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissapointed and not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> but hair is dull.</li>
            <li> Have purchased a couple of cans since it is less expensive than in the salon.  </li>
            <li> I hate hair spray because it always make my hair hard, tangled, and dry.</li>
            <li> Even worse, after using, I have to use deep-cleansing shampoo just to wash it out.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even real Moroccan oil hair spray, it&#x27;s a can of knock off crap!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it just gunks up with regular shampoo and leaves a nasty coating on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this was fake product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in a level of product like this that would use a poor quality of spray bottle.</li>
            <li> One thing that was disappointing was that it was shipped in a padded envelope.  </li>
            <li> It lasted for hours and was an unpleasant odor to me.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is bad.</li>
            <li> but if i cant get it out its worthless</li>
            <li> Sticky and smells bad!  </li>
            <li> I think it smells terrible and is overly fragrant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really horrible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use this all the time...highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The actual product of the hairspray is good but the sprayer stopped working quickly.  I take good care of my things and even tried soaking the spray head and cleaning it out.  It never worked again.  Disappointed in a level of product like this that would use a poor quality of spray bottle.</li>
            <li> my go-to hairspray for over 5 years. I am a very fickle person when it comes to product, too!</li>
            <li> I am more impressed by the entire Moroccanoil line than I have ever been with any other hair product line!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray ... holds really well and has a wonderful light clean fragrant scent ... will continue to order it and recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Perfect hold... Smells good... Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I don&#x27;t need anyhing from an hairspray so i&#x27;ll stick to this one.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist.  The product worked wonderfully on my hair and it smells amazing.  I would order this product again and recommend it highly to orthers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Product Customer</li>
            <li> This hairspray has the perfect hold without being heavy or making my hair feel dirty.  The smell is better than most too.  I will continue to use this hairspray!</li>
            <li> to reorder this product for her and my daughter.......she says &#x27;i love this&#x27; &#x27;it is just perfect&#x27; &#x27;the smell is great&#x27;............</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and arrived in a timely fashion with no dents!</li>
            <li> my daughter left a can at my home on her vacation!she told me to keep it glad i did!thanks lisa!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found - it doesn&#x27;t get crunchy, is easy to brush through, and hardly feels like you&#x27;re wearing any. Good amount of hold even with my straight, fine hair that generally likes to revert back to its old ways within minutes of curling.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was introduced to the oil - which I use ever day.  I have fine, thin hair - this does not weigh it down or dry it out.  My hair is so soft!  One thing that was disappointing was that it was shipped in a padded envelope.  The cap was in severral pieces by the time it got to me, thankfully the spray nozzle was in tact and working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not very strong hold but give you a more natural styling.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! Product is not original. Came with chinese writing all over the bottle. Spend some extra bucks and buy it directly from your local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the level of hold... and the scent is very nice... but it is very highly scented... so beware!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It will not leave your hair stiff like so many others.  Your hair will still move.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Moroccan Oil products.  They make my hair shiny and manageable.  Wonderful hair care!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair spray, it holds where you want it to and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light and it adds  some shine. Keeps the fly-aways&lt;br /&gt;away and gives you a professional look. Love these Morroccan Oil Products!</li>
            <li> I use this after blowing out my dyed hair (I&#x27;m all grey/white) with Moroccanoil mouse and curling cream, when I know I&#x27;ll be outdoors a lot or want to stay perfect for the evening. The finish is firm, but pliable, but my hair needs to be totally washed the next day. This is why I say that I use it occasionally. I don&#x27;t need a hairspray otherwise and, without it, my hair is refreshable each morning with a little water and blowdry...rather than a full wash, which seems to be required after I use the spray. I&#x27;m 60 and prefer to not wash my hair everyday. This may not matter to a younger woman who washes her hair everyday anyway. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice hairspray, combats the frizz in my humid climate very well. I do like how the Moroccanoil products work well together. And the seller was extremely quick in getting the products to me-- I also bought the mousse from them.</li>
            <li> the hairspray does not come out in a mist but with too much force.  my hair gets drenched and soaked and is dripping hair spray......</li>
            <li> I am a lover of Argan oil and a lover of the Moroccan Oil line. This product has great shine and the hold is very light and leaves hair touchable.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the other reviewers regarding the fragrance.  I think it smells terrible and is overly fragrant.  It&#x27;s like a cheap perfume from a drug store.  I find it nauseating and am not normally overly sensitive to smells.  I am very surprised how many people like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a light hold, not strong hold.  I&#x27;ve found cheaper hair sprays that work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use organic moroccan argan essential oil straight from the bottle for added moisture and heat damage protection.  It&#x27;s much less toxic than this hairspray and it is available from other less expensive suppliers.</li>
            <li> Love the great holding power plus the wonderful fragrance of Moroccanoil.  No competing smells like when using another brand of hairspray.</li>
            <li> all time favorite! I love all the morrocanoil products and I repurchase them constantly. this hair spray has the perfect amount of hold without my hair getting crunchy or dry</li>
            <li> Hair spray will not come  out. I can not say if it works good or not. I think they shouldvtest it before sending.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. It has medium hold and is very easy to comb or brush through. If you want strong hold, this is not the product for you. It also smells wonderful, unlike so many hairsprays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally spent a lot on hair care products;, mid-range at the super market. While traveling I had forgot my hairspray so when visiting a salon with my mom I grabbed a travel size of the Moroccanoil that they had on the counter, I loved it! It did the job of keeping down the fly always but looked and felt natural.  It&#x27;s more spendy than I usually go but I don&#x27;t use a lot so I it will last me several months.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, leaves your hair feeling sticky and terrible. Keeps a curl but if you move it it gets knotted easy.</li>
            <li> This is my second can.  Love the hold without being stiff.  And it smells soooooo good.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky either.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would help my dry hair but my allergies said no.  Anyone want a very slightly used hairspray?</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray,holds style,and no product build up. The smell is very pleasant and hair does not feel stiff.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing softly scented hairspray I have ever bought. It is heavenly! It is a great flexible hold spray.</li>
            <li> Left white residue in my hair and very sticky would not buy again</li>
            <li> This hair spray has the best fragrance, hands down!  The mist is very fine, so you don&#x27;t get doused.</li>
            <li> This clogs up every time you use it and just plain stopped working after a few uses. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down .....nice and light! Would recommend to those that don&#x27;t like hairspray!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is the best product line right now. I love the hairspray. Since there is only ONE place in this city that I can go to, all the way on the other side of the city, to get this, being able to buy it online, and no charge for delivery with Prime...rocks.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair soft and shines all day long.  The smell is also a soft pleasant smell.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky at all and I&#x27;ll be purchasing some more!! ;)</li>
            <li> The hairspray left my hair still soft, and yet, still holds the shape beautifully. It also kept the hair moist.  I love all the products by Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> I use the oil but this stuff is bad. Oil works great. This makes your hair flat. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This spray had a good hold &amp; left some shine,  but the odor was way too strong.  It lasted for hours and was an unpleasant odor to me.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is the best for hair care in ALL their products.  The smell of this hairspray keeps me hooked as well as its super hold!  It&#x27;s my favorite.  Been using for about 5 years.  I put some on today because the winds were wicked here in the Midwest.</li>
            <li> Lighter hold than expected but perfect for my needs. Creates a soft look and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything!This one is smooth,light and hair looks fabulous!I had John Fried before and it was sticky,smelly and made my scalp dry!Now i found best hairspray for me!</li>
            <li> After less than 10 uses no more hair spray would come out. The sprayer is not clogged. This is simply a defective bottle. I would be cautious purchasing this product from this supplier.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this product, and it works really well to keep my hair the way i want it</li>
            <li> This was used on my hair for the first time at the salon and I really liked it at the time, but now I&#x27;m not so impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like what I remembered from the salon; in fact it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything and it doesn&#x27;t provide good hold.  I have fine hair so I usually use a lighter hold spray, but this one is not very effective.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - works good and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used drugstore brands of hairspray.  It was fine.  Then my hairdresser used this.  My goodness.  It smelled pretty darn good, but wait.  It was so light and airy, like not having hairspray on at all.  Could it really work?  Yes!  I have very short hair, and do NOT want helmet hair.  I&#x27;ve always gone for the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hold spray.  I didn&#x27;t really know what that was until I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Dang it though.  It costs four times what my old stuff used to cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it though.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>
            <li> This is best for those who want extra hold without the smell of hairspray! It is gentle and smells amazing! It also holds your style without making it feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Very good hair spray but does not give the shine I expected. Hold is fine but hair is dull.</li>
            <li> 1st time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I love it.  Great smell, non sticky hair product!</li>
            <li> GOOD HAIRSPRAY!!&lt;br /&gt;HOLDS AND SHINES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY ENOUGH</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most amazing hairspray to hit the market. It is not sticky, nor does it leave hair feeling or looking stiff. Not only does it keep loose curls/waves intact all day, it smells AMAZING! I cannot tell you how many people have mentioned how good the hairspray smells. I have recommended this hairspray to everyone I know and they&#x27;re all hooked!</li>
            <li> This spray could be a body cologne it smells so good.  that said, it does not hold my style well but I use it before I curling iron my hair instead...a little pricey for not holding well.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is great if you don&#x27;t want that &amp;#34;helmet-hair&amp;#34; feeling.  The large size is great so you don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The smell alone keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> Good stuff......Recommend for you</li>
            <li> Works better than any other spray that I have used for frizz. Have curly hair. Really like the scent.  I am sensitive to smell but this is soft and subtle.  Reminds me of a product that is no longer around made by Jirmack?  Not sure of spelling.</li>
            <li> Works good and smells great too!</li>
            <li> JUST ENOUGH LIFT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOUR HAIR TOO STIFF.&lt;br /&gt;THE HOLD IS PERFECT FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THE SMELL IT&#x27;S YUMMY</li>
            <li> Ok, Glamazons, listen up. If you can afford this hairspray, get it. It is now available in 3 different strengths. Note: none are really firm......I use the firm hold for everything. If you are looking for concrete hard hold, this is NOT the hairspray for you. It&#x27;s not sticky, it smells nice, and it&#x27;s not as drying as most hairsprays. If you want firm hold, you will have to layer this product on. Wait until it drys completely before spraying again. Until next time, smoochie smooch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro, Glamour Couture</li>
            <li> Este producto me ha ayudado muchísimo para darle brillo a mi cabello. Realmente es buenísimo y se lo recomendaría a cualquier persona!</li>
            <li> It is a Fairly light spray-I like that . I was hoping for that fabulous Moroccan oil scent but it&#x27;s not there</li>
            <li> I ordered medium hold, should of ordered strong, as this is hold is not strong enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like using this hairspray for a nice light hold.  The Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray Aero has a nice smell also.</li>
            <li> light hairspray, recommend for hair that doesn&#x27;t require much hairspray to keep a curl in.  I use my heavier hairspray as I&#x27;m styling then use this at the very end as I&#x27;m getting to walk out the door, can&#x27;t beat the smell (it&#x27;s wonderful)</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissapointed and not happy with this product. I have ordered it many times and have loved it but this time it came with another language all over the bottle. This alerted me that it may not be the same product I have been using. I tried it out and instead of having a beautiful smell like I Iove, it has a strong chemical smell. I was definitely ripped off!</li>
            <li> So I was able to use this product for about 2 weeks and then the spraying mechanism failed and it is not working at all.  I have tried all sorts of tricks nothing works and my hairdresser said that the bottle is banged up and that may have caused the malfunction.  I loke th product alot but if i cant get it out its worthless</li>
            <li> She had a familiarization from her stylist, and came here to grab some, she uses this when straightening and placing a single curl, or two, at the bottom... it keeps it&#x27;s hold, but not really a stiff hold at all, for a few days. We&#x27;ve sent people here to grab it, told many a person and word of mouth must be earned, this stuff earns every word.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect with hot rollers. It keeps my curls from falling out and is very soft to the touch. I love that I can brush out my hair and create a more natural soft curl when I want.</li>
            <li> Did not work.  Can was full but would not spray.  The nozzle did not appear to be clogged.  Just in case though I took it off, cleaned it, and still it would not work.  I was able to get a refund quickly though which was great customer service on Amazon&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> Have purchased a couple of cans since it is less expensive than in the salon.  The product is absolutely wonderful.  Holds&lt;br /&gt;your hair softly.  Never sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product..great quality</li>
            <li> This product is more of a shine spray than a hairspray.  It didn&#x27;t have any holding power at all but I did notice it seemed to make my hair shinny.  But if you used to much, hair was left greasy looking.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and the condtion of my hair after using this.  Only drawback wa that the nozzle seems to get clogged alot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actress and I just filmed a commercial where they used this on my hair. I hate hair spray because it always make my hair hard, tangled, and dry.This did none of the above.. I have relaxed, bleached, colored african american 4a hair. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday; I put a curl former in my hair last night  and my hair is so curly and volumous this morning as if i used more than one curl former, and not stiff or crispy at all!!!! Love this stuff. Wish they sold it in more places!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest hairspray, it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray, however it has a tendency to not want to spray.  This is not a typical hold the nozzle under hot water because one day it will spray great and the next not so much.  Not sure what is going on with this but the hair spray does not weigh my hair down and holds pretty good.  Does not leave my neck feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Love love love this hairspray!  It&#x27;s light and actually is one of the few that works...</li>
            <li> I paid $3 more (to include shipping) for x2 cans than buying this product at the hair salon! I LOVE this hairspray because it smells great, it holds VERY well and has Morroccan oil in it so it makes my hair really soft!  AND the BEST part is I get TWO cans for just about the price of ONE!!  AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is perfect!  It gives softness and hold at the same time!  I always use it as a finishing spray and sometimes even just to add a little texture.  And the smell is great too!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It has a nice hold without feeling like regular hairspray. I highly recommend this product. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair spray.  It goes on dry, is never sticky and it makes your hair small great.  I recommend it along with all of the Aveda Moroccan Oil products for curing your dry hair woes.</li>
            <li> I messed up and ordered the medium hold which I prefer the strong hold.  I always come back to this hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t gunk up in your hair.  The medium hold handles fly aways but doesn&#x27;t hold that strongly when you need that extra hold.  I love the smell which is probably the reason I buy it.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the hairspray, it has a great smell and very light, flexible hold which is exactly what I wanted.  It gives a nice shine as well.  The only downfall, and it may be just the bottle I got, but it does not spray well at all.  I have to continually work with it to get it to spray.  Don&#x27;t expect a huge force spray and range like you&#x27;d find in other brand hairsprays.  This has morracan oil in it and it is not meant to &#x27;stiffen&#x27; your hair.  A light, shiny, wonderful smelling hold is what you get.  If my sprayer would work better, I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The price of this hair spray may be a bit steep but the smell and touchability is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Came on time and it was just what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Quality hair spray that doesn&#x27;t feel like hair spray!....Also, the price was just right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the best hair spray ever!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair sprays on the market. It has a wonderful, light fragrance and you actually can brush through your hair and still have control.</li>
            <li> I use it to control fly-aways and it does a great job.  It smells nice and brushes right out.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sticky and smells bad!  Even worse, after using, I have to use deep-cleansing shampoo just to wash it out.  Otherwise, it just gunks up with regular shampoo and leaves a nasty coating on my hair.  It&#x27;s really horrible!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray, does not leave my hair feeling sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Will NEVER order from Perfumes World again.  I believe that this was fake product.  When I looked at the hairspray, I noticed that it looked similar but brand name  and icon didn&#x27;t match Maroccanoil product.  It also had  some sort of language that is not on true product.  Trying to return it was a hopeless nightmare.  I finally gave up and had to keep it.  Better than arguing with Perfumes World.  DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THEM !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to write a report.. I will give a star rating. If I like the product you will get a 5 star. If Im not pleased you will get les than 5 stars</li>
            <li> I like the light weight feel of this spray and the great shine it gives my hair! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> It is a firm hold and I wanted a medium hold and it has a completely different smell.  I will check next time to see the firmness</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even real Moroccan oil hair spray, it&#x27;s a can of knock off crap! Unfortunately, because it&#x27;s deemed hazardous, I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I expected better Amazon, thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a residue, smells great, but not a long lasting hold. Smell is tropical.</li>
            <li> Love the whole line of Moroccanoil. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the imatations out there. Looking for the large M in the aqua bottle. The smell is great and the way the product conditions your hair is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. it smells pretty strong and doesn&#x27;t really smell like other products of the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love it! it smells good and does not dry your hair.  I love it! is awesome product... the best!</li>
            <li> Luv just wish was cheaper</li>
            <li> Great product, was delivered on time</li>
            <li> Tried this at my daughter&#x27;s and knew I needed to get it!  It keeps my hair in place as well as does not dry it out or make it sticky.  Great product!</li>
