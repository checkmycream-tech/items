            <li>However, I bet it will be really nice in my brown sugar-vanilla body scrub</li>
            <li>Upon opening this oil, it was very strong.</li>
            <li>I liked it for the purity, and when I put lemon, orange, and about 6 drops of this in my diffuser, I am in love.</li>

            <li>lovely essence.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent, but have issue with the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this smell .  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of vanilla.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find more scents to use.</li>
            <li>Anyways,  to conclude,  I should have probably done more research before hand</li>
            <li>I love the smell of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>The texture was wierd, not like most oils I get.</li>
            <li>This vanilla is SO much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The others have lovely scents...</li>
            <li>No complaints :)</li>
            <li>My favorite smell in Vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Plant Therapy always has such excellent products.</li>
            <li>This company has high quality oils, they test each batch and they are a great value.</li>
            <li>I used it in my essential oil warmer (lit with a tea-light candle), and it has a very pleasant and calming aroma.  </li>
            <li>Super nice oil.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, however, bear in mind when ordering that it is brown in color...not clear.  </li>
            <li>Smell is wonderful and just what I expected!</li>
            <li>Came very quickly, too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really strong vanilla.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and smells just like vanilla.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and nice smell</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product and company, received quickly, and was the first time I had used essential oils, good experience will purchase again!</li>
            <li>My essential oil warmer holds about one ounce of liquid, and I added about 7 drops of oil to produce a very nice smell that filled the room.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, I love mixing it with a few drops of lavender oil for my bath.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am a very strong advocate of essential oils &amp; purchase most of them from amazon.</li>
            <li>so therfore your not going to get a sweet smell like a fragrance oil or the villa</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company.</li>
            <li>I used the Vanilla oil when I made some lotion bars, when you rub the bar over your skin, it smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>It will only be &#x27;too strong&#x27; if you do not dilute it, and when you dilute it the strong scent dissipates and the lovely vanilla is there.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a potent scent from the essential oil.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect it come streaming out as quickly as it did.  </li>
            <li>I am just writing this review to possibly help out others who would think vanilla would be a wonderful idea and make the same mistake as me.</li>
            <li>I would not buy again, I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem buying from the company again as the shipping was quick, I just didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>This is my second order from Plant Therapy Essential Oils, and I have been very happy with both orders.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly, and it was packaged very well, in both bubble wrap and padded packaging - -</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and wonderful, but the color and texture is weird.  </li>
            <li>With so many modifications to the products on the market today,  people aren&#x27;t used to  the natural  essence  of products.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend wanted some oils because he&#x27;s a massage therapist &amp; makes his own essential oils and this oil did the job</li>
            <li>To get the best use of this...is to use it in a diffuser mixed with other oils or in body care preparations.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with other oils but believe this one was very deleted ( water &amp; color) did NOT smell like vanilla at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with its original seal in tact, which is also very important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little of a sweeter smell, but once you mix it into whatever you are using it in it smells really good.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, I&#x27;d never used vanilla essential oil before</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>This essential oil smells more like the vanilla extract does in your spice cabinet.</li>
            <li>Seems almost exactly like the vanilla extract I have in my kitchen pantry, but thicker.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very relaxed right now as I diffuse this vanilla in my room.</li>
            <li>Mixes nicely with other oils.</li>
            <li>The Great Value Vanilla Cooking Extract from walmart smells better, but was instantly reminded of such a thing that went sour.</li>
            <li>If people would do their research before purchasing certain oils</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li>It smells like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>It has the pure scent that real vanilla has.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this oil yet, but I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between the scent of it and my pure vanilla extract on my baking shelf...</li>
            <li>While it DOES smell VERY good, it is absolutely useless to me unless I change my recipe to one that is water based or includes water.</li>
            <li>This is a vanilla absolute.</li>
            <li>Pours out fast..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use much so it didn&#x27;t tint the balm too much, but just keep this in mind when ordering.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was received in a very timely fashion and well packaged.</li>
            <li>&quot; I think I paid too much now.</li>
            <li>It smells almost exactly like vanilla extract, not quite that warm floral vanilla scent, but this price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>but they seem to have high quality products for better than average prices.</li>
            <li>I did not care for the scent of this oil right out of the bottle, it had a very strong, almost wood-alcohol odor, it wasn&#x27;t until I blended small amounts with other oils such as Ylang Ylang and Mandarin that the true, sweet vanilla scent came through.  </li>
            <li>Pure 100% natural oil.</li>
            <li>It is definitely pure vanilla, and isn&#x27;t a synthetic fragrance oil like most of these negative reviews are really expecting.</li>
            <li>opened the item, and the dark brown liquid has the aroma of a strong vanilla extract.  </li>
            <li>I have done extensive research on oils because I am a cancer survivor and only want to use unadulterated high quality products.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it for a few days prior to writing a review  - - to see if I liked the item.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think about this when ordering, but I use for my line of natural lip balms, and I would prefer them to not have a color to them.  </li>
            <li>it has a natural vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I think this &#x27;essential oil&#x27; is really just a carrier oil added vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>You can buy a bottle of vanilla extract much cheaper at the grocery store and that is definitely what I received in my package!</li>
            <li>Soft vanilla scent, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Received broken and unusable,  made the box&#x27;s smell nice</li>
            <li>I make my own deodorant and wanted to mix up a vanilla lavendar blend, and the vanilla always separates and leaves little black spheres in the mix.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant buying this because some of the other reviewers said it smelled funny.</li>
            <li>It has a deep rich scent - not overly sweet like fake vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>This is a little heavy than I expected, but it is a good product</li>
            <li>If u read the description above it clearly states it&#x27;s extraction method.</li>
            <li>This is all natural just like an essential oil</li>
            <li>Not really as I expected.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s dark, like vanilla extract used in baking.</li>
            <li>Second, the scent completely disappeared when I added it to my soap recipe.</li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;relax\\&quot; essential oil by the same company a few weeks ago and it was exactly what I was wanting.</li>

            <li> &quot; I think I paid too much now.</li>
            <li> It smells almost exactly like vanilla extract, not quite that warm floral vanilla scent, but this price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> but they seem to have high quality products for better than average prices.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the scent of this oil right out of the bottle, it had a very strong, almost wood-alcohol odor, it wasn&#x27;t until I blended small amounts with other oils such as Ylang Ylang and Mandarin that the true, sweet vanilla scent came through.  </li>
            <li> Pure 100% natural oil.</li>
            <li> It is definitely pure vanilla, and isn&#x27;t a synthetic fragrance oil like most of these negative reviews are really expecting.</li>
            <li> opened the item, and the dark brown liquid has the aroma of a strong vanilla extract.  </li>
            <li> I have done extensive research on oils because I am a cancer survivor and only want to use unadulterated high quality products.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it for a few days prior to writing a review  - - to see if I liked the item.  </li>
            <li> Strong smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think about this when ordering, but I use for my line of natural lip balms, and I would prefer them to not have a color to them.  </li>
            <li> it has a natural vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I think this &#x27;essential oil&#x27; is really just a carrier oil added vanilla extract.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> You can buy a bottle of vanilla extract much cheaper at the grocery store and that is definitely what I received in my package!</li>
            <li> Soft vanilla scent, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Received broken and unusable,  made the box&#x27;s smell nice</li>
            <li> I make my own deodorant and wanted to mix up a vanilla lavendar blend, and the vanilla always separates and leaves little black spheres in the mix.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant buying this because some of the other reviewers said it smelled funny.</li>
            <li> It has a deep rich scent - not overly sweet like fake vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> This is a little heavy than I expected, but it is a good product</li>
            <li> If u read the description above it clearly states it&#x27;s extraction method.</li>
            <li> This is all natural just like an essential oil</li>
            <li> Not really as I expected.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s dark, like vanilla extract used in baking.</li>
            <li> Second, the scent completely disappeared when I added it to my soap recipe.</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;relax\\&quot; essential oil by the same company a few weeks ago and it was exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> The scent was very hard to smell after lighting the candle, and wore off quickly.</li>
            <li> This was very apparent since the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is a dark brown.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works but the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as other vanilla oils I&#x27;ve used from NAN, MRH, or BHH.</li>
            <li> As seen in other posts this is thick and separates, I just didn&#x27;t use to much and shake it every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time so only a little is needed</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to purchase this at first due to all the mixed reviews,  needless to say, I&#x27;m glad that I did purchase it.  </li>
            <li> there is no way to make a vanilla essential oil using typical extraction methods I.e.... Co2 or distillation.</li>
            <li> Tried to use it in an oil warmer and it turned into solid black tar within minutes.</li>
            <li> This oil smelled wonderful, but I was very unhappy that the oil was very thick and very black.</li>
            <li> it smells  Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset that I spent money on this.</li>
            <li> It does combine nicely with a base oil, I am thinking it will grow on me.  </li>
            <li> Super thick and nasty and very strong alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> The lotion bars that I made are all black on the bottom where the dark essential oil settled.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other oils from Plant Therapy.  </li>
            <li> but I mix it with other oils for desired effects.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of this product and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> At least it would not have been a total loss.</li>
            <li> There are actual black dots in this dark oil, which makes it difficult to incorporate into a white body butter....</li>
            <li> I was also unaware that the essential oil was dark brown in color just like vanilla extract - so it&#x27;s not good for my candle making - the brown oil comes to the surface &amp; looks weird.  </li>
            <li> Tried it with a few patients for relaxation and they objected.  </li>
            <li> I will not be buying this scent again, it didn&#x27;t even smell in my oil burners, just messy.</li>
            <li> Obviously those of u who posted bad reviews know nothing about essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am not a trained aromatherapist, just an amateur oil-blender</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to use it in a blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am just so surprised that the product is so bad.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it even though I had read some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and drops to the bottom of my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Stinky not pleasant hash-type aroma.  </li>
            <li> Yep its very thick stuff and doesn&#x27;t mix well.</li>
            <li> Ordering essential oils online can seem like a crap shoot.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; seems to be merely a higher-concentrated Extract and not oil at all.</li>
            <li> I was unable to give these as gifts as the color ruined the looks of the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla, just weird.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use artificial scents, but I may have to go that way.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, but maybe what I think of as vanilla is a fake chemical smell!</li>
            <li> So before u give a bad review.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you research and LEARN before making  bad reviews</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t bake with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> So disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product!</li>
            <li> smells horrible not even close to b</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received broken and unusable,  made the box&#x27;s smell nice</li>
            <li> Do not buy!! Super thick and nasty and very strong alcohol scent. They do not offer customer satisfaction either so not a company I will order from again. Lesson learned!!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and nice smell</li>
            <li> I bought this to make bath bombs, and the scent worked out perfectly. It smells almost exactly like vanilla extract, not quite that warm floral vanilla scent, but this price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Upon opening this oil, it was very strong. It has the pure scent that real vanilla has. I liked it for the purity, and when I put lemon, orange, and about 6 drops of this in my diffuser, I am in love. It will only be &#x27;too strong&#x27; if you do not dilute it, and when you dilute it the strong scent dissipates and the lovely vanilla is there. It is definitely pure vanilla, and isn&#x27;t a synthetic fragrance oil like most of these negative reviews are really expecting. If you want vanilla that smells like vanilla candles and cake then you should get vanilla fragrance oil. I still think this smells wonderful and I&#x27;m very relaxed right now as I diffuse this vanilla in my room.</li>
            <li> If people would do their research before purchasing certain oils u may learn alot. This is not an essential oil....there is no way to make a vanilla essential oil using typical extraction methods I.e.... Co2 or distillation. This is a vanilla absolute. This is all natural just like an essential oil so therfore your not going to get a sweet smell like a fragrance oil or the villa u buy in the baking section. To get the best use of this...is to use it in a diffuser mixed with other oils or in body care preparations. Yep its very thick stuff and doesn&#x27;t mix well. Keep that in mind. So before u give a bad review.  Do your homework and research. If u read the description above it clearly states it&#x27;s extraction method. Obviously those of u who posted bad reviews know nothing about essential oils. I suggest you research and LEARN before making  bad reviews</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised. Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company. I would give it a 10! Great products &amp; customer service you could ever ask for. Will buy again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> item was well packed everything was great</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a potent scent from the essential oil.  Will have to find another brand.  I was also unaware that the essential oil was dark brown in color just like vanilla extract - so it&#x27;s not good for my candle making - the brown oil comes to the surface &amp; looks weird.  I don&#x27;t want to use artificial scents, but I may have to go that way.</li>
            <li> Stinky not pleasant hash-type aroma.  Tried it with a few patients for relaxation and they objected.  I tried to see how to dilute it.  It did not dilute in oil, alcohol or glycerine.  Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is wonderful and not over powering, I use for my soaps, body scrubs candles, love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, I&#x27;d never used vanilla essential oil before but I didn&#x27;t expect it come streaming out as quickly as it did.  I also put it into my diffuser and it appeared to sink to the bottom and not scent my room.  I will continue experimenting with it, it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful but it doesn&#x27;t mix well with the carrier oil. It beads up and just doesn&#x27;t seem to blend. I&#x27;ll be buying from somewhere else next time.</li>
            <li> love it..make my own bath salts.  lovely essence.  will order it again.  My sister-in-law is borrowing ? some of it.</li>
            <li> Super nice oil. Smell is wonderful and just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but have issue with the bottle. Pours out fast.. So, it didn&#x27;t last..</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however, bear in mind when ordering that it is brown in color...not clear.  I didn&#x27;t even think about this when ordering, but I use for my line of natural lip balms, and I would prefer them to not have a color to them.  I didn&#x27;t use much so it didn&#x27;t tint the balm too much, but just keep this in mind when ordering.  Product is exactly as described, and smells great!</li>
            <li> I did not care for the scent of this oil right out of the bottle, it had a very strong, almost wood-alcohol odor, it wasn&#x27;t until I blended small amounts with other oils such as Ylang Ylang and Mandarin that the true, sweet vanilla scent came through.  I have ordered other oils from Plant Therapy.  I am not a trained aromatherapist, just an amateur oil-blender but they seem to have high quality products for better than average prices.</li>
            <li> I was looking for scents to mix in oils but if I wanted Vanilla, I probably could have gone to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This company has high quality oils, they test each batch and they are a great value. I have done extensive research on oils because I am a cancer survivor and only want to use unadulterated high quality products. Great oils!</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with water in a spray bottle and use as an air freshener for my kitchen and bathrooms--it smells so yummy just like vanilla extract!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to purchase this at first due to all the mixed reviews,  needless to say, I&#x27;m glad that I did purchase it.  This is a great product.  it smells  Just as expected.  and it works great in my  homemade lip balms.  With so many modifications to the products on the market today,  people aren&#x27;t used to  the natural  essence  of products.  To set the expectation, this doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla potpourri or vanilla air freshener,  it has a natural vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t really love things, my 5 stars means I am very pleased and am happy to stop using my cooking vanilla.</li>
            <li> I love this smell .  It lasts quite a long time so only a little is needed but I mix it with other oils for desired effects.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of vanilla. This is a little heavy than I expected, but it is a good product</li>
            <li> Love the vanilla scent combined with lavender!</li>
            <li> Worked great in the salve i made.</li>
            <li> Great price and love the product.  I would definitely buy it again.  I wish I could find more scents to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to lotion/chapstick/other cosmetics . I bought Rosemary, Peppermint, Cinnamon Bark, and a Citrus Blend. All worked perfectly. However, upon adding the vanilla essential &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; , I immediately noticed a problem. Instead of dispersing throughout the melted contents evenly, the vanilla was beading up at the bottom. This was very apparent since the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is a dark brown. You might wonder why I keep putting &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in quotations. Well, my recipes use no water. This &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; seems to be merely a higher-concentrated Extract and not oil at all. While it DOES smell VERY good, it is absolutely useless to me unless I change my recipe to one that is water based or includes water. Anyways,  to conclude,  I should have probably done more research before hand but it is what it is. I am just writing this review to possibly help out others who would think vanilla would be a wonderful idea and make the same mistake as me. If your using it for aroma-therapy or something though, it is a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to save money and to use for scented body butters.  It works but the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as other vanilla oils I&#x27;ve used from NAN, MRH, or BHH.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  Was exactly what I ordered.  Great smell - and proved to be a great addition to the homemade lotion I was making.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful. I just have to remember to blend it continuously when pouring my home made chap stick. Shipment was received in a very timely fashion and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of vanilla.  This smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am a very strong advocate of essential oils &amp; purchase most of them from amazon. I have been happy with other oils but believe this one was very deleted ( water &amp; color) did NOT smell like vanilla at all. Just water &amp; color !!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Not really as I expected.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product! I thought I would try it even though I had read some negative reviews. I cannot smell the vanilla scent at all. I&#x27;ve tried using it different ways and I am just so surprised that the product is so bad. I bought the \\&quot;relax\\&quot; essential oil by the same company a few weeks ago and it was exactly what I was wanting. Strong smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is actual vanilla essential oil. First, it&#x27;s dark, like vanilla extract used in baking. Second, the scent completely disappeared when I added it to my soap recipe. I think this &#x27;essential oil&#x27; is really just a carrier oil added vanilla extract. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> great product, smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This oil smelled wonderful, but I was very unhappy that the oil was very thick and very black. The lotion bars that I made are all black on the bottom where the dark essential oil settled. I was unable to give these as gifts as the color ruined the looks of the product.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells more like the vanilla extract does in your spice cabinet. I was expecting a little of a sweeter smell, but once you mix it into whatever you are using it in it smells really good. I use it in my cleaning supplies that I make at home.</li>
            <li> I used the Vanilla oil when I made some lotion bars, when you rub the bar over your skin, it smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like vanilla?</li>
            <li> This product acts like a tincture, and isn&#x27;t blendable. I thought it was going to be in an oil, but it appears to be in alcohol.</li>
            <li> used this for bath scrubs &amp; the aroma was very nice.  everyone asked for recipe &amp; where I purchased the oil.  would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this oil, well a lesson learned in \\&quot;ya get what ya pay for.\\&quot; I think I paid too much now. This stuff stinks! The Great Value Vanilla Cooking Extract from walmart smells better, but was instantly reminded of such a thing that went sour. The texture was wierd, not like most oils I get. I will not be buying this scent again, it didn&#x27;t even smell in my oil burners, just messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this oil.  I make my own deodorant and wanted to mix up a vanilla lavendar blend, and the vanilla always separates and leaves little black spheres in the mix.  Or it settles at the bottom before the concoction cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a different vanilla essential oil, so I&#x27;m assuming they are all like this.  I would not buy again, I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem buying from the company again as the shipping was quick, I just didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.  I don&#x27;t like the scent at all.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla, just weird.</li>
            <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil sfor different things and these are great.</li>
            <li> Ordering essential oils online can seem like a crap shoot. This is my second order from Plant Therapy Essential Oils, and I have been very happy with both orders. This vanilla is SO much better than others I&#x27;ve tried. It has a deep rich scent - not overly sweet like fake vanilla scent. I can hardly wait to use it in a blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with its original seal in tact, which is also very important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars - I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I ordered several essential oils from this brand.  The others have lovely scents...this one smells like water.  So disappointed...there&#x27;s no scent sweeter than vanilla, and my essential oil has none of it.</li>
            <li> smells horrible not even close to b a vanilla smell. . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Came very quickly, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil yet, but I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between the scent of it and my pure vanilla extract on my baking shelf...it&#x27;s really strong vanilla. Nothing special. However, I bet it will be really nice in my brown sugar-vanilla body scrub I plan to make.</li>
            <li> Your product looked and smelled identical to vanilla extract for baking. Tried to use it in an oil warmer and it turned into solid black tar within minutes. there was no mention about having to dilute. This oil is unusable to me as intended. Too bad I can&#x27;t bake with it. At least it would not have been a total loss. [[ASIN:B005V3W036 Vanilla Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.]]</li>
            <li> Seems almost exactly like the vanilla extract I have in my kitchen pantry, but thicker.  It does combine nicely with a base oil, I am thinking it will grow on me.  Not what I was expecting, but maybe what I think of as vanilla is a fake chemical smell!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money. You can buy a bottle of vanilla extract much cheaper at the grocery store and that is definitely what I received in my package!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant buying this because some of the other reviewers said it smelled funny. However, it smells how vanilla should AND it is a good price. No complaints :)</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and wonderful, but the color and texture is weird.  There are actual black dots in this dark oil, which makes it difficult to incorporate into a white body butter....</li>
            <li> I used the essential oils for a candle project I was making. The scent was very hard to smell after lighting the candle, and wore off quickly. Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> As seen in other posts this is thick and separates, I just didn&#x27;t use to much and shake it every time I use it.</li>
            <li> NOT ESSENTIAL OIL!!!! This stuff is horrid!!! I&#x27;m so upset that I spent money on this. It&#x27;s vanilla extract and a gross one at that!! It smells like pure alcohol. You could probably find better vanilla extract at the dollar store than this!! Save your money and buy else where!!!!!</li>
            <li> Soft vanilla scent, not overpowering at all. This oil is thick and drops to the bottom of my diffuser. Mixes nicely with other oils.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and company, received quickly, and was the first time I had used essential oils, good experience will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Pure 100% natural oil.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I love mixing it with a few drops of lavender oil for my bath. Also works great in a diffuser and makes my house smell awesome!</li>
            <li> Description fits perfectly.  My boyfriend wanted some oils because he&#x27;s a massage therapist &amp; makes his own essential oils and this oil did the job well!  + smells so good!</li>
            <li> My favorite smell in Vanilla.  I have used this in my home diffuser.  I love it.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and smells just like vanilla.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of this product and decided to give it a try.  I received it very quickly, and it was packaged very well, in both bubble wrap and padded packaging - - so it arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the item, and the dark brown liquid has the aroma of a strong vanilla extract.  I decided to try it for a few days prior to writing a review  - - to see if I liked the item.  I used it in my essential oil warmer (lit with a tea-light candle), and it has a very pleasant and calming aroma.  My essential oil warmer holds about one ounce of liquid, and I added about 7 drops of oil to produce a very nice smell that filled the room.  It aroma isn&#x27;t as strong as frankincense, myrrh, or lavender, but it does have a very nice calming aroma that is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  The scent is perfect!  Plant Therapy always has such excellent products.</li>
