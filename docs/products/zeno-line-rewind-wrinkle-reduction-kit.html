            <li>but it feels good</li>
            <li>Good thing is you&#x27;ll get a discount coupon with your kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with my ZENO and would never promote it if I didn&#x27;t feel it would help your skin improve in some shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with my ZENO and would never promote it if I didn&#x27;t feel it would help your skin improve in some shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I have had wonderful success and results with Zeno&#x27;s Hotspot device.</li>
            <li>- hope she&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but I am pleased I did!  </li>
            <li>There is something nice about the warm feeling you get when you use it.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it a lot up until then.</li>
            <li>I kind of forgot I had it, and then remembered and now I am using it every night.  </li>
            <li>On off switch has an issue but it does get warm and appears to help.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really nice.</li>
            <li>It feels so soothing and warm</li>
            <li>it is nice.</li>
            <li>This item seems to have a life of its own.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off spending your money on a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It was sent to me very quickly and was in good condition</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and it feels so good on the skin with the warming touch that it has.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ANY TIME WHEN YOU ARE READY TO GET TO FEEL GOOD WITH YOUR SELF</li>
            <li>It felt good, like a light massage and</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to keep up with so many parts.</li>
            <li>Also - the zeno hot spot device works great as well.  </li>
            <li>The device is  very cheaply made and mine would not turn off until the battery was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They give women a very bizarre look.</li>
            <li>As with many others I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off.</li>
            <li>Seem to work, my face seems more relaxed after using the kit to massage in the skin care.</li>
            <li>If it was replaced I might give it a better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And its a lot cheaper than most costmetic procedures.  </li>
            <li>But there were so many difficulties with this Zeno product.</li>
            <li>sure if the LED light used in the device is the type that would be effective for skin</li>
            <li>but I am also in love with just using virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love my Line Rewind.</li>
            <li>and...&lt;br /&gt;I instantly noticed a wonderful warming feeling.</li>
            <li>The purer the better..</li>
            <li>you use a similar regimen you will be very pleased with how you&#x27;re able to maintain your beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>The purer the better..</li>
            <li>you use a similar regimen you will be very pleased with how you&#x27;re able to maintain your beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you have moisturizers that you like, you can use this with it too, to work it into the skin better.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>I will purchase more for friends.</li>
            <li>it it made my miss love it...</li>
            <li>Bought many and love them.</li>
            <li>Christmas gifts now for my favorite friends.</li>
            <li>AMAZON NEEDS TO DO MORE RESEARCH INTO THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better, and cheaper than Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>You will love the serum that comes with the zeno</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>i did notice that it made my face feel more softer</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these and a week or more after I ordered these they cancelled my order.</li>
            <li>I also really love the pinky-iridescent look of the serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tinted like makeup in any way; it just makes your skin look so lovely and</li>
            <li>but I do like the warming sensation while using it, and I feel that my face was able to absorb serums better when using this product to sweep on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>The wrinkle serum it comes with is pretty good.</li>
            <li>My face feels smoother and it is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>I find Line Rewind easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not harmful, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really liked the first 3 days with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE After I changed the batteries, it works fine.</li>
            <li>It does have an auto shut off which is fine.  </li>
            <li>now i do see some improvement in my fine line. ..............</li>
            <li>Mine works just fine</li>
            <li>I purchased the Zeno Line Rewind after seeing a positive report on a popular television show.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I did, it has made a visible difference in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>After that - you can bang it against the wall - it just has pulsating light and nothing else.</li>
            <li>, just wish it was more powerful.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the process.  </li>
            <li>The light flashes on and off and no heat comes off.</li>
            <li>I truly believe in light therapy its collagen building benefits.</li>
            <li>This compact unit is great for travel when you don&#x27;t want to pack the big units.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>It also does not VIBRATE,,, just a sound.  </li>
            <li>and so now this is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>prices is fantastic also...</li>
            <li>BUT when you want to use it, the light won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>no annoying buzzing.</li>
            <li>lol  Oh, and sidenote, I take my batteries out in between uses, it&#x27;s been known to turn itself on and scare me to death in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>Face is smooth after each use and wrinkles are smoothing as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed at how quickly my cheeks have become less rosy.</li>
            <li>They have never offered them to me at the original cheap price, just cancelled and ignored me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to turn on and off:</li>
            <li>Got the item was excited about using it.</li>
            <li>The heat and vibration feels great and my skin did seem to look a little better</li>
            <li>I was very excited to purchase and try this item, however it stopped working after the first day.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re lucky to have available many pure form oils that do help our aging skin.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re lucky to have available many pure form oils that do help ouraging skin.</li>
            <li>With all of their wording like, exotic special seaweed broth and pure pearl infusions.</li>
            <li>and you rub all over your face with a special lotion.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m giving Zeno 5 STARS!</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m giving Zeno 5 STARS!</li>
            <li>Got a great price on these (bought 3 as gifts), but the boxes were crushed.  </li>
            <li>Makes her skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but as for soft skin it does a nice job</li>
            <li>It is a great way to deliver bacteria-killing light down to cysts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and super practical if it really worked.</li>
            <li>The vibration causes warming and putting the combination of the light, vibration and warming I see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, after much research, the amount and intensity that a home LED light gives off is incomparable to ones at a spa/clinic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars anyway because it&#x27;s so inexpensive and a good facial massage is worth $6.00.</li>
            <li>I got this quickly</li>
            <li>but other then that i love the warm feeling and the vibration from it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This probably won&#x27;t make deep wrinkles disappear completely, but I think if you&#x27;ve got reasonable expectations, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The Serum absorbed quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li>I was excited at first to get this product and to try it.</li>
            <li>You really can see a difference with the fine lines on your skin.</li>
            <li>use pure Plant based Squalane to massage the light on to my skin nightly.</li>
            <li>use pure Plant based Squalane to massage the light on to my skin nightly.</li>
            <li>far, I believe I was very vigilant when I was younger in taking very good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>You know the one&#x27;s, who promise to give you all of these amazing, instant results and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Very inconsistent with light output.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way this gets warm enough to notice any change in lines or pigmentation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also feeling firmness and my skin is looking more alive.</li>
            <li>people flip when I tell them my age (which is rarely)</li>
            <li>Most people say, I&#x27;m 28 or early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The shipping was prompt and for $5 you aren&#x27;t it was worth a try, not giving up on it just yet.</li>
            <li>I would say you don&#x27;t even get your money&#x27;s worth with this item.  </li>
            <li>The Zeno is compact and effective but it is quirky.</li>
            <li>Consistency.u need to be patient but it is really worth it.</li>
            <li>First off, I need to preface this review with these facts, I&#x27;m 46 years old, always had pore less, flawless skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t believe all the people who gave this product a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a joke!  </li>
            <li>This is what i reccommend if you want to see any kind of results in the long run.</li>
            <li>I guess the old saying that you get what you pay for is true!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice alternative to very pricey LED facial machines.</li>
            <li>So far this works fine for me</li>
            <li>Good price but 2 stars for 2 little result.</li>
            <li>Have the same kit and use it myself - love it.</li>
            <li>Not difficult or too time consuming to use.</li>
            <li>That really rocks for your skin!  </li>
            <li>A note to the first commenter--</li>
            <li>know for a fact, red light therapy does improve your skin and is very beneficial if you use the light therapy correctly.</li>
            <li>know for a fact, red light therapy does improve your skin and is very beneficial if you use the light therapy correctly.</li>
            <li>Not working as well as it has when I first received.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure yet if it&#x27;s quite effective, it might in the long run as with anything and a good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t brake your bank</li>
            <li>The Zeno Line Reduction broke after using the device the first time.</li>
            <li>Out really works!</li>
            <li>Ok, admittedly, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but have some laugh lines and decided to see if I could get them to go away, or at least diminish.  </li>
            <li>Bummer, It&#x27;s the first time Dr Oz lied to me.</li>
            <li>I did use it once and the next day it appeared that my freckles got MORE noticiable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the serum much because there isn&#x27;t much and it absorbs too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of this product for wrinkles or any other kind of skin condition as it broke after about five uses.</li>
            <li>and find that my cheeks are really looking better after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels smoother, pores are more refined, and fine lines appear smaller.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the trick: instead of tapping the power button twice very quickly, take a short break in between the taps.</li>
            <li>Pure PANIC on my part.</li>
            <li>I always recommend using pant based ingredients on your face or pure oils/butters like Shea/Argon..</li>
            <li>I always recommend using pant based ingredients on your face or pure oils/butters like Shea/Argon..</li>
            <li>It certainly does what it states</li>
            <li>I know it will go through X amount of batteries and have bought the large economy pack.</li>
            <li>Very ethical and high service standards.  </li>
            <li>the warmth and slight vibration really make it feel like the serum is working its magic and getting absorbed well.</li>
            <li>Head over to Big Lots and buy a large pack of batteries, they are cheap there!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say after only a few days I have seen results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 and just over the last year I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin texture and thanks to my sleeping positions</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that was possible without spending a huge amount of cash.</li>
            <li>Worked for a whole 3 days.</li>
            <li>I have used daily and have seen no results in three weeks, the power of the led light is mininimal and comes on by itself with the off area not functioning at all.</li>
            <li>I find it a very soothing and relaxing process at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Will keep using it to see if it really erases wrinkles.</li>
            <li>How much I use it, often.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how well it worked ,but  I would like to think it did.  </li>
            <li>how much of a punch can</li>
            <li>you need a device that is very affordable that will give you results</li>
            <li>understand how the red light therapy works</li>
            <li>you need a device that is very affordable that will give you results</li>
            <li>understand how the red light therapy works</li>
            <li>, the serum drys out fast, I may try coconut oil and vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I used the Zeno three months straight and did not experience any line reduction at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the red light is anything but</li>
            <li>Great idea, poor design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now thinking about trying the blue LED light therapy to keep my face clearer from bacteria and acne.</li>
            <li>Maybe Zeno will create a blue light product soon.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Save your money and purchase a quality infrared red light.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say if it works because of this.</li>
            <li>i would have given it 5 stars if it didnt drain out the batteries so fast.</li>
            <li>OK, but not what I expected</li>
            <li>The product works and feels great on your skin, but it does not turn off, which is kinda of frustrating.</li>
            <li>I think this product is cheap enough to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>The warmth it gives is very relaxing, and the humming makes me want to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>It is very sensitve with the on/off button.</li>
            <li>I did alot of research on red light therapy..</li>
            <li>I see some reviews claiming the batteries run out fast with the Zeno.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes--where all my wrinkles are!--looks firmer and smoother after I&#x27;ve used the device each night, and I swear my skin tone is looking more even and clear overall, like on my cheeks where I have some splotchiness and sun damage.    </li>
            <li>I use Bio-Oil instead (and would use other skin oils too) which has better slip.  </li>
            <li>Using it every day for a week the fine lines and laugh lines are less.  </li>
            <li>a Christmas light tucked inside a pretty pink case but that&#x27;s just JMHO.</li>
            <li>I do one full session on my face and jawline, then let the unit cool down a bit, and then do my neck and décolletage.  </li>
            <li>If it just flashes red light with no vibration, it needs new batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a suntan on my face (ever), never went outside without sunglasses (even when sunglasses weren&#x27;t cool)</li>
            <li>Too many driving trips down to the coast in the summer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing its the same with this device, as much as they want you to believe it will work right away..let&#x27;s be real here, no anti aging product is an overnight miracle.</li>
            <li>I would say they are 50% better in less than a week.  </li>
            <li>My main problem was sun damage (spots) that my dermatologist keeps telling me need to be lasered off, so I was looking for another method to get them to fade.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product pretty religiously but can say I haven&#x27;t realized any real results !  </li>
            <li>she highly recommends it...</li>
            <li>: I have found that this little thing, which I LOVE now, eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</li>
            <li>I love the little massager.  </li>
            <li>I used this for about 2 weeks and honestly am sure it was a waste of my time.</li>
            <li>This may have been why there was such a price reduction, but I guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how on earth these little red lights could be strong enough to stimulate collagen, but maybe they are, because after a week of use my skin does look firmer and more even in tone.</li>
            <li>To tell the truth, I have a nice skin, no wrinkles just little tiny around the mouth.</li>
            <li>a new one with return shipping for the one that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I used the new one once...</li>
            <li>New batteries, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Stopped working even after new batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this, twice daily, for seven days, but I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a red light thermal facial and I&#x27;m telling you, Zeno packs a punch depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for in help with your skin.</li>
            <li>The red light and heat is enough for it.</li>
            <li>hopefully it will last longer than the first one.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my unit is malfunctioning because it never gets hot enough to even burn</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>progress\\&quot;) I will update at a later date to give a full review.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I did not wait to write my review later is because of this...</li>
            <li>It sinks in too quickly that way.</li>
            <li>But this little guy, along with the serum, has actually made my skin more hydrated.</li>
            <li>LED is known to help with wrinkles and clear your skin.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>Under a month old.</li>
            <li>Started using my Line Rewind a week ago and like the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I smooth it all over, and also linger to concentrate on trouble spots.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Also, drinking at least a liter or more of water helps your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, drinking at least a liter or more of water helps your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the results so far.  </li>
            <li>While this was a &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; (Somewhat, this is an OLD, retired product)</li>
            <li>no difference so far...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the serum did not cause me any irritation.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been faithful with using this product, so I really can&#x27;t evaluate it properly.</li>
            <li>There is no need to constantly massage your face the whole time-just hover it over the wrinkle for a minute then switch to another area &amp; repeat repeat repeat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about these thing&#x27;s typically, but I&#x27;m having a tough time with this &amp;#34;aging issue&amp;#34; and losing my beautiful youthful skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sleep wrinkles are pretty deep and noticeable under my eyes, chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 1 month, absolutely no change -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM:  Seller contacted me after reading the review above and provided for a quick refund.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my skin feel smoother and generally look healthier, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my spots and fine lines are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It will not turn off normally,,, take a lot of pounding to get it off,, then it turns back on over &amp; over &amp; over.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice when it does work correctly, though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it, at this point, due to the inconsistent start-stop issue.</li>
            <li>The new facial gadgets on the market may or may not work.</li>
            <li>I was easily able to turn the unit on and off, however it just randomly turns on whenever it wants to.  </li>
            <li>would suggest slow and even strokes over your entire face in an upwards motion to get the most out of your Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>would suggest slow and even strokes over your entire face in an upwards motion to get the most out of your Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m only 29 years old, and I have very few lines (mainly fine lines on forehead and the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet),</li>
            <li>without the use of fillers, major plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>The Zeno does a have a few minor glitches with the light blinking at times and it will not turn on or off for a couple of seconds.</li>

            <li>Please use rechargable batteries folks, and dispose of old batteries properly or by recycling them!  </li>
            <li>Was really curious about this product and really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Creams will improve your skin texture/hydration but there is nothing in a bottle that will repair damage as far as deep wrinkles, loss of firmness, etc.</li>
            <li>It turns on when I barely touch it, don&#x27;t touch it, or won&#x27;t start when I try to get it to start.</li>
            <li>Constant calls to the 800 number result in busy signals.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY TO TRY AND RETURN IT.  </li>
            <li>After personally emailing the manufacture to send me a new one the same thing happened again.</li>
            <li>the box arrived COMPLETELY smashed and the seller really couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li>In a few days the lines are less noticeable and my skin seems to be firmer and have a more youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time believing that this is working, because my super expensive Baby Quasar device didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, but honestly this Zeno thing seems to be working.</li>
            <li>the record, the first time I used this, I had trouble turning it off, too.</li>
            <li>It actually made my face a little sticky and pulled it funny to use the device.  </li>
            <li>and if you try it again right away it usually just blinks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not long enough to assess full/long-term results, but I can already tell a difference after I use it.</li>
            <li>really like this little Zeno gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the Zeno purchase.</li>

            <li> but it feels good</li>
            <li> Good thing is you&#x27;ll get a discount coupon with your kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with my ZENO and would never promote it if I didn&#x27;t feel it would help your skin improve in some shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with my ZENO and would never promote it if I didn&#x27;t feel it would help your skin improve in some shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I have had wonderful success and results with Zeno&#x27;s Hotspot device.</li>
            <li> - hope she&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but I am pleased I did!  </li>
            <li> There is something nice about the warm feeling you get when you use it.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it a lot up until then.</li>
            <li> I kind of forgot I had it, and then remembered and now I am using it every night.  </li>
            <li> On off switch has an issue but it does get warm and appears to help.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really nice.</li>
            <li> It feels so soothing and warm</li>
            <li> it is nice.</li>
            <li> This item seems to have a life of its own.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off spending your money on a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was sent to me very quickly and was in good condition</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and it feels so good on the skin with the warming touch that it has.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ANY TIME WHEN YOU ARE READY TO GET TO FEEL GOOD WITH YOUR SELF</li>
            <li> It felt good, like a light massage and</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to keep up with so many parts.</li>
            <li> Also - the zeno hot spot device works great as well.  </li>
            <li> The device is  very cheaply made and mine would not turn off until the battery was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They give women a very bizarre look.</li>
            <li> As with many others I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off.</li>
            <li> Seem to work, my face seems more relaxed after using the kit to massage in the skin care.</li>
            <li> If it was replaced I might give it a better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And its a lot cheaper than most costmetic procedures.  </li>
            <li> But there were so many difficulties with this Zeno product.</li>
            <li> sure if the LED light used in the device is the type that would be effective for skin</li>
            <li> but I am also in love with just using virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my Line Rewind.</li>
            <li> and...&lt;br /&gt;I instantly noticed a wonderful warming feeling.</li>
            <li> The purer the better..</li>
            <li> you use a similar regimen you will be very pleased with how you&#x27;re able to maintain your beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The purer the better..</li>
            <li> you use a similar regimen you will be very pleased with how you&#x27;re able to maintain your beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you have moisturizers that you like, you can use this with it too, to work it into the skin better.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> I will purchase more for friends.</li>
            <li> it it made my miss love it...</li>
            <li> Bought many and love them.</li>
            <li> Christmas gifts now for my favorite friends.</li>
            <li> AMAZON NEEDS TO DO MORE RESEARCH INTO THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Better, and cheaper than Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> You will love the serum that comes with the zeno</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> i did notice that it made my face feel more softer</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and a week or more after I ordered these they cancelled my order.</li>
            <li> I also really love the pinky-iridescent look of the serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tinted like makeup in any way; it just makes your skin look so lovely and</li>
            <li> but I do like the warming sensation while using it, and I feel that my face was able to absorb serums better when using this product to sweep on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> The wrinkle serum it comes with is pretty good.</li>
            <li> My face feels smoother and it is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> I find Line Rewind easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not harmful, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really liked the first 3 days with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE After I changed the batteries, it works fine.</li>
            <li> It does have an auto shut off which is fine.  </li>
            <li> now i do see some improvement in my fine line. ..............</li>
            <li> Mine works just fine</li>
            <li> I purchased the Zeno Line Rewind after seeing a positive report on a popular television show.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I did, it has made a visible difference in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> After that - you can bang it against the wall - it just has pulsating light and nothing else.</li>
            <li> , just wish it was more powerful.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the process.  </li>
            <li> The light flashes on and off and no heat comes off.</li>
            <li> I truly believe in light therapy its collagen building benefits.</li>
            <li> This compact unit is great for travel when you don&#x27;t want to pack the big units.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> It also does not VIBRATE,,, just a sound.  </li>
            <li> and so now this is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> prices is fantastic also...</li>
            <li> BUT when you want to use it, the light won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> no annoying buzzing.</li>
            <li> lol  Oh, and sidenote, I take my batteries out in between uses, it&#x27;s been known to turn itself on and scare me to death in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Face is smooth after each use and wrinkles are smoothing as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed at how quickly my cheeks have become less rosy.</li>
            <li> They have never offered them to me at the original cheap price, just cancelled and ignored me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to turn on and off:</li>
            <li> Got the item was excited about using it.</li>
            <li> The heat and vibration feels great and my skin did seem to look a little better</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase and try this item, however it stopped working after the first day.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re lucky to have available many pure form oils that do help our aging skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re lucky to have available many pure form oils that do help ouraging skin.</li>
            <li> With all of their wording like, exotic special seaweed broth and pure pearl infusions.</li>
            <li> and you rub all over your face with a special lotion.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m giving Zeno 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m giving Zeno 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> Got a great price on these (bought 3 as gifts), but the boxes were crushed.  </li>
            <li> Makes her skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> but as for soft skin it does a nice job</li>
            <li> It is a great way to deliver bacteria-killing light down to cysts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and super practical if it really worked.</li>
            <li> The vibration causes warming and putting the combination of the light, vibration and warming I see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, after much research, the amount and intensity that a home LED light gives off is incomparable to ones at a spa/clinic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars anyway because it&#x27;s so inexpensive and a good facial massage is worth $6.00.</li>
            <li> I got this quickly</li>
            <li> but other then that i love the warm feeling and the vibration from it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This probably won&#x27;t make deep wrinkles disappear completely, but I think if you&#x27;ve got reasonable expectations, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The Serum absorbed quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> I was excited at first to get this product and to try it.</li>
            <li> You really can see a difference with the fine lines on your skin.</li>
            <li> use pure Plant based Squalane to massage the light on to my skin nightly.</li>
            <li> use pure Plant based Squalane to massage the light on to my skin nightly.</li>
            <li> far, I believe I was very vigilant when I was younger in taking very good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> You know the one&#x27;s, who promise to give you all of these amazing, instant results and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent with light output.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way this gets warm enough to notice any change in lines or pigmentation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also feeling firmness and my skin is looking more alive.</li>
            <li> people flip when I tell them my age (which is rarely)</li>
            <li> Most people say, I&#x27;m 28 or early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The shipping was prompt and for $5 you aren&#x27;t it was worth a try, not giving up on it just yet.</li>
            <li> I would say you don&#x27;t even get your money&#x27;s worth with this item.  </li>
            <li> The Zeno is compact and effective but it is quirky.</li>
            <li> Consistency.u need to be patient but it is really worth it.</li>
            <li> First off, I need to preface this review with these facts, I&#x27;m 46 years old, always had pore less, flawless skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe all the people who gave this product a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a joke!  </li>
            <li> This is what i reccommend if you want to see any kind of results in the long run.</li>
            <li> I guess the old saying that you get what you pay for is true!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice alternative to very pricey LED facial machines.</li>
            <li> So far this works fine for me</li>
            <li> Good price but 2 stars for 2 little result.</li>
            <li> Have the same kit and use it myself - love it.</li>
            <li> Not difficult or too time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> That really rocks for your skin!  </li>
            <li> A note to the first commenter--</li>
            <li> know for a fact, red light therapy does improve your skin and is very beneficial if you use the light therapy correctly.</li>
            <li> know for a fact, red light therapy does improve your skin and is very beneficial if you use the light therapy correctly.</li>
            <li> Not working as well as it has when I first received.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure yet if it&#x27;s quite effective, it might in the long run as with anything and a good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t brake your bank</li>
            <li> The Zeno Line Reduction broke after using the device the first time.</li>
            <li> Out really works!</li>
            <li> Ok, admittedly, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but have some laugh lines and decided to see if I could get them to go away, or at least diminish.  </li>
            <li> Bummer, It&#x27;s the first time Dr Oz lied to me.</li>
            <li> I did use it once and the next day it appeared that my freckles got MORE noticiable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the serum much because there isn&#x27;t much and it absorbs too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of this product for wrinkles or any other kind of skin condition as it broke after about five uses.</li>
            <li> and find that my cheeks are really looking better after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels smoother, pores are more refined, and fine lines appear smaller.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the trick: instead of tapping the power button twice very quickly, take a short break in between the taps.</li>
            <li> Pure PANIC on my part.</li>
            <li> I always recommend using pant based ingredients on your face or pure oils/butters like Shea/Argon..</li>

            <li> It certainly does what it states</li>
            <li> I know it will go through X amount of batteries and have bought the large economy pack.</li>
            <li> Very ethical and high service standards.  </li>
            <li> the warmth and slight vibration really make it feel like the serum is working its magic and getting absorbed well.</li>
            <li> Head over to Big Lots and buy a large pack of batteries, they are cheap there!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say after only a few days I have seen results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and just over the last year I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin texture and thanks to my sleeping positions</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that was possible without spending a huge amount of cash.</li>
            <li> Worked for a whole 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have used daily and have seen no results in three weeks, the power of the led light is mininimal and comes on by itself with the off area not functioning at all.</li>
            <li> I find it a very soothing and relaxing process at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Will keep using it to see if it really erases wrinkles.</li>
            <li> How much I use it, often.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how well it worked ,but  I would like to think it did.  </li>
            <li> how much of a punch can</li>
            <li> you need a device that is very affordable that will give you results</li>
            <li> understand how the red light therapy works</li>
            <li> you need a device that is very affordable that will give you results</li>
            <li> understand how the red light therapy works</li>
            <li> , the serum drys out fast, I may try coconut oil and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I used the Zeno three months straight and did not experience any line reduction at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the red light is anything but</li>
            <li> Great idea, poor design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now thinking about trying the blue LED light therapy to keep my face clearer from bacteria and acne.</li>
            <li> Maybe Zeno will create a blue light product soon.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase a quality infrared red light.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I like this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say if it works because of this.</li>
            <li> i would have given it 5 stars if it didnt drain out the batteries so fast.</li>
            <li> OK, but not what I expected</li>
            <li> The product works and feels great on your skin, but it does not turn off, which is kinda of frustrating.</li>
            <li> I think this product is cheap enough to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> The warmth it gives is very relaxing, and the humming makes me want to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> It is very sensitve with the on/off button.</li>
            <li> I did alot of research on red light therapy..</li>
            <li> I see some reviews claiming the batteries run out fast with the Zeno.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes--where all my wrinkles are!--looks firmer and smoother after I&#x27;ve used the device each night, and I swear my skin tone is looking more even and clear overall, like on my cheeks where I have some splotchiness and sun damage.    </li>
            <li> I use Bio-Oil instead (and would use other skin oils too) which has better slip.  </li>
            <li> Using it every day for a week the fine lines and laugh lines are less.  </li>
            <li> a Christmas light tucked inside a pretty pink case but that&#x27;s just JMHO.</li>
            <li> I do one full session on my face and jawline, then let the unit cool down a bit, and then do my neck and décolletage.  </li>
            <li> If it just flashes red light with no vibration, it needs new batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a suntan on my face (ever), never went outside without sunglasses (even when sunglasses weren&#x27;t cool)</li>
            <li> Too many driving trips down to the coast in the summer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing its the same with this device, as much as they want you to believe it will work right away..let&#x27;s be real here, no anti aging product is an overnight miracle.</li>
            <li> I would say they are 50% better in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> My main problem was sun damage (spots) that my dermatologist keeps telling me need to be lasered off, so I was looking for another method to get them to fade.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product pretty religiously but can say I haven&#x27;t realized any real results !  </li>
            <li> she highly recommends it...</li>
            <li> : I have found that this little thing, which I LOVE now, eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</li>
            <li> I love the little massager.  </li>
            <li> I used this for about 2 weeks and honestly am sure it was a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> This may have been why there was such a price reduction, but I guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how on earth these little red lights could be strong enough to stimulate collagen, but maybe they are, because after a week of use my skin does look firmer and more even in tone.</li>
            <li> To tell the truth, I have a nice skin, no wrinkles just little tiny around the mouth.</li>
            <li> a new one with return shipping for the one that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I used the new one once...</li>
            <li> New batteries, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Stopped working even after new batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this, twice daily, for seven days, but I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a red light thermal facial and I&#x27;m telling you, Zeno packs a punch depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for in help with your skin.</li>
            <li> The red light and heat is enough for it.</li>
            <li> hopefully it will last longer than the first one.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my unit is malfunctioning because it never gets hot enough to even burn</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> progress\\&quot;) I will update at a later date to give a full review.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I did not wait to write my review later is because of this...</li>
            <li> It sinks in too quickly that way.</li>
            <li> But this little guy, along with the serum, has actually made my skin more hydrated.</li>
            <li> LED is known to help with wrinkles and clear your skin.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> Under a month old.</li>
            <li> Started using my Line Rewind a week ago and like the results so far.  </li>
            <li> I smooth it all over, and also linger to concentrate on trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Also, drinking at least a liter or more of water helps your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, drinking at least a liter or more of water helps your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the results so far.  </li>
            <li> While this was a &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; (Somewhat, this is an OLD, retired product)</li>
            <li> no difference so far...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the serum did not cause me any irritation.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been faithful with using this product, so I really can&#x27;t evaluate it properly.</li>
            <li> There is no need to constantly massage your face the whole time-just hover it over the wrinkle for a minute then switch to another area &amp; repeat repeat repeat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about these thing&#x27;s typically, but I&#x27;m having a tough time with this &amp;#34;aging issue&amp;#34; and losing my beautiful youthful skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sleep wrinkles are pretty deep and noticeable under my eyes, chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 1 month, absolutely no change -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM:  Seller contacted me after reading the review above and provided for a quick refund.  </li>
            <li> Not only does my skin feel smoother and generally look healthier, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my spots and fine lines are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It will not turn off normally,,, take a lot of pounding to get it off,, then it turns back on over &amp; over &amp; over.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice when it does work correctly, though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it, at this point, due to the inconsistent start-stop issue.</li>
            <li> The new facial gadgets on the market may or may not work.</li>
            <li> I was easily able to turn the unit on and off, however it just randomly turns on whenever it wants to.  </li>
            <li> would suggest slow and even strokes over your entire face in an upwards motion to get the most out of your Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> would suggest slow and even strokes over your entire face in an upwards motion to get the most out of your Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m only 29 years old, and I have very few lines (mainly fine lines on forehead and the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet),</li>
            <li> without the use of fillers, major plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> The Zeno does a have a few minor glitches with the light blinking at times and it will not turn on or off for a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> The Zeno does a have a few minor glitches with the light blinking at times and it will not turn on or off for a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> Please use rechargable batteries folks, and dispose of old batteries properly or by recycling them!  </li>
            <li> Was really curious about this product and really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Creams will improve your skin texture/hydration but there is nothing in a bottle that will repair damage as far as deep wrinkles, loss of firmness, etc.</li>
            <li> It turns on when I barely touch it, don&#x27;t touch it, or won&#x27;t start when I try to get it to start.</li>
            <li> Constant calls to the 800 number result in busy signals.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY TO TRY AND RETURN IT.  </li>
            <li> After personally emailing the manufacture to send me a new one the same thing happened again.</li>
            <li> the box arrived COMPLETELY smashed and the seller really couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li> In a few days the lines are less noticeable and my skin seems to be firmer and have a more youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time believing that this is working, because my super expensive Baby Quasar device didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, but honestly this Zeno thing seems to be working.</li>
            <li> the record, the first time I used this, I had trouble turning it off, too.</li>
            <li> It actually made my face a little sticky and pulled it funny to use the device.  </li>
            <li> and if you try it again right away it usually just blinks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not long enough to assess full/long-term results, but I can already tell a difference after I use it.</li>
            <li> really like this little Zeno gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the Zeno purchase.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the effort or the money as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> It will not last long.</li>
            <li> I paid full price (not happy)</li>
            <li> That is the major difference between the Zeno and all of these other gadgets on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is the major difference between the Zeno and all of these other gadgets on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Device was easy to use and not at all uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Of course, realistically I know I have not had this long enough to see if this will work long term.</li>
            <li> only have time to use it at night, and I can&#x27;t say I use it every single night, and</li>
            <li> I also noticed two days later in florescent lighting the tiny lines under my eyes were so much smaller and hardly less visible.</li>
            <li> I use it before I go to sleep sometimes because of that or an excuse not to get out of bed in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Second use for the product</li>
            <li> I found this a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then, it is very difficult to turn on,,, when on... it gets EXTREMELY HOT and can be too hot to use.  </li>
            <li> I have not only thanked the friend who told me about it, I have also been telling other friends to try it out as well.</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;trying\\&quot; because most of the time that doesn&#x27;t work and annoyingly you just have to listen to the loud vibration until it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, after the first couple of times using the Zeno, the thing wouldn&#x27;t turn off and sometimes came on by itself.</li>
            <li> even when I put it down on the shelf after struggling to turn it off, it goes back on.  </li>
            <li> Based on previous ratings...if my device broke or stopped working...for $22....I would definitely buy another device.  </li>
            <li> The marionette lines seemed less and the crows feet line on my left eye was looking smoother.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely dry skin (like menopause-dry), and my few fine lines are exaggerated by that fact.</li>
            <li> Do it EVERYDAY for at LEAST 15 minutes, massage your face hard enuff with it &amp; leave if over the wrinkles long enuff for the light to sink in the skin.</li>
            <li> as per several other reviews I had to remove the battery, still not worth the effort to return.</li>
            <li> had some of the same complaints that there was little or no results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter the age of 46 and menopausal symptoms begin to make your facial skin go a little bananas.</li>
            <li> that left crow&#x27;s feet wrinkle a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that left crow&#x27;s feet wrinkle a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, overall apperance of skin was smoother, however there was little improvement on deeper wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> After only using my Line Rewind for less than a month it went out on me like other users.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have a sensitive ON button but the off button is a complete fail.</li>
            <li> So, I was hoping, since I don&#x27;t have any big problems, those tiny wrinkles if not go away, at least, diminish.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money and provided no benefit.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t just ONE defective Zeno that I bought, the whole LINE is poorly made.</li>
            <li> Also, the insert mentioned to be careful of being burned.  </li>
            <li> Ive used this only a few times and even tried replacing the batteries but no improvement noticed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve only used it for a few nights.</li>
            <li> however it does not last mine quit working after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> For someone that has had good skin all her life...this was horrifying.  </li>
            <li> Yes, other reviewers, I have tried EVERYTHING else when it comes to turning it off - tapping, clicking, pushing the button in a multitude of ways.  </li>
            <li> This is a shame because I can&#x27;t find any other product that heats.</li>
            <li> it seemed to help moisturize but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences.</li>
            <li> But I did some comparison shopping and other devices with a $400 pricetag</li>
            <li> Usually there is some improvement but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of dollars later</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this at first</li>
            <li> I think like any other &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; product it depends on the person.</li>
            <li> I removed the back of the unit and pop the batteries out after each use, I usually get about a week out of two batteries.</li>
            <li> I usually tap, wait one second, tap again.</li>
            <li> This is only after 3 days of use with treatments of approximately 20-30 minutes each over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to having painful skin from strong topicals</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as I find it not very reliable since it break down in less then 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> If it won&#x27;t go off when you tap it, you&#x27;re not tapping it quite hard enough.     </li>
            <li> Use your Zeno daily if you can at least twice.</li>
            <li> Use your Zeno daily if you can at least twice.</li>
            <li> and now it pulsates off and on constantly, very annoying, and not getting the effect of the constant red light.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product is going to help with wrinkle (minor ones around my eyes),</li>
            <li> When I go to lay it down the slightest touch turns it on.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t break down I would give it 5 stars, but even knowing how these break, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> However, that could just be due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t moisturized yet and my skin dried out.  </li>
            <li> It was a very small finacial investment to try and bring back some youth to my face.  </li>
            <li> I do like how it feels when it worked, and maybe notice a slight improvement in skin tone</li>
            <li> I used it for less then 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I would give it less stars but it works so well for my complexion that I won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> for the device itself, like someone said in the previous reviews, it turns on by &amp;#34;just looking at it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and i belive that with continued use it will help with my  skin discolorations and slight forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The directions say do﻿ it until the serum absorbs but it do it for wayyy longer, sometimes even a half hour.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve used every high dollar creme on the market.</li>
            <li> The serum that came with it, made the face dry, hard to use the Zeno tool.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m determined to get my expensive creams down in my dermis as far as I can.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m determined to get my expensive creams down in my dermis as far as I can.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for a \\&quot;little help\\&quot; and a friend said that I should try this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this little gadget at Target one day hoping that it&#x27;ll just tighten up my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> Every little bit would alright.</li>
            <li> I cranked this little baby up</li>
            <li> this little Zeno pack?</li>
            <li> My face does feel a little tighter when finished.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone...don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Zeno Line Rewind for a few weeks and already notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Basically, if you&#x27;re having trouble with it, change the batteries.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t waste even 30 bucks</li>
            <li> It is a waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> I have a two hour drive (four hour round trip)</li>
            <li> It was so inexpensive that I was skeptical, but I try nearly every product in the beauty aisle for wrinkles or undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d just started to notice a few issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest purchasing the ZENO!&lt;br /&gt;While it comes with a tube of wrinkle cream, I&#x27;ve broken out the big guns</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest purchasing the ZENO!&lt;br /&gt;While it comes with a tube of wrinkle cream, I&#x27;ve broken out the big guns</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Usually it will break down within a month.</li>
            <li> marionette lines are not too bad but visible and after some intense grief due to a few back to back deaths, I felt I was getting &amp;</li>
            <li> In my opinion....its a little cosmetic gem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually works because I&#x27;m so frustrated with the functionality of what should be so simple</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is down a star because it-will-NOT-shut-off!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is something wrong with my Zeno but the only way I can turn the thing off if I take out one of the batteries.  </li>
            <li> Usually takes about 5 minute&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Because this is a skin care product, I was wary of using the eye cream on my face as it is likely expired.</li>
            <li> Also I think there is a capacitor that has to bleed off after each use so that may be why it will usually go through one cycle at a time</li>
            <li> for the people having trouble getting it to turn OFF- it will not turn off if u press the button once!  </li>
            <li> After that I end up buying other less expensive serums.</li>
            <li> The Battery case takes a LOT of hard work to get off.  </li>
            <li> It is problematic, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it takes at LEAST 3 months to see results.</li>
            <li> each area slowly for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My thing is to do it slowly and gracefully.</li>
            <li> each area slowly for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My thing is to do it slowly and gracefully.</li>
            <li> Also, if it&#x27;s low on batteries, it&#x27;s almost impossible to turn off.</li>
            <li> Between the two, seriously, it has taken 10 years off my face.  </li>
            <li> It vibration is a little weird</li>
            <li> For those of you who are afraid of botox or other injections</li>
            <li> Battery installation was difficult (hard to part the sections of the device to install the battery.)  </li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>
            <li> but it gets worse as time goes on.</li>
            <li> this will make it worse.</li>
            <li> and I do see a difference around my eyes and mouth when using it however the power button is poorly placed and often causes me to turn it on or off inadvertently</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I purchased the device as a gift and was embarrassed to hear the results of a broken kit.</li>
            <li> , too sad I can&#x27;t make it work.</li>
            <li> also recommend twice weekly in home dermabrasion to help your skin absorb your expensive products.</li>

            <li> The item is extremely difficult to switch on.  </li>

            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> These are &amp;#34;Minor issues&amp;#34; based on how expensive this treatment would be if I were going to a spa weekly!</li>

            <li> I broke a nail trying to get the stupid battery out</li>
            <li> but the button thing is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and a bit frightend by the Rewind wrinkle reduction kit.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does not serve its purpose</li>
            <li> Have the same kit and use it myself - love it. This kit purchased as a present for my cousin - hope she&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is something wrong with my Zeno but the only way I can turn the thing off if I take out one of the batteries.  I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually works because I&#x27;m so frustrated with the functionality of what should be so simple, I don&#x27;t use it frequently.  Before spending $40 on this so called miracle worker on removing wrinkles, I would wait until they improve the mechanism of this device.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 2 weeks and honestly am sure it was a waste of my time. There&#x27;s no way this gets warm enough to notice any change in lines or pigmentation. It&#x27;s cute and super practical if it really worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Zeno Line Rewind after seeing a positive report on a popular television show.  I ordered it on August 30, 2011 and rec&#x27;d it about 1 week later.  On October 6, 2011 it stopped working.  Changed the batteries several times...no sign of life.  I am waiting to hear a reply from the company about getting a refund.  Poor quality I would not recommend this to anyone...don&#x27;t waste your money.  Update...last week I was contacted by  the company that shipped the Zeno Line Rewind.  Rec&#x27;d a new one with return shipping for the one that didn&#x27;t work.  I am very happy with the customer service.  I used the new one once...hopefully it will last longer than the first one.  There is something nice about the warm feeling you get when you use it.  I hope it does the trick.</li>
            <li> This item is bad.  Along with another reviewer, the only way I can turn the darn thing off is by removing batteries!  Yes, other reviewers, I have tried EVERYTHING else when it comes to turning it off - tapping, clicking, pushing the button in a multitude of ways.  It just does NOT TURN OFF!!!  I also have not seen ANY difference in my skin, so there you go.  Back to the manufacturer it goes...</li>
            <li> I got this a couple of days ago. I see no change at all. Of course, realistically I know I have not had this long enough to see if this will work long term. (That is why this review is \\&quot;in progress\\&quot;) I will update at a later date to give a full review.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I did not wait to write my review later is because of this...&lt;br /&gt;CON-You just about have to break your thumb trying to turn this thing off! I say \\&quot;trying\\&quot; because most of the time that doesn&#x27;t work and annoyingly you just have to listen to the loud vibration until it shuts itself off. Usually takes about 5 minute&#x27;s. RIDICULOUS!</li>
            <li> Dont seem like it work</li>
            <li> I got my Line Rewind on the recommendation of a friend, and even after a week of using it, I can already totally see the difference.  My main problem was sun damage (spots) that my dermatologist keeps telling me need to be lasered off, so I was looking for another method to get them to fade.  Not only does my skin feel smoother and generally look healthier, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my spots and fine lines are less noticeable.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Zeno Line Rewind for a few weeks and already notice a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it over my entire face, and the lines in my forehead and around my eyes are definitely smaller. Further, the rest of my skin is smoother and clearer as well. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a \\&quot;little help\\&quot; and a friend said that I should try this product. I am so happy that I did, it has made a visible difference in a short period of time. I have not only thanked the friend who told me about it, I have also been telling other friends to try it out as well.</li>
            <li> Worked for a whole 3 days. After that - you can bang it against the wall - it just has pulsating light and nothing else. I don&#x27;t know if there is any skin improvement in 3 days, too sad I can&#x27;t make it work.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with heat to apply lotions &amp; creams to replace a Revlon product that died. As with many others I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off. It turned on if you just looked at it. Then it would flash, no vibration, to pulseing now sounds like a sick duck with flshing lights. Battery out used to reset it but it gets worse as time goes on. Under a month old. I do like how it feels when it worked, and maybe notice a slight improvement in skin tone so 2 stars instead of one. This is a shame because I can&#x27;t find any other product that heats.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how on earth these little red lights could be strong enough to stimulate collagen, but maybe they are, because after a week of use my skin does look firmer and more even in tone. I have a hard time believing that this is working, because my super expensive Baby Quasar device didn&#x27;t seem to do anything, but honestly this Zeno thing seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money and provided no benefit.  I have used daily and have seen no results in three weeks, the power of the led light is mininimal and comes on by itself with the off area not functioning at all.</li>
            <li> it seemed to help moisturize but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences. Not really worth the effort or the money as far as I can tell. It would be easier to just buy a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Started using my Line Rewind a week ago and like the results so far.  My face feels smoother and it is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Seem to work, my face seems more relaxed after using the kit to massage in the skin care. Value for money.</li>
            <li> got this for my mom. She loves it.! Makes her skin nice and soft. I ordered a second cream so she has a backup</li>
            <li> I liked it, but it malfunctioned! :(</li>
            <li> Good price but 2 stars for 2 little result.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Zeno line Rewind Wrinkle Reduction Kit after reading some good reviews. I used it for less then 3 weeks and it just stop working. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as I find it not very reliable since it break down in less then 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I feel stupid using it.  The things we women will do to try and erase wrinkles short of having a face lift!</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone skin like me this will make it worse. The serum also makes my skin feel like it is burning.</li>
            <li> Mine worked for about 10 days and I liked it a lot up until then. I have not received a response back from the company....If it was replaced I might give it a better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE After I changed the batteries, it works fine. Bear in mind that batteries will need to be changed often. I like the way it works, just wish it was more powerful.</li>
            <li> is a very good product after using it for 2 weeks my skin fells better and i see some line reduction around my eyes</li>
            <li> Softened my wrinkles, gave my skin a glow. Not difficult or too time consuming to use. I like it! It&#x27;s a nice alternative to very pricey LED facial machines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change yet...:(</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;ve had my Zeno for two years and have even travelled around the world with it.  I find it a very soothing and relaxing process at the end of the day.  I kind of forgot I had it, and then remembered and now I am using it every night.  I don&#x27;t use the serum much because there isn&#x27;t much and it absorbs too quickly.  I use Bio-Oil instead (and would use other skin oils too) which has better slip.  You tap the textured button and it hums to life, then runs for 3-4 minutes or so, then times out. I do one full session on my face and jawline, then let the unit cool down a bit, and then do my neck and décolletage.  I smooth it all over, and also linger to concentrate on trouble spots.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it because I find it is making my skin softer, firmer and just softens my appearance and evens out my tone overall.  It seemed to eat regular batteries, but when I switched to rechargeable batteries, the unit seems to runs for weeks without having to change them!  I just recharge them and reuse them again and again.  Please use rechargable batteries folks, and dispose of old batteries properly or by recycling them!  Please think of your environment.</li>
            <li> On off switch has an issue but it does get warm and appears to help.  Will keep using it to see if it really erases wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy this device after reading the reviews.  But I did some comparison shopping and other devices with a $400 pricetag had some of the same complaints that there was little or no results.  I&#x27;m happy to say after only a few days I have seen results.  I&#x27;m 44 and just over the last year I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my skin texture and thanks to my sleeping positions I now have what they call sleep wrinkles.  My sleep wrinkles are pretty deep and noticeable under my eyes, chin and upper lip. For someone that has had good skin all her life...this was horrifying.  But the Zeno seems to be working.  In a few days the lines are less noticeable and my skin seems to be firmer and have a more youthful glow.  For those of you who are afraid of botox or other injections this is a great product.  Based on previous ratings...if my device broke or stopped working...for $22....I would definitely buy another device.  And its a lot cheaper than most costmetic procedures.  In my opinion....its a little cosmetic gem!</li>
            <li> I only got to use my Zeno for 3 days. On the 3rd day it turned on and then went off and on, over and over again. I thought I would just let it go for a cycle and maybe it would quit. But NO! It just kept going. The only way to make it stop is to take out the battery. The only way to make it \\&quot;go\\&quot; (off/on, off/on) is to put the battery back in. I really liked the first 3 days with it but this last day has sucked!! I broke a nail trying to get the stupid battery out and that was the line in the sand for me!! I&#x27;m done!! AND since it was working so well in the beginning, I threw the box out. So now it&#x27;s all mine! If you are like me and think all the crazy things that are happening to everyone else with this thing won&#x27;t happen to you, let me just give you some advise-save the box!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I have found that this little thing, which I LOVE now, eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If it just flashes red light with no vibration, it needs new batteries. Also, if it&#x27;s low on batteries, it&#x27;s almost impossible to turn off. Basically, if you&#x27;re having trouble with it, change the batteries. Mine is working great now and is making a HUGE difference around my mouth and eyes!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I saw this on The Dr. Oz Show and decided to try it.  I think I see a reduction of wrinkles.  I enjoy the process.  My skin feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this little gadget at Target one day hoping that it&#x27;ll just tighten up my skin a bit. Every little bit would alright. But there were so many difficulties with this Zeno product. I used it a lot in a couple weeks and it just stopped working. The light flashes on and off and no heat comes off. After personally emailing the manufacture to send me a new one the same thing happened again. It wasn&#x27;t just ONE defective Zeno that I bought, the whole LINE is poorly made. Additionally, after much research, the amount and intensity that a home LED light gives off is incomparable to ones at a spa/clinic. So don&#x27;t waste even 30 bucks like I did because a company is preying on your hope of better-looking skin.</li>
            <li> The device is  very cheaply made and mine would not turn off until the battery was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if the LED light used in the device is the type that would be effective for skin improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 month, absolutely no change -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM:  Seller contacted me after reading the review above and provided for a quick refund.  Very ethical and high service standards.  I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It was sent to me very quickly and was in good condition but I have not seen any improvement in my skin. It is a waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> I truly believe in light therapy its collagen building benefits. This compact unit is great for travel when you don&#x27;t want to pack the big units.</li>
            <li> the face lotion was good. But the red laser did not work. It kept going off and on. It about drove me nuts. Maybe mine had a mechanical problem. I used the face cream and pitched the laser...Good luck</li>
            <li> The product does work. LED is known to help with wrinkles and clear your skin. The vibration causes warming and putting the combination of the light, vibration and warming I see a difference right away.  Using it every day for a week the fine lines and laugh lines are less.  How much I use it, often.  I have a two hour drive (four hour round trip) and I often use it as I drive so that could be some over kill there but what the heck.  Otherwise I use it about 10 minutes twice a week.  It feels so soothing and warm I enjoy it.  I use it before I go to sleep sometimes because of that or an excuse not to get out of bed in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Second use for the product is a pain reliever.  It has helped with headache and neck aches.  It doesn&#x27;t advertise that but it works.&lt;br /&gt;It is down a star because it-will-NOT-shut-off!!  It does have an auto shut off which is fine.  I think it runs for about five minutes.  It seems to have a sensitive ON button but the off button is a complete fail. Same button. You figure it. I would give it less stars but it works so well for my complexion that I won&#x27;t but the button thing is annoying.  When I go to lay it down the slightest touch turns it on. BUT that same button will not shut it back off. I have tried it all.  I am not, however, going to throw it on the ground as someone said they did.  I have to take the back off and pop the batteries.  Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;The serum that comes with it is nice. I do see a difference with that as well but I am also in love with just using virgin coconut oil. That really rocks for your skin!  One week of no zeno, just using the coconut and there is a difference in wrinkles. Between the two, seriously, it has taken 10 years off my face.  I paid full price (not happy) but now that the price is lowered ($7.92) I would go for it.  Even with the hinky button.  It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THIS.&lt;br /&gt;INITIALLY, I HAD TO REMOVE THE BATTERIES TO STOP IT.&lt;br /&gt;NOW, THE COVER WILL NOT COME OFF AND THE BATTERY DOES NOT TURN OFF.</li>
            <li> The warmth feels good but no wrinkle improvement</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good.  It won&#x27;t shut off unless you take out the batteries.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product work well and feels really good with the warmth on your face.  I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Was really curious about this product and really wanted to like it.  But, it fell apart in my hand and it won&#x27;t shut off unless I take the batteries out.  Really LOW quality.</li>
            <li> I love my Line Rewind. A note to the first commenter--it&#x27;s super easy to turn on and off: you tap the button once for on, twice for off. If it won&#x27;t go off when you tap it, you&#x27;re not tapping it quite hard enough.     I&#x27;ve been using the Line Rewind for a week. It&#x27;s probably not long enough to assess full/long-term results, but I can already tell a difference after I use it. The skin around my eyes--where all my wrinkles are!--looks firmer and smoother after I&#x27;ve used the device each night, and I swear my skin tone is looking more even and clear overall, like on my cheeks where I have some splotchiness and sun damage.    I find Line Rewind easy to use. The directions are simple and there&#x27;s nothing to it. I like that the warmth and slight vibration really make it feel like the serum is working its magic and getting absorbed well. I can&#x27;t wait to see further results! So far, so good!</li>
            <li> It actually works!!  It was so inexpensive that I was skeptical, but I try nearly every product in the beauty aisle for wrinkles or undereye circles.  It lessened the lines on my forehead and crows feet.  Not a lot of help with the crevasse that is between my eyebrows but they never advertised it as botox now did they...  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the product works just as well without the device.  It actually made my face a little sticky and pulled it funny to use the device.  I just buy the replacement serum and rub generously now!!</li>
            <li> After a week it over heated to the point of burning. Do not waste your money. It will not last long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how well it worked ,but  I would like to think it did.  Great value</li>
            <li> First off, I need to preface this review with these facts, I&#x27;m 46 years old, always had pore less, flawless skin. I&#x27;ve never had a suntan on my face (ever), never went outside without sunglasses (even when sunglasses weren&#x27;t cool) I&#x27;ve never done drug&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the age of 46 and menopausal symptoms begin to make your facial skin go a little bananas. Dull, lifeless skin and that begins a vicious cycle of issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter- Pure PANIC on my part. I don&#x27;t care about these thing&#x27;s typically, but I&#x27;m having a tough time with this &amp;#34;aging issue&amp;#34; and losing my beautiful youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d just started to notice a few issues with my skin. My pores had started getting larger where I could actually see them. I have a tiny wrinkle on the corner of my left eye (maybe from squinting inside my glasses) This had to be from where the sun would come in the left side of my sunglasses, causing me to squint I can only assume! Too many driving trips down to the coast in the summer I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My marionette lines are not too bad but visible and after some intense grief due to a few back to back deaths, I felt I was getting &amp;#34;grief face.&amp;#34; I was beginning to have a permanent looking frown on my face. IMO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Zeno Line Rewind Kit I cranked this little baby up and...&lt;br /&gt;I instantly noticed a wonderful warming feeling. I also noticed two days later in florescent lighting the tiny lines under my eyes were so much smaller and hardly less visible. The marionette lines seemed less and the crows feet line on my left eye was looking smoother. My pores...hardly visible..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also feeling firmness and my skin is looking more alive. This is only after 3 days of use with treatments of approximately 20-30 minutes each over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a red light thermal facial and I&#x27;m telling you, Zeno packs a punch depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for in help with your skin. Yeah, I know, for $22 bucks how much of a punch can this little Zeno pack? A lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will erase the signs of aging but &amp;#34;proper preparation&amp;#34; prior to aging like no drinking, drugs, sunscreen, proper eye wear in the sun, plenty of water, and refraining from sunbathing. The tan in the bottle has evolved if you must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course if you&#x27;ve want to be a slave to your Plastic surgeon, you can, but its not for me. I&#x27;m not having anyone put fillers in my face. Sorry! They give women a very bizarre look. No thank-you! One look at Joan Rivers or Priscilla Presley and that was enough to scare me straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people flip when I tell them my age (which is rarely) Most people say, I&#x27;m 28 or early 30&#x27;s which I&#x27;ll take.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not expecting to look 21....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this little Zeno gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the Zeno purchase. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve used every high dollar creme on the market. You know the one&#x27;s, who promise to give you all of these amazing, instant results and don&#x27;t. With all of their wording like, exotic special seaweed broth and pure pearl infusions. Oh the fancy wording! Get&#x27;s you every time..Our thought process starts a cycle of well, maybe this one will do the trick. Usually there is some improvement but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of dollars later, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion, it&#x27;s a part of the aging process and anything we can do once this begins to start-, be like Nike and Just do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creams will improve your skin texture/hydration but there is nothing in a bottle that will repair damage as far as deep wrinkles, loss of firmness, etc. without the use of fillers, major plastic surgery. The new facial gadgets on the market may or may not work. This is the current path I&#x27;m on so I figure I&#x27;d share my experiences with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, it&#x27;s heart breaking but we have to figure out a way to maintain what we have left to work with.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I believe I was very vigilant when I was younger in taking very good care of my skin. That is a plus, now I&#x27;m trying to catch these tiny hints of the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know for a fact, red light therapy does improve your skin and is very beneficial if you use the light therapy correctly. Use your Zeno daily if you can at least twice. Don&#x27;t expect instant results if you don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis. You&#x27;ve got to be devoted to the project!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my Zeno twice a day and sometimes I&#x27;ll use it when I want to work on that left crow&#x27;s feet wrinkle a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest slow and even strokes over your entire face in an upwards motion to get the most out of your Zeno.&lt;br /&gt;Work each area slowly for about 10 minutes. (Remember devotion/dedication) We didn&#x27;t get here in a flash!&lt;br /&gt;You will see RESULTS! That is the major difference between the Zeno and all of these other gadgets on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with my ZENO and would never promote it if I didn&#x27;t feel it would help your skin improve in some shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;A treatment that the Zeno deliver&#x27;s, will cost you $3-$5 thousand dollars per session The sessions are 30 to 60 minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That deep warmth you feel after each use of your Zeno is your collagen being recharged.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a device that is very affordable that will give you results I&#x27;d suggest purchasing the ZENO!&lt;br /&gt;While it comes with a tube of wrinkle cream, I&#x27;ve broken out the big guns already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand how the red light therapy works so I&#x27;m determined to get my expensive creams down in my dermis as far as I can.&lt;br /&gt;I use pure Plant based Squalane to massage the light on to my skin nightly. I then follow up with one of my emollient night creams. I always recommend using pant based ingredients on your face or pure oils/butters like Shea/Argon..In the 100% form, not a smidge in a cream claiming to have Shea?argon in it.The purer the better..We&#x27;re lucky to have available many pure form oils that do help our aging skin. I&#x27;ve used just about every oil/butter on the market. That is for another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend twice weekly in home dermabrasion to help your skin absorb your expensive products. This is key!&lt;br /&gt;If you use a similar regimen you will be very pleased with how you&#x27;re able to maintain your beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;It inevitable that we&#x27;re all going to age. My thing is to do it slowly and gracefully. Also, drinking at least a liter or more of water helps your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this post after 1 month of continuous use. Right now I&#x27;m giving Zeno 5 STARS! The Zeno does a have a few minor glitches with the light blinking at times and it will not turn on or off for a couple of seconds. For the money, I&#x27;m not complaining. These are &amp;#34;Minor issues&amp;#34; based on how expensive this treatment would be if I were going to a spa weekly! $3,000 to $5,000 Think about it.ounger in taking very good care of my skin.

            <li> I thought this was really great....until it stopped working after two weeks. New batteries, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now.  I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it.  My face does feel a little tighter when finished.  However, that could just be due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t moisturized yet and my skin dried out.  Also, the insert mentioned to be careful of being burned.  Perhaps my unit is malfunctioning because it never gets hot enough to even burn it&#x27;s way through tissue paper.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, overall apperance of skin was smoother, however there was little improvement on deeper wrinkles around my eyes.  The Device was easy to use and not at all uncomfortable.  The Serum absorbed quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week.  I like to use it at night, and again in the morning.  It seems to help with under eye puffiness, and makes the skin under my eyes look smoother.  I like the results so far.  I&#x27;m sure if you have moisturizers that you like, you can use this with it too, to work it into the skin better.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, the serum drys out fast, I may try coconut oil and vitamin E. The shipping was prompt and for $5 you aren&#x27;t it was worth a try, not giving up on it just yet.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more for friends.</li>
            <li> I used the Zeno three months straight and did not experience any line reduction at all. It felt good, like a light massage and the cream was pleasant. I&#x27;m giving it three stars anyway because it&#x27;s so inexpensive and a good facial massage is worth $6.00. I don&#x27;t think the red light is anything but a Christmas light tucked inside a pretty pink case but that&#x27;s just JMHO.</li>
            <li> This is great.  I love the little massager.  It warms my cream and it absorbs so well.  Will keep getting this.</li>
            <li> Device worked for about a week, then lights would flicker while running.Very inconsistent with light output. Great idea, poor design.</li>
            <li> Not working as well as it has when I first received.  Ive used this only a few times and even tried replacing the batteries but no improvement noticed.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Save your Money!!!  It is problematic, to say the least.  The Battery case takes a LOT of hard work to get off.  Then, it is very difficult to turn on,,, when on... it gets EXTREMELY HOT and can be too hot to use.  It will not turn off normally,,, take a lot of pounding to get it off,, then it turns back on over &amp; over &amp; over.  It also does not VIBRATE,,, just a sound.  Produces NO RESULTS,, even with daily,, sometimes 2 x day usage.  NONE.  I would say you don&#x27;t even get your money&#x27;s worth with this item.  And the seller says they have \\&quot;Never heard these issues before\\&quot;.  No replacement offer made.  Avoid this one and go for a Proven item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with cystic acne &amp; rosacea for years (took accutaine, topicals, antibiotics, etc.) and find that my cheeks are really looking better after a week of daily use. I&#x27;m so impressed at how quickly my cheeks have become less rosy. I would say they are 50% better in less than a week.  Wow! I&#x27;m now thinking about trying the blue LED light therapy to keep my face clearer from bacteria and acne. Maybe Zeno will create a blue light product soon.  Also - the zeno hot spot device works great as well.  It is a great way to deliver bacteria-killing light down to cysts. I&#x27;m so used to having painful skin from strong topicals and so now this is gentle and effective.  GREAT!</li>
            <li> After only using my Line Rewind for less than a month it went out on me like other users.  I have made several attempts to contact customer service via email and phone with no response.  According to the website they have a warranty and are suppose to get back to you in a timely manner.  No luck here!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of this product for wrinkles or any other kind of skin condition as it broke after about five uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Zeno sporadically, but it still seems as though it is working.  It was a very small finacial investment to try and bring back some youth to my face.  My skin definitely feels smoother, pores are more refined, and fine lines appear smaller.</li>
            <li> it it made my miss love it...then its a great product...she highly recommends it...prices is fantastic also...so purchase it and you will happy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t turn off, have to remove the battery, no virbation.  The serum that came with it, made the face dry, hard to use the Zeno tool.  No difference seen.</li>
            <li> The Zeno is compact and effective but it is quirky. The machine sometimes turns on by itself or will not turn off after use. Also the batteries provided with the machine were not usable.</li>
            <li> You cannot turn it off, you have to pull battery out in order for it to turn off or wait the 5 min and it will automatically shut off.  Other than that, I&#x27;ve only used it for a few nights.</li>
            <li> This item seems to have a life of its own. It turns on when I barely touch it, don&#x27;t touch it, or won&#x27;t start when I try to get it to start. Feels nice when it does work correctly, though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it, at this point, due to the inconsistent start-stop issue.</li>
            <li> Bought many and love them. Christmas gifts now for my favorite friends. Hint: they work for men too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it says. Save your money</li>
            <li> While this was a &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; (Somewhat, this is an OLD, retired product) the box arrived COMPLETELY smashed and the seller really couldn&#x27;t care less. Because this is a skin care product, I was wary of using the eye cream on my face as it is likely expired. I bough two, meaning one for a gift but was miffed when it arrived in a box that was NOT tall enough- therefor CRUSHED and looking awful!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase and try this item, however it stopped working after the first day.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> So far this works fine for me and I can see some crows feet have softened over the days. Very affordable.</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet if it&#x27;s quite effective, it might in the long run as with anything and a good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t brake your bank&lt;br /&gt;so I would say try it. Not harmful, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really works. Consistency... Consistency.u need to be patient but it is really worth it. Remember it takes time for change.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product pretty religiously but can say I haven&#x27;t realized any real results !  Will give it 6 weeks and see what happends</li>
            <li> I got this quickly it was what I ordered it worked and I happy with it. It vibration is a little weird but it feels good it warms up and you rub all over your face with a special lotion.</li>
            <li> I was easily able to turn the unit on and off, however it just randomly turns on whenever it wants to.  BUT when you want to use it, the light won&#x27;t stay on.  I&#x27;ve tried changing the batteries etc.  I found this a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Got the item was excited about using it. After several uses it started not turning off and as per several other reviews I had to remove the battery, still not worth the effort to return. Didn&#x27;t use it for awhile, then returned to using it and now it pulsates off and on constantly, very annoying, and not getting the effect of the constant red light. Have tried numerous times to contact Zeno about returning it as it has a 1 yr warranty and conveniently they do not have a corporate website only a sales site. Constant calls to the 800 number result in busy signals. So here I am still trying to return it 5 months later and I still cannot get thru. And I can no longer return it to Amazon. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY TO TRY AND RETURN IT.  AMAZON NEEDS TO DO MORE RESEARCH INTO THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS THEY OFFER</li>
            <li> My mom loved it! She purchased another one this year!</li>
            <li> Love it. It really works. Better, and cheaper than Clarisonic. no annoying buzzing. The wrinkle serum it comes with is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The Zeno Line Reduction broke after using the device the first time. Save your money and purchase a quality infrared red light. The science does work, yet it takes 12 weeks to see improvements in your skin. Unfortunately, I purchased the device as a gift and was embarrassed to hear the results of a broken kit.</li>
            <li> Only gave 1 star because they didn&#x27;t have a lower choice.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe all the people who gave this product a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a joke!  The unit vibrates and lights up....so does a kid&#x27;s toy.&lt;br /&gt;Never saw any change in my face after a week.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;wrinkle reduction&amp;#34; as it advertises. To tell the truth, I have a nice skin, no wrinkles just little tiny around the mouth. So, I was hoping, since I don&#x27;t have any big problems, those tiny wrinkles if not go away, at least, diminish. No... no difference so far...&lt;br /&gt;As for the device itself, like someone said in the previous reviews, it turns on by &amp;#34;just looking at it&amp;#34;. I can only turn it off by taking the batteries out.</li>
            <li> it softend skin but does not remove wrinkles so if that what you want this prouduct will not work but as for soft skin it does a nice job</li>
            <li> Got a great price on these (bought 3 as gifts), but the boxes were crushed.  This may have been why there was such a price reduction, but I guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This will be the third Zeno I buy. As the reviews say, this is not a sturdy product. But why do I keep buying I it? Out really works! I hope eventually the manufacturer works out the glitches. Usually it will break down within a month. If it didn&#x27;t break down I would give it 5 stars, but even knowing how these break, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. That&#x27;s how much I like this product. You really can see a difference with the fine lines on your skin. Don&#x27;t expect changes with deep wrinkles or creases though. You will love the serum that comes with the zeno but it&#x27;s very expensive. Good thing is you&#x27;ll get a discount coupon with your kit. After that I end up buying other less expensive serums.</li>
            <li> The reduction device that I am supposed to use with the serum doesn&#x27;t shut off. In order to shut it off I have to take a battery out.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 2 weeks now i do see some improvement in my fine line. ..............</li>
            <li> The system does not turn off. Unless I remove the cap and the battaries. Kind of a pain to keep up with so many parts. Can&#x27;t really say if it works because of this.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and it feels so good on the skin with the warming touch that it has.  My skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the serum did not cause me any irritation. The heat and vibration feels great and my skin did seem to look a little better however it does not last mine quit working after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> i would have given it 5 stars if it didnt drain out the batteries so fast. but other then that i love the warm feeling and the vibration from it. i did notice that it made my face feel more softer and i belive that with continued use it will help with my  skin discolorations and slight forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin?  Mine broke after 3 1/2 weeks and I could not get the blinking red lights to turn off.  I had to take the batteries out to get it to turn off and then when I put them back in it didn&#x27;t work.  I guess the old saying that you get what you pay for is true!  It&#x27;s garbage, and that&#x27;s where it ended up.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Dr Oz.  It was on a dermatological segment.  The Dermatologist said it worked, and Dr Oz was standing next to her asking questions and nodding his approval, so I thought, &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;.  Ok, admittedly, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but have some laugh lines and decided to see if I could get them to go away, or at least diminish.  I have used the Zeno for 3 months but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  Bummer, It&#x27;s the first time Dr Oz lied to me. lol  Oh, and sidenote, I take my batteries out in between uses, it&#x27;s been known to turn itself on and scare me to death in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I purchased this item, but wished I had never done so.  I used this Zeno nightly for a couple of weeks and saw no change at all. To make matters worse, after the first couple of times using the Zeno, the thing wouldn&#x27;t turn off and sometimes came on by itself. You&#x27;d be better off spending your money on a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> OK, but not what I expected</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars because I do like what this product does and I do see a difference around my eyes and mouth when using it however the power button is poorly placed and often causes me to turn it on or off inadvertently</li>
            <li> I tried it and was suprised to see it make a difference!  I did as instructed and took a before and 2 wk after face picture and can definately see and feel a change in my wrinkles!  Now if i could just get rid of those pesky age spots!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and great product. Will buy this product again.  Face is smooth after each use and wrinkles are smoothing as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this at first but I am pleased I did!  It certainly does what it states it is supposed to do, however, I struggle with turning it off!  The product works and feels great on your skin, but it does not turn off, which is kinda of frustrating. even when I put it down on the shelf after struggling to turn it off, it goes back on.  sometimes i just remove the batteries at night to turn it off and keep it off.</li>
            <li> Not using the lotion because it has ingredients I don&#x27;t like in it, I&#x27;m using my regular organic lotion. I think I&#x27;m seeing a gradual improvement so it&#x27;s an ongoing test. I think this product is cheap enough to give it a shot. I think like any other &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; product it depends on the person. I have had no problem with batteries. I know it will go through X amount of batteries and have bought the large economy pack. I removed the back of the unit and pop the batteries out after each use, I usually get about a week out of two batteries. Also I think there is a capacitor that has to bleed off after each use so that may be why it will usually go through one cycle at a time and if you try it again right away it usually just blinks.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and a week or more after I ordered these they cancelled my order. I was getting them at a great price, but after they cancelled they raised the price so I was unable to get them! Can you believe that? They have never offered them to me at the original cheap price, just cancelled and ignored me.</li>
            <li> The item is extremely difficult to switch on.  Battery installation was difficult (hard to part the sections of the device to install the battery.)  Once installed, the on/off doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to hit the device to get it to go on and then hit it again to stop its functioning.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ANY TIME WHEN YOU ARE READY TO GET TO FEEL GOOD WITH YOUR SELF AND WITH ANYONE YOU WANT TO BE WITH.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been faithful with using this product, so I really can&#x27;t evaluate it properly.</li>
            <li> Stopped working even after new batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this, twice daily, for seven days, but I already see a huge difference. Granted, I&#x27;m only 29 years old, and I have very few lines (mainly fine lines on forehead and the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet), but after one week, I&#x27;ve got none. NONE. I also have extremely dry skin (like menopause-dry), and my few fine lines are exaggerated by that fact. But this little guy, along with the serum, has actually made my skin more hydrated. I didn&#x27;t think that was possible without spending a huge amount of cash. The warmth it gives is very relaxing, and the humming makes me want to fall asleep. I also really love the pinky-iridescent look of the serum. It&#x27;s not tinted like makeup in any way; it just makes your skin look so lovely and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, the first time I used this, I had trouble turning it off, too. Here&#x27;s the trick: instead of tapping the power button twice very quickly, take a short break in between the taps. I usually tap, wait one second, tap again. That always works for me. Also, I don&#x27;t apply the serum all over my face at one time. It sinks in too quickly that way. Instead, I do it in sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably won&#x27;t make deep wrinkles disappear completely, but I think if you&#x27;ve got reasonable expectations, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product is going to help with wrinkle (minor ones around my eyes), but I do like the warming sensation while using it, and I feel that my face was able to absorb serums better when using this product to sweep on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s how I do it:&lt;br /&gt;cleansing &amp;#62; toning &amp;#62; serum &amp;#62; zeno device &amp;#62; zeno wrinkle cream &amp;#62; zeno device &amp;#62; night cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have time to use it at night, and I can&#x27;t say I use it every single night, and that&#x27;s probably why I haven&#x27;t seen noticeable improvements.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy at all .Also  Batteries were exploded In  package.</li>
            <li> I was excited at first to get this product and to try it. I have had wonderful success and results with Zeno&#x27;s Hotspot device.I was very disappointed and a bit frightend by the Rewind wrinkle reduction kit. It is very sensitve with the on/off button. The battery cover WILL NOT remove without turning on the device and it still does not come off. This worries me --- fire hazard. I did use it once and the next day it appeared that my freckles got MORE noticiable. This product is CRAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received mine two days ago so i have no review to state about results yet but i will just give my two cents for advice. I did alot of research on red light therapy..&amp; it takes at LEAST 3 months to see results. I&#x27;m guessing its the same with this device, as much as they want you to believe it will work right away..let&#x27;s be real here, no anti aging product is an overnight miracle. It takes consistentcy and patience! This is what i reccommend if you want to see any kind of results in the long run. Do it EVERYDAY for at LEAST 15 minutes, massage your face hard enuff with it &amp; leave if over the wrinkles long enuff for the light to sink in the skin. The directions say do﻿ it until the serum absorbs but it do it for wayyy longer, sometimes even a half hour. There is no need to constantly massage your face the whole time-just hover it over the wrinkle for a minute then switch to another area &amp; repeat repeat repeat. The red light and heat is enough for it. I see some reviews claiming the batteries run out fast with the Zeno.  Head over to Big Lots and buy a large pack of batteries, they are cheap there!&lt;br /&gt; But like i guess, this is NO OVERNIGHT miracle. All the reviews here claiming it doesn&#x27;t work probably only used it for a month &amp; gave up. Give it time &amp; be patient. Drinking lots of water and extra face massages don&#x27;t hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;As for the people having trouble getting it to turn OFF- it will not turn off if u press the button once!  Tap it twice and it will shut off or on. Simple!  Mine works just fine</li>
            <li> Found out it works great on sinus pressure. Did not notice a difference in skin condition.</li>
