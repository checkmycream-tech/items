            <li>I was a Cover gal all my life, but found &amp;#34;Fit Me&amp;#34; more consistent to my age without the oily appearance.</li>

            <li>It is the true definition of combination.</li>
            <li>It is a medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>It is super buildable.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin, mostly in my t-zone.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>The smell is minimal, its a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It really does help eliminate pores and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I do use a primer, but I&#x27;ve found that no matter what kind of foundation I use, this is a necessary step.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all though I feel it looks a bit more natural</li>
            <li>the more it sets on the skin and mixes with your natural oils.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this foundation it was love at first try for me</li>
            <li>and I blot it into my skin rather quickly because it does set fast.  </li>
            <li>This was the first maybelline foundation I&#x27;ve ever used I had seen it at target this past winter when it was first released and it was a great price</li>
            <li>For the coverage you get from this foundation, it should cost twice as much!</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>think this is okay, the color matched fine, but it feels heavy.</li>
            <li>I use a flat top makeup brush to apply it</li>
            <li>I am not sure I would wear it for a shoot but definitely a great deal for a daily and the the coverage is medium to full.</li>
            <li>In fact, you should consider investing in the entire fit me line....</li>
            <li>Very buildable without blotches which even my MAC pro foundations struggle with and take time to give you an even finish.</li>
            <li>If  desired I only use one layer,it lasted me through an 8 hour work day and still looked fantastic plus</li>
            <li>But other than that I love it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear foundation all that much anymore, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $$$ on my normal MAC foundation as it&#x27;ll rot before I go through</li>
            <li>It starts out nice and matte and it does seem to reduce the look of pores for an hour or so, but after that, I&#x27;m an oil slick.</li>
            <li>Last, and last for many hours.</li>
            <li>just so I always have it on hand.highly highly recommended</li>

            <li> than i started looking for cheaper drug store brand and decided to try the new poreless fit me 220, i havnt broken out since ive been using it for the past 3 wks.  </li>
            <li> My skin is naturally oily, and the matte finish keeps it relatively in control for a few hours.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it, it&#x27;s a little dark but lightens a shade once it is dry.  </li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not great foundation.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the case for me.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation all that much anymore, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $$$ on my normal MAC foundation as it&#x27;ll rot before I go through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is okay, the color matched fine, but it feels heavy. I don&#x27;t think it looked natural enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on with a makeup brush and also tried with my fingers. The makeup brush is definitely the way to go. It gives decent coverage and I&#x27;ll use it until it goes bad but it&#x27;s definitely not great foundation.</li>
            <li> I was highly impressed with this foundation.  I have normal to oily skin, mostly in my t-zone.  I do use a primer, but I&#x27;ve found that no matter what kind of foundation I use, this is a necessary step.  I use a flat top makeup brush to apply it and I blot it into my skin rather quickly because it does set fast.  It blends easily once it dries though.  It is a medium to full coverage foundation and you can build on it.  I was iffy on choosing a color to match my skin, but this color matched it perfectly.  When you first apply it, it&#x27;s a little dark but lightens a shade once it is dry.  I&#x27;m able to contour and apply blush w/o my foundation rubbing off.  I have acne prone skin and I only have to apply concealer to blemishes that are very red.  I haven&#x27;t had any reactions from wearing this foundation.  It does not cause me to break out which is awesome!  It&#x27;s super affordable and I absolutely love it!  It&#x27;s my favorite drug store foundation.  In fact, you should consider investing in the entire fit me line....setting powder and concealer.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am a foundation snob and I have picky skin. It is the true definition of combination. I received a sample of this and boy was I blown away at the quality of this stuff. Most drugstore makeup is anything but flawless, however this stuff is top shelf!  I am not sure I would wear it for a shoot but definitely a great deal for a daily and the the coverage is medium to full. Very buildable without blotches which even my MAC pro foundations struggle with and take time to give you an even finish. Bottom line I definitely recommend this stuff, they also offer a dewy finish but being I tend to prefer matte I am not sure I will invest in it yet, maybe in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  Covers well but is not heavy or oily.  It really does help eliminate pores and fine lines.  I use it every day and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I got this foundation for the hopes of matte skin and reduced pore size. Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the case for me. I have to say, it is very easy to blend. (I used a sponge) It starts out nice and matte and it does seem to reduce the look of pores for an hour or so, but after that, I&#x27;m an oil slick. I&#x27;m not oily and this made me look as if I&#x27;d rubbed bacon grease allover my face. It does feel light as I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing foundation at all.</li>
            <li> This was the first maybelline foundation I&#x27;ve ever used I had seen it at target this past winter when it was first released and it was a great price so I thought I&#x27;ve got nothing to lose and bought it.....let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised by this foundation it was love at first try for me which is amazing since I&#x27;m very very picky about what products I will let TOUCH MY FACE...I have the color 120,I&#x27;ve used this product with and without a primer it works just fine without a primer,I&#x27;d say the coverage is light to medium and it can be built up If  desired I only use one layer,it lasted me through an 8 hour work day and still looked fantastic plus the BEST PART NO ACNE BLEMISHES this is my New go to foundation,maybelline I&#x27;m very very impressed with this and the price is just phenomenal I&#x27;ve bought two more bottles just so I always have it on hand.highly highly recommended</li>
            <li> It came in great time! Was very impressed. Make sure to get a shade or two lighter than what you think, the buff beige was a bit too dark for me, which surprised me. I thought it&#x27;d be too light. But other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a foundation that suits my skin. The color was as expected and I really like how it has a matte finish. My skin is naturally oily, and the matte finish keeps it relatively in control for a few hours. However, after a while my skin does start to become shiny. Not my favorite shine-control foundation, but I do love the color.</li>
            <li> color was more yellow than expected but blends very well into the skin tone.  coverage is light and doesn&#x27;t last as long as expected but slightly longer than the normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I just did a blog post about this foundation. I highly recommend it. For the coverage you get from this foundation, it should cost twice as much! It is super buildable. It is a medium to full coverage. Its feels great on your skin. Last, and last for many hours. I even recommend wearing it without a primer. The smell is minimal, its a pleasant smell. Its not too thick, not too thin. This foundation makes my skin look airbrushed, and I have some really problem skin!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation i&#x27;ve tried! Its not thick and does not cake like a lot of other foundations. I would highly recommend this. I apply mine with a blending sponge and its sets instantly. Its easy to blend and you can build up the coverage.</li>
            <li> I love, Love, Love this foundation. No brake outs or irritations on my skin... the product came on time with out any problems what so ever.</li>
            <li> I was a Cover gal all my life, but found &amp;#34;Fit Me&amp;#34; more consistent to my age without the oily appearance. It lasts all day long without any touch up. The matte finish is perfect.</li>
            <li> Soft coverage, but excellent shine control</li>
            <li> Looks different from the picture</li>
            <li> compared to the original fit me foundation this doesn&#x27;t look oily when I apply it. The other one does&lt;br /&gt;It stays on longer too, I do have combination skin but I will definitely re purchase I just wish it was one shade lighter which I can&#x27;t even find in the store</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation overall. It&#x27;s a nice consistency and blends really nicely. What I like the most is that it sets almost immediately when you buff it in with a brush so you don&#x27;t have to endure that tackiness that never sets properly like how to revlon colorstay does on my skin anyway. I do  feel that the foundation is pretty poreless and matte but not flat it doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all though I feel it looks a bit more natural the more it sets on the skin and mixes with your natural oils. I have pretty oily skin and this lasts me pretty much all day which is a lifesaver because everything on my skin starts to smudge and become an oily mess after a while. My only complaint is that the shade natural beige is a bit too dark for me I feel like it oxidizes a bit next time I&#x27;ll get one or two shades lighter and it should be perfect. This is definitely my new favorite drugstore foundation. You can&#x27;t really beat it for the price, it has really good coverage and lasting power and makes your skin look flawless. I love it. I recommend it for everyone but mostly for the oily skin sufferers.</li>
            <li> Love this product and how it smooths out my face.</li>
            <li> first time tryin a drug store foundation and it work great. normally i wear mac studio fixfluid nc35 and it was starting to break out my face. than i started looking for cheaper drug store brand and decided to try the new poreless fit me 220, i havnt broken out since ive been using it for the past 3 wks.  and its the perfect match for my face.</li>
            <li> I tried mac foundation and honestly I would rather use this for the price, it&#x27;s great coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel cakey or thick, great product for price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 with normal skin. This foundation made my pores disappear and lasted pretty much all day long. No shine, no smearing - just nice looking skin. I used a primer and also used Maybelline BB cream as a moisturizer before applying foundation. Product delivers!</li>
