            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the face wash, but this is a better buy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you want something that is going to dry up those pimples then this is a great product!</li>
            <li>Good price &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>It makes skin feel smooth and even-textured, with a very mild cooling sensation from the mint.</li>
            <li>This product plus sulphur soap (which can be found on Amazon for cheap) have cured my acne.</li>
            <li>I use 10% sulphur ointment (that Also can be bought on Amazon for cheap)</li>
            <li>Great Product for daily scrub</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>If I do have a break out (which is very rare)</li>
            <li>The scrub is so smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and has a good natural scent and so fresh after scrubbed.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for 20 minutes then wash it off using the Acnedote scrub and my skin feels SO soft and healthy afterwards!</li>
            <li>I love that this face wash gently exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, smells really good, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Great face wash, we use it daily and really like it, and so do our friends.</li>
            <li>I use this scrub daily on my face, chest and back - it works great!  </li>
            <li>I love the scrub and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin and on top of that, I have super sensitive  skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and great on my greasy Italian skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super gentle.  </li>
            <li>It removes oil very effectively and doesn&#x27;t cause excessive dryness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after the first week my face adapted to it and it started clearing the pimples.</li>
            <li>Will definitely repurchase when I run out :)</li>
            <li>so I scrub with a light rotating motion (really sensitive skin or severe acne</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and free of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>when they stopped using it awhile back, their skin worsened again, started using it once more and improved within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>dry skin that is very easily agitated.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves me feeling clear and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It can be used everyday and really helps your skin so it can do its&#x27; natural shedding process for healthy, glowing skin!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone with mild/moderate acne that wants to improve skin texture, glow and keep blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li>Love this product and I keep it on hand back to back.</li>
            <li>When I do get an occasional pimple,  this scrub dries it up quickly and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Acne medicine works differently for everyone, luckily this works for my kids.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural!!</li>
            <li>This time i ordered 3 because i used it very frequently.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with this one or twice a day and it does wonders to help keep breakouts to a minimum, my favorite so far, and it uses a natural exfoliate which naturally degrades instead of building up in waterways and creating problems for fish and small aquatic creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this keeps my skin clear and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a week because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it totally gets rid of my problem acne (nothing really has), but it does help.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and eczema so a lot of acne treatments give me rashes.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for my teenage daughters and it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne for a long while now and most topical treatments that use benzoyl peroxide leave my face dry and flaky, but Acnedote from Alba uses salicylic acid, which makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li>I am 35yrs old and have normal/oily combo skin with fairly mild acne (a few pimples each month)</li>
            <li>No other product like it.</li>
            <li>may not like due to too much abrasion).</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has ever worked to clear my skin and fade the red from my skin.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it my face dried up and became very irritated ( which is common when I use new products).</li>
            <li>I bought the tree-pack which costs about as much as one 8 oz unit at a typical retail store.</li>

            <li> It works well some days and other days</li>
            <li> It works well on my face but makes my chest and back breake out :/</li>
            <li> I like to follow up with a few drops of Jojoba oil which I message into the skin keeping it from getting dry and also helping to fight breakouts as it helps make the skin breathable and is anti-microbial.</li>
            <li> I still get a few pimples here</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so I use this often in the summer and about once a week in the winter, usually on my face.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday for my annoying adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my acne worse.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and I keep it on hand back to back.</li>
            <li> Use this for my face and body. Must use lotion or coconut oil in winter as it dries out my skin. I&#x27;ve used this for about a year. My face has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s gentle, smells really good, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft afterwards.  I have oily/combination skin and on top of that, I have super sensitive  skin so products that contain salicylic  acid just aren&#x27;t that effective for me.  However;  I do notice a bit of improvement  in my skin when using this product.  I use this once or twice a week because of my sensitive skin.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have combination skin, so I use this often in the summer and about once a week in the winter, usually on my face. Great price.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my acnedote for about 2 weeks.. My face started to break out. I guarantee I will never run out again. This leave my skin flawless!</li>
            <li> I love the scrub and highly recommend this product. I am so happy that I took a chance and purchased.</li>
            <li> It works well some days and other days I feel like it makes my acne worse. It works well on my face but makes my chest and back breake out :/</li>
            <li> The only face wash I use. It&#x27;s all natural and great on my greasy Italian skin.</li>
            <li> Its my second repeating purchase. This time i ordered 3 because i used it very frequently. 3 times a week for my back (acne) and twice a week for my face. The scrub is so smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and has a good natural scent and so fresh after scrubbed.</li>
            <li> Have been using this face wash for about a year and it works great. I don&#x27;t like how it stings if it gets in your eyes though.</li>
            <li> This product plus sulphur soap (which can be found on Amazon for cheap) have cured my acne. I have had severe acne since I was 12 and been on everything from Retin-A to Proactive to 2 rounds of Acutane. This is the only thing that has ever worked to clear my skin and fade the red from my skin. I wash my face with the sulphur soap every morning and use the Acnedote scrub every night that&#x27;s it! If I do have a break out (which is very rare) I use 10% sulphur ointment (that Also can be bought on Amazon for cheap) I leave it on for 20 minutes then wash it off using the Acnedote scrub and my skin feels SO soft and healthy afterwards!</li>
            <li> Too amazing I am on my 4th bottle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 10. Not only on my face, but also my back and chest. This scrub and lotion, purchased separately, has made of world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t dry me out like the others have, and I get the added bonus of knowing the product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with this one or twice a day and it does wonders to help keep breakouts to a minimum, my favorite so far, and it uses a natural exfoliate which naturally degrades instead of building up in waterways and creating problems for fish and small aquatic creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves me feeling clear and fresh. I like to follow up with a few drops of Jojoba oil which I message into the skin keeping it from getting dry and also helping to fight breakouts as it helps make the skin breathable and is anti-microbial. Dessert Essence is my preferred brand of Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> Great Product for daily scrub</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i have tried many during many years.</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care!</li>
            <li> Great face wash, we use it daily and really like it, and so do our friends. Purchased 2 more.</li>
            <li> If you want something that is going to dry up those pimples then this is a great product! I have very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;and dry skin that is very easily agitated. The first week I used it my face dried up and became very irritated ( which is common when I use new products). But after the first week my face adapted to it and it started clearing the pimples. I still get a few pimples here and there but it has worked wonders controlling my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Recently my local store stopped carrying this brand but I was happy to get such a good deal here!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for a long while now and most topical treatments that use benzoyl peroxide leave my face dry and flaky, but Acnedote from Alba uses salicylic acid, which makes all the difference in the world. It removes oil very effectively and doesn&#x27;t cause excessive dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of the product in the multiple packs is noteworthy as well. I bought the tree-pack which costs about as much as one 8 oz unit at a typical retail store.</li>
            <li> Great product, clears up my chest acne after just one use. No other product like it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels when I use this scrub. Cruelty free and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have acne on my back . I tried so many things to tackle this . I saw this and thought why not. It worked perfect. With this and a back scrubber my back cleared up in 3 days. It&#x27;s amazing !!!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! Will definitely repurchase when I run out :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scrub! I love the smell (mix of bergamont, citrus, mint) and I love the way it makes my skin feel afterward. It makes skin feel smooth and even-textured, with a very mild cooling sensation from the mint. It is a bit abrasive so I scrub with a light rotating motion (really sensitive skin or severe acne may not like due to too much abrasion). I am 35yrs old and have normal/oily combo skin with fairly mild acne (a few pimples each month) but this keeps my skin clear and feeling refreshed. It can be used everyday and really helps your skin so it can do its&#x27; natural shedding process for healthy, glowing skin! I would highly recommend to anyone with mild/moderate acne that wants to improve skin texture, glow and keep blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I can&#x27;t say that it totally gets rid of my problem acne (nothing really has), but it does help.  I love the smell. It lathers great!! A little goes a long ways. And it&#x27;s natural!!</li>
            <li> I love that this face wash gently exfoliates.  It has been a perfect replacement to using the face wash with beads that are horrible for the environment.  I never want to use those again.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday for my annoying adult acne.  I have sensitive skin and eczema so a lot of acne treatments give me rashes.  This stuff is super gentle.  I&#x27;ve also used the face wash, but this is a better buy.</li>
            <li> great product; smells good, natural ingredients, cleans face well</li>
            <li> I use this scrub daily on my face, chest and back - it works great!  It leaves my skin feeling soft and free of breakouts.  When I do get an occasional pimple,  this scrub dries it up quickly and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Acne medicine works differently for everyone, luckily this works for my kids. I buy this for my teenage daughters and it seems to work really well. Their acne is not completely gone with it, but they both have seen improvement to their skin while using this in combination with the deep cleanser.  One way we know that it does help, when they stopped using it awhile back, their skin worsened again, started using it once more and improved within a couple of days. No dryness of their skin, no irritation at all. We will definitely continue to buy as long as it keeps working.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Fast shipping. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome scrub-I love it! Good price &amp; fast shipping</li>
