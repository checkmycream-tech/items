            <li>My grandson&#x27;s love these</li>
            <li>Might have to get another set for Christmas. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to stay and monitor my son to make sure he brushes his teeth.</li>
            <li>overs b/c most boys forget to bring a toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>Sure, you can find cheaper toothbrushes, but how many &#x27;inspire&#x27; your child to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>The flashing light timer was nice though.</li>
            <li>but he loved it so much that I got one for myself!</li>
            <li>My grandson is a big Star Wars faan and thinks this is the greatest thing ever, very neat gift and good way to get kids to brush teeth.</li>
            <li>They are light up light sabers!</li>
            <li>Amazingly the battery on the first lasted longer than the bristles.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t light.</li>
            <li>He does it until the light turns off.</li>
            <li>Neither of them light up.  </li>
            <li>Ah well, was a cute and fun gift.</li>
            <li>(with the lights off for maximum enjoyment of the flashing light feature), I found that it encouraged longer brushing, as it flashes for a minute before stopping.</li>
            <li>this came right on time for my friend&#x27;s gift and she loves it :)</li>
            <li>Push the timed button, and they have a light up toothbrush for 1 minute - makes brushing fun!</li>
            <li>The light is great because it gives my kid an idea of how long to brush.  </li>
            <li>We love brushing our teeth together in the dark and lighting up our toothbrushes lol</li>
            <li>It lights up really cool, and the light stays on for a minute</li>
            <li>Has a great flashing light timer to remind kids how long to brush  and adds fun to the morning ritual</li>
            <li>They are not only cute and fun, but such an awesome way to get your kid to brush their teeth!</li>
            <li>My son and his friends love this light up light saber toothbrush (we keep new ones on had for sleep</li>
            <li>Cool product.</li>
            <li>The bristles wore out pretty quickly, and the light saber function died as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap product for cheap, so don&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna lie, my son loves a new toothbrush regardless of style/color, but the ones that keep him brushing for a length of time are fantastic!</li>
            <li>When I did this for the first time, he was really excited.  </li>
            <li>When these wear out I will definitely replace them with more!</li>
            <li>Fun product for dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>This item is so fun</li>
            <li>It worked... &amp; now all 3 kids have fun using them before bed.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Made my grandson brush his teeth for at least a minute and he loved doing it!  </li>
            <li>so the whole thing is cool.</li>
            <li>mom is super jealous and wants one now.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, but had a hard to get it the work good!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, came exactly as described, thank you!</li>
            <li>Not only are they brushing longer but better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>turned low :)</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I ordered two for my grand children.</li>
            <li>Since it is a standard head though, his teeth were not getting very clean.  </li>
            <li>but the fact the night just blinks as a count down instead of staying on and then turning off kind of bother me a bit</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Since then, he refuses to use his old Elmo brush and only wants to use this light saber.  </li>
            <li>I have two of the same color--not easy when both kids start using them at the same time.</li>
            <li>The entire top half, including the plastic containing the brush portion, flashes for one minute; my son brushes his teeth until it shuts off.</li>
            <li>He is 5 years old and with a moving head brush, he has no problem cleaning his teeth.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old son loves Star Wars.</li>
            <li>My Dad (age 49) got green, while I (21) opted for the blue, preferring more of a Luke Skywalker look.</li>
            <li>You really have to push button to get them to light and not sure how long they will hold up.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is hard for him to hit the button, which is slightly difficult to hit in the right spot, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li>small button on the brush causes the red part to light up and blink.  </li>
            <li>(Is it worth the few dollars to return it?  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my nephews ages 7 and 9 who usually think 20 seconds is long enough to brush but with the flashing light there is no more arguing and after they brush they usually enjoy a &amp;#34;light saber&amp;#34; fight.</li>
            <li>It is a very cool toothbrush but the light never lit up, very disappointing.</li>
            <li>Only problem is now my son wants to brush in the dark now.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft which our dentist recommends, but they don&#x27;t last long now that my son has braces.  </li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve only had it for a week and a couple of times, my son has bragged about pressing the button twice so he could brush twice as long...</li>
            <li> Trying to get my kid to stand still long enough to brush his teeth is a challenge.  </li>
            <li> The bristles wore down much faster than other toothbrushes.</li>

            <li> They come in red and blue (and I think green as well.)</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my nephew who is a major Star Wars fan, after his mom told me she was having trouble getting him to brush his teeth.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been hard for me to get my 6 year old son to brush his teeth and this brush has helped a lot.</li>

            <li> Not worth the time and effort to return it.</li>
            <li> but they brush faster while watching the handle move in the dark.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping, but had a hard to get it the work good!</li>
            <li> Product was defective. Didn&#x27;t light. Not worth the time and effort to return it. Threw it away. Bad product. Disappointed kid.</li>
            <li> My child loved it how it lightup when brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> Was given refund because does not light up</li>
            <li> Cute but the fact the night just blinks as a count down instead of staying on and then turning off kind of bother me a bit</li>
            <li> My grandson&#x27;s love these and now I only have to call them once to come brush their teeth. Not only are they brushing longer but better. Of course we do have to shut out lights while they brush but they brush faster while watching the handle move in the dark. The negative is that they are difficult to turn on. You really have to push button to get them to light and not sure how long they will hold up. After only two weekends of use one of three has to be smacked to get to work. Would return but didn&#x27;t keep wrapper. I do think they are a bit overpriced but will probably replace when needed since I no longer have to keep telling them to keep brushing since time is not up.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my nephews ages 7 and 9 who usually think 20 seconds is long enough to brush but with the flashing light there is no more arguing and after they brush they usually enjoy a &amp;#34;light saber&amp;#34; fight.</li>
            <li> I got this (along with other stuff) for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday as sorta a joke but he loved it so much that I got one for myself! We love brushing our teeth together in the dark and lighting up our toothbrushes lol</li>
            <li> Must have for your Star Wars fans! My sons LOVED theirs! Might have to get another set for Christmas. :)</li>
            <li> Not only did this unit break after only two uses... But the battery compartment is sealed, so there is no way of replacing in case the unit accidentally turned on in shipment. It is a waste of money. Purchase a more expensive one that you can replace heads and battery</li>
            <li> I give it 3 starts because although it does what a toothbrush should, it isn&#x27;t a moving head electric toothbrush.  The light is great because it gives my kid an idea of how long to brush.  Since it is a standard head though, his teeth were not getting very clean.  He is 5 years old and with a moving head brush, he has no problem cleaning his teeth.  Just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> My son enjoys it alot</li>
            <li> Made my grandson brush his teeth for at least a minute and he loved doing it!  Fun product for dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little brother. I haven&#x27;t heard if it worked out or anything. It&#x27;s a cheap product for cheap, so don&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> This item is so fun I bought it for my Star Wars loving boyfriend as a novelty item, he loved it! I only wish that I could choose the color.</li>
            <li> Broken when we received it, it never one lit up.  (Is it worth the few dollars to return it?  Probably not.  Disappointing.)</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. I don&#x27;t have to stay and monitor my son to make sure he brushes his teeth. He does it until the light turns off.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3-year-old nephew, who loves Star Wars but totally hates brushing his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small button on the brush causes the red part to light up and blink.  When I did this for the first time, he was really excited.  Since then, he refuses to use his old Elmo brush and only wants to use this light saber.  Sometimes it is hard for him to hit the button, which is slightly difficult to hit in the right spot, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> Just got this toothbrushes at other retail store. They had 3 different colors and about half the price. My boys loves this!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 for my 3 young kids &amp; received 2 blue &amp; 1 green. One did not light up so (to avoid fighting &amp; tears) I popped off the sealed cap on the bottom with a butter knife &amp; inspected the guts. I ended up taking out the 3 little batteries &amp; putting them back in in a different order. It worked... &amp; now all 3 kids have fun using them before bed. Cool product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a Star Wars junkie and while I ordered this a few weeks ago, I just gave it to his yesterday for his birthday. It is super cute and he loved it but we were both disappointed to see that it did not work! The battery is dead and it appears as though the button had been pressed hundreds of times through the packaging and was all worn!</li>
            <li> My son and his friends love this light up light saber toothbrush (we keep new ones on had for sleep overs b/c most boys forget to bring a toothbrush).  They come in red, green and blue for variety.  The bristles are soft which our dentist recommends, but they don&#x27;t last long now that my son has braces.  So, I am replacing his again...which I don&#x27;t mind...however, price here is twice as much as big box store....so I&#x27;m getting them at W-world instead.</li>
            <li> Perfect stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  Neither of them light up.  How do I return them?</li>
            <li> Dead non replicable batteries. Bought two. Both were crap.</li>
            <li> Love star wars this was perfect for my husband&#x27;s collection</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> this came right on time for my friend&#x27;s gift and she loves it :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard for me to get my 6 year old son to brush his teeth and this brush has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> My some loves it.  We couldn&#x27;t find it in the store, so I ordered online.  It lights up really cool, and the light stays on for a minute so your child knows when to stop brushing.  Only problem is now my son wants to brush in the dark now. Lol.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift, so don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> My son LOVES this toothbrush. The entire top half, including the plastic containing the brush portion, flashes for one minute; my son brushes his teeth until it shuts off. The bottom half is designed to look like a light-saber handle- so the whole thing is cool. Sure, you can find cheaper toothbrushes, but how many &#x27;inspire&#x27; your child to brush their teeth. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, my son loves a new toothbrush regardless of style/color, but the ones that keep him brushing for a length of time are fantastic! We&#x27;ve only had it for a week and a couple of times, my son has bragged about pressing the button twice so he could brush twice as long... can&#x27;t argue with that. Well worth the price, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a toothbrush. There is no light and there is no saber. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bristles wore out pretty quickly, and the light saber function died as well. Ah well, was a cute and fun gift.</li>
            <li> Trying to get my kid to stand still long enough to brush his teeth is a challenge.  Not with this toothbrush.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> The bristles wore down much faster than other toothbrushes. The flashing light timer was nice though.</li>
            <li> It is a very cool toothbrush but the light never lit up, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son loves Star Wars. I bought this as one of his birthday gifts, the only problem I had with it is that the battery died the same day we received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> it was a fun gift for my husband and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Wish it had a CHOICE of colors.  I have two of the same color--not easy when both kids start using them at the same time.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these for my twins a few months back. They are not only cute and fun, but such an awesome way to get your kid to brush their teeth! They are light up light sabers! They come in red and blue (and I think green as well.) Push the timed button, and they have a light up toothbrush for 1 minute - makes brushing fun! Especially cool with the lights turned low :) When these wear out I will definitely replace them with more! The price on amazon is great too, I think they are around $6.99 in the store!</li>
            <li> I just moved back home from college for the summer and my Mom made the mistake of sending my Dad and I to the grocery store alone. We returned with these incredible toothbrushes! My Dad (age 49) got green, while I (21) opted for the blue, preferring more of a Luke Skywalker look. We ALMOST passed them up in the store, until we discovered that they lit up! Leaving it in the store was not an option after this discovery.&lt;br /&gt;That night as I brushed my teeth (with the lights off for maximum enjoyment of the flashing light feature), I found that it encouraged longer brushing, as it flashes for a minute before stopping. Sensational!&lt;br /&gt;My mom is super jealous and wants one now. We offered to get her the red one, but she doesn&#x27;t want to be a sith. My brothers pretend they aren&#x27;t jealous and that they are \\&quot;embarrassed\\&quot; of us, but I know the truth. They&#x27;re just jealous that the force is not with them when they brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my nephew who is a major Star Wars fan, after his mom told me she was having trouble getting him to brush his teeth. Not a problem anymore!</li>
            <li> Has a great flashing light timer to remind kids how long to brush  and adds fun to the morning ritual</li>
            <li> My kid loves this (it&#x27;s our second one) The lightsaber flashes the length of time he should be brushing.  Amazingly the battery on the first lasted longer than the bristles.  I&#x27;m happy we found another one.</li>
            <li> The battery only lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> My grandson is a big Star Wars faan and thinks this is the greatest thing ever, very neat gift and good way to get kids to brush teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, came exactly as described, thank you!</li>
            <li> Very cute product.  My only problem is that I ordered two for my grand children. I was Hoping to get two different colors and I received two of the same color.  I wish I had a choice of colors or at least they could have given me two different colors.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friends son for his birthday who loves Star Wars. I know he&#x27;ll love it!! A must for all boys who love Star Wars!!!!!!!!</li>
