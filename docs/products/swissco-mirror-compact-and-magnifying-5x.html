            <li>The product is billed as a 5x magnification mirror, but as you can see in the attached photo showing the regular and &amp;#34;5x&amp;#34; mirror, the reflections are almost exactly the same size when close enough to be useful.  </li>

            <li> Of little value as I had plenty of giveway mirrors from my makeup counter.  </li>

            <li> ; in diameter, round.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, compact, takes up very little room in my desk drawer at work.</li>

            <li> Small sized but workable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need these mirrors for what I suppose is their usual purpose, to help women apply makeup.</li>

            <li> this mirror is very small and makes it hard to pluck your eye brows.</li>
            <li> It is very small, but works well as a purse mirror.</li>
            <li> Very small magnifying mirror : 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> the case has a slightly rubberized feeling to it without feeling weird.</li>
            <li> It is very very hard to get it to close</li>
            <li> Very disappointed; don&#x27;t get this if you are actually looking for something to help you see details on your face up close.  </li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s 2 sided and folds on itself, it doesn&#x27;t get dirty or smudged.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to move on the carpet.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed in the size of the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> so you can see what that annoying thing in your eye is and get it out-</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Ummmm, the magnifying mirror doesn&#x27;t really magnify. At all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is a 5x mirror. It&#x27;s barely different from the regular mirror. Plus the mirror is too small. You have to hold it at arm&#x27;s length to see your whole face. If you want a mirror to touch up makeup without seeing your whole face, then you might like this.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works great, wife uses it to thread her embroidery machine. Just what she needed to see in the confined space.</li>
            <li> This compact mirror is exactly what I was looking for! I love the rubberized case....not easy to find in stores. Perfection!</li>
            <li> Great for Bug Out Bag.</li>
            <li> I like the sleek design of the case and the matte finish.  I thought it was exactly what I was looking for until I opened the case.  The regular mirror is the size of the case but the magnifying mirror is a smaller circle that reduces the viewing area making it difficult for me to see.  Based on the reviews I ordered two mirrors but I&#x27;m disappointed in the size of the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror, solid and snaps closed nicely. Perfect for my shaving kit, might be a little small for a lady, but who knows. Would definetly order more if I needed them. Great price too!</li>
            <li> The compact fits in my purse perfectly. The magnification is good. Great for applying lipstick.</li>
            <li> Very good quality....super soft...Im going to order a few more for my bags...</li>
            <li> good, but the hinge did loosen over use and now won&#x27;t stay open on its own so I have to prop it open if I&#x27;m trying to use it to sit upright.</li>
            <li> I just needed a mirror, something small and cheap, and this fit the bill. I don&#x27;t travel with it though; it just sits in a drawer, so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve pressure-tested it.</li>
            <li> snazzy! fits in a pocket, sturdy construction, one normal and one magnifying mirror. the case has a slightly rubberized feeling to it without feeling weird. i like it very much.</li>
            <li> Swissco Mirror compact:&lt;br /&gt;This works great. Stays open when needed.  Rubberized. Very handy little mirror. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality. Yeah!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect compact for applying make-up, tweezing eyebrows, and the purse. Works perfectly all the way around.  :-)</li>
            <li> Mum loves it she says it&#x27;s perfect for travelling and carrying around in her purse for tweezing etc</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s an inexpensive item, but I was expecting it to close. It&#x27;s a snap close type of thing that does not snap...&lt;br /&gt;I kept it anyway because the mirrors are ok.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, for traveling.  Case seems sturdy, snaps shut and has a rubberized feel.</li>
            <li> Nice little mirror..not much of a magnifying side.</li>
            <li> What a great little compact mirror! Not only do I get ONE view of my face, but TWO! That&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s big enough to hold and to let you see more of your face, but small enough to keep in the pocket of your tightest jeans or your makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth every cent. Buy one for yourself and one for a friend! ;)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this mirror.  It was reasonably priced and came quickly.  Some reviewers thought it was too small, but it is a great accessory to even a small handbag.  I like the case because it appears to be more durable than some of the hard plastic covers that come with most compact mirrors.</li>
            <li> Great small mirror for any purpose! Well encased, and very clear!</li>
            <li> I did keep it in my bag for a while but then I never used it and used my phone as a mirror instead... I still like it though.</li>
            <li> looks good, feels soft, fits well. i was pleasantly surprised. cute little thing you&#x27;d be happy you bought.. . .</li>
            <li> The product is billed as a 5x magnification mirror, but as you can see in the attached photo showing the regular and &amp;#34;5x&amp;#34; mirror, the reflections are almost exactly the same size when close enough to be useful.  I had to hold it at arm&#x27;s length to get any meaningful magnification, and then it&#x27;s too far away to use realistically.  Very disappointed; don&#x27;t get this if you are actually looking for something to help you see details on your face up close.  (My wife has an identical mirror although we aren&#x27;t sure what brand it is, and hers actually magnifies, so perhaps this one is a cheap knockoff?  or defective?  Either way, I&#x27;m returning it.)</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a guy...but I like to make a quick check before dashing into a meeting with lunch dangling from my face. A good-quality folding mirror and while not bursting with testosterone, the rubberized case is completely appropriate for guys who what to look good and not start any office rumors.</li>
            <li> this mirror is very small and makes it hard to pluck your eye brows.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on the go make-up applying!  Looked everywhere in town for one, only found 10x or 15x, way too strong, this one is just right!</li>
            <li> This was just what I wanted to carry in my purse.  It comes in handy if you need a magnifying mirror to get something out of your eye.  It is just the right size.  Not to large or heavy.  I needed it to use when I travel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price with timely delivery.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be bigger for some reason...guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough.  It is very small, but works well as a purse mirror. And because it&#x27;s 2 sided and folds on itself, it doesn&#x27;t get dirty or smudged. This product arrived quickly, well packed and intact.</li>
            <li> I bought a large number of these mirrors to give out as gifts for a specific purpose. They were perfect! Small sized but workable. The case keeps the mirrors clean and safe from breakage. I am quite pleased with them and would not hesitate to order them again if I needed a hand mirror of some kind.</li>
            <li> Great size for travel, or for daily purse use, nice price, seems sturdy enough, it&#x27;ll certainly do!</li>
            <li> This is a great little pocket mirror.  I liked it so much that I went back and bought another one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need these mirrors for what I suppose is their usual purpose, to help women apply makeup. I needed them for my son who has a form of cerebral palsy and needs a mirror in front of him while dining. I ordered four of these (he&#x27;s a little rough on mirrors), not expecting much, given the low price, but was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. These little mirrors are rather well-made and perfect for our purpose. Shipping was fast, an email to the seller was answered very quickly (unlike many vendors), and the product was great.  I&#x27;m impressed with the mirrors and the seller. Hope to do business with them again.  old arkiedan</li>
            <li> Nice size.  Love this little compact.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product; great quality for the price.  The rubberized finish is ingenious, and I like that there is a 5X magnifying mirror included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ust what I needed! It&#x27;s well made, compact, takes up very little room in my desk drawer at work.</li>
            <li> We bought a chair that we move out whenever we watch tv.  It was very difficult to move on the carpet.  With these it&#x27;s truly a breeze to move.  Hard to believe they work so well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for purse.  Good size.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, and a nice textured case.  Perfect for contact lens wearers when backpacking, which is my intended purpose for this mirror.</li>
            <li> Simply love the matte black exterior finish. Medium sized sleek compact mirror to help those wanting perfect makeup.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Compact mirror that fits very well, inside of my purse. It is quality made and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very small magnifying mirror : 2&amp;#34; in diameter, round. Smaller than outside case. 1X mirror is square, almost the size of outside case. I wish 5X would be same size.  For me: such a small 5x mirror defeats the purpose of buying 5X.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a 5x mirror to help me if I got an eyelash in my eye at work, or out somewhere.  I could not be more disappointed.  2x at best.  Of little value as I had plenty of giveway mirrors from my makeup counter.  If something it cheaply priced, beware.</li>
            <li> It is very very hard to get it to close and if I do I can&#x27;t open it. The mirror is not 5X. I&#x27;m thinking of returning this.</li>
            <li> All kids with braces need one!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, donÂ´t buy&lt;br /&gt;I donÂ´t think is 5X</li>
            <li> very good size but mag mirror could have been larger</li>
            <li> Really nice mirror in a nice case - perfect size.  The  black case color is especially appealing for the military/tactical market.  Fits well in a field first aide kit.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best mirrors I have gotten in a long time. Standard mirror and magnifying mirror are suited to any task. I would recommend this to any other buyers.</li>
            <li> it is nice but the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay open by itself anymore. the hinges or whatever is loose now...</li>
            <li> Sturdy.  Nice size to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> love this little thing, it fits well into my wristlet</li>
            <li> The magnifying mirror is so small that it&#x27;s pretty much useless. I bought it because of size and weight but it was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Good case. Good glass. Easy to use and very discrete.</li>
            <li> This is a handy-dandy little thing.  Great for applying lipstick and checking your make-up when you&#x27;re out and about.  Love the 5X side.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect compact mirror for your purse or travel.  It has a clear reflection (other small mirrors tend to be cloudy) for both the regular side as well as the 5x magnification.</li>
            <li> This little mirror is flat, light weight, sturdy, closes tightly, and has both a regular mirror and a magnification mirror so you can see what that annoying thing in your eye is and get it out- or perfect your lip gloss quickly and discreetly. It is a no-fuss tool, worth a tiny space in your bag.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t bet the price and it fits in your pocket without a problem. Definitely a great product</li>
            <li> great mirror and fits great even in a small purse</li>
