            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>and after I had it on for a bit, it smelled very nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But the seller very kindly allowed me to return it, so I can recommend the seller, just not this product.</li>
            <li>I just love this brand of Patchouilli - I believe it is one of the best on the market</li>

            <li>Of course I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I asked  a friend of mine what they were wearing for scent because it was so lovely.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many people stop me to ask waht perfume I am wearing and</li>
            <li>/&gt;So , now I&#x27;m online to go back to the best. !!</li>
            <li>will love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it , just too pricey.</li>

            <li>I love patchouli...</li>
            <li>I love that scent..</li>
            <li>Love the scent, others notice more than I smell myself</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for good service.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>Super earthy and authentic.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff straight out of the bottle !!</li>
            <li>Very calming and have been told how nice I smell.</li>
            <li>You need to smell it on skin to get all of its woodsey, rich notes.  </li>
            <li>I love this, perfect patchouli, long lasting.  </li>
            <li>to get true sent...</li>
            <li>And you will not get a true evaluation of it like that.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about it, but did come as presented and quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Only thing I liked was the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This patchouli is stronger than most, and it takes awhile to blend with the natural oils in your skin.</li>
            <li>This oil is pure patchouli and true to the patchouli scent.</li>
            <li>I love Patchouli, it&#x27;s my favorite essence in the whole wide world.</li>
            <li>Aroma is VERY intense.</li>
            <li>I have bought many different brands of  Patchouli...</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle not knowing what to expect.  </li>
            <li>just remember, just a TINY little dab will do good for you all day!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Could be that this is the way Patchouli really smells.</li>
            <li>and I really like this one...</li>
            <li>a more discrete patchouli scent none the less the texture and the fragrance</li>
            <li>i did like the smell of it, and it lasts a decent time.</li>
            <li>Second, they are most likely judging the odor after opening the bottle, sticking it under their nostrills and inhaling deeply.  </li>
            <li>It will not smell exactly the same on anyone.  </li>
            <li>The soft, subtle scent is so amazing.</li>
            <li>Just a very small amount will do it for you, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t return this fast enough.</li>
            <li>Warning when you first put it on it is really kind of unappealing, but give it about a half hour</li>
            <li>MUCH to sweet smelling, Nauseatingly sweet, very weak patchoulli scent.</li>
            <li>I was not happy with it, however I love patchouli.</li>
            <li>Patchouli reminds me of my \\&quot;hippie days\\&quot;; when life was less strained and intense!</li>
            <li>Smell old and stale and to me nothing like the Patchouli I love to wear.</li>
            <li>A little over powering when first putting on, then faded to nothing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was not a hippie, but knew it mixed well with other scents and soaps.</li>
            <li> I used to dab a little on the walls (bulkheads) of the ship in different rooms (compartments).  </li>
            <li> I personally thought it was too heavy for me as I like</li>
            <li> Really no complaints.</li>
            <li> First, they may be expecting that harsh, shrill almost sour smell of Spiritual Sky Pachtouli or some other cheep replica oil.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I received it I dabbed a little on and my boss walks out of his office and says - What is that</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, shop around.......</li>
            <li> I usually put a couple of drops on my pulse points and then spray another patchouli over that.</li>
            <li> the bottle is too small for the price.</li>
            <li> I think there are a couple of reasons why some reviewers have not liked it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I threw this in the trash.</li>
            <li> Maybe a drop in a pot pourri pot for a room fragrance would be acceptable but even then that would be too expensive.</li>
            <li> People stop me to ask what I am wearing, and now I want to keep it a secret!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product and return it because the scent was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I hate it because it smell very very bad, even no smell of patchouli as i use to smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Awful smell awful, took for ever to get.. and the shipping price outrages..  </li>
            <li> It was so terrible</li>
            <li> It was literally horrible!</li>

            <li> had this sent years ago....did not know it was still on the market...a little goes a long way..........needs to bee on you for abought 30 mins. to get true sent...price and shipping were great....im  happy....</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I threw this in the trash. Only thing I liked was the bottle.  I&#x27;m 64.....from the generation that loved Patchouli.  I could not use this for anything.</li>
            <li> This is a very good smelling patchouli perfume oil.I usually put a couple of drops on my pulse points and then spray another patchouli over that.The bottle is tiny, but the oil packs a big burst of fragrance!I get lots of compliments every time I wear my patchouli perfumes. I would recommend this brand to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> Awful smell awful, took for ever to get.. and the shipping price outrages..  Don&#x27;t waste your money, shop around.......</li>
            <li> Initially I have to admit I thought it smelled a bit like a swamp, and I almost just threw it away.  But, I thought I&#x27;d try it before wasting my money and after I had it on for a bit, it smelled very nice.  Maybe it has to blend with your body chemistry? Just a very small amount will do it for you, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> Of course I love this product.  I also was impressed on how quickly I received the order.  Thanks for good service.</li>
            <li> There is no match for Terranova Pachtouli. It is perfect, and true to the way a real pachtouli should smell.  It takes me back to Europe in the &#x27;60s.  I think there are a couple of reasons why some reviewers have not liked it.  First, they may be expecting that harsh, shrill almost sour smell of Spiritual Sky Pachtouli or some other cheep replica oil. Second, they are most likely judging the odor after opening the bottle, sticking it under their nostrills and inhaling deeply.  And you will not get a true evaluation of it like that.  You need to smell it on skin to get all of its woodsey, rich notes.  It will not smell exactly the same on anyone.  And lastly, you only need the tiniest drop on your wrist, then rub your wrists together.  This jar should last over a year.  Maybe two.  Despite what a few reviewers have come away believing, this is the real deal, and the finest there is anywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product and return it because the scent was very disappointing.  Smell old and stale and to me nothing like the Patchouli I love to wear.</li>
            <li> I love Patchouli, it&#x27;s my favorite essence in the whole wide world. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My dad used to wear patchouli and I always loved it so I decided to try it myself. This smell is divine and everytime I wear it I get compliments. Super earthy and authentic.</li>
            <li> Smell wonderful great earth tones, but not to over powering. A little goes a long way.  Would defiantly order again.</li>
            <li> This oil is pure patchouli and true to the patchouli scent. I personally thought it was too heavy for me as I like a more discrete patchouli scent none the less the texture and the fragrance is perfect if you are a true patchouli lover</li>
            <li> This patchouli is stronger than most, and it takes awhile to blend with the natural oils in your skin. It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I hate it because it smell very very bad, even no smell of patchouli as i use to smell.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what to do whit it. ???  I never use it, just smell....</li>
            <li> I sent this back. Did not like the smell at all. Amazon lost the bottle which was in a box with another perfume I sent back and tried to charge me for this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I love it!</li>
            <li> I asked  a friend of mine what they were wearing for scent because it was so lovely. Well, they gave me Terra NOva Patchouli for my b-day, and that was the beginning of my experience. I cannot tell you how many people stop me to ask waht perfume I am wearing and how great I  smell.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using it for a  couple years. Just ran out and bought a patchouli at my local health store. got it ome .... YUK !!&lt;br /&gt;So , now I&#x27;m online to go back to the best. !!&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;PS... I was not a hippie, but knew it mixed well with other scents and soaps. I love this stuff straight out of the bottle !! LOL&lt;br /&gt;I still have a few drops in my bottle, but will look forward to my new one !</li>
            <li> Love it , just too pricey.</li>
            <li> I love it! I love it! I love it! The soft, subtle scent is so amazing. It&#x27;s not overbearing--but people know when I enter or leave a room! I have received nothing but compliments! Patchouli reminds me of my \\&quot;hippie days\\&quot;; when life was less strained and intense! This is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I always loved the smell of Madonna&#x27;s album Like a Prayer.  Decided to Google it and see what I would find - Patchouli came up, so I ordered this perfume.  When I received it I dabbed a little on and my boss walks out of his office and says - What is that, it smells like a head shop in here!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Need I say more.  I stronly suggest that you pass on this one... unless you like to smell like you pass something else.</li>
            <li> I have bought many different brands of  Patchouli...this one is one of my favorites....I hope this brand is around for a while....I plan on buying it again when needed.    For those who never used  Patchouli....just remember, just a TINY little dab will do good for you all day! Very sexy sent....the longer it&#x27;s on....the sexier it smells....JMHO.</li>
            <li> I adore patchouli and have been using wearing it for years in various forms.  This smelled nothing like patchouli to me. It was so terrible I had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the seller very kindly allowed me to return it, so I can recommend the seller, just not this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product. It came in the mail today. It did NOT smell like Patchouli. It was literally horrible! I had to wash it off, which I have never done with any scent in my life.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong. I won&#x27;t were that as a perfum. Maybe a drop in a pot pourri pot for a room fragrance would be acceptable but even then that would be too expensive.</li>
            <li> Aroma is VERY intense. I just used the last drop of this. I get constant comments &amp; compliments on this perfume. I LOVE this brand. It only takes a drop! I&#x27;m reordering</li>
            <li> I still have mine and dot it in the car periodically. I really like the smell. Some don&#x27;t. I bought it back in 2006 or so when I was in the Navy. I used to dab a little on the walls (bulkheads) of the ship in different rooms (compartments).  That made me happy because the scent is very strong.  A small bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  I just love this brand of Patchouilli - I believe it is one of the best on the market&lt;br /&gt;Deb Renner</li>
            <li> Love this! I put a drop of it on my rists morning and night. Very calming and have been told how nice I smell. Wish the bottle was bigger, when I run out I&#x27;ll have to buy two.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t open bottle frozen shut</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened this bottle I wanted to gag. It smelled toxic like a very strong bug spray. I couldn&#x27;t return this fast enough.</li>
            <li> the bottle is too small for the price. i did like the smell of it, and it lasts a decent time.</li>
            <li> I love this, perfect patchouli, long lasting.  I have used it for years</li>
            <li> Could be that this is the way Patchouli really smells. Doesn&#x27;t last very long on skin. Not crazy about it, but did come as presented and quite quickly. Really no complaints.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and the smell lasts all&lt;br /&gt;day.  Men walk by and say, &amp;#34;man, that is&lt;br /&gt;Some good smelling patchouli!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love patchouli... and I really like this one... just a drop on my wrist... and 9 hours later I can be in a store and someone will walk by my and say &amp;#34;oh I love that scent..&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A little over powering when first putting on, then faded to nothing.  I was not happy with it, however I love patchouli.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Lots of comments on the fragrance. I would buy again. Love the scent, others notice more than I smell myself</li>
            <li> did not quite smell like the patchouli  spray I use !</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle not knowing what to expect.  Now I am on my third!!! People stop me to ask what I am wearing, and now I want to keep it a secret! Warning when you first put it on it is really kind of unappealing, but give it about a half hour and you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Daughter put on her wish list and I ordered...Merry Christmas&lt;br /&gt;We even call the delivery driver Santa Claus..</li>
            <li> MUCH to sweet smelling, Nauseatingly sweet, very weak patchoulli scent.</li>
