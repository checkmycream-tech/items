    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent cream for wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li>Face cream, wash, and strech marks cream are great!</li>
            <li>Make up goes on over it great.  </li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>this is really good product.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know about the line smoothing, i just know it is an excellent moisturizer that is very quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it as a night eye cream and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li>best eye cream , good value, good for  allergy prone people or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many products before and this product works!  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t expect any cream to get rid of lines, and I don&#x27;t think this is doing that.  </li>
            <li>the reason why i didn&#x27;t love this cream is because although it moisturizes really good the eye, i don&#x27;t like it under makeup</li>
            <li>I MUST SAY i&#x27;m very happy with the whole line of Palmer&#x27;s products, I would recommend it</li>
            <li>Super happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>However, it goes on so smoothly, moisturizes without being greasy, makes things kind of glowy/dewy around the eye area...  </li>
            <li>i recently even started using my Differin 0,5% gel around my eyes (stronger than Roc), and Palmer&#x27;s eye cream still moisturized wonderfully.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years, and I have now started using all of the Palmer&#x27;s skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I probably would not buy again even though I love Palmers products.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>love it also.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>first time using this product, but thought I would give it a try since I loved the cocoa butter body lotions so well.</li>
            <li>I really love cocoa butter products cause they are not too strong for my skin</li>
            <li>I love the Palmer&#x27;s products because they are natural and work great for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this, for moisturizing and maintaining the softness and integrity to the fine to medium lines I have now.</li>
            <li>So far  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li>No reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>However my skin always looks healthy and fresh and fine lines are not increasing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Just as with all the other Palmer&#x27;s products I have tried, this eye cream is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It has super healthy and quality ingredients and extremely cost effective.</li>
            <li>This is pretty inexpensive compared to most eye creams, but then again it&#x27;s really just a creamy petrolatum product.</li>
            <li>It makes your under eye area feel smooth and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about a week or so, but I am happy so far with the results.  </li>
            <li>i used LaRoche Posay&#x27;s Hydraphase intense Eyes which is excellent but more expensive.</li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t wear makeup without concealer first</li>
            <li>Shipping review first:</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of under eye creams and serums.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is way more affordable than other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, and overall their product is better.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and i really needed this one to work under my corrector.</li>
            <li>And it is an added plus that they are Made in America and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I will try and find it elsewhere since I like it so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I absolutely will not repurchase this item.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well for a fraction of the price; I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle</li>
            <li>Like most other Palmer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one a LOT....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i decided to try a new product and gave that one a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this hasn&#x27;t had any adverse effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this along with the night renewal cream, daily lotion with SPF 15, and gentle foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li>i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised by this one.</li>
            <li>i was beyond surprised how well it moisturized.</li>
            <li>and i really don&#x27;t think it actually smooths the creases.</li>
            <li>However, I will continue to order items directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh.</li>
            <li>It is a lightweight white cream that has a delicate and pleasant fragrance (not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when she mentioned the strong fragrance).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reaction aside, this had no moisturizing affects on my under eye area and did absolutely nothing for the fine lines around my eyes accept make them look worse.</li>
            <li>Went back to my old under eye cream.</li>
            <li>If your looking for an instant or quick fix within a few weeks though, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young (22) and I&#x27;ve been looking for some eye cream for a long time.</li>
            <li>Real Vaseline would cost much less per-usage AND it would be fragrance-free.</li>

            <li> Not sure how much help it was.</li>

            <li> If I have to be careful to avoid getting my eye cream in my eyes because it might sting, then I want a different eye cream.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have taken away the beginnings of some dry, winter weather patches.  </li>
            <li> I had a severe reaction to it, it made my under eye area dry and itchy with redness and swelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the Facial Cream and decided I wanted to try the Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Not much, seemed like another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> not much of a change.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my biggest complaint about this: this is like a strong, floral perfume, which is completely useless in an eye cream and it stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles</li>
            <li> been using it for two weeks and noticed I have less dark circles under my eyes and also helps with the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Like this cream, had bought previously.</li>
            <li> If I used it twice a day I notice the follicles around my eye lashes get a little clogged</li>
            <li> I like the small tube packaging and the consistency of the cream.</li>
            <li> especially when compared to the very expensive ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I emailed Amazon with a complaint and they solved my complaint with a refund for shipping cost and 2 day shipping was given to me.  </li>
            <li> I had this, along with other Palmer&#x27;s products on my Amazon delivery service, and sadly they are not going to keep carrying this one.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> This one was by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I find this one works just as well as expensive products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was allergic to this eye cream</li>

            <li> I am undecided about this product. Not sure how much help it was. Went back to my old under eye cream.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>

            <li> Like this cream, had bought previously.</li>
            <li> i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised by this one. i use Estee Lauder Re-nutriv Ultimate Line Correcting eye cream in the morning and Roc Retinol Correxion Eye at night, and i need a moiturizer over both because they can be drying. i used LaRoche Posay&#x27;s Hydraphase intense Eyes which is excellent but more expensive. i decided to try a new product and gave that one a try. i was beyond surprised how well it moisturized. Let&#x27;s not forget how drying Retinol can be. i recently even started using my Differin 0,5% gel around my eyes (stronger than Roc), and Palmer&#x27;s eye cream still moisturized wonderfully. i don&#x27;t know about the line smoothing, i just know it is an excellent moisturizer that is very quickly absorbed by the skin. It is a lightweight white cream that has a delicate and pleasant fragrance (not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when she mentioned the strong fragrance). Recommended.</li>
            <li> first time using this product, but thought I would give it a try since I loved the cocoa butter body lotions so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young (22) and I&#x27;ve been looking for some eye cream for a long time. I really love cocoa butter products cause they are not too strong for my skin but yet they work properly on it. the reason why i didn&#x27;t love this cream is because although it moisturizes really good the eye, i don&#x27;t like it under makeup and i really don&#x27;t think it actually smooths the creases. I have dark circles and i don&#x27;t wear makeup without concealer first and i really needed this one to work under my corrector.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!  It makes your under eye area feel smooth and ready for the day. Its my second time purchasing it back to back also.</li>
            <li> Just as with all the other Palmer&#x27;s products I have tried, this eye cream is a very good product. My skin looks better than it has in years, and I have now started using all of the Palmer&#x27;s skin care products.  And it is an added plus that they are Made in America and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> best eye cream , good value, good for  allergy prone people or sensitive skin. Why do I need to make a long description.</li>
            <li> Not much, seemed like another moisturizer. No change in the area. I probably would not buy again even though I love Palmers products.</li>

            <li> So far so good.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes at all.  Not too greasy or oily, concealer goes on well.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for wrinkled skin. Does the job. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this product.  I just use it once a day in the morning.  Make up goes on over it great.  If I used it twice a day I notice the follicles around my eye lashes get a little clogged so I use a lighter under eye moisturizer at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Like most other Palmer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one a LOT....especially when compared to the very expensive ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. I find this one works just as well as expensive products. I had this, along with other Palmer&#x27;s products on my Amazon delivery service, and sadly they are not going to keep carrying this one. I will try and find it elsewhere since I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I like the Palmers eye cream.I can tell the difference since I&#x27;ve been using it also use the face moisturizer  love it also.</li>
            <li> It was great. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was allergic to this eye cream so it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Love this, for moisturizing and maintaining the softness and integrity to the fine to medium lines I have now. It has super healthy and quality ingredients and extremely cost effective. If your looking for an instant or quick fix within a few weeks though, this isn&#x27;t it. However my skin always looks healthy and fresh and fine lines are not increasing.</li>
            <li> Of course you need to do this every night but even if I skip a night my skin and eye area seem to be forgiving when I have used this eye cream regularly.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is smoothing and soothing.  I use it as a night eye cream and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference using this eye cream. No reduction in fine lines. I would try something else instead.</li>
            <li> Used it for eleven days.....not much of a change.</li>
            <li> this is really good product. I MUST SAY i&#x27;m very happy with the whole line of Palmer&#x27;s products, I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and this seems to be it.  I like the small tube packaging and the consistency of the cream. I have seen some improvement after only 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Shipping review first: After a delay with shipping. I emailed Amazon with a complaint and they solved my complaint with a refund for shipping cost and 2 day shipping was given to me.  I would give Amazon a 3-STAR Rating for Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Product Review: I have tried many different brands of under eye creams and serums. This one was by far the worst. I had a severe reaction to it, it made my under eye area dry and itchy with redness and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;Reaction aside, this had no moisturizing affects on my under eye area and did absolutely nothing for the fine lines around my eyes accept make them look worse. I absolutely will not repurchase this item. However, I will continue to order items directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is pretty inexpensive compared to most eye creams, but then again it&#x27;s really just a creamy petrolatum product. Real Vaseline would cost much less per-usage AND it would be fragrance-free. That&#x27;s my biggest complaint about this: this is like a strong, floral perfume, which is completely useless in an eye cream and it stings my eyes. If I have to be careful to avoid getting my eye cream in my eyes because it might sting, then I want a different eye cream. As a standard moisturizer it works as well as Vaseline would, but if you don&#x27;t mind fragrance in your moisturizers, buy Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Vitamin E Concentrated Cream in the 3.75-ounce tube. It works VERY well for a fraction of the price; I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade.</li>
            <li> I love the Palmer&#x27;s products because they are natural and work great for me.  Also, the price is way more affordable than other eye creams I&#x27;ve used, and overall their product is better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not harsh. It is so gentle&lt;br /&gt;And it actually works!!...thank u Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used many products before and this product works!  My daughter loves Palmer products as well.  Face cream, wash, and strech marks cream are great!</li>
