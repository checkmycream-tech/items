            <li>It made a great Christmas gift and arrived in the knick of time!</li>
            <li>Its a great idea, but not well implemented.</li>
            <li>Great idea.</li>
            <li>I did find that it did not rip the hair out, which was good, as for things like nose hair that is a good thing</li>
            <li>However, it did a good job on ear hair and nose hair.</li>
            <li>product also good to trim face hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li>Product came in handy.</li>
            <li>This product sounded like an interesting one as all guys have some body hair that they have to deal with.</li>
            <li>I though this was going to be better then</li>
            <li>The attachments could be better.</li>
            <li>But once figured out, it works ok.</li>
            <li>I found with this product that it seemed to work fine with longer hair, but seemed to not cut all of the shorter, finer hair that I tried to get rid of.</li>
            <li>Cheap product, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a cheap product ,which it was.</li>
            <li>My advice is if you are looking for a micro trimmer, just buy the original MicroTouch.</li>
            <li>the first went ok but</li>
            <li>but when its turned on it makes a wwird high pitch sound and doesn&#x27;t work at all any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for nose hair, outer ear hair, etc.  </li>
            <li>The micro trimmer works well enough and the light is a nice touch, but the switchblade part needs some work.</li>
            <li>it got clogeg or something the very first swip.</li>
            <li>thought the new one would work better.  </li>
            <li>far i havent tried using it for ears or nose :)</li>
            <li>my first thing to trim was my eybrows .</li>
            <li>your money here and invest in a higher quality device</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he really likes it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could leave a positive review on this.</li>
            <li>Overall its all plastic and feels like something that i would find in the dollar store, pretty cheap in all.</li>
            <li>Large end still works.  </li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>(took that much off just to even it out again).</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t have huge issues, but they are issues none the less.</li>
            <li>It feels like the larger blade is not very sharp and pulls hair more than it cuts.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes on this item.</li>
            <li>real looser, do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they were all brand new.</li>
            <li>With new batteries it gets caught in hair and stalls out.</li>
            <li>Its not strong enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for small trims.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty simple to use</li>
            <li>If just using the micro trimmer part it will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I turned around and ordered an old reliable.</li>
            <li>It didnt last me more than a few days after only using it for about 10 min a day.</li>
            <li>It barely turns on .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as i expected it to.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job at cutting some of the hairs that I had issues with, but it did miss others</li>
            <li>guess this might work well if you try shaving your head or trimming your slightly grown hair on ur already shaved head;)</li>

            <li> Does not trim my eye brows at all, the battery power does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Also using the larger blade will suck your battery dry in no time.</li>

            <li> They only have one guard and its so long that it didn&#x27;t cut a single hair from my sides even though my sides of my hair are much long then the guy in the video trimming his hair with such ease.</li>
            <li> but the small trimmer broke down on my first use.</li>
            <li> A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also I believe the other number is the 9918 also a lot like the 9916.</li>
            <li> Feels poorly made but could not even try it since it did not even started with brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> should have listened to the other bad reviews they were true.</li>
            <li> Sizes to cut not too tight</li>
            <li> The small cutting end quit working during it&#x27;s first use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I does not do what it is advertised to do, it will not cut or thin or trim your hair, and after only one use you need to replace the batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
            <li> I have the small version.  </li>
            <li> Buy the small version if any.</li>
            <li> Something I had in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried it out on my beard and ended up cutting it down to look like I was just starting to grow it</li>
            <li> Wish I read the reviews before making the purchase since I have the same issues as what the reviews stated - its weak , attachments do not work , its poor quality.</li>
            <li> It would not turn on at times and then it was hard to turn off when it did turn on.</li>
            <li> Hardly any hair cuts off but some does.</li>
            <li> this is a poorly made and useless piece of junk and is a total waist of your time to order</li>
            <li> The cutting edge is small but sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades get stuck when it tries cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Was broken and I  couldnt even try it.</li>
            <li> so not only does the long trimmer part  completly worthless to get that in between hair cut trim even when its in need very bad.</li>
            <li> Poor design, useless attachments....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> Awful product, does not nearly perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> The after effect of using this was unpleasant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I was very disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this, it is a completely worthless piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap.</li>

            <li> It barely turns on . I read the warrantee insert and they want a check enclosed for $7.99 in order to replace it. That&#x27;s a joke since I already paid shipping and handling for the initial purchase. Wish I read the reviews before making the purchase since I have the same issues as what the reviews stated - its weak , attachments do not work , its poor quality. Don&#x27;t  waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This product sounded like an interesting one as all guys have some body hair that they have to deal with. Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t have huge issues, but they are issues none the less. I found with this product that it seemed to work fine with longer hair, but seemed to not cut all of the shorter, finer hair that I tried to get rid of. I did find that it did not rip the hair out, which was good, as for things like nose hair that is a good thing as that can definitely hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like that it ran on batteries. I would have preferred that it either have an internal rechargable battery or a plug. It also does not come with a case to hold onto the parts, so you have to come up with something else to hold everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the money the product is multi-functional which is a plus and it does a good job at cutting some of the hairs that I had issues with, but it did miss others (I know - picky picky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> The micro trimmer works well enough and the light is a nice touch, but the switchblade part needs some work. It feels like the larger blade is not very sharp and pulls hair more than it cuts. Also using the larger blade will suck your battery dry in no time. It didnt last me more than a few days after only using it for about 10 min a day. If just using the micro trimmer part it will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Its a great idea, but not well implemented. My advice is if you are looking for a micro trimmer, just buy the original MicroTouch.</li>
            <li> The small cutting end quit working during it&#x27;s first use. Worked well for 30 seconds. Large end still works.  Great idea.</li>
            <li> Cheap product, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Poor design, useless attachments.... Don&#x27;t waist money on this product. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could leave a positive review on this.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this, it is a completely worthless piece of junk.  Just stopped working after having it for a month.</li>
            <li> Showed up broke and did not even turn on. Tried to use several batteries thinking it was the batteries but they were all brand new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for small trims. Like your mustache. It&#x27;s not up to anything heavier. And if you have plenty of TIME.</li>
            <li> my first thing to trim was my eybrows . the first went ok but the second I tried my next eyebrow it got clogeg or something the very first swip. ive trie to fix and don&#x27;t see any clogs or anything but when its turned on it makes a wwird high pitch sound and doesn&#x27;t work at all any more. next I havnt had a hair cut in a while so I thought I would try  trimming the sides of my head to trim some hair off before my next cut. They only have one guard and its so long that it didn&#x27;t cut a single hair from my sides even though my sides of my hair are much long then the guy in the video trimming his hair with such ease. so not only does the long trimmer part  completly worthless to get that in between hair cut trim even when its in need very bad. but the small trimmer broke down on my first use. The video looks like this switchblade is the ansewer to my trimming needs  but did not accomplish anything it said it would do.  Very upset. hope to get my money back</li>
            <li> my husband loves this thing. BUT !! he cut himself 2 time while opening and putting batteries in it. Should be a label on the package that states that the large end will cut skin very easily if no held by the sides when opening it</li>
            <li> this is a poorly made and useless piece of junk and is a total waist of your time to order</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.It would not turn on at times and then it was hard to turn off when it did turn on.It seemed like a cheap product ,which it was.</li>
            <li> I have the small version.  thought the new one would work better.  it doesn&#x27;t. Neither work AT ALL with any attachment on it, so it&#x27;s useless.  Eyebrows, Body hair, head hair, etc.  It&#x27;s only good for nose hair, outer ear hair, etc.  Buy the small version if any.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap. it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Was broken and I  couldnt even try it. Save your money and buy a quality product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes on this item. It rendered out to be nothing like the TV promo. Do not get this for trimming your beard or anything else. I tried it out on my beard and ended up cutting it down to look like I was just starting to grow it (took that much off just to even it out again). However, it did a good job on ear hair and nose hair. Yes, now I have a $20 nose trimmer. Ha.&lt;br /&gt;After using it to devastate my beard I turned around and ordered an old reliable. Wahl 9916 Beard trimmer. Also I believe the other number is the 9918 also a lot like the 9916. Something I had in the past. THIS PUPPY WORKS WELL. Again 2 stars and only 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Its not strong enough to be effective. With new batteries it gets caught in hair and stalls out. do not buy.</li>
            <li> I though this was going to be better then the  type I had before, but it pulls the hair and it hurts&lt;br /&gt;does not cut the hair at all .&lt;br /&gt;w</li>
            <li> Feels poorly made but could not even try it since it did not even started with brand new batteries. Bad.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty simple to use but it didnt do well. The blades get stuck when it tries cutting hair. There will be pulls quite often.. The after effect of using this was unpleasant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far i havent tried using it for ears or nose :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this might work well if you try shaving your head or trimming your slightly grown hair on ur already shaved head;)</li>
            <li> Awful product, does not nearly perform as advertised. Waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money here and invest in a higher quality device</li>
            <li> I does not do what it is advertised to do, it will not cut or thin or trim your hair, and after only one use you need to replace the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real looser, do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to the other bad reviews they were true.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I was very disappointed in this item.  I thought it would do the job but no.  Does not trim my eye brows at all, the battery power does not last very long.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut but pull out the hair.  I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> This product do not work as it should. It left a lot of hair on my neck line after i tried to trim. A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as i expected it to. Hardly any hair cuts off but some does. Overall its all plastic and feels like something that i would find in the dollar store, pretty cheap in all. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again but its up to your if you want to try it out.</li>
            <li> Need something to cut nose hair. Product came in handy. product also good to trim face hairs. The attachments could be better. Sizes to cut not too tight</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it!  It made a great Christmas gift and arrived in the knick of time!</li>
            <li> The cutting edge is small but sharp.  It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as in the video.  But once figured out, it works ok.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim Anything but the skin off your face. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing. I actually bled trying to trim a side burn.</li>
