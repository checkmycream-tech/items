            <li> On a tired or rough day the Yonka Serum brings life back to my face and skin.  The aromatherapy is extremely soothing as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! everything by Yonka is amazing, but I adore how my skin smells and feels using this! Not to mention, my husband loves me usting this stuff! He loves the smell, and how soft my skin is!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Have tried less expensive serums but there is no comparison.  This is the best and you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> thus I have bought several bottles of the stuff and she is beautiful!  the bottle is pretty small but goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I have been using this serum for years and swear by it. Makes me skin feel amazing .</li>
            <li> My aesthetician uses Yonka products for my facials and this stuff rocks.  The herbaly scent is very relaxing, must be the juniper and rosemary.  The results are dramatic.  Two drops are all that are needed and the wrinkley eyelids are gone.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was extremely helpful and I will be purchasing from them again.  The price was modest, shipping terrific, communication outstanding!</li>
            <li> Very nice, especially after exfoliating or deep cleansing. Really replenishes. Put on just before bed and awake with nourished skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It is truly an amazing combination of essential oils!</li>
            <li> I put this on at night, after cleansing.  Honestly, it smells kind of spicy, and that&#x27;s about all I get from it.  I have not seen any improvement in my&lt;br /&gt;skin...It is more of an essential oil than a face serum.  My sinus kind of opened a bit, but as far as benefits to skin and face, I say find something else.  I&lt;br /&gt;think I was duped and my money:  wasted.  :(</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome! My skin looks so good and my face isn&#x27;t as oily even though this is a serum.</li>
            <li> Yonka Serum is awesome to nourish your skin. It only takes a little to add brightness and life to your skin.</li>

            <li> Met all expectations and is a great product!  I have been using it for over 2 years and continues to be a great product.</li>
