            <li>Not an amazing heal my hair but helpful.</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair feeling and looking amazing.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on my hair today and it is absolutely amazing..</li>
            <li>Olaplex is amazing.</li>
            <li>The best hair product ever, so much bounce and body now.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from this seller and product came perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li>Spectacular.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really kind of a miracle.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing, shiny and strong!</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes however, it is awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li>They also understand that many people color their own hair at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it was great to be able to receive this so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Strong!</li>
            <li>I was happy to get it at such a great price too.</li>
            <li>I first experienced this at my hair salon.</li>
            <li>I still needed a light trim, but after two uses my hair was perfectly healthy again!</li>
            <li>The hair gets soft and its feels very good.</li>
            <li>I would like to continue to use the product a couple more months to determine if there is any difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>&gt; If you feel like this review has been helpful to you in anyway please click the button below :)</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>(my hair is mostly below my shoulders)</li>
            <li>OMG.. who doesn&#x27;t LOVE OLAPLEX???</li>
            <li>and my hair is all wavy and healthy.</li>
            <li>so hopefully you&#x27;ll have better results than I.</li>
            <li>After Olaplex my hair looked considerably better.</li>
            <li>Just putting that out there as a product to try :)</li>
            <li>Would love if Olaplex came out with a shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC product!  </li>
            <li>My hair endured many chemical processes within the course of three months-due to a color SNAFU.</li>
            <li>(Be sure to use #3 as directed--</li>
            <li>If you have virgin hair that is damaged you can use the system to repair your hair without adding any color (many salons will provide that service if you ask.)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Drops mic, and walks away)  :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:) thank you</li>
            <li>One more thing, I did NOT use Olaplex 1 or 2.....</li>
            <li>You should see some immediate results, but you will see the integrity of your hair continue to get better with use.</li>
            <li>I have highlighted my hair for over 30 years and have always had healthy hair because I use the Wen products...</li>
            <li>HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing it works better if you use all the products.</li>
            <li>This Olaplex formula is magic for your hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a magical product to improve my hairs texture and consistency.</li>
            <li>I am In love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I buy from my stylist but love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If your expecting it to magically fix everything in one use you need a reality check.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read up and do your research before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Mayo works better</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you buy from another site, make sure they are a hair dresser and offer email exchanges for guidance in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also purchase from the salon owner sellers with the most information, ingredients, and directions for the product listed in the description</li>
            <li>With each treatment, I see more improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>Have used two times already and my hair feels great its shiny and has repaired much of my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Super fast deliver and amazing product!!</li>
            <li>Rinse it out then wash as you normally would.your hair will look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended I use this stuff once a week to keep my hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I do not use much for my hair, just a good conditioner/shampoo.</li>
            <li>Delivery is always fast, I Love being able to use this product between hair appointments!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I discovered this gem. :)</li>
            <li>It will work well alone, but it is a diluted version of #2 so is not as strong alone.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried things before due to great reviews and most were just ok, nothing great enough to warrant a review.</li>
            <li>There is a safety seal, you are getting a genuine product.</li>
            <li>My hair is amazing and so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I follow by a deep conditioning, and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>but this addition is fantastic...</li>
            <li>Love Olaplex, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to have received the order so quickly!</li>
            <li>This is not like all the other products I&#x27;ve purchased that sit on top of the hair, or makes your hair feel great until you wash it out...</li>
            <li>then its ever been - HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it I already noticed a huge difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product twice now and so far very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Since using this product there has been a significant change in the amount.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any significant improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure that you do exactly what directions say.</li>
            <li>This is a unique formula of oil based protein molecule.</li>
            <li>It was more effective than regular coconut oil as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible and I&#x27;d be a frizzy mess without it.</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and nice after two times of use.</li>
            <li>The last time I kept it on overnight and loved the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good, true things about this product</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny, very easy to style.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and strong!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and result was amazing ,make the hair really soft!</li>
            <li>But seeing this value it&#x27;s so much cheaper to do my own hair and get the high quality that this product produces.</li>
            <li>This is the first hair product I have ever used that actually works this good.</li>
            <li>It was not an easy and fast process</li>
            <li>Love it - it really made my hair stronger on the first use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to use this</li>
            <li>I have used a bit once a week and it really conditions and repairs fantasticly</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff left my hair feeling like it felt when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>it is shiny, healthy, soft, and holds the curl.</li>
            <li>5 stars, well worth it since it saved my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided it was worth the $ to try this.</li>
            <li>And yeah, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny - in fact, worth triple the cost.  </li>
            <li>but IMO it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>treatment!&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have seen results, was pricy but def worth it.</li>
            <li>use Olaplex No. 1 &amp; 2 as stand alone treatments right now to correct damage.  </li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair a lot of volume and it makes it soft and silky!</li>
            <li>Deep conditioning was only somewhat effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was told to use Olaplex by my future sister in law, who has been doing hair for many years and is great.</li>
            <li>This is different: it&#x27;s a pre-shampoo treatment, so when you rinse it out, your hair feels very smooth and silky, then you shampoo and</li>
            <li>This little bottle provides my medium length hair with 4 good weekly treatments.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use; the directions are simple and very clear.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful but way too expensive.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been over year since I first purchased this</li>
            <li>however I come home in the first time I wash my hair after coloring I use it</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair but want to change up your color as much as I do.</li>
            <li>My hair much softer and FRIZZIER!</li>
            <li>I am glad to say that this one actually did what it said.</li>
            <li>Definitely increases the strength and healthy appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure whether this strategy is effective, but hey, I&#x27;m workin&#x27; it!</li>
            <li>Love Olaplex as I dye my level 4 hair platinum and pastel regularly and am always changing my hair color.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>But the first time I used this I didn&#x27;t think it would do much, but it did!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic, but have definitely not been getting many split ends -</li>
            <li>You notice a difference from the first time you use this product.  </li>
            <li>used only once-not sure how it performed.  </li>
            <li>Works well but getting part 1 and 2 done first</li>
            <li>My hair gets to dry and straight during warm Summer months.</li>
            <li>No 1 and 2, however, on Olaplex&#x27;s website, it CLEARLY states that No 1 and 2 can be used independently of No 3 and you DON&#x27;T have to have them for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best invention made for those who want blonde hair , but fear of sacrificing the health of your hair.</li>
            <li>Although it did keep it strong, healthy, and smooth, I do not think it is worth the price since it comes in such a small bottle!</li>
            <li>I died my hair blonde a week ago, used this conditioner, and my hair feels normal and healthy.</li>
            <li>This seems like a genuine product but its not worth the money on its own, only use it with the whole system.</li>
            <li>I have really fine medium brown hair that was recently lightened quite a bit.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My hair feels much smoother and softer and much easier to comb through after using this product I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week</li>
            <li>It is really helping to keep it from breaking -- I have tons of 3 to 4 inch hairs  </li>
            <li>This has really helped to make my hair look fuller and healthier</li>
            <li>and I really can say this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from this very sellar.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Fast Ship</li>
            <li>the ends are what really needs repair</li>
            <li>After 2 treatments, my hair is very well fortified and feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>The combo really works for me.  </li>
            <li>My order came so fast &amp; packed well.</li>
            <li>so I knew my hair was going to get really damage</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get a whole lot for the price, but it really does work.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t done much for me.</li>
            <li>that really didn&#x27;t much and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, has fantastic movement, and feels like silk--even my teenage daughter commented on it ( unsolicited!!)</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This ia a must for anyone who wants to bleach or chemically process hair.</li>
            <li>I pay 14$ for this directly through Olaplex because I have a license!!!</li>
            <li>There is no other high quality, immediately effective, hair  treatment on the market to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; dry, over processed hair.</li>
            <li>I wet my hair down and night and lather my hair up win this and let it sit in my hair overnight.</li>
            <li>My hair is still fine and on the dry side, but, no longer mush or like straw.</li>
            <li>I am mostly using the #1 and #2, but I like to have the #3 avail for in between the intensive treatments that I need for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I straighten and use a curling iron on my fine naturally curly hair almost daily.  </li>
            <li>I notice a less breakage and it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually go for treatment packets, as they usually don&#x27;t provide any results for my hair type, but I was really impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>As with most conditioning treatments, you can feel the difference in your hair after you rinse it out, but it usually only lasts until the next shampoo, which removes it from your hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I did not understand the rip off comments, I pay $30 from my hair dresser and this is cheaper for the product but the shipping might be high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It bonds the hair shaft back together to it&#x27;s original virgin state, completely restoring and reversing the chemical and/or heat damage.</li>
            <li>My curl pattern is more defined, I have less frizz (even without product) and my hair feels like it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, silky, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Adds shine and new life to your hair.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>It is a new product like nothing in the market as of today.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products (both expensive and cheap)</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very very soft.</li>
            <li>I color my hair blonde and had abused hot tools for over 3 months I have used it twice</li>
            <li>I bought it here and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft or anything!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products that have fallen short on their promises.</li>
            <li>Soft!</li>
            <li>If you want soft hair, this is what you want in your life!</li>
            <li>my hair feels exactly how it did when I left my salon that day.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>cannot say that you will definitely get a certified original product when buying second hand, but I know certified people that do sell it there.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>the way, Olaplex No. 2 &amp; No. 3 are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is nothing compared to what this stuff does for your hair and all the ppl who gave it less than 5 stars, it&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle, but pretty damn close !!  </li>
            <li>The product keeps my blonde highlights longer with more shine and less frizz and dryness.</li>
            <li>That was my goal to get my hair back to previous length while maintaining healthy shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is the at home after care treatment, i just used it and made my hair melt like butter from how soft it feels.. definitely purchasing for as long as im blonde :)</li>
            <li>They want to be able to sell it to you themselves at a profit, which of course I get, but don&#x27;t leave it a negative review.</li>
            <li>I also used it as a leave in (much thicker application) and left in overnight.</li>
            <li>My straight damaged ends actually had some wavy texture and it is no longer mushy.</li>
            <li>I have used the complete Olaplex system (numbers 1 and 2 in the salon) and bought #3 to use at home...</li>
            <li>so when I apply the product, I just concentrate on the ends so to not waste it.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny with no tangles.</li>
            <li>It really does make my hair softer and shinier and healthier especially after I color my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very wavy/curly hair that I regularly straighten.</li>
            <li>I like this so far.  </li>
            <li>I have only bought it thru my hair stylist, it&#x27;s absolutely life changing.</li>
            <li>For convenience, I purchased Olaplex on Amazon after my bottle was near finished.</li>
            <li>friend is a stylist and she buys it for me from a professional store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how that is possible because this really makes my hair in better condition, but I guess everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  </li>
            <li>and it has really helped to lessen the damage done by the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I tried other leave in conditioners and deep conditioners but didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the high price.  </li>
            <li>I have very dark brown hair, so I color my hair regularly (full head of highlights).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle but after using this 3 times my hair is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>Olaplex definitely help my grade of hair return to normal.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked well but will have to allow a few more weeks to give complete review as sometimes these products can make hair become flatter and have less body over time.</li>
            <li>I still had a small amount left of my original bottle and noticed that the one I had purchased off of Amazon was also a different consistency being much runnier and the smell was a bit off.</li>
            <li>Also due to the nature of the haircut I have to use a flat iron to smooth out my hair daily</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it is actually Olaplex so please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I use fashion colors, which means I am constantly reapplying color, and fairly frequently bleaching to near-white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a licensed professional, but I have done my research, do the same before using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thin or watery conditioner, it seems to be moisturizing, I&#x27;ve used better stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more dense without feeling weighed down or too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural haired (no relaxer) black girl, with very curly (3a type) hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was fried &amp; strawlike from a combination of coloring and illness--this product was the ONLY change I made to my haircare routine, and I&#x27;ve got my old hair BACK!!  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the money just yet.</li>
            <li>I used to have frizzy, dry (chemically processed hair) and this has turned my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this helped much, I was going from black to blonde</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long down to my mid back</li>
            <li>I am little suspicious if it really is a real Olaplex product.</li>

            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair today and it is absolutely amazing..</li>
            <li> Olaplex is amazing.</li>
            <li> The best hair product ever, so much bounce and body now.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from this seller and product came perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> Spectacular.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really kind of a miracle.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing, shiny and strong!</li>
            <li> As far as the product goes however, it is awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> They also understand that many people color their own hair at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was great to be able to receive this so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Strong!</li>
            <li> I was happy to get it at such a great price too.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I still needed a light trim, but after two uses my hair was perfectly healthy again!</li>
            <li> The hair gets soft and its feels very good.</li>
            <li> I would like to continue to use the product a couple more months to determine if there is any difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> &gt; If you feel like this review has been helpful to you in anyway please click the button below :)</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> (my hair is mostly below my shoulders)</li>
            <li> OMG.. who doesn&#x27;t LOVE OLAPLEX???</li>
            <li> and my hair is all wavy and healthy.</li>
            <li> so hopefully you&#x27;ll have better results than I.</li>
            <li> After Olaplex my hair looked considerably better.</li>
            <li> Just putting that out there as a product to try :)</li>
            <li> Would love if Olaplex came out with a shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC product!  </li>
            <li> My hair endured many chemical processes within the course of three months-due to a color SNAFU.</li>
            <li> (Be sure to use #3 as directed--</li>
            <li> If you have virgin hair that is damaged you can use the system to repair your hair without adding any color (many salons will provide that service if you ask.)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Drops mic, and walks away)  :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :) thank you</li>
            <li> One more thing, I did NOT use Olaplex 1 or 2.....</li>
            <li> You should see some immediate results, but you will see the integrity of your hair continue to get better with use.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted my hair for over 30 years and have always had healthy hair because I use the Wen products...</li>
            <li> HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing it works better if you use all the products.</li>
            <li> This Olaplex formula is magic for your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a magical product to improve my hairs texture and consistency.</li>
            <li> I am In love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I buy from my stylist but love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If your expecting it to magically fix everything in one use you need a reality check.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read up and do your research before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Mayo works better</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you buy from another site, make sure they are a hair dresser and offer email exchanges for guidance in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also purchase from the salon owner sellers with the most information, ingredients, and directions for the product listed in the description</li>
            <li> With each treatment, I see more improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Have used two times already and my hair feels great its shiny and has repaired much of my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Super fast deliver and amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Rinse it out then wash as you normally would.your hair will look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended I use this stuff once a week to keep my hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I do not use much for my hair, just a good conditioner/shampoo.</li>
            <li> Delivery is always fast, I Love being able to use this product between hair appointments!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I discovered this gem. :)</li>
            <li> It will work well alone, but it is a diluted version of #2 so is not as strong alone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried things before due to great reviews and most were just ok, nothing great enough to warrant a review.</li>
            <li> There is a safety seal, you are getting a genuine product.</li>
            <li> My hair is amazing and so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I follow by a deep conditioning, and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> but this addition is fantastic...</li>
            <li> Love Olaplex, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have received the order so quickly!</li>
            <li> This is not like all the other products I&#x27;ve purchased that sit on top of the hair, or makes your hair feel great until you wash it out...</li>
            <li> then its ever been - HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it I already noticed a huge difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product twice now and so far very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Since using this product there has been a significant change in the amount.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any significant improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure that you do exactly what directions say.</li>
            <li> This is a unique formula of oil based protein molecule.</li>
            <li> It was more effective than regular coconut oil as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible and I&#x27;d be a frizzy mess without it.</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and nice after two times of use.</li>
            <li> The last time I kept it on overnight and loved the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good, true things about this product</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Soft and shiny, very easy to style.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and strong!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and result was amazing ,make the hair really soft!</li>
            <li> But seeing this value it&#x27;s so much cheaper to do my own hair and get the high quality that this product produces.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair product I have ever used that actually works this good.</li>
            <li> It was not an easy and fast process</li>
            <li> Love it - it really made my hair stronger on the first use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited to use this</li>
            <li> I have used a bit once a week and it really conditions and repairs fantasticly</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff left my hair feeling like it felt when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> it is shiny, healthy, soft, and holds the curl.</li>
            <li> 5 stars, well worth it since it saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided it was worth the $ to try this.</li>
            <li> And yeah, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny - in fact, worth triple the cost.  </li>
            <li> but IMO it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> treatment!&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have seen results, was pricy but def worth it.</li>
            <li> use Olaplex No. 1 &amp; 2 as stand alone treatments right now to correct damage.  </li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair a lot of volume and it makes it soft and silky!</li>
            <li> Deep conditioning was only somewhat effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was told to use Olaplex by my future sister in law, who has been doing hair for many years and is great.</li>
            <li> This is different: it&#x27;s a pre-shampoo treatment, so when you rinse it out, your hair feels very smooth and silky, then you shampoo and</li>
            <li> This little bottle provides my medium length hair with 4 good weekly treatments.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use; the directions are simple and very clear.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful but way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been over year since I first purchased this</li>
            <li> however I come home in the first time I wash my hair after coloring I use it</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is worth the investment if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair but want to change up your color as much as I do.</li>
            <li> My hair much softer and FRIZZIER!</li>
            <li> I am glad to say that this one actually did what it said.</li>
            <li> Definitely increases the strength and healthy appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether this strategy is effective, but hey, I&#x27;m workin&#x27; it!</li>
            <li> Love Olaplex as I dye my level 4 hair platinum and pastel regularly and am always changing my hair color.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> But the first time I used this I didn&#x27;t think it would do much, but it did!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic, but have definitely not been getting many split ends -</li>
            <li> You notice a difference from the first time you use this product.  </li>
            <li> used only once-not sure how it performed.  </li>
            <li> Works well but getting part 1 and 2 done first</li>
            <li> My hair gets to dry and straight during warm Summer months.</li>
            <li> No 1 and 2, however, on Olaplex&#x27;s website, it CLEARLY states that No 1 and 2 can be used independently of No 3 and you DON&#x27;T have to have them for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best invention made for those who want blonde hair , but fear of sacrificing the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> Although it did keep it strong, healthy, and smooth, I do not think it is worth the price since it comes in such a small bottle!</li>
            <li> I died my hair blonde a week ago, used this conditioner, and my hair feels normal and healthy.</li>
            <li> This seems like a genuine product but its not worth the money on its own, only use it with the whole system.</li>
            <li> I have really fine medium brown hair that was recently lightened quite a bit.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My hair feels much smoother and softer and much easier to comb through after using this product I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week</li>
            <li> It is really helping to keep it from breaking -- I have tons of 3 to 4 inch hairs  </li>
            <li> This has really helped to make my hair look fuller and healthier</li>
            <li> and I really can say this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from this very sellar.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fast Ship</li>
            <li> the ends are what really needs repair</li>
            <li> After 2 treatments, my hair is very well fortified and feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> The combo really works for me.  </li>
            <li> My order came so fast &amp; packed well.</li>
            <li> so I knew my hair was going to get really damage</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a whole lot for the price, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t done much for me.</li>
            <li> that really didn&#x27;t much and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, has fantastic movement, and feels like silk--even my teenage daughter commented on it ( unsolicited!!)</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This ia a must for anyone who wants to bleach or chemically process hair.</li>
            <li> I pay 14$ for this directly through Olaplex because I have a license!!!</li>
            <li> There is no other high quality, immediately effective, hair  treatment on the market to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; dry, over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair down and night and lather my hair up win this and let it sit in my hair overnight.</li>
            <li> My hair is still fine and on the dry side, but, no longer mush or like straw.</li>
            <li> I am mostly using the #1 and #2, but I like to have the #3 avail for in between the intensive treatments that I need for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I straighten and use a curling iron on my fine naturally curly hair almost daily.  </li>
            <li> I notice a less breakage and it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for treatment packets, as they usually don&#x27;t provide any results for my hair type, but I was really impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> As with most conditioning treatments, you can feel the difference in your hair after you rinse it out, but it usually only lasts until the next shampoo, which removes it from your hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I did not understand the rip off comments, I pay $30 from my hair dresser and this is cheaper for the product but the shipping might be high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It bonds the hair shaft back together to it&#x27;s original virgin state, completely restoring and reversing the chemical and/or heat damage.</li>
            <li> My curl pattern is more defined, I have less frizz (even without product) and my hair feels like it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft, silky, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Adds shine and new life to your hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> It is a new product like nothing in the market as of today.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products (both expensive and cheap)</li>
            <li> It makes your hair very very soft.</li>
            <li> I color my hair blonde and had abused hot tools for over 3 months I have used it twice</li>
            <li> I bought it here and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft or anything!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products that have fallen short on their promises.</li>
            <li> Soft!</li>
            <li> If you want soft hair, this is what you want in your life!</li>
            <li> my hair feels exactly how it did when I left my salon that day.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> cannot say that you will definitely get a certified original product when buying second hand, but I know certified people that do sell it there.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> the way, Olaplex No. 2 &amp; No. 3 are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is nothing compared to what this stuff does for your hair and all the ppl who gave it less than 5 stars, it&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle, but pretty damn close !!  </li>
            <li> The product keeps my blonde highlights longer with more shine and less frizz and dryness.</li>
            <li> That was my goal to get my hair back to previous length while maintaining healthy shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is the at home after care treatment, i just used it and made my hair melt like butter from how soft it feels.. definitely purchasing for as long as im blonde :)</li>
            <li> They want to be able to sell it to you themselves at a profit, which of course I get, but don&#x27;t leave it a negative review.</li>
            <li> I also used it as a leave in (much thicker application) and left in overnight.</li>
            <li> My straight damaged ends actually had some wavy texture and it is no longer mushy.</li>
            <li> I have used the complete Olaplex system (numbers 1 and 2 in the salon) and bought #3 to use at home...</li>
            <li> so when I apply the product, I just concentrate on the ends so to not waste it.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny with no tangles.</li>
            <li> It really does make my hair softer and shinier and healthier especially after I color my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very wavy/curly hair that I regularly straighten.</li>
            <li> I like this so far.  </li>
            <li> I have only bought it thru my hair stylist, it&#x27;s absolutely life changing.</li>
            <li> For convenience, I purchased Olaplex on Amazon after my bottle was near finished.</li>
            <li> friend is a stylist and she buys it for me from a professional store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that is possible because this really makes my hair in better condition, but I guess everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  </li>
            <li> and it has really helped to lessen the damage done by the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I tried other leave in conditioners and deep conditioners but didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the high price.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair, so I color my hair regularly (full head of highlights).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle but after using this 3 times my hair is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> Olaplex definitely help my grade of hair return to normal.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked well but will have to allow a few more weeks to give complete review as sometimes these products can make hair become flatter and have less body over time.</li>
            <li> I still had a small amount left of my original bottle and noticed that the one I had purchased off of Amazon was also a different consistency being much runnier and the smell was a bit off.</li>
            <li> Also due to the nature of the haircut I have to use a flat iron to smooth out my hair daily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is actually Olaplex so please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I use fashion colors, which means I am constantly reapplying color, and fairly frequently bleaching to near-white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a licensed professional, but I have done my research, do the same before using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin or watery conditioner, it seems to be moisturizing, I&#x27;ve used better stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more dense without feeling weighed down or too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural haired (no relaxer) black girl, with very curly (3a type) hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried &amp; strawlike from a combination of coloring and illness--this product was the ONLY change I made to my haircare routine, and I&#x27;ve got my old hair BACK!!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth the money just yet.</li>
            <li> I used to have frizzy, dry (chemically processed hair) and this has turned my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this helped much, I was going from black to blonde</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long down to my mid back</li>
            <li> I am little suspicious if it really is a real Olaplex product.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown straight hair just past my shoulders and have had my hair lightened 3x over the last 7 months and started to notice my hair breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently went from naturally Jet black hair to platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> and it will last for about a month (for long hair), maybe longer for short.</li>
            <li> Some of my ends broke off, my hair was soft and mushy when wet and like hay when dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown and naturally curly.</li>
            <li> One bottle only gives you 2 applications, for long hair</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde long hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron and dye my hair &amp;</li>
            <li> I have tightly coiled natural African-American hair.</li>
            <li> Good price, comparable to my hair stylist&#x27;s price but a few dollars less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ie... You need to wet your hair, towel dry your hair , place a small amount of the Olaplex in your hair and leave it on for at least 10 mins or more, but it has yo be 10 mins.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and my ends are not nearly as straw-like.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately since my hair is so long, this bottle is super small and I can only use it a handful of times before I need a new bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just turned 65 (shocking to a fit, high energy Boomer), but thanks to Olaplex, my hair looks 35.</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail I was very skeptical as it was a different color than the bottles I had previously gotten at my salon being more of a yellowish white.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders in my dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Did wonders for my dry hair that was breaking off and falling out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out what this actually did for my hair, other than make it really dry!!  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair down to the bottom of my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> Remember, a little goes a long way and you only need to apply once a week.</li>
            <li> If you use it like a conditioner, your hair will be stronger and shiny, but DRY!)  </li>
            <li> Be careful to not overuse, it will dry hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> I recently went in for my usual highlights and my stylist used steps 1 and 2 of the Olaplex system (for salon use only...</li>
            <li> I saw some of the other reviews about making your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> They get so slippery :) helped me recover from a bad bleach job.</li>
            <li> The ONLY product on the market that does so, which is why stylists are leaving it such negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, a few inches past the middle of my back</li>
            <li> no real difference</li>
            <li> It was fried -basically mush when wet.</li>
            <li> it is a very small bottle though so it won&#x27;t last very long but each bottle should last a few months depending on how long your hair is.  </li>
            <li> but I see on other reviews (mostly the bad ones) that people are thinking this is a conditioning.</li>
            <li> You may or may not want to use extra conditioner after that, or use very little of it.</li>
            <li> May not reorder due to price.</li>
            <li> Forget all the sexy Madison Avenue advertising that other brands use to sell us products that are better looking in their glamorous packaging, but fail miserably to perform on our hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant to be used alone, this is supposed to accompany the other two Olaplex products after a service.</li>
            <li> Such a small bottle though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must do your &#x27;due diligence&#x27; before using the product.  </li>
            <li> I went from black to blonde in a few weeks, a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and definitely see results but the directions are a bit confusing if you&#x27;re using it at home and not right after a color service.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, porous, coarse chest-length hair, and I used 2/3 of the bottle for one application.</li>
            <li> I did some research online and found this at-home treatment (No. 3) which is basically a watered down version of the treatments they use at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Was it watered down?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a big difference pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair</li>
            <li> Shiner, softer hair and noticeably less frizz on those ends.  </li>
            <li> Before I knew about olaplex, I was bleaching out my black hair to go pastel.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this product from my hair salon</li>
            <li> I used according to the directions, and there was absolutely no change after blowdrying/styling my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> it was not as thick as the one i purchased at the salon and has not lasted as long.</li>
            <li> I was losing a small handful  of hair a day due to damage and hormones.</li>
            <li> the other night!!  </li>
            <li> However, my hair was in desperate need of some deep conditioning and you use this only once a week.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After my third lightening the breakage was getting worse.</li>
            <li> Buy and use the take home product (#3) every few weeks, if you had preexisting, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a sunscreen for your hair before you do the harsh burning of bleach.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is watered down</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair noticeably less brittle!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I was hoping my hair would at least seem a little softer or stronger after using this treatment.</li>
            <li> my stylist in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it made any difference.</li>
            <li> I spend a small fortune.  </li>
            <li> comb it through &amp; let it sit for an hour or two, then wash &amp; condition as usual, once a week.  </li>
            <li> prices here are not much more than if you bought the product from your stylist or prof store.&lt;br /&gt;$30</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this, but I was very disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> Seriously, miraculous.</li>
            <li> I do feel it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair used to dry out so badly it would be crispy sometimes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The Olaplex system is a game changer.</li>
            <li> I think it made my hair horribly worse</li>
            <li> What a waste!!!!</li>
            <li> Just too expensive.</li>
            <li> What am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> When I was randomly out and about today at Rite Aid, I ended up picking up Hask coconut treatment packets.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical that this could make a difference to my hair</li>
            <li> Id like to use this once a week but sadly can&#x27;t afford to do so.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive it&#x27;d be a 5 Star.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and put it through the wringer with home highlight kits.</li>
            <li> I have used weekly for a couple of weeks as I am letting my hair grow out from a bad haircut.  </li>
            <li> My hair was fried after having four treatments in a month from a bad color job.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its the best product I know thanks</li>
            <li> What a waste!!!! I can&#x27;t figure out what this actually did for my hair, other than make it really dry!!  I&#x27;ve seen no benefit at all from this! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Buy it!! This is a must have if you dye your hair. I have had an ombr&amp;eacute; for years and my ends are fried. This ACTUALLY repairs. The ONLY product on the market that does so, which is why stylists are leaving it such negative reviews. They want to be able to sell it to you themselves at a profit, which of course I get, but don&#x27;t leave it a negative review. There is a safety seal, you are getting a genuine product. What faker would go through the costs of diluting a product and then factory sealing the item again? Could not be happier!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! My hair gets to dry and straight during warm Summer months. With Olaplex3 it is shiny, healthy, soft, and holds the curl. It has saved my hair.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t condition or enrich my hair at all....in fact, I would say the opposite.  Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works great! My hair feels stronger and the smoother.</li>
            <li> Still on the fence on this product.  My hairdresser just discovered this and is introducing to his clients.  I&#x27;ve only had one treatment from him and bought this product to supplement in between his treatments.  I would like to continue to use the product a couple more months to determine if there is any difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Just followed the directions and it works great! Saw a difference in 2 1/2 weeks ^_^</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful but way too expensive.  However, my hair was in desperate need of some deep conditioning and you use this only once a week.  Just too expensive.</li>
            <li> package arrived sealed. good product.</li>
            <li> My mom was recommended this from a hair stylist.  She loves it</li>
            <li> Amazing product to add to your haircare.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Adds shine and new life to your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much smoother and softer and much easier to comb through after using this product I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week it is a very small bottle though so it won&#x27;t last very long but each bottle should last a few months depending on how long your hair is.  My hair is pretty long down to my mid back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE-  it&#x27;s been over year since I first purchased this and I would still recommend it . My stylist does not use this in her salon when she colored my hair however I come home in the first time I wash my hair after coloring I use it and I can always tell a big difference in the texture and look and feel of my hair .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you feel like this review has been helpful to you in anyway please click the button below :)</li>
            <li> If you color your hair buy this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair treament, but it is NOT a conditioner. I use this before and after I bleach and do keratin treatments. My hair feels wonderful and does feel &#x27;newer.&#x27; I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love this Olaplex!  I am mostly using the #1 and #2, but I like to have the #3 avail for in between the intensive treatments that I need for my fine, thin hair.  It is really helping to keep it from breaking -- I have tons of 3 to 4 inch hairs  (my hair is mostly below my shoulders) and I wanted to protect this regrowth.  Olaplex and a good conditioner is all I need.</li>
            <li> OMG.. who doesn&#x27;t LOVE OLAPLEX??? Awesome!  If your stylist isn&#x27;t using it..please ask them WHY???</li>
            <li> This product did wonders in my dry damaged hair. I color my hair blonde and had abused hot tools for over 3 months I have used it twice and my hair is all wavy and healthy. Thank you! I&#x27;ll be back for more! ;)</li>
            <li> A must product for all women!</li>
            <li> Like the product, calms my hair. I do feel it is a little expensive. May not reorder due to price.</li>
            <li> This has really helped to make my hair look fuller and healthier</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a big difference pretty disappointed. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair for over 10 years so I was pretty excited to use this but I didn&#x27;t see noticeable results. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so hopefully you&#x27;ll have better results than I.</li>
            <li> Really love this product! I do not use much for my hair, just a good conditioner/shampoo. I used this as a leave in treatment, putting a dollop size in my hand and spreading throughout my hair before blowdrying. I also used it as a leave in (much thicker application) and left in overnight. My hair is noticeably healthier! Must try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel on my hair as silky as the No 2 did .. tangles hair at the ends .  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Dried my tips out, I have an ombre reason for this purchase , very dissatisfied .</li>
            <li> This was my last resort for my over processed bleached hair. My hair is dark brown and naturally curly. I had a stylist bleach my hair in an ombre and it ruined my hair. Some of my ends broke off, my hair was soft and mushy when wet and like hay when dry. My curls were fried and gone. I had a different salon do a fullOolaplex treatment (no color). After Olaplex my hair looked considerably better. My straight damaged ends actually had some wavy texture and it is no longer mushy. I used this No 3. as a take home treatment and I really can say this stuff works. I will no longer color my hair without Olaplex. It is worth the investment if you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair but want to change up your color as much as I do. 5 stars, well worth it since it saved my hair. I would have chopped my medium length hair to a bob if it wasn&#x27;t for Olaplex.</li>
            <li> Lotta hype for nothin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have used a bit once a week and it really conditions and repairs fantasticly</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Works great!</li>
            <li> I pay 14$ for this directly through Olaplex because I have a license!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and nice after two times of use.</li>
            <li> Ok so I went to my stylist and my hair felt great!! I bought it here and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft or anything! I&#x27;m kinda bummed that I didn&#x27;t get the same turn out?!? What am I doing wrong? The seller did great I got it in record time. I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting the same results as I did in the salon! 😞</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this, but I was very disappointed in the results. I have extremely thick, porous, coarse chest-length hair, and I used 2/3 of the bottle for one application. I was hoping this would help mend my straw like ends, in preparation for another treatment of bleach. I used according to the directions, and there was absolutely no change after blowdrying/styling my hair as usual. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I was hoping my hair would at least seem a little softer or stronger after using this treatment. I asked for a refund, which Amazon granted. When I was randomly out and about today at Rite Aid, I ended up picking up Hask coconut treatment packets. I don&#x27;t usually go for treatment packets, as they usually don&#x27;t provide any results for my hair type, but I was really impressed with the results. My hair feels softer and my ends are not nearly as straw-like. It was more effective than regular coconut oil as well. Just putting that out there as a product to try :)</li>
            <li> I like this product and definitely see results but the directions are a bit confusing if you&#x27;re using it at home and not right after a color service.  Would love if Olaplex came out with a shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!!!! One bottle only gives you 2 applications, for long hair</li>
            <li> My hair much softer and FRIZZIER!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and put it through the wringer with home highlight kits. I was extremely skeptical that this could make a difference to my hair I have tried so many other products that have fallen short on their promises. I am glad to say that this one actually did what it said. After using it I noticed how great my hair felt and looked. I will continue to use this on a regular basis sadly results don&#x27;t last for too many days.  The only drawback is the high price.  Id like to use this once a week but sadly can&#x27;t afford to do so.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as step #3 as I recently had steps 1-2 completed at my salon and they were out of this so it was great to be able to receive this so quickly.  My hair is super soft and strong!</li>
            <li> The best hair product ever, so much bounce and body now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from this very sellar. It arrived looking like an Olaplex product and was even &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34;. However, I have received this product from a salon/my stylist in the past so I know what it should look/smell/feel like. The product I bought from this seller is thinner, runnier, and off in color. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing. Used this product only once and won&#x27;t be using the rest. Waste of money. Next time I&#x27;ll just buy it from my stylist. I recomend you do the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it made any difference. Pricey!</li>
            <li> I have medium brown straight hair just past my shoulders and have had my hair lightened 3x over the last 7 months and started to notice my hair breaking. My stylist uses olaplex at the salon but I never purchased the at home treatment. I tried other leave in conditioners and deep conditioners but didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement. After my third lightening the breakage was getting worse. I decided it was worth the $ to try this. It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle but after using this 3 times my hair is almost back to normal. The last time I kept it on overnight and loved the results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Definitely increases the strength and healthy appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC product!  My hair endured many chemical processes within the course of three months-due to a color SNAFU. This product saved my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair should be fried and falling out. I use fashion colors, which means I am constantly reapplying color, and fairly frequently bleaching to near-white. My hair used to dry out so badly it would be crispy sometimes. Deep conditioning was only somewhat effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was told to use Olaplex by my future sister in law, who has been doing hair for many years and is great. She was right! This stuff is the BEST. I recommend this product to anyone that has stressed out, chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product twice now and so far very pleased with the results. My hair feels smoother, and in conjunction with my recent keratin treatment, the Olaplex seems to provide a barrier of protection. On both occasions, I&#x27;ve opted to leave the Olaplex on my hair for deeper penetration. Not sure whether this strategy is effective, but hey, I&#x27;m workin&#x27; it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I&#x27;m a natural haired (no relaxer) black girl, with very curly (3a type) hair. I have very dark brown hair, so I color my hair regularly (full head of highlights). The Olaplex system is a game changer. This is not like all the other products I&#x27;ve purchased that sit on top of the hair, or makes your hair feel great until you wash it out... It actually repairs your hair, strand by strand! And the difference is REMARKABLE. I&#x27;ve used everything imaginable to improve the elasticity and strength of my hair. I co-wash, I use a variety of oils to seal my hair, do protective styling, steam conditioning, etc. etc...  but my hair always broke off a bit when I colored it. (Not to mention that curly hair is just prone to breakage anyway!) I have used the complete Olaplex system (numbers 1 and 2 in the salon) and bought #3 to use at home... And I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!! So-- If you are going to get your hair colored at a salon, ask for Olaplex. Yeah, it costs extra. And yeah, it&#x27;s worth it. Buy and use the take home product (#3) every few weeks, if you had preexisting, damaged hair. (Be sure to use #3 as directed-- it is NOT a conditioner. If you use it like a conditioner, your hair will be stronger and shiny, but DRY!)  So remember to condition well after! If you have virgin hair that is damaged you can use the system to repair your hair without adding any color (many salons will provide that service if you ask.) It seriously best the hair product of the year!! My curl pattern is more defined, I have less frizz (even without product) and my hair feels like it&#x27;s brand new.  Strong! Shiny! Soft! Happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? I LOVE this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;(Drops mic, and walks away)  :)</li>
            <li> Just like it said in the listing. Fast Ship</li>
            <li> This product is not a same as from salon. It is runnier and does not work quite as well. I am little suspicious if it really is a real Olaplex product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Be careful to not overuse, it will dry hair out a bit. Shedding stopped immediately.  I use with amino acids alternating between the two. I am going to get the treatment fully to continue hair health. I have tightly coiled natural African-American hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin or watery conditioner, it seems to be moisturizing, I&#x27;ve used better stuff. Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Ok. Hair softer  Nothing amazing</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve been chemically processing my hair for years and since I started using Olaplex I notice a less breakage and it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product! Very satisfied with this purchase. The product keeps my blonde highlights longer with more shine and less frizz and dryness.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this at the salon. The treatment cost $15-$20 each time so I figured I could just do it myself at home. Remember, a little goes a long way and you only need to apply once a week. But I would recommend for the maximum time of 30 minutes so schedule it and give yourself time to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a balage ombre and the ends are what really needs repair so when I apply the product, I just concentrate on the ends so to not waste it. After 2 treatments, my hair is very well fortified and feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> Buy it!It works! Your hair will be like silk!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Not an amazing heal my hair but helpful. Hair damaged from coloring etc did help some. Not sure if it is worth the money just yet.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Definitely saw an improvement in the texture of my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I can already tell a difference in the texture and healthiness of my hair. Will definitely be buying Olaplex from this seller again! :) thank you</li>
            <li> Worth every penny - in fact, worth triple the cost.  I went from black to blonde in a few weeks, a few months ago.  Olaplex #3 has brought back the shine, bounce, and strength.  This little bottle provides my medium length hair with 4 good weekly treatments.  Midweek I use organic coconut oil one hour before shampooing.  The combo really works for me.  Try it!  One more thing, I did NOT use Olaplex 1 or 2..... Just #3 -  next time I will try 1 &amp; 2......can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Love it !!! My hair is amazing and so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it&#x27;s a miracle worker. I have tried things before due to great reviews and most were just ok, nothing great enough to warrant a review. I have long hair, a few inches past the middle of my back and it&#x27;s damaged from trying to bleach it at home. It was falling out in the shower and when I would brush or comb. I left this on over night, total time was about 10-11 hours before rinsing it out and washing with shampoo. When I got out of the shower and combed my hair, no tangles and the comb had no hair on it!  My hair is soft, shiny with no tangles. I was losing a small handful  of hair a day due to damage and hormones. Since using this product there has been a significant change in the amount. This is the first hair product I have ever used that actually works this good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any significant improvement in my hair. Have been using it once a week for a month. I leave it in all night, wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfekt. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned below that it is meant to go with Olaplex No 1 and 2, however, on Olaplex&#x27;s website, it CLEARLY states that No 1 and 2 can be used independently of No 3 and you DON&#x27;T have to have them for it to be effective. It is meant to be a take home for clients. You should see some immediate results, but you will see the integrity of your hair continue to get better with use. Love Olaplex as I dye my level 4 hair platinum and pastel regularly and am always changing my hair color.</li>
            <li> Love Olaplex, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. This is the hair perfector, you use it after bleaching to bring strength back to your hair. Fast shipping from this seller and product came perfectly packaged. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Super fast deliver and amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I went from brunette to blonde and this product helped save my hair.  I was happy to get it at such a great price too.</li>
            <li> Best thing you can put on your hair!</li>
            <li> I found out about this by accident by a hair salon.  It really does make my hair softer and shinier and healthier especially after I color my hair.  I use it once a week and have been leaving it on overnight.  I saw some of the other reviews about making your hair dry.  I&#x27;m not sure how that is possible because this really makes my hair in better condition, but I guess everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This seems like a genuine product but its not worth the money on its own, only use it with the whole system.</li>
            <li> My order came so fast &amp; packed well.</li>
            <li> Omg! Blondes out there... If you want soft hair, this is what you want in your life! After the first time I used it I already noticed a huge difference in my hair! I&#x27;m amazed at how well this product works! Whoever invented this stuff is a hair GOD!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it!</li>
            <li> This leaves your hair feeling and looking amazing. Once a week is all you need to keep and maintain color and health.</li>
            <li> Received it sealed. Great product, but I see on other reviews (mostly the bad ones) that people are thinking this is a conditioning. #3 is to be used as a home treatment after you had #1 and #2 treatment done. It will work well alone, but it is a diluted version of #2 so is not as strong alone. After I use #3 I follow by a deep conditioning, and my hair feels great. I&#x27;m not a licensed professional, but I have done my research, do the same before using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome but not worth the price. I have naturally black hair and I dyed it blonde. My stylist recommended I use this stuff once a week to keep my hair strong and healthy. Although it did keep it strong, healthy, and smooth, I do not think it is worth the price since it comes in such a small bottle! Once a week and it will last for about a month (for long hair), maybe longer for short. I think you can find a cheaper option with similar results.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair noticeably less brittle!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair today and it is absolutely amazing..I have highlighted my hair for over 30 years and have always had healthy hair because I use the Wen products...but this addition is fantastic...</li>
            <li> I have been highlighting my hair blonde for 15 years. I have very wavy/curly hair that I regularly straighten. I recently went in for my usual highlights and my stylist used steps 1 and 2 of the Olaplex system (for salon use only... No. 1 goes in the highlight bleach and No. 2 is applied in between foil removal and water rinse and before shampoo/conditioner). For about a week after, my hair did not feel like my own, in a good way! Soft and shiny, very easy to style. HEALTHY. Drying time was quicker as well.  I did some research online and found this at-home treatment (No. 3) which is basically a watered down version of the treatments they use at the salon.  Every time I use this product (every 1-2 weeks) my hair feels exactly how it did when I left my salon that day. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and result was amazing ,make the hair really soft! The reason I gave 4 star is too pricey for the amount !</li>
            <li> Transforming.....that is the best that I can put it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently went from naturally Jet black hair to platinum blonde. It was not an easy and fast process but i thank my hair stylists for always using Olaplex. It&#x27;s like a sunscreen for your hair before you do the harsh burning of bleach. Seriously the best invention made for those who want blonde hair , but fear of sacrificing the health of your hair. This product is the at home after care treatment, i just used it and made my hair melt like butter from how soft it feels.. definitely purchasing for as long as im blonde :)</li>
            <li> Gives you back baby hair. Really! To the point you can&#x27;t braid them. They get so slippery :) helped me recover from a bad bleach job.</li>
            <li> it was not as thick as the one i purchased at the salon and has not lasted as long.Was it watered down?</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes your hair amazing!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Did wonders for my dry hair that was breaking off and falling out. I am no longer losing hair and I have the shine back.</li>
            <li> After using this product once a week for four weeks my hair feels stronger and is no longer breaking.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!! My hair is longer and healthier then its ever been - HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product. The hair gets soft and its feels very good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this helped much, I was going from black to blonde so I knew my hair was going to get really damage and I saw lots of reviews on youtube about this product but I&#x27;m guessing it works better if you use all the products.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a difference! But i am using #1,2 at the salon as well.</li>
            <li> If I ran my fingers through ng hair, 15-20 would fall out! Excess bleaching problems. But the first time I used this I didn&#x27;t think it would do much, but it did! I have almost no hair loss since using it! Holy grail product.</li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market, must buy! Great for damaged and split ends.</li>
            <li> Love it - it really made my hair stronger on the first use</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m not no hair stylist, just a girl who dyes her hair a lot!  This stuff has been a life savor for my hair!  The price is nothing compared to what this stuff does for your hair and all the ppl who gave it less than 5 stars, it&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle, but pretty damn close !!  Get it if you dye or bleach your hair often!</li>
            <li> I have really fine medium brown hair that was recently lightened quite a bit. My stylist used Olaplaex when she was lightening it, and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff around once a week since. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic, but have definitely not been getting many split ends - so that&#x27;s progress!</li>
            <li> Spectacular. There is no other high quality, immediately effective, hair  treatment on the market to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; dry, over processed hair. I&#x27;ve tried them all. This Olaplex formula is magic for your hair. Forget all the sexy Madison Avenue advertising that other brands use to sell us products that are better looking in their glamorous packaging, but fail miserably to perform on our hair. I&#x27;m an Olaplex girl for life. I&#x27;ve just turned 65 (shocking to a fit, high energy Boomer), but thanks to Olaplex, my hair looks 35.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product. It will forever be a staple in my beauty cabinet!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking and feeling like a million dollars</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Bought to use in between salon appts as a color extend</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde long hair. I am always looking for a magical product to improve my hairs texture and consistency. Since I color my hair, you gals know what a pain in the butt keeping your hair looking luscious is like and this is that product. Unfortunately since my hair is so long, this bottle is super small and I can only use it a handful of times before I need a new bottle but IMO it&#x27;s worth it. I wet my hair down and night and lather my hair up win this and let it sit in my hair overnight. Wash it out in the morning and my hair feels like it&#x27;s never been touched my chemicals or heat. I am In love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I buy from my stylist but love this stuff.  I perm and dye hair and it has helped make it shine again.  I use it at home and then when I get my hair done, my stylist uses it also.  I did not understand the rip off comments, I pay $30 from my hair dresser and this is cheaper for the product but the shipping might be high.  As far as the product goes however, it is awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautician use this on my hair and charged me quite a bit of money. But seeing this value it&#x27;s so much cheaper to do my own hair and get the high quality that this product produces. Deborah</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy this product.  My mother purchased this from a local salon at double the price and I had to find it.  I have highlighted blonde hair down to the bottom of my shoulder blades.  I straighten and use a curling iron on my fine naturally curly hair almost daily.  To keep my hair from being too damaged I spend a small fortune.  This is the best bang for my buck that I&#x27;ve found.  You notice a difference from the first time you use this product.  Shiner, softer hair and noticeably less frizz on those ends.  I will never be without a bottle of this stuff.  My product came in a sealed plastic bag, and the bottle was sealed with no evidence of tampering.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a whole lot for the price, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I had hope for. I think it made my hair horribly worse</li>
            <li> I like this so far.  I have used weekly for a couple of weeks as I am letting my hair grow out from a bad haircut.  Also due to the nature of the haircut I have to use a flat iron to smooth out my hair daily and it has really helped to lessen the damage done by the flat iron.  That was my goal to get my hair back to previous length while maintaining healthy shiny hair.  So far it has worked well but will have to allow a few more weeks to give complete review as sometimes these products can make hair become flatter and have less body over time.</li>
            <li> Delivery is always fast, I Love being able to use this product between hair appointments! A+++</li>
            <li> I see allot of people saying this product did not work for them. It&#x27;s not meant to be used alone, this is supposed to accompany the other two Olaplex products after a service. Also, number three is supposed to be used once a week. If your expecting it to magically fix everything in one use you need a reality check. It works over time to help strengthen the hair. Make sure you read up and do your research before purchasing. It seems like allot of people buying this have no idea what it&#x27;s meant for, which is why licensed professionals offer it as a service. I use this on my customers regularly, because I am licensed and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Olaplex definitely help my grade of hair return to normal. I died my hair blonde a week ago, used this conditioner, and my hair feels normal and healthy. Such a small bottle though.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> used only once-not sure how it performed.  no real difference</li>
            <li> Ohhhhh my!!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great! The best product I found for my hair. It was recommend it to me by my hairdresser as a maintenance product.</li>
            <li> Delivered so quickly and product is excellent - thank you</li>
            <li> LOVE!! Hair miracle-especially for over processed hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I was excited to have received the order so quickly!</li>
            <li> Olaplex is amazing. I have only bought it thru my hair stylist, it&#x27;s absolutely life changing. I flat iron and dye my hair &amp; this stuff has made my hair finally healthy and it grows!!</li>
            <li> My hair was fried after having four treatments in a month from a bad color job. I still needed a light trim, but after two uses my hair was perfectly healthy again!</li>
            <li> The best product for damage hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works well but getting part 1 and 2 done first helps see better results faster!</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t done much for me. Mayo works better</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair!! I used to have frizzy, dry (chemically processed hair) and this has turned my hair soft and silky. I have tried so many products (both expensive and cheap) that really didn&#x27;t much and I was so excited when I discovered this gem. :)</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it and I use it once a week and what a difference in my hair!  It&#x27;s more dense without feeling weighed down or too heavy.  Very good for the hair.  Good price, comparable to my hair stylist&#x27;s price but a few dollars less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> you can get this guaranteed not to be counterfit  from a licenced hair stylist for $30. RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> This literally SAVED my hair. It&#x27;s a miracle product. Before I knew about olaplex, I was bleaching out my black hair to go pastel. It was fried -basically mush when wet. During my final process, my hair sylist added olaplex to the bleach &amp; I got this to use at home. Seriously, miraculous. My hair is still fine and on the dry side, but, no longer mush or like straw.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this product from my hair salon and it truly works wonders on my hair. For convenience, I purchased Olaplex on Amazon after my bottle was near finished. When I received it in the mail I was very skeptical as it was a different color than the bottles I had previously gotten at my salon being more of a yellowish white. I still had a small amount left of my original bottle and noticed that the one I had purchased off of Amazon was also a different consistency being much runnier and the smell was a bit off. I do not recommend this product! I don&#x27;t believe it is actually Olaplex so please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> My hair was fried &amp; strawlike from a combination of coloring and illness--this product was the ONLY change I made to my haircare routine, and I&#x27;ve got my old hair BACK!!  It&#x27;s shiny, has fantastic movement, and feels like silk--even my teenage daughter commented on it ( unsolicited!!) the other night!!  Great stuff--I use it on damp, unwashed hair...comb it through &amp; let it sit for an hour or two, then wash &amp; condition as usual, once a week.  My hair is BAAAACK....can&#x27;t say enough good, true things about this product...worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! My hair feels amazing, shiny and strong!</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from highlighting &amp; using this product weekly has saved my hair. It can be used as a stand- alone treatment!&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;My friend is a stylist and she buys it for me from a professional store. It is very easy to use; the directions are simple and very clear.&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t have my friend to buy it for me, I&#x27;d probably buy it from eebay as there are licensed professionals selling it there.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that you will definitely get a certified original product when buying second hand, but I know certified people that do sell it there.&lt;br /&gt;They understand that some people can&#x27;t afford to go the salon to get the pricey Olaplex process done. They also understand that many people color their own hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you buy from another site, make sure they are a hair dresser and offer email exchanges for guidance in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also purchase from the salon owner sellers with the most information, ingredients, and directions for the product listed in the description area.&lt;br /&gt;I use Olaplex No. 1 &amp; 2 as stand alone treatments right now to correct damage.  With each treatment, I see more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Olaplex No. 2 &amp; No. 3 are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices here are not much more than if you bought the product from your stylist or prof store.&lt;br /&gt;$30 is the norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My licensed friend also told me that OLAPLEX shouldn&#x27;t be used with box dyes.&lt;br /&gt;You must do your &#x27;due diligence&#x27; before using the product.  Read and follow all directions that come with the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff left my hair feeling like it felt when I was a kid. My hair now is naturally coarse (from going gray) and dyed to within and inch of its life (from going gray), but after the treatment in the salon and one follow-up use at home it&#x27;s soft, silky, and very shiny. It&#x27;s really kind of a miracle.</li>
            <li> One big misconception is that #3 has to be used only once per week. I use it as a leave in conditioner at least 3 times a week. This stuff is incredible and I&#x27;d be a frizzy mess without it. Bought mine on eBay for 14.00. Same size, sealed product. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. I have bleached hair and used Olaplex in the salon. This is very similar and has similar effects.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this at my hair salon. It is great. It makes your hair very very soft. You have to make sure that you do exactly what directions say. ie... You need to wet your hair, towel dry your hair , place a small amount of the Olaplex in your hair and leave it on for at least 10 mins or more, but it has yo be 10 mins. Rinse it out then wash as you normally would.your hair will look and feel great. I highly recommend this product. I will be buying more when the time comes. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It gives my fine hair a lot of volume and it makes it soft and silky!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! This is a unique formula of oil based protein molecule. It bonds the hair shaft back together to it&#x27;s original virgin state, completely restoring and reversing the chemical and/or heat damage. As with most conditioning treatments, you can feel the difference in your hair after you rinse it out, but it usually only lasts until the next shampoo, which removes it from your hair. This is different: it&#x27;s a pre-shampoo treatment, so when you rinse it out, your hair feels very smooth and silky, then you shampoo and as you rinse the shampoo out the silkiness and smoothness is still there! You may or may not want to use extra conditioner after that, or use very little of it. Hair savior!</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive it&#x27;d be a 5 Star.</li>
            <li> Have used two times already and my hair feels great its shiny and has repaired much of my damaged hair. Not sure if this product is watered down but I have seen results, was pricy but def worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to use after a chemical processing. It saved my hair. This ia a must for anyone who wants to bleach or chemically process hair. Read about olaplex. It is a new product like nothing in the market as of today.</li>
