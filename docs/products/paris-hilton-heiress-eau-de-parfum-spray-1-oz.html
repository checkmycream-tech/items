            <li>but this has very strong alcohol smell that doesn&#x27;t smell anything like &#x27;Heiress.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>It had somehow matured lady&#x27;s smell but still smells quite young and delightful.</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>but whatevs gf liked it im sure yours might as well</li>

            <li>Nothing special, I&#x27;ll wear it until the bottle is gone</li>
            <li>I bought it for someone special, and believe me it is a gift that no woman will ever forget.</li>
            <li>This was on a special since I had bought another fragrance</li>
            <li>Sweet delicate very delicious for me!</li>
            <li>i love this scent, my bf didn&#x27;t like the perfumes i was wearing, but then i got this one, he loves it just as much as i do, he just kept smelling me all day.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews and every one saying how sweet it is I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>So for those who like sweet fruity perfumes this is not the one.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a bottle from Amazon and when it arrived my friend could not believe it smelled so good</li>
            <li>bigger than my guess, but still good.</li>
            <li>I probably saved a lot more too haha.</li>
            <li>When I got home, I fully opened the packaging and got the full experience.</li>
            <li>it smells so feminine and sweet, not not fruity at all.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite Paris Hilton scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet buy not in a bubblegum-candy sort of way.</li>
            <li>I really like the orginal Paris Hillton perfume a lot more.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best fragrance featuring Paris Hilton, I gave my sister for the first time and then did his personal favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good present</li>
            <li>True to discription.  </li>
            <li>Girly and sweet.</li>
            <li>Not even good enough to spray in the bathroom!!!</li>
            <li>So girls if they like sweet fruity fragrance trend, this is a good option at a very low price!</li>
            <li>Has a sweet and warm scent that last but is not too strong that it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for this perfume and such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and wife loves it.</li>
            <li>Super recommended .</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite Perfume spray and it was at good price, this item is not strong</li>
            <li>and I know exactly how the bottle looks (with a mirror on one side) and smells, but this had a cheap reflective sticker on the bottle try to make it look like a mirror</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product, the shipment and the total experience.</li>
            <li>First off I don&#x27;t buy cheap perfume-</li>
            <li>I received this product very fast!  </li>
            <li>If you are in your 20s-30s and like sweet scents, this one&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Sweet, candy, fun.</li>
            <li>A very pretty and fresh.</li>
            <li>And after the first application I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists!</li>
            <li>Lovely, soft and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Any recommendations on a nice smelling perfume that actually LAST?</li>
            <li>By far my favorite perfume EVER.</li>
            <li>worth the price, trust me.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be a fresh product...</li>
            <li>Just what I expected... Loved it</li>
            <li>its girly, fresh, and fun.</li>
            <li>Compared to other leading brands, this one is a good deal.</li>
            <li>For those who like flowery smells this one might be the right one for you.</li>
            <li>, she went and bought one right away.</li>
            <li>It was given to me as a gift and the scent is just right.</li>
            <li>Paris did something right with this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is the best gift you can give a woman, your mother your wife your girlfriend, your daughter, you will be fascinated because it is a very subtle fragrance</li>
            <li>I am very prone to headaches when perfume is just strong, but with this, I can spray on however much</li>
            <li>As you first spray it it does give kind of bubble gum smell but than it becomes really strong floral fragrance and not sweet at all...</li>
            <li>I really like sweet perfumes that have fruity tones to it.</li>
            <li>Almost like cotton candy, or sweet flowers but not too strong like alot of other sweet perfumes!</li>
            <li>my bf liked it so much, he found this scent as a roll-on oil, smells the same, but that is one that even i can smell all day.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not a Paris Hilton fan, this is by far my absolute favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li>it came super fast...</li>
            <li>simply because it&#x27;s soft, smells good and don&#x27;t make my allergies kick in.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li>The package was delivered in about 4 days and came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The real perfume has very dreamy and sweet fragrance</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this perfume for me when we first started dating 7 yrs ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years - ever since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The perfume is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Such a potent perfume and it lingers.</li>
            <li>My wife and i first smelled this scent on a lady walking in front of us into the mall and my wife (who never likes perfumes) stopped her to ask what she was wearing.</li>
            <li>I felt i had too many that smelled exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Thanks Paris Hilton!</li>
            <li>Overall I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is not what the REAL perfume smells like!</li>
            <li>I find this scent very unique and have not come across similar fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like the sweet almost fruity/ citrus smell and find it blends in well with most of my other citrus perfumes.</li>
            <li>The scent is very soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>I then decided to try this one due to friends claiming it was nice.</li>
            <li>…they don’t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic.</li>
            <li>Soft, sweet and flirty.</li>
            <li>This sweet fragrance is recommended for young women.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it i&#x27;m due to buy some more. :)</li>
            <li>Very clever</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I read the description that amazon provided of what&#x27;s the certain smells that are in the perfume</li>
            <li>Honestly this is not sweet at all...</li>
            <li>Just smells plain sexy!</li>
            <li>When I bought this at some local mall, I did not expect much thing from this, cause the price was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I just really wondered how it going to smell on me if I wear it.</li>
            <li>Its very flowery.</li>
            <li>because I ordered, it came really fast</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>You have to spray it on your skin to really know if you are going to like it or not.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>This is a gift, so I cannot really rate this perfume.</li>
            <li>After all that i should have just went straight to amazon.</li>
            <li>im not an employee or family of an employee,, I&#x27;m a real customer speaking a real experience/ opinion.</li>
            <li>Costing approximately $70 in Costa Rica, it was a great purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore</li>
            <li>it have a soft smell that every female would love....</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume in the whole wide world.</li>
            <li>Great for spring/summer when you want a subtle fragrance to delight your senses!</li>
            <li>This scent is unbelievable and for the price, you really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li>and I actually prefer Paris hiltons original fragrance over this one.  </li>
            <li>Before, I got this as a gift from a Paris Hilton Perfume set (along with my other favorite fragrance, CanCan).</li>
            <li>Last a long time and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Smells similar to Sweet Pea</li>
            <li>I am older &amp;#60;50&amp;#62; and hesitated about buying this</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main thing I want in a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about this other than I bought it to wear to work because it is such a fresh and clean scent that smells pretty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and company.  </li>
            <li>I use to wear this all the time in High School but could never find it in stores after awhile.</li>
            <li>Remember the way the box smells when you got a new particularly girly (maybe with sparkle extensions, or 15 outfits included)</li>
            <li>Hard to describe really, it&#x27;s similar to the original Paris Hilton perfume, but better.</li>
            <li>, right size will definitely buy again when run out.</li>
            <li>it is ok  somewhat diluted and concentrated very little smell, but</li>
            <li>but I couldnt score it higher than a 3 because the scent/aroma fades after only about an hour or so...</li>
            <li>She gave us the name and we went directly to the perfume store in our mall where THEY were selling it for almost 45 dollars!</li>
            <li>I first used this perfume in middle school.</li>
            <li>I love wearing not only this scent but a lot of her other fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this huge bottle for less than a month</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>its not to strong not to weak its just right for me.</li>
            <li>It is clear and not oily, it doesn&#x27;t mark or stain clothes.</li>
            <li>i would discribe this scent as young, yet mature, floral, yet fruity.</li>
            <li>every man alive can&#x27;t resist this smell</li>
            <li>please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>You can wear this for any occasion or for a daily scent and it won&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a calming, classy scent.</li>
            <li>It has a really sweet,honey, candy smell to it that I just can&#x27;t get enough of</li>
            <li>It has a weird kind of fruity smell, I can&#x27;t really describe.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is sweet, a little fruity &amp; aimed for the young!</li>
            <li>Slightly embarrassed that it is &#x27;Paris Hilton&#x27; but truly worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Its a fun scent, when it camr out In 2007 it was different than the other scents out at that time.</li>
            <li>and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously the most addictive smell EVER!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too sweet smelling if you use it daily.</li>
            <li>Long last and very sensual aroma..</li>
            <li>apparently paris hilton smells like perfume.</li>
            <li>One could say it stinks but in a good way.</li>
            <li>She has also just bought 2 new Paris Hilton perfumes and needless to say, Paris Hilton sure knows how to make perfume.</li>
            <li>Super delicate and femenine fragrance.</li>

            <li> price is perfect and the quality is super satisfying.</li>
            <li> It makes for a pleasant work fragrance, you will smell very fresh and uplifting so for that reason id recommend to give it a try!</li>
            <li> It has an amazing smell and package</li>
            <li> It smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and my wife (who is prone to migraines from perfumes) has worn it (along with Siren, and Passport to Paris) almost every day and has yet to have any sort of issues.</li>
            <li> Am happy to say the perfume was genuine.  </li>

            <li> spectacular fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it says perfume is under hazardous category that I can&#x27;t even return.  </li>
            <li> and i saw some that i liked, so i ordered it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spray a lot either, which is nice.</li>

            <li> Great product, was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love Heiress because it smells sweet and fresh, and its not too strong.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not that strong.</li>
            <li> It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume has an amazing scent and is very sweet and lasting in the body and clothing</li>
            <li> I have Estee Lauder Knowing, and it smells nice and last, but it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> I have many new perfumes and I have thrown away many throughout the years, but this one remains in my collection.</li>
            <li> You rather stick with the original Paris Hilton perfume...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light and sweet fragrant.</li>
            <li> But if you wear it every other day it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I always feel fresh when I wear this!</li>

            <li> 100% original excelente</li>
            <li> The products are 100% original .</li>
            <li> Its has a light fruity, powdery scent that&#x27;s sweet but doesn&#x27;t smell like the essence of sugar.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opinión les sea útil.</li>
            <li> Amazon made this product available at a reasonable price and ofcourse this is my favorite spray.</li>
            <li> The scent if light but very very pretty, I always get complimented.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I&#x27;ll wear it until the bottle is gone</li>
            <li> I bought it for someone special, and believe me it is a gift that no woman will ever forget.</li>
            <li> This was on a special since I had bought another fragrance</li>
            <li> Sweet delicate very delicious for me!</li>
            <li> i love this scent, my bf didn&#x27;t like the perfumes i was wearing, but then i got this one, he loves it just as much as i do, he just kept smelling me all day.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews and every one saying how sweet it is I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> So for those who like sweet fruity perfumes this is not the one.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a bottle from Amazon and when it arrived my friend could not believe it smelled so good</li>
            <li> bigger than my guess, but still good.</li>
            <li> I probably saved a lot more too haha.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I fully opened the packaging and got the full experience.</li>
            <li> it smells so feminine and sweet, not not fruity at all.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite Paris Hilton scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet buy not in a bubblegum-candy sort of way.</li>
            <li> I really like the orginal Paris Hillton perfume a lot more.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best fragrance featuring Paris Hilton, I gave my sister for the first time and then did his personal favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good present</li>
            <li> True to discription.  </li>
            <li> Girly and sweet.</li>
            <li> Not even good enough to spray in the bathroom!!!</li>
            <li> So girls if they like sweet fruity fragrance trend, this is a good option at a very low price!</li>
            <li> Has a sweet and warm scent that last but is not too strong that it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this perfume and such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Super recommended .</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Perfume spray and it was at good price, this item is not strong</li>
            <li> and I know exactly how the bottle looks (with a mirror on one side) and smells, but this had a cheap reflective sticker on the bottle try to make it look like a mirror</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product, the shipment and the total experience.</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t buy cheap perfume-</li>
            <li> I received this product very fast!  </li>
            <li> If you are in your 20s-30s and like sweet scents, this one&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Sweet, candy, fun.</li>
            <li> A very pretty and fresh.</li>
            <li> And after the first application I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists!</li>
            <li> Lovely, soft and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Any recommendations on a nice smelling perfume that actually LAST?</li>
            <li> By far my favorite perfume EVER.</li>
            <li> worth the price, trust me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be a fresh product...</li>
            <li> Just what I expected... Loved it</li>
            <li> its girly, fresh, and fun.</li>
            <li> Compared to other leading brands, this one is a good deal.</li>
            <li> For those who like flowery smells this one might be the right one for you.</li>
            <li> , she went and bought one right away.</li>
            <li> It was given to me as a gift and the scent is just right.</li>
            <li> Paris did something right with this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It is the best gift you can give a woman, your mother your wife your girlfriend, your daughter, you will be fascinated because it is a very subtle fragrance</li>
            <li> I am very prone to headaches when perfume is just strong, but with this, I can spray on however much</li>
            <li> As you first spray it it does give kind of bubble gum smell but than it becomes really strong floral fragrance and not sweet at all...</li>
            <li> I really like sweet perfumes that have fruity tones to it.</li>
            <li> Almost like cotton candy, or sweet flowers but not too strong like alot of other sweet perfumes!</li>
            <li> my bf liked it so much, he found this scent as a roll-on oil, smells the same, but that is one that even i can smell all day.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a Paris Hilton fan, this is by far my absolute favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li> it came super fast...</li>
            <li> simply because it&#x27;s soft, smells good and don&#x27;t make my allergies kick in.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I fell in love instantly.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered in about 4 days and came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The real perfume has very dreamy and sweet fragrance</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me when we first started dating 7 yrs ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years - ever since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The perfume is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Such a potent perfume and it lingers.</li>
            <li> My wife and i first smelled this scent on a lady walking in front of us into the mall and my wife (who never likes perfumes) stopped her to ask what she was wearing.</li>
            <li> I felt i had too many that smelled exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Thanks Paris Hilton!</li>
            <li> Overall I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is not what the REAL perfume smells like!</li>
            <li> I find this scent very unique and have not come across similar fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like the sweet almost fruity/ citrus smell and find it blends in well with most of my other citrus perfumes.</li>
            <li> The scent is very soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> I then decided to try this one due to friends claiming it was nice.</li>
            <li> …they don’t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic.</li>
            <li> Soft, sweet and flirty.</li>
            <li> This sweet fragrance is recommended for young women.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it i&#x27;m due to buy some more. :)</li>
            <li> Very clever</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I read the description that amazon provided of what&#x27;s the certain smells that are in the perfume</li>
            <li> Honestly this is not sweet at all...</li>
            <li> Just smells plain sexy!</li>
            <li> When I bought this at some local mall, I did not expect much thing from this, cause the price was so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I just really wondered how it going to smell on me if I wear it.</li>
            <li> Its very flowery.</li>
            <li> because I ordered, it came really fast</li>
            <li> Got here fast.</li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> You have to spray it on your skin to really know if you are going to like it or not.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> This is a gift, so I cannot really rate this perfume.</li>
            <li> After all that i should have just went straight to amazon.</li>
            <li> im not an employee or family of an employee,, I&#x27;m a real customer speaking a real experience/ opinion.</li>
            <li> Costing approximately $70 in Costa Rica, it was a great purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore</li>
            <li> it have a soft smell that every female would love....</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume in the whole wide world.</li>
            <li> Great for spring/summer when you want a subtle fragrance to delight your senses!</li>
            <li> This scent is unbelievable and for the price, you really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> and I actually prefer Paris hiltons original fragrance over this one.  </li>
            <li> Before, I got this as a gift from a Paris Hilton Perfume set (along with my other favorite fragrance, CanCan).</li>
            <li> Last a long time and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Smells similar to Sweet Pea</li>
            <li> I am older &amp;#60;50&amp;#62; and hesitated about buying this</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main thing I want in a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this other than I bought it to wear to work because it is such a fresh and clean scent that smells pretty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and company.  </li>
            <li> I use to wear this all the time in High School but could never find it in stores after awhile.</li>
            <li> Remember the way the box smells when you got a new particularly girly (maybe with sparkle extensions, or 15 outfits included)</li>
            <li> Hard to describe really, it&#x27;s similar to the original Paris Hilton perfume, but better.</li>
            <li> , right size will definitely buy again when run out.</li>
            <li> it is ok  somewhat diluted and concentrated very little smell, but</li>
            <li> but I couldnt score it higher than a 3 because the scent/aroma fades after only about an hour or so...</li>
            <li> She gave us the name and we went directly to the perfume store in our mall where THEY were selling it for almost 45 dollars!</li>
            <li> I first used this perfume in middle school.</li>
            <li> I love wearing not only this scent but a lot of her other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this huge bottle for less than a month</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> its not to strong not to weak its just right for me.</li>
            <li> It is clear and not oily, it doesn&#x27;t mark or stain clothes.</li>
            <li> i would discribe this scent as young, yet mature, floral, yet fruity.</li>
            <li> every man alive can&#x27;t resist this smell</li>
            <li> please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> You can wear this for any occasion or for a daily scent and it won&#x27;t be too much.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a calming, classy scent.</li>
            <li> It has a really sweet,honey, candy smell to it that I just can&#x27;t get enough of</li>
            <li> It has a weird kind of fruity smell, I can&#x27;t really describe.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is sweet, a little fruity &amp; aimed for the young!</li>
            <li> Slightly embarrassed that it is &#x27;Paris Hilton&#x27; but truly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Its a fun scent, when it camr out In 2007 it was different than the other scents out at that time.</li>
            <li> and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously the most addictive smell EVER!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sweet smelling if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> Long last and very sensual aroma..</li>
            <li> apparently paris hilton smells like perfume.</li>
            <li> One could say it stinks but in a good way.</li>
            <li> She has also just bought 2 new Paris Hilton perfumes and needless to say, Paris Hilton sure knows how to make perfume.</li>
            <li> Super delicate and femenine fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has a very distinct aroma--a signature smell I have never experienced in perfumes.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it, is that it does not last long.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but the bottle came uncovered, the spray came broken, the lid is half set, spilled wine.</li>
            <li> I feel it doesn&#x27;t really last too long, but it could be because I wear it so often</li>
            <li> very  responsible and serious staff working in this company</li>
            <li> doesnt stay long.</li>
            <li> I got this pefume a long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume for a long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price at $20.00.</li>
            <li> I had gotten it  years ago and found my empty bottle  and looked it up and found and instantly  bought</li>
            <li> so does my mother the only thing is it&#x27;s not strong enough for me</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the same quality I&#x27;ve bought previously.</li>
            <li> Got a bigger bottle for less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Few scratches on the box, so it looks like little bit old or used one.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> I did some price matching on other sites and could not find it any cheaper.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the perfume smells like a cotton candy.</li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand loves it.  </li>
            <li> it smelled just like all the other celebrity endorsed scents...</li>
            <li> Due to me having allergies I can&#x27;t wear any perfumes.</li>
            <li> I hated the way this stuff smelled, I had recently purchased the Paris Hilton \\&quot;tease\\&quot; and I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> It lasts an average amount of time about 4/6 hours.  </li>
            <li> (Before I bought and tried this on me, I just thought that it might has a smell of typical teengager.)</li>
            <li> I got my little sister this perfume</li>
            <li> Moved to PA and couldnt find this perfume in any of the drug stores or walmart and the mall&#x27;s little side stores</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i wasted my money on this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from here as you can save a few dollars shopping at Walmart, Tjmaxx or Ross 🎀</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Is not so heavy but stays on and on.</li>
            <li> and just incase you are thinking what I usually think when I read these,,</li>
            <li> Never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 1 because the smell is awful, cloying and turns my stomach, smells really cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> so that sucks.</li>
            <li> I previously ordered on another site &amp; they sent fake perfume.</li>
            <li> but I seriously have to use maybe like 10 sprays at a time, and the scent fades almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This perfume does not smell the same and it lasts only 2 minutes after spraying,  I&#x27;m highly disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about buying a Paris Hilton fragance, since now celebs put their names on anything.</li>
            <li> Nothing broken</li>
            <li> So NOT happy.....</li>
            <li> Sadly, every department store I&#x27;ve been to do not have this perfume.</li>
            <li> It has to be fake cause</li>
            <li> were way to expensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this perfume over a year ago and I was unable t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that some sellers sell fake perfume and was weary.  </li>
            <li> I wear this perfume often and it drives my husband crazy.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> Sorry butI hateed the smelle of this perfume :(</li>
            <li> (very cheesy indeed).  </li>
            <li> I have bought Heiress by Paris Hilton from department stores for a couple of years now, and I was so disappointed when I received this....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Excelente Product! I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so fruity. My only problem with it, is that it does not last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this perfume here. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume by Paris Hilton. I previously ordered on another site &amp; they sent fake perfume. The color was off and the smell was strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found it on Amazon. The scent is very soft and sweet. This perfume is everything. I love it.</li>
            <li> Lovely, soft and fresh scent. I am older &amp;#60;50&amp;#62; and hesitated about buying this but glad I didn&#x27;t. Great for spring/summer when you want a subtle fragrance to delight your senses!</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. AT ALL. Any recommendations on a nice smelling perfume that actually LAST? That&#x27;s the main thing I want in a fragrance. I have Estee Lauder Knowing, and it smells nice and last, but it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance nice price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I am not a Paris Hilton fan but I stumbled upon this perfume in a restroom in Vegas. I fell in love instantly. I refuse to wear anything else. By far my favorite perfume EVER.</li>
            <li> TODAS LAS FRAGANCIAS DE PARIS HILTON LAS RECOMIENDO, AUNQUE PARA MI OPINION PERSONAL ESTA FRAGANCIA SERIA PERFECTA PARA USARLA DE DIA.</li>
            <li> i love this parfum... its so delicious....</li>
            <li> i love this scent, my bf didn&#x27;t like the perfumes i was wearing, but then i got this one, he loves it just as much as i do, he just kept smelling me all day. even tho i may not be able to smell it after a while, someone makes a comment on my perfume, so i know its still there, im just used to the smell. my bf liked it so much, he found this scent as a roll-on oil, smells the same, but that is one that even i can smell all day. i would discribe this scent as young, yet mature, floral, yet fruity. like the perfect happy medium!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent. Soft, sweet and flirty. Slightly embarrassed that it is &#x27;Paris Hilton&#x27; but truly worth every penny. I spritz about three sprays daily and it lasts about 9 months. It is clear and not oily, it doesn&#x27;t mark or stain clothes.</li>
            <li> The date code on this product was 2005??? And it is not returnable.  Very clever</li>
            <li> spectacular fragrance. i love it</li>
            <li> great price, i love this perfume</li>
            <li> wife loves this perfume</li>
            <li> daughter favorite sent</li>
            <li> Just as described. I wear it often. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love the fragance, totally happy with it</li>
            <li> every man alive can&#x27;t resist this smell</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I like the scent but it doesn&#x27;t last in which I have to keep applying.</li>
            <li> When I bought this at some local mall, I did not expect much thing from this, cause the price was so cheap.  I bought this cause I heard that it smells like bubble gum. I just really wondered how it going to smell on me if I wear it. I tried it several times and I was quite surpried cause it was smell really good. The smell was not that cheap. It had somehow matured lady&#x27;s smell but still smells quite young and delightful. (Before I bought and tried this on me, I just thought that it might has a smell of typical teengager.) Considering its price, this Eau De Parfum can be a really good choice.</li>
            <li> I really like sweet perfumes that have fruity tones to it. Reading the reviews and every one saying how sweet it is I decided to try it. Honestly this is not sweet at all... Its very flowery. As you first spray it it does give kind of bubble gum smell but than it becomes really strong floral fragrance and not sweet at all... So for those who like sweet fruity perfumes this is not the one. You rather stick with the original Paris Hilton perfume... Which I believe have more of a fruity undertone than this one. I am not a big fan of flowery smells... For those who like flowery smells this one might be the right one for you.</li>
            <li> very good. I came to buy the product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I&#x27;ll wear it until the bottle is gone but I won&#x27;t be ordering it ever again.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and wife loves it.</li>
            <li> and I have the product in my hands. all in perfect condition .thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCENT! FLORAL ELEGANCE IN A BOTTLE!</li>
            <li> I must say, I absolutely LOVE this perfume. It has a very distinct aroma--a signature smell I have never experienced in perfumes. I wear this for formal occasions, and it always impresses.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I go through a bottle of this a year so when I saw this big bottle for the price I just had to get it. I am so glad I did. Will be buying again once this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells but I couldnt score it higher than a 3 because the scent/aroma fades after only about an hour or so... But either than that good purchase if your looking for a girly, flowerly scent.</li>
            <li> este perfume no me entregaron jamas y ya me cobraron...quien me devuelve mi dinero de inmediato asi como me cobraron</li>
            <li> A very pretty and fresh. girly scent that smells like a really good shampoo...herbal essences or something.  I don&#x27;t have much to say about this other than I bought it to wear to work because it is such a fresh and clean scent that smells pretty.  It lasts an average amount of time about 4/6 hours.  I dont think I&#x27;ll repurchase this and I actually prefer Paris hiltons original fragrance over this one.  It makes for a pleasant work fragrance, you will smell very fresh and uplifting so for that reason id recommend to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this smell one of my favorites by paris. Its a fun scent, when it camr out In 2007 it was different than the other scents out at that time.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I purchased this item for my daughter and she loves it!! It&#x27;s the only fragrance she wears now! The package was delivered in about 4 days and came exactly as described. To be honest, I thought this was a cheap knock-off because of the great price but its the real deal. I will definitely be buying from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume has an amazing scent and is very sweet and lasting in the body and clothing</li>
            <li> very good price--delivered on time---second time i have ordered from amazon on this product, been happy both times</li>
            <li> I just got the perfume for my niece.  I have a prime membership and it took a week to be delivered. Secondly, I&#x27;ve been using this perfume and I know exactly how the bottle looks (with a mirror on one side) and smells, but this had a cheap reflective sticker on the bottle try to make it look like a mirror (very cheesy indeed).  The real perfume has very dreamy and sweet fragrance but this has very strong alcohol smell that doesn&#x27;t smell anything like &#x27;Heiress.&#x27;  Please go to Walgreens and get an authentic one.  I&#x27;m trying to return it but it says perfume is under hazardous category that I can&#x27;t even return.  Don&#x27;t buy.  Don&#x27;t even want to give one star but no options.</li>
            <li> I bought Heiress by Paris Hilton Parfum (3.4 oz) and it is great.  The price was better than in a store.  I am very pleased with the product, the shipment and the total experience.</li>
            <li> doesnt stay long. will not buy again</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite by Paris it smells so good and its light and sexy</li>
            <li> i love it and every time I have it on everyone ask me what I have on..i will get it again</li>
            <li> I got this pefume a long time ago and I decided to try it again. I loved it!!! The smell is delicious and it stays on your skill all day! The bottle is super cute with a lot of glitter. If you buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is unbelievable and for the price, you really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> This is my first time smelling this and it smell sooooo good thank you amazon GREAT JOB!!!  Im ordering another one it smell just that good no ?</li>
            <li> Super delicate and femenine fragrance. It came perfectly and the package was impecable. Amazon sold the product and it was delivered on a terrific time.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite scents. The bottle size it worth the price, trust me. The scent if light but very very pretty, I always get complimented.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because I absouletly love it! It came very quickly and it was cheap, such a great buy!</li>
            <li> I never smelled this perfume before i bought it. I read the description that amazon provided of what&#x27;s the certain smells that are in the perfume and i saw some that i liked, so i ordered it. I absolutely love this perfume, it smells awesome!!! I&#x27;m so greatful that amazon provides the description of the items that they are selling. I wear this perfume often and it drives my husband crazy. It smells really, really good!!</li>
            <li> The perfume came without the push button sprayer to spray perfume out of the bottle.  There was just the bottle and the cap.  Very disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> realice la compra de 2 perfumes y llego solo 1 necesito el reintegro de mi plata o el envio del otro perfume</li>
            <li> excelente producto esto va para mis amigo los venezolanos que siempre hay dudas de los paquetes personas serias y todo es como sale compre con seguridad soy muy delicado con mis compras y quede fino ciando vi los paquetes</li>
            <li> Smells just like I remember. Love it. Bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> It smells great I love it I recommend this perfume to any girl you will love it My Husband got it for me and it&#x27;s been my perfume ever since</li>
            <li> Delicious fragrance. I bought it for someone special, and believe me it is a gift that no woman will ever forget. But beware, you may end up falling in love even more than this woman, once you start using it.</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t buy cheap perfume- it&#x27;s gives me migranes. But I loved Paris&#x27;s original scent so I went ahead and ordered this one. And after the first application I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists! It just smells delicious! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Estoy encantada con este perfume, es realmente delicioso. Me lo aplico en las mañanas y perdura todo el día. lo recomiendo 100% y por ello le doy 5 estrellas. Es fabuloso</li>
            <li> i love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted, smells great, right size will definitely buy again when run out.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me when we first started dating 7 yrs ago.  I absolutely love it and he loves it on me as well. It&#x27;s a light and sweet fragrant. I think it will go great with anyones body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I have used this before, so I know I would like it. I&#x27;m writing a review because I ordered, it came really fast and it was in perfect shape just like described.</li>
            <li> i like the smell it just doesn&#x27;t smell like it did when i had before. maybe it just me because i had it years ago but i think i will just stick to buying my perfumes somewhere else but the seller was great it got here on time and everything. now on to the scent it is fruity. if you were to buy a fruity gum like zebra stripes it kind of reminds me of that smell but it does smell very good and  the seller i bought it from was channel one. was neatly packaged and no spill what so ever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. I got this as a gift and received so many compliment when I wore it, some people could not believe it was Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfume. I recently bought a bottle from Amazon and when it arrived my friend could not believe it smelled so good, she went and bought one right away.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 1 because the smell is awful, cloying and turns my stomach, smells really cheap. I can&#x27;t believe i wasted my money on this.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this perfume to anyyone. please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This cologne is delicius. My boyfriend is happy with this perfum, i recommend it a lot, my favorite gift from my honey.</li>
            <li> bigger than my guess, but still good. Few scratches on the box, so it looks like little bit old or used one. Smell is so good.</li>
            <li> Not a Hilton fan but I love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> Before, I got this as a gift from a Paris Hilton Perfume set (along with my other favorite fragrance, CanCan). I love Heiress because it smells sweet and fresh, and its not too strong. I am very prone to headaches when perfume is just strong, but with this, I can spray on however much and I still feel good. Sadly, every department store I&#x27;ve been to do not have this perfume. They only have the newer brands, and CanCan. But Im glad I got in on here! I probably saved a lot more too haha.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I recommend it. Excellent quality, as it says the publication. presentation is very good, the price adjusted.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Been using it for awhile:)</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much!!  It is my favorite and this was a really good price for it!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, the smell is sublime, the right size, right color, and I really love the smell, I love paris hilton perfum</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for my daughter and she loved it. Amazon has the best price + free shipping. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years - ever since it first came out. While I&#x27;m not a Paris Hilton fan, this is by far my absolute favorite perfume ever. I get so many compliments on it and it lasts for a while. You don&#x27;t have to spray a lot either, which is nice. It just has a wonderfully different, floral/airy scent. Hard to describe really, it&#x27;s similar to the original Paris Hilton perfume, but better. I&#x27;d highly recommend it. You&#x27;ll fall in love with it and never want to wear anything else.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, and the price is great. It&#x27;s a little too sweet smelling if you use it daily. But if you wear it every other day it&#x27;s pretty awesome. (ie. Change it up! Or use multiple fragrances at the same time.)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It was given to me as a gift and the scent is just right. Sweet but not that strong. I always feel fresh when I wear this!</li>
            <li> I am complimented every time I wear this! #devine</li>
            <li> My mother loves it. She is happy so I am happy. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sorry butI hateed the smelle of this perfume :(</li>
            <li> The perfume is exactly what I was looking for.  The deliver was like a week later from my order date.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a gift .. I smelled it and loved it .. Sweet delicate very delicious for me!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance around November of 2013 while shopping for perfume for a Christmas gift. This was on a special since I had bought another fragrance and I gave it a go. I smelled it quickly and thought I liked it, so I went with it. When I got home, I fully opened the packaging and got the full experience. It&#x27;s seriously the most addictive smell EVER! Such a potent perfume and it lingers. It doesn&#x27;t wear off immediately. It smells so delicious and I swear, I&#x27;d buy this over and over and over. Which I obviously just did recently since I went through the entire 3.4 ounce bottle in like, a month! I know, I know. Crazy. But, I love it!</li>
            <li> It smells good but I seriously have to use maybe like 10 sprays at a time, and the scent fades almost immediately. I&#x27;ve had this huge bottle for less than a month and it&#x27;s almost gone. Can&#x27;t be a fresh product...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. Got here fast. Smells nice too and the price is reasonable. Compared to other leading brands, this one is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I am so happy I have been able to find it here at an affordable price! It arrived sooner then expected. Nothing broken and it&#x27;s the same quality I&#x27;ve bought previously. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love all of Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes.  I have an entire collection and out of all of them this one is the best for me.</li>
            <li> It has to be fake cause the smell doesn&#x27;t last and the cap always pops off. I&#x27;ve worn this for years and never had to constantly reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;I will never order it again. Should&#x27;ve just went to Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Muy seguro, muy buena compra!!!&lt;br /&gt;Magnifico de muy buena calidad, muy bonito, estoy muy contento con la compra muchas Gracias!&lt;br /&gt;Excelente!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excelente!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter as a christmas gift and she loves the product. Very pleased with it. Also the prompt delivery was great.</li>
            <li> Very happy i love this perfume smells so good!! This is one of my favorite Sents! the product arrived on time. I&#x27;m a happy customer!!</li>
            <li> It smells so wonderful! Almost like cotton candy, or sweet flowers but not too strong like alot of other sweet perfumes!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! HEIRESS BY PARIS HILTON IS GREAT.  THE SCENT LAST ALL DAY WITHOUT REAPPLYING IT.  I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE COMING UP TO TELL ME HOW GOOD IT SMELLS.  MY HUSBAND LOVES IT ALSO!!!  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE HEIRESS BY PARIS HILTON!!!</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as expected. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The best perfume on the market!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent! Shipping,price, and size are all great. I&#x27;ve loved this scent for probably 15years.. So happy to find it again :)</li>
            <li> Ha, so I do not like Paris Hilton much but I love her perfume. This one is one of my favs. I got it for a great price here on Amazon. I did some price matching on other sites and could not find it any cheaper. I never recommend buying perfume that you yourself have not smelled before. You have to spray it on your skin to really know if you are going to like it or not. Then you buy the product or re-up on Amazon to get the best deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this perfume and such a large bottle. If you know you already like it - this is the best deal around.</li>
            <li> Want something that smells delicious? Well This is it..don’t look any further, I can remember this fragrance back in the day and I haven’t seen it in a long time until I was shopping for the older colognes. I put this cologne up there with Obsession, Eternity, Polo, DKNY, Gucci, Eternity, BCBG and Betsy Johnson …I love this stuff…they don’t make them like they use to but this one right here is a classic.</li>
            <li> She loved it. Thank you...</li>
            <li> Quick shipping - smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. I am pleased with the product. I remember wearing this fragrance over four years ago and loving it. I was thrilled to purchase it again, after purchasing and putting on the perfume I can&#x27;t even believe that I had gone four years without wearing it. it smells so feminine and sweet, not not fruity at all. Just the most perfect scent ever.</li>
            <li> It is the best gift you can give a woman, your mother your wife your girlfriend, your daughter, you will be fascinated because it is a very subtle fragrance</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised. Got it on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, a bit cloying for my taste, but not horrible. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I got my little sister this perfume and she could not be more excited! It has an amazing smell and package</li>
            <li> gift for family, i never open it to know. but i&#x27; m sure it  will be good.</li>
            <li> It smells how it suppose. I recommend it 100 %. I love it. It&#x27;s a product 100 % original. Thanks</li>
            <li> for my daughter.  One of her favorite scents.  Paris did something right with this perfume.  It smells great and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the price and like the smell,got it on time for a gift and would buy it again from this seller</li>
            <li> This sweet fragrance is recommended for young women.</li>
            <li> It smells so amazing. You can wear this for any occasion or for a daily scent and it won&#x27;t be too much. I use this quite regularly and oftenly get compliments</li>
            <li> Not an over powering scent.. Great choice for teens.. My 15 year old loves it.</li>
            <li> Just smells plain sexy! Has a sweet and warm scent that last but is not too strong that it&#x27;s overpowering. One of my favorite perfumes that my girlfriend wears.</li>
            <li> My wife and i first smelled this scent on a lady walking in front of us into the mall and my wife (who never likes perfumes) stopped her to ask what she was wearing. She gave us the name and we went directly to the perfume store in our mall where THEY were selling it for almost 45 dollars! It smells amazing and my wife (who is prone to migraines from perfumes) has worn it (along with Siren, and Passport to Paris) almost every day and has yet to have any sort of issues. She has also just bought 2 new Paris Hilton perfumes and needless to say, Paris Hilton sure knows how to make perfume.</li>
            <li> excellent really great</li>
            <li> excellent responsible</li>
            <li> The perfume box looked like it had served in dessert storm. Did not come in wrapping to protect the box.</li>
            <li> I have used this years ago &amp; now I sent it to my best friend too. The fragrance is sweet, a little fruity &amp; aimed for the young! So, I think it&#x27;s an apt gift for ages 12-30 years. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it. It does linger on you for some time. Some of my fall clothes (coats &amp; jackets) smell good with its scent, even days after I&#x27;ve not worn or washed them. So yeah.. Buy it! I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from here as you can save a few dollars shopping at Walmart, Tjmaxx or Ross 🎀</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived in good condition, meets all requirements widely recommended. thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> I hated the way this stuff smelled, I had recently purchased the Paris Hilton \\&quot;tease\\&quot; and I enjoyed it. I then decided to try this one due to friends claiming it was nice. I recommend you try the scent out at a department store or wherever it&#x27;s available before purchasing it. It has a weird kind of fruity smell, I can&#x27;t really describe.</li>
            <li> Thank you. no complaints</li>
            <li> I love it!  My absolute favorite Paris Hilton scent. I definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume for a long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price at $20.00.</li>
            <li> I ARRIVE EVERYTHING IN PERFECT STATE, MY WIFE LIKES PERFUME A LOT, it is SCENT it is VERY RICH, it LIKES ME TO MI WHEN it USES IT BECAUSE SHE FEELS MORE FEMININE 100 RECOMMENDED%.</li>
            <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> I may not be a fan of Paris Hilton but her fragrance has got me hooked. This is one of the most affordable perfumes that smells like you paid three times as much!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected... Loved it</li>
            <li> my mom loves this, it was a good b-day gift</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about buying a Paris Hilton fragance, since now celebs put their names on anything. But my daughter insisted on this perfume, and it&#x27;s really good! It&#x27;s sweet buy not in a bubblegum-candy sort of way. If you are in your 20s-30s and like sweet scents, this one&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Just I love this product</li>
            <li> siempre ha sido mi olor favorito en perfumes para damas. tengo tiempo usandolo, por eso lo compro anual. huele divino</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Great product, was more than I expected. I arrive in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Amazon made this product available at a reasonable price and ofcourse this is my favorite spray. Will buy again when current is finished.  Fast shipping, good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and can&#x27;t go without it. Smells similar to Sweet Pea I think. It is light, sweet, and flirty. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> muy serios con el envío, todo llegó al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad, recomiendo este artículo a todos, muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra</li>
            <li> Recomendado  siempre y para siempre usarlo es lo mejor y mas sencillo que hay para comprar por amanzon y es inmediato.</li>
            <li> My nozzle came out. Whenever I try to spray, it leaks. Waste of money. Other than that, the perfume smells like a cotton candy. Really strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume. The shipping was speedy and contents were well packaged. I like the sweet almost fruity/ citrus smell and find it blends in well with most of my other citrus perfumes. This is one I always keep in my collection and get tons of compliments on it. I feel it doesn&#x27;t really last too long, but it could be because I wear it so often I get used to the smell. If sprayed on clothing the scent stays until you next wash it. I love it, makes me feel fresh!</li>
            <li> Everything shipped in great condition. I&#x27;m not a Paris fan but I smelled this perfume on a lady in a store and asked her what she was wearing. I decided to order it and I love it! Last a long time and smells nice. My husband even likes it and he&#x27;s not a fan of perfume.</li>
            <li> I first used this perfume in middle school. I fell in love with the scent.  I am now in college and I still love this scent. One of the best scents from Paris Hilton. I have many new perfumes and I have thrown away many throughout the years, but this one remains in my collection.</li>
            <li> This is a gift, so I cannot really rate this perfume. But it looks nice and smells good when I received it.</li>
            <li> Este es un excelente producto. Es especificamente lo que solicite. Muy buen servicio. 100% recomendado para otros.&lt;br /&gt;Muy bueno .</li>
            <li> I like the scent, it is great for spring/summer.  My husband on the other hand loves it.  I really like the orginal Paris Hillton perfume a lot more.</li>
            <li> Bubblegum in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Excelente articulo me gusto lo recomiendo para futuras compras muy responsable llego tal y cual como se esperaba y a la fecha indicada.</li>
            <li> very pleased with product quality, delivery time and mode of packaging.</li>
            <li> Eleg&amp;iacute; la clasificaci&amp;oacute;n porque el producto llego en buen estado y la entrega fue entre el tiempo estimado. El perfume fue para un regalo. Saludos</li>
            <li> I love the long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Smelled correct; she loved it and was happy....</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  Is not so heavy but stays on and on.</li>
            <li> Moved to PA and couldnt find this perfume in any of the drug stores or walmart and the mall&#x27;s little side stores were way to expensive. After all that i should have just went straight to amazon. Easy ordering, super quick delivery,perfect size&amp; amount, overall awesome experience--- and just incase you are thinking what I usually think when I read these,, im not an employee or family of an employee,, I&#x27;m a real customer speaking a real experience/ opinion. Good luck and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> for my first original colony bought by Amazon, has good olor.lo recommend</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand the great reviews. This smells like STRONG department store perfume and made me break out. I ended up selling it in a tag sale. To each his own.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best fragrance featuring Paris Hilton, I gave my sister for the first time and then did his personal favorite perfume. It smells very exquisite, is a very sweet fragrance but very original, soft and elegant to be a cheaper perfume is excellent quality! My sister uses it often and wherever it touches people like it and immediately ask him what it is? So girls if they like sweet fruity fragrance trend, this is a good option at a very low price! 100% Guaranteed!</li>
            <li> it was an exelente purchase, i think its the best way to buy a product. really nice perfume!!&lt;br /&gt;greetings from venezuela</li>
            <li> Good the product I come near in good conditions and in awaited time for which I wait to continue with you</li>
            <li> EL PERFUME ES BUENO. LLEGO EN EL TIEMPO ESTIPULADO Y EN BUENAS CONDICIONES. RESPONSABLES Y EFICIENTES. LOS RECOMIENDO. DESDE VENEZUELA.</li>
            <li> 100% original excelente</li>
            <li> This was a gift. The person we gave it to really liked it. One could say it stinks but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Remember the way the box smells when you got a new particularly girly (maybe with sparkle extensions, or 15 outfits included) Barbie ? Smells like that. Sweet, candy, fun. Curmudgeonly people may not like this scent but I think it would be flattering to most people</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good!</li>
            <li> NUNCA ME LLEGO EL PERFUME HEREDERA DE PARIS HILTON PARA LAS MUJERES - 3,4 ONZAS edp  SPRAY SERA QUE ME PUEDEN INFORMAR GRACIAS</li>

            <li> I love wearing not only this scent but a lot of her other fragrances.  Although it&#x27;s cheap in price it last all day and I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Mt daughter receives daily compliments from both men and women. Costing approximately $70 in Costa Rica, it was a great purchase on Amazon. Long last and very sensual aroma.. You will love it too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicious morover comes with all the original package and have nice presentation. If you want to gift something it&#x27;s a good present</li>

            <li> This fragrance will always be one of my favorites. I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments on a perfume as I have with Paris Hilton&#x27;s Heiress. It&#x27;s a calming, classy scent. Never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Scent is very sweet. Sometimes reminds me of bubble gum.</li>
            <li> it came super fast...however the reviews talked this scent up and when i got it....it smelled just like all the other celebrity endorsed scents...nothing spectacular. I felt i had too many that smelled exactly the same. I got it for a good price.</li>

            <li> apparently paris hilton smells like perfume. *i imagined alcohol and what not) but whatevs gf liked it im sure yours might as well</li>
            <li> TODO MUY BIEN PERSONA ATENTA Y AMABLE TIENDA  RECOMENDADA PRODUCTOS ORIGINALES TIEMPO DE ENTREGA SATISFACTORIO UN PLACER NEGOCIAR CON USTEDES</li>
            <li> I read reviews that some sellers sell fake perfume and was weary.  Hence I chose seller &#x27;Amazon.com&#x27; to safeguard since I am an overseas buyer. Am happy to say the perfume was genuine.  My current bottle will finish soon, so buying my 2nd bottle. I find this scent very unique and have not come across similar fragrance. Thanks Paris Hilton!</li>
            <li> Its just smells lovely. I use to wear this all the time in High School but could never find it in stores after awhile. Found it here on amazon and had to have it. Its has a light fruity, powdery scent that&#x27;s sweet but doesn&#x27;t smell like the essence of sugar. Overall I love this perfume. Just buy it already!!!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance years ago. I have been looking for another bottle in the stores I am so glad that I came to amazon and got such a great price for one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but the bottle came uncovered, the spray came broken, the lid is half set, spilled wine.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume in the whole wide world. It has a pear fruity smell but it&#x27;s amazing. Everyone says this perfume reminds them of me because it is my signature smell. Definitely recommend it i&#x27;m due to buy some more. :)</li>
            <li> el perfume, es muy delicioso como todos los de paris hilton, llegaron a tiempo, y se los obsequie a unas primas</li>
            <li> I have bought Heiress by Paris Hilton from department stores for a couple of years now, and I was so disappointed when I received this....I don&#x27;t know what to call it!!!! This is not what the REAL perfume smells like! All I could smell was Alcohol with a hint of fragrance. So NOT happy..... Not even good enough to spray in the bathroom!!!</li>
            <li> Didnt come with a cap... so that sucks. But it smells great and came in good time!</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opinión les sea útil.</li>
