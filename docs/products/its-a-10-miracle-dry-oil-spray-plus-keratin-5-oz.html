            <li> It leaves your hair feeling wet when you spray it directly on your hair and it feels like you have to wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> You must remember to use it before you flat iron or hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on each section before I use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> so when I use it I feel I need to spray it in my hands first and then apply to my hair slowly.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair!</li>
            <li> This spray perks up your curls in dry hair and puts a shinny finish to your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 product line with Keratin, however I found this spray to dry my hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> I spritz dry shampoo on my roots, and before I found this product, I would try putting an oily serum on my ends.  </li>
            <li> I am growing my hair out, and only wash my hair every few days</li>
            <li> I have used it only twice, so it is hard to tell the long-term effect on my hair</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it adds any moisture (oil) to the hair.</li>
            <li> well at least it does mine.  </li>

            <li> It is  not a bad product.  You can smell the alcohol in this so when I use it I feel I need to spray it in my hands first and then apply to my hair slowly.  It leaves your hair feeling wet when you spray it directly on your hair and it feels like you have to wait for it to dry.  Once it dries it seems okay.  It is not greasy but I am not sure if it adds any moisture (oil) to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair so this is the best oil free sheen product that does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent  for dematting</li>
            <li> Quick ship. Dry oil is new for me, I think I like it better</li>
            <li> This spray perks up your curls in dry hair and puts a shinny finish to your hair.  Love the look.</li>
            <li> It works well and provides even coverage without getting too greasy. They also do not use animal testing, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  You must remember to use it before you flat iron or hair spray.  If you put it on after you will have a hot mess.</li>
            <li> Hair feel smooth and smells good. I have used it only twice, so it is hard to tell the long-term effect on my hair</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful for taming flyaway hair even my daughter loves it, I have to hide it from her. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the It&#x27;s a 10 product line with Keratin, however I found this spray to dry my hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! I am a hero.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product, and was even more pleased to see that it now has keratin included.  Makes hair shiney and manageable&lt;br /&gt;, well at least it does mine.  Even my beautician uses this</li>
            <li> I love this product makes my hair really shiney</li>
            <li> Love It&#x27;s a 10 products. They make your hair feel great</li>
            <li> This is the best keratin light spray.  I use it on both my hair and my daughters.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li> great for my soft curly fine strain hair…not heavy…pricy for the amount, but does a great job.  If find for a lower the $20 price point will buy 3 to 4.  smells good</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my hair shiny</li>
            <li> This is GREAT! better than anything I&#x27;ve tried for heat protection.  I put it on damp hair before using the flat iron and it turns your hair shiny and smooth and not oily and lifeless like some other products out there. I totally recommend this! Great product line :)))</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me the last time I was in and I really liked the way it made my hair feel. I am very happy with this product. My hair is somewhat fine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all (I use it sparingly). At first, I sprayed it on after I dried and curled my hair but before hairspray, just to add shin to my color &amp; highlighted hair (that&#x27;s the way my hairdresser used it on me). For the first time yesterday, I sprayed it on my wet hair and that worked great! It made drying and curling so much easier, I really loved the results. It brought out the color and the shine much better and made my hair easier to work with. I am going to use it that way from now on.  One more thing.....my co-worker tried it, she has long hair that is coarse with color and highlights, it worked fantastic on her hair! We tried it on her dry hair and instantly made it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair, and I loved it so much that I decided to order some for myself!  Amazon is the cheapest I could find it, too!  I am growing my hair out, and only wash my hair every few days, so I&#x27;m constantly having an oily scalp, but really dry/frizzy ends.  (I live in FL so all the humidity here doesn&#x27;t help, either.)  I spritz dry shampoo on my roots, and before I found this product, I would try putting an oily serum on my ends.  It would weigh my hair down so much and then ended up making my hair look kind of stringy.  This Miracle Dry Oil Spray on the other hand, is AMAZING!  I spray it on sections of my hair before I straighten it, and then spritz it all over my hair (especially focusing on the ends).  My hair looks awesome and not frizzy.  I also noticed that throughout the day, it did not get tangled as much!  I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it makes my hair so soft, smooth, tangle-free, and shiny!  It really is great stuff.  If you&#x27;re having issues with dry, tangled hair, I really suggest you try this!  It adds a beautiful finished to styled hair.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it sparingly and it isn&#x27;t greasy. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this because supposedly it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, well it did. Maybe I just have that kind of hair, IDK. Even though it made my hair greasy I actually like it, smells good, calms the frizz, and gives shine.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! I spray it on each section before I use the flat iron. Makes my hair so soft and shiny without being oily. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love just every thing from it&#x27;s a 10!!! This company on amazon there price&#x27;s are good but there slow about 3 weeks to get stuff so if your willing to wait its a great price and good product!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair product, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Only use a small amount and it adds great shine.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and I final bought some for myself. It works great with the flat iron!</li>
            <li> Great product at a GREAT price! Very happy with this purchase and seller. Shipping fast and product arrived as described. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> When I got my hair cut and styled the stylist used this on my hair! I loved it so much I had to by myself some for when I flat iron my hair! Great product and the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily!</li>
            <li> Good, but shine fades away on my blonde hair. I also have to use a boatload. The silicone sprays are cheaper, but make blondes look more shiny.</li>
