            <li>a makeup and brush snob, so I wanted to make sure she got something great but inexpensive for her first set, and these fit the bill</li>
            <li>Great quality, durability, functionality...SUPER SOFT</li>
            <li>I love my eco friendly bamboo brush set</li>
            <li>You will never get as many great quality, usable, brushes as you get in this set for even 5 times the price you pay for this entire set.</li>
            <li>These are super soft, great quality and plenty of brushes for all makeup needs.</li>
            <li>they are prefect for anyone and easy to clean</li>
            <li>I like the light color bristles</li>
            <li>I honestly love these brushes highly recommend you will fall in love</li>
            <li>worth every cent!</li>
            <li>It just arrived this morning and so far I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the pretty leather case that came with it.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes are indeed very soft and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a gift for my best-friend of 8 years, who has never had a full set of makeup brushes, good/bad/indifferent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are super soft and pick up color amazingly.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>( but the brushes are nice and firm where you need it, nice densely packed liner and shading/contour/stippling brushes)  </li>
            <li>I have other sets, and this one is by far the best one I have.</li>
            <li>very nice quality, only downfall is the colors don&#x27;t come out completely when washed.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this set and then adding on individual must have brushes from your favorite brand(s) for anything you feel you need or is lacking.</li>
            <li>they are super soft</li>
            <li>However its not too much of a problem.</li>
            <li>When theses came in the mail i was so excited to finally have brushes after my dog decided to chew my others</li>
            <li>I would have to say these are my new favorites.</li>
            <li>(but i also have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just personal preference, but you will spend a helluva lot buying as many single, quality,  brushes  as you wind up really liking and using in this set overall.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anybody that needs to update their brushes, first time buyers or someone needing any extra brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Elite Brush Set for a week &amp; these are so soft!</li>
            <li>and I have all types of brushes from high end to low end (M.A.C, Sigma, Sephora, real technique, E.L.F, etc.)</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t till I went to see my eye doctor and was told to go through out my old brushes.</li>
            <li>everybody like this brushes and i like them too but not one brush is natural all of them are synthetic</li>
            <li>So far the synthetic bristles haven&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and I have had very little fall out.</li>
            <li>: Very little shedding if you wash with a mild shampoo like baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>it holds the brushes very well &amp; also comes with a zipper inside to store your brush guards or other things.</li>
            <li>I finally was able to narrow it down to 2 sets to choose from.</li>

            <li> I finally was able to narrow it down to 2 sets to choose from.</li>
            <li> This review started off as a one star which represented the absolute disappointment I felt when I opened my package excitedly to find a soap...</li>
            <li> The face brushes on the other hand are way to soft, they dont pick up products like they should.</li>
            <li> although I love a big soft fluffy face brush, I find these a bit difficult to control for things like contour and blush placement</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is I would have bought the black set not the white set.</li>
            <li> I been needing new brushes for a while but just been to lazy to get them.</li>
            <li> Keep the metal and handles dry at all costs so as not to loosen the handles.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the face brushes are so big,</li>
            <li> My only thought was shit</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no shedding or durability issues</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how that is possible since the soap is a fraction of the size of a brush set</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they were almost too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> but i do think they could be just a little bit softer.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> So I hoped on YouTube and watched a few reviews that that compared the brushes.</li>
            <li> i use them everyday.</li>
            <li> a firm believer in &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble cleaning them or any shedding.</li>
            <li> Synthetic bristles are the way to go in my opinion since it doesn&#x27;t waste makeup like goat hair and so on...</li>
            <li> and theres a brush for every subject of make up!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> In so glad I bought these</li>
            <li> I love the eye brushes, their really good. The face brushes on the other hand are way to soft, they dont pick up products like they should. the eye brushes are good though, i love them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and I have had very little fall out. They aren&#x27;t my style but the case is amazing and keeps everything nicely in place. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet so I&#x27;ll have to review after doing that...</li>
            <li> For the price and brushes I couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better set! I definitely recommend buying these just as my makeup artist friend recommended them to me since I was on a budget!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes since I have not purchased any in years. They arrived quickly. I was quite impressed with the variety of sizes. I do not think that they missed any sizes at all. I have enjoyed using them and they work wonderful with applying my makeup. I would recommend these to anybody that needs to update their brushes, first time buyers or someone needing any extra brushes.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a make up artist I needed lots of brushes. This set is awesome, I love them, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a professional make up artist.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just a girl who wants to get real good make up done, they&#x27;re just fine. I use them just for me, not with my clients.</li>
            <li> worth every cent! they dont shed or fall apart and theres a brush for every subject of make up! there great</li>
            <li> I been needing new brushes for a while but just been to lazy to get them. It wasn&#x27;t till I went to see my eye doctor and was told to go through out my old brushes. My only thought was shit I have to start from scratch and that&#x27;s not cheap. So I decided to to get on Amazon and take a look at what they had for brush sets. I looked at so many of them and read reviews. I finally was able to narrow it down to 2 sets to choose from. But the all the reviews on Amazon weren&#x27;t the biggest help. So I hoped on YouTube and watched a few reviews that that compared the brushes. Of course I want to get the most out of my money.In the end I choose the Coastal Scents Elite brush set over the Coastal Scents 22 brush set. It just arrived this morning and so far I am very pleased with my purchase. The brushes are indeed very soft and the quality is amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> When theses came in the mail i was so excited to finally have brushes after my dog decided to chew my others up.&lt;br /&gt;If you order these, make sure you wash them before you use them on your face, i didn&#x27;t and my face broke out in a rash, (but i also have very sensitive skin) the brushes are good quality but i do think they could be just a little bit softer.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> these brushes are ok. i use them everyday. theres no fall out they are good quality would recommend i have had them for about a year now</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the brushes</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. Great quality, durability, functionality...SUPER SOFT ( but the brushes are nice and firm where you need it, nice densely packed liner and shading/contour/stippling brushes)  I would recommend getting this set and then adding on individual must have brushes from your favorite brand(s) for anything you feel you need or is lacking. You will never get as many great quality, usable, brushes as you get in this set for even 5 times the price you pay for this entire set. Everyone will probably find a couple of brushes they don&#x27;t use, but it will vary by the individual...it&#x27;s just personal preference, but you will spend a helluva lot buying as many single, quality,  brushes  as you wind up really liking and using in this set overall. I have had absolutely no shedding or durability issues and I use/wash them regularly. My only complaint is that the face brushes are so big, although I love a big soft fluffy face brush, I find these a bit difficult to control for things like contour and blush placement</li>
            <li> One of the brush was bent on arrival.</li>
            <li> They are great! I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> loving my elite brush set&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the texture feels great.&lt;br /&gt;nice brush set at reasonable/affordable value</li>
            <li> very nice quality, only downfall is the colors don&#x27;t come out completely when washed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft, I didn&#x27;t get many fly aways, and they are great quality... These are better than most sets...</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my best-friend of 8 years, who has never had a full set of makeup brushes, good/bad/indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup and brush snob, so I wanted to make sure she got something great but inexpensive for her first set, and these fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the brushes on her with some of my makeup, as well as with hers, having tried several looks to test all of the brushes with different types of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they were almost too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the makeup (i.e. shadow, blush, and powder) didn&#x27;t hold onto the brushes as well as they do to my sigma and MAC brushes, but that&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The liquids and cream makeup (i.e. foundation, concealer, eyeliner) took to the brushes AMAZINGLY and blended out flawlessly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a firm believer in &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Very little shedding if you wash with a mild shampoo like baby shampoo. Keep the metal and handles dry at all costs so as not to loosen the handles.</li>

            <li> I love these brushes. I love the pretty leather case that came with it. They are very soft. I sometimes do have a problem with it not picking up enough powder. However its not too much of a problem. No stray hairs fall out yet and doesn&#x27;t look like it will.</li>
            <li> These are super soft, great quality and plenty of brushes for all makeup needs. I have other sets, and this one is by far the best one I have. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Elite Brush Set for a week &amp; these are so soft! The case is not flimsy it holds the brushes very well &amp; also comes with a zipper inside to store your brush guards or other things. So far the synthetic bristles haven&#x27;t shed I&#x27;m very impressed. Synthetic bristles are the way to go in my opinion since it doesn&#x27;t waste makeup like goat hair and so on... I like the light color bristles so when I wash them I know it&#x27;s squeaky clean. This set covers everything for your face &amp; you can&#x27;t bet the value. And I would definitely recommend this set to a makeup artist &amp; beginners as well. I love my eco friendly bamboo brush set it is truly amazing!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter says it is much wonderful</li>
            <li> This review started off as a one star which represented the absolute disappointment I felt when I opened my package excitedly to find a soap... Yes a soap instead of the brush set I ordered. The soap was labelled a brush set but I am not sure how that is possible since the soap is a fraction of the size of a brush set but I digress. I immediately contracted Amazon customer service who responded within 30 minutes to apologies for the error and agree to refund me my purchase. They also suggested that I reorder the item which I did and received. I love my brushes they are super soft the variety is just what I wanted. Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
