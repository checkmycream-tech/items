            <li>I decided to purchase this mirror for my dad for Christmas because it had the best reviews for the price.  </li>
            <li>So, I just decided it might be best to just leave the mirror in there and have the guy hold it while shaving which is an inconvenience in itself.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great product!</li>

            <li>This mounts with suction cups and is perfect.  </li>

            <li>MINE STUCK PERFECT</li>
            <li>For what it is, a shaving mirror, it works great!</li>

            <li>He&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy !</li>
            <li>Bottom line is when my hubby is happy I&#x27;m happy!!!</li>
            <li>It has worked brilliantly for me.</li>
            <li>It looks very trendy, the design is great!</li>
            <li>And it does that beautifully.  </li>
            <li>while the mirror itself is of an excellent grade and the idea is exceptional</li>
            <li>This is mirror does a great job of remaining fogless in the shower.</li>
            <li>A great purchase.</li>
            <li>my  husband cussing (lol)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great product as advertised.</li>
            <li>The quality of the mirror itself is great.     </li>
            <li>but it sticks GREAT on my glass door.</li>
            <li>It does not fog up, is attractive</li>
            <li>Its a great mirror that never fogs up.</li>
            <li>But break off the razor holder and you still have a great mirror for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great idea ...</li>
            <li>The mirrir itself and the water chamber are great.</li>
            <li>This mirror Still fogs  up in the shower and the suction cups do not work great.</li>
            <li>The fogless feature works great</li>
            <li>This mirror has been great.</li>
            <li>The razor hook also works great with my Mach 3 Turbo razor.</li>
            <li>This is a great design, there is no fogless film, it uses water temp.  </li>
            <li>Great product and design.</li>
            <li>and it is a great value.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>great travel accessory.</li>
            <li>Really a great product</li>
            <li>mirror works great for shaving in shower to prevent fogging.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a fraction of the cost of others.</li>
            <li>That works just great.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups work great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>it worked great</li>
            <li>(My wife cannot use my shower holder to hold her razor)which is a huge plus for me!!!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>If this had better suction cups, this would be the best shower mirror out there, but until they improve this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless you plan to glue it to your wall.</li>
            <li>For all that, it&#x27;s held up remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>ON A NOT SO FRIENDLY SHOWER WALL!!!  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly well and is easy to use.    </li>
            <li>The razor holder works fine for him, it holds it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have a basket on the shower head arm where it fits perfectly and works as intended.  </li>
            <li>I knew I needed a good shower mirror and tried a couple of Zadro products.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a good shower mirror.</li>
            <li>Cons -  Suction cups - suck...and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>fair image, until the mirror surface deteriorates to a cloudy surface over time.    </li>
            <li>this mirror and get rid of fog for good.</li>
            <li>The mirror is good.</li>
            <li>Would have been 4 stars if the suction cups good hold the mirror</li>
            <li>Good product, though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually good with suction cups.</li>
            <li>I have a clock and a over the shower rack that would take a good amount of force to pry off.  </li>
            <li>and so they can&#x27;t make a good seal against a known non-porous surface like a mirror or tile.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>The water drips out on its own which is great</li>
            <li>It will give you a good 5 mins of fog-free time for shaving (plenty of time for me).  </li>
            <li>if you like to shave in the shower and don&#x27;t need lights, radios or special holders for shave cream or brush, this is an excellent choice...</li>
            <li>Good job on this product, we are very very pleased.</li>
            <li>The fog-free feature, however, works perfectly, and as this is the main reason I chose this mirror, I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>but it needs a better mechanism for staying put!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that my exuberance lasts for but the moment, I&#x27;m stoked and pleased to recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ace, time to invest in better suction cups!</li>
            <li>This does what it says, great suction hold, easy to fill, drains itself and the mirror stays fog-free.  </li>
            <li>and it works great, but you do have to permanently attach it, which is fine with me since I plan to always shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great product and would recommend this to others looking for a fog free mirror.</li>
            <li>Great job on fog free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it may sound like this wasn&#x27;t a great experience...</li>
            <li>The razor holder is a nice add on as well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all mount to fill it with warm water before each use)  </li>
            <li>It impressed me so much that I reviewed it on my own site.</li>
            <li>However the mirror does what it says and is fogless which is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the principle, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The built-in drain is a nice feature as the water slowy drains on its own, so you don&#x27;t have to do it after each use and no mildew builds.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came with some kind of shower wall hook in addition to the suction cups.  </li>
            <li>The walls in my shower have a kind of matte finish and they do not stick to it at all.  </li>
            <li>I do that as soon as I get in the shower and have warm water coming out of the shower head.</li>
            <li>Effective solution to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>I used to have the \\&quot;Sharper Image\\&quot;-type shower mirror---the kind that hooks inline with the shower nozzle plumbing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea, a fogless mirror that you can stick to the wall - they&#x27;re much better than the ones that attach to your showerhead.</li>
            <li>When I got mine I liked it a lot, but then some problems began to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice holder for the razor.    </li>
            <li>So I got the kind that was advertised as fog-free, and required no shower attachment.  </li>
            <li>The razor holder is flexible and my Gillette Fusion fits in it nicely.    </li>
            <li>For the price that you pay, this might be the best available - anything better, may cost multiples more...</li>
            <li>I liked the style and the suction cup on the Oxo model</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>The Ace mirror just attaches to a glass surface with suction cups, and you fill it with warm water when you need it to be fogless.</li>
            <li>They have held nicely for about a week now.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;one of my theories is that the cleaning lady cleaned it with some kind of chemical that ruined it&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does the job brilliantly and really works!</li>
            <li>The suction cups do not do a great job of sticking and the mirror keeps falling - luckily it is shatterproof.  </li>
            <li>I take the mirror off the mount (very easy to do)</li>
            <li>Its very easy to fill the \\&quot;basin\\&quot; with shower water</li>
            <li>He can use this very easily and it adjusts to his tall height (6&#x27;4).</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Best mirrow I&#x27;ve used as far as preventing the glass from fogging up.</li>
            <li>Out of all of the fogless mirrors I have purchesed for my husband, this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>but by far this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>than that it&#x27;s brilliant: I love it, I kept trying to fog it by blowing hot air at it, just does not get foged.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Hopefully someday someone will invent a mirror that works effectively on its own and stays fog free without having to fill a reservoir.  </li>
            <li>Those worked great at first but in a couple of months would need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>The concept is smart, the product is sturdy, and the results are great.</li>
            <li>I have had the one that attaches to your shower and uses water this one is way better.</li>
            <li>and/or more of a rubberized finish.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups did not hold it to the shower wall, so there&#x27;s nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I think four would be better.  </li>
            <li>Mounted it to the shower wall and filled it with warm shower water and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>was expecting more from the reviews, but can say it is just ok.</li>
            <li>I see now that the product is fulfilled by amazon, probably because more and more people are ordering it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding ACE product.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I filled the mirror with the warm shower water per the instructions and guess what....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall and it develops spots that i havent been able to remove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Zadro anti-fog shower mirrors, and they worked okay;</li>
            <li>The suction cups are more than ample to hold this thing up</li>
            <li>Lovely...</li>
            <li>Suction cups seem to work better that way.</li>
            <li>This is more just a cosmetic issue I have with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so we made sure that neither suctions cups were over the grout line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using mine for many months now.</li>
            <li>What more can one ask for.</li>
            <li>would purchase it again, but I would like it to have better quality suction cups.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any \\&quot;fog free\\&quot;</li>
            <li>OK Shower Shave Mirror.</li>
            <li>As far as being fog free, this mirror is excellent.</li>
            <li>Very simple and the self draining hole is awesome.</li>
            <li>Ok so if you want this mirror to shave in the shower, look somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>Ok - so I get in the shower, shampoo up an bit, then turn to shave.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sold on the technology (or, perhaps better stated, the simplicity of the technology).  </li>
            <li>Instead of a coating on the mirror that seems to wear off or get covered with soap or minerals, this mirror works by raising the temperature of the mirror through shower water you put into the top of it.</li>
            <li>This has been an excellent purchase for me, I now only use this for shaving.  </li>
            <li>These do not stick to any surface in our shower for more than 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Having gone through so many mirrors, this one I feel is the closest to fogless yet.  </li>
            <li>The design is ingenious.  </li>
            <li>Nothing I know of works better.</li>
            <li>I have a removable shower head, so I just spray water in the top of the mirror and in about 5 seconds any fog on the mirror disappears.  </li>
            <li>My husband (for shaving his face) and daughter (for shaving her armpits) both love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly switching out my mirror for the latest and greatest \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; shaving mirror.  </li>
            <li>I figured the more</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Simple and functional, and a great price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to recommend a product I&#x27;ve found that works better here</li>
            <li>Having to fill this and wipe this adds a lot of fiddling around that it seems like could be eliminated by a better product or better design.</li>
            <li>I waited a month before writing this review to make sure it worked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve beens shaving in shower for decades, and have tried many approaches/devices etc.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>as others have noted, the suction cups could be a bit more robust.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>If they put better suction cups on</li>
            <li>Okay but does fall off at times.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li>The suction cups are great, a very underrated feature with a shower product.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for more than a month now, and it works just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>If you need more time you can always refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this about 2 years ago and the product was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>It needs to be appropriately cared for and it will continue to work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried many, and let me tell you.  </li>
            <li>The suction has fallen off a couple times but overall I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>the mirrors that I had purchased before these would typically last a month or two before the anti-fogging material would wear off, making shaving a \\&quot;best guess\\&quot; scenario...  </li>
            <li>All in all, a decent price for a great mirror.</li>
            <li>If you just really love yourself and want to be able to see how awesome you look with a wet face and shampoo in your eye, buy this mirror.  </li>
            <li>This one is definitely superior to the first.  </li>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time, in fact, I&#x27;m going to order another one now just as a backup!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you ACE for a great product, (But please keep in mind to change those suction cups when making a new product).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t huge; I can&#x27;t see my whole face in the mirror at once, but it is a great size for</li>
            <li>It actually remains fog free and does its job perfectly.  </li>
            <li>- The Single razor is perfect for me</li>
            <li>My advice is to clean your tiles!  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s enjoyed being able to shave in the shower and meet my standards of a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have been amazingly happy.  </li>
            <li>The mirror stays clear, the no fog feature works great.  </li>
            <li>I decided a wall-mounted mirror looked like a more flexible option, and I liked the idea of the built-in hot water reservoir on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as fog, its great, doesnt fog, even after all the water dripped out.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work if we had smooth tiles though.</li>
            <li>Wow, great idea.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shower mirror I have ever owned, and for $12 I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  </li>
            <li>The mirror has a huge opening at the top which makes it really easy to fill it up with water.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is easily removable to fill with water, works well.  </li>
            <li>It fills up with water easily before shaving.</li>
            <li>The mirror with the water chamber can be easily detached.</li>
            <li>(it falls once in a while), but it is relatively easy to move as well.</li>
            <li>Water beads on the surface really easily.</li>
            <li>Filling the reservoir is easy (either with a cup or by lifting the mirror out of its v-shaped holder slot).</li>
            <li>The drain hole works well, but it is just as easy to lift the mirror and dump any remaining water at the end of the shower.</li>
            <li>thankfully Amazon provided an easy return</li>
            <li>Not so easy to clip and unclip the razor with one hand.</li>
            <li>An easy step, not a deal breaker.      </li>
            <li>My Gilette Track II razor fits easily in the holder.</li>
            <li>It easily comes off the bracket for filling and with the built in 20 minute</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this mirror to anyone who enjoys shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>After 2+ years of use it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>the suction cups arent that strong, so i could not leave it at its spot in the shower,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be certain you have a smooth surface and good light to shave.  </li>
            <li>(you can probably figure you better than i can by clicking on me) -- it is now a full 4 stars</li>
            <li>Honestly, there&#x27;s just not much to go wrong.</li>
            <li>use the hot water from the shower to keep the mirror warm and stop it from fogging up in the shower.    </li>
            <li>My first fog-free mirror was the kind that attached to the shower head.  </li>
            <li>I guess you have to make sure the wall is clean and smooth before you put the suction cups in.</li>
            <li>My razor fits fine in the holder.</li>
            <li>The plastic holder for a razor is somewhat flexible and should hold any razor (held my Personna M5 Magnum just fine).    </li>
            <li>Suction to the wall works fine.  </li>
            <li>I stick it to a glass, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>This things sticks perfectly fine to the tile in my shower.  </li>
            <li>The mirror does have a slight distortion from a distance, but for the close work of shaving, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>(my partner doesn&#x27;t complain and he shaves just fine in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this being great since you could remove the mirror and fill it with hot water so the steam didn&#x27;t collect.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups stick to my tile just fine.  </li>
            <li>If your shower has super-smooth tile, then you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, but you have to wait a couple of minutes for the condensation to dissipate.</li>
            <li>My Gillette razor fits just fine in the holder - you turn it sideways to pull or push the thinnest part of the razor</li>
            <li>The suction cups seem to work just fine as well.  </li>
            <li>Looks fine, attached well to the shower wall and works.</li>
            <li>That process was fine except that I had to keep purchasing the bottles of solution.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is simply made and easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li>The suction cups are plenty strong enough for holding the light-weight mirror and the water reservoir was a GREAT idea for keeping the mirror fog free.   </li>
            <li>It is still working great and no problems except what I mentioned above about securing to the wall.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is great, stays fog-free when water is in the back.</li>
            <li>The mirror&#x27;s concept is fantastic, in fact, I wish I&#x27;d thought of it myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all, and none fit.</li>
            <li>Great idea guys, but back to the drawing board.    </li>
            <li>Stays fog free for the length of my showers (10 mins or so).  </li>
            <li>But mine is standard tile, works great.</li>
            <li>I am a scuba diver and have experience with fog free sprays, coatings, and the like for lenses under water.</li>
            <li>It makes mornings stress free, as you just rinse the face away in the shower.    </li>
            <li>but eventually the surfaces would become corroded and would not remain fog free.    </li>
            <li>This product, however, is fantastic.</li>
            <li>You must have smooth face tile, plastic walls or glass.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t know there is a problem unless it&#x27;s filled with water.    </li>
            <li>always wanted to try the Sharper Image fog free mirror which was attached to the showerhead and kept the mirror fog free by temperature control, but I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $29.95 for it.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bead up with water that much either which is nice.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great product and well excecuted.  </li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase and well worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>Seems rather cheap in design</li>
            <li>It would be great for a smaller stall shower.</li>
            <li>So, I read all the reviews on here, having just lost my &#x27;fog free&#x27; mirror to the fades of time.</li>
            <li>After filling it up with water the reservoir keeps the mirror fog free.  </li>
            <li>I have, in fact, relocated it twice, and found it securely attached when I attempted to relocate it.</li>
            <li>It remains fog free throughout a shower and shave.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t fit my Gillette Mach 3</li>
            <li>I saw some stuff at different vendors for cheaper but this is a larger mirror and has a tilt capability so you can see under your chin and jaw bones better to make sure you got that perfect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll freely admit up front -</li>
            <li>This mirror stayed fog free /past/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The filling the mirror with water idea keeps the mirror fog free.  </li>
            <li>This product has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It has remained steadfastly stuck to the smooth fiberglass wall in my shower since I placed it there over two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not conclusive whether mine has good suction or not, but it is quite easy to push on it every now and again--and it apparently works fine doing that.  </li>
            <li>When I attached it to the shower wall the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick and my razor wouldn&#x27;t fit in the attached holder.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all of the so-called fogless mirrors available so that I can shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Once mirror cavity is filled with water it is indeed fog free.</li>
            <li>It is great to see when simple science can can come together with a well thought out design to meet your needs.</li>
            <li>The important part is the fogless mirror.  </li>
            <li>a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide and the handle doesn&#x27;t fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>However, he loved that it stayed clear even in the shower.</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect, it is a little small, but can still see easily and the water resevoir to keep it from fogging is perfect.</li>
            <li>It works great... except that I had to cut out the original suction cups and force some larger ones in.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it falling unless it is not applied to a smooth, clean surface, or that it is accidentally struck by the shower occupant.  </li>
            <li>After you mount it to your shower wall (clean smooth walls</li>
            <li>The resivor on the back for water keeps the mirror nice and clean, the suction cup is very strong.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to install and suction cup holds to wall really well.</li>
            <li>but the great thing about this one is you can slide it out quickly, rinse, slide back in...</li>
            <li>Really excellent, a bit small</li>
            <li>I originally saw at the \\&quot;Grooming</li>
            <li>The reviews on this product were generally quite good, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>: ok i am bumping this up to 4 stars now -- it&#x27;s lasted and stayed in the shower since i first wrote this review, some time ago - 6 or 7 months?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed one bit.      </li>
            <li>Fix these two small issues and it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Suction cups kind of wear out and falls off the wall sometimes due to the weight of the mirror when filled with water (to avoid fogging, you need to fill the mirror with warm water).  </li>
            <li>So eventually I will have to clean the mirror with a bathroom solvent.  </li>
            <li>, never feel like I can get my face clean from the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for my husband as I thought it might be easier for him to shave while he showers, not to mention the benefit of not having to clean after him every time he shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing if your shower tiles aren&#x27;t clean then the suction cups won&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good cheap solution.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t clean your mounting surface suction hold is limiting and your unit can fall.  </li>
            <li>Clean the suction cups</li>
            <li>Trying to clean the glass</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never shaved in the shower before purchasing this mirror, and now I&#x27;ll never do it at the sink again--no more irritation or razor burn, no mess, and it saves precious morning minutes.</li>
            <li>New one came, and it&#x27;s just as good as the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried poking a needle into the drip hole with very mild success, I think I may try CLR next as we have fairly \\&quot;hard\\&quot; water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have special tile, just tile.  </li>
            <li>Great suction cups keep it on the tile without slipping.  </li>
            <li>Although it functions in the way that I need it to, its pretty cheaply made and the reflection isn&#x27;t terribly precise.  </li>
            <li>Over all a good product though, the only mirror I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
            <li>the mirror (with full reservoir)</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good shower mirror, look no further.</li>
            <li>Plus, it looks cool and</li>
            <li>It goes a full shower without fogging up.</li>
            <li>again, this is a good product overall.</li>
            <li>I went from having to shave in front of the sink to being able to shave in the shower (and being that I shave my head, too, that&#x27;s really convenient).  </li>
            <li>If you hold this \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; up to a true mirror, you will see the difference.  </li>
            <li>- The design is really cool</li>
            <li>and you get a true fogless mirror.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much more about it, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pleased with the mirror and really dislike shaving without it.</li>
            <li>I have had this for over a year - much longer than any of my previous mirrors - and it still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>have extremely hot water in a easily steamed-up bathroom and this thing does not fog a bit.  </li>
            <li>The fog-free function works fine and the wall suction does not fail on my gloss-finish tile.  </li>
            <li>, I did a lot more research and came across this simple and awesome fogless shaving mirror for half</li>
            <li>so make sure you have decent lighting in your shower area.  </li>
            <li>The mounting system is adequate, it has not fallen once in the 2 week period that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best $15 I have ever spent on amazon.</li>
            <li>Luckily that wasn&#x27;t a problem for us.</li>
            <li>In short if you are the maker of this product and would like to make it better get a spring loaded suction cup for the top and include a cleanout button for the bottom of the reservoir.</li>
            <li>My shower has a smooth fiberglass surround, which should be perfect for a suction cup to adhere to, but it kept falling, be it when it was full of water and being used, or empty and in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>and i havent found the right product to clean it</li>
            <li>You use the HOT shower water, to fill the mirror, equalizing the temperatures, keeping the mirror fog free.</li>
            <li>You put hot water in the reservoir and it stays fog free for 15 minutes, genius.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, stays fog free.  </li>
            <li>This is true of any mirror, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>You fill it up with hot water and the heat of the water keeps the mirror warm and the mirror stays clear.  </li>
            <li>: I bought a similar but superior shower mirror by ToiletTree here, and I&#x27;ve been putting the water in when I first hop in the shower.</li>
            <li>The stated 20 minute drain time is a gross exaggeration, more like 5!</li>
            <li>The top one is strong enough, so it&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li>As an alternative, the mirror easily slips upward and off its mount to be filled remotely--no water spills and no trouble latching or sliding it off the mount.  </li>
            <li>This mirror works great and because of the design, requires no special coating to keep the fog away.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large size mirror and the bracketing that allows you to remove the mirror and fill with water is rather smart and elegant.</li>
            <li>When ordering the unit, be certain you have a smooth surface to stick the unit to.    </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaving mirror, except for, as you guessed it, the suction cups.  </li>
            <li>In concept, the idea of a reservoir of hot water helping to keep the mirror fog free and usable for shaving or other shower activities is a good one.  </li>
            <li>I have a clean, new, perfectly smooth shower wall (plastic) and</li>
            <li>The mirror really does stay fog free so you can see what your doing shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have a smooth shower wall and the suction cups hold very well.</li>
            <li>It really does stay fog free.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror after reading reviews for all the others that do not do very well at staying fog free.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you need to fill it with warm water and that means it gets covered in water droplets.</li>
            <li>For the price though, this can&#x27;t be beat and is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>It rarely stays fog free and the suction cups don&#x27;t stay stuck to the shower wall very well.  </li>
            <li>Setup and installation is easy and the construction is decent, too.  </li>
            <li>My issue is that I want to use the mirror for shaving in the shower, so I need to be able to see my face clearly.  </li>
            <li>However, there were enough favorable reviews plus the attractive price that convinced me to complete the purchase.</li>
            <li>The razor holder sticks out in the way, it would be nice if it could be folded back out of the way when not being used.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is really useful.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is clear and does not appear to be distorted, but it doesn&#x27;t make me look any better.</li>
            <li>:)  So far, the suction cups have held the mirror in place without falling off the shower wall.  </li>
            <li>Am I supposed to be impressed it hasn&#x27;t broken yet?  </li>
            <li>This Ace mirror is phenomenal, and it STAYS fog free for my entire shower.  </li>
            <li>It just takes a second to fill it with warm water from the shower head</li>
            <li>worth it.    </li>
            <li>the height adjustment is simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Easy to hang, easy to fill, and absolutely crystal clear!  </li>
            <li>Strong suction cups, clever easy to fill chamber that easily drops back onto the hanger, et viola!</li>
            <li>It is just the right mirror for the price</li>
            <li>(now I just remember to re-press them in every once in awhile), the anti-fog system for the mirror works well, and the razor holder fits my Merkur just right.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most ingenious idea and it actually works!  </li>
            <li>fog free mirrors couldn&#x27;t handle this or would only stay fog free for a month or two before their coating stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Low tech, low cost fogless shower mirrow that works great every time.</li>
            <li>I would say about half as good as when new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many fogless mirrors and eventually they loose their fogless feature (and I don&#x27;t clean them with Windex, etc).  </li>
            <li>So far the top cup holds the whole thing pretty well.      </li>
            <li>(And, it&#x27;s strong enough when it&#x27;s full of water.)  </li>
            <li>The fog-less part works as advertised and is much better than any other cheap fog-less mirror I ever tried.</li>
            <li>My shower is a plastic lined affair and where mirror is mounted the surface is not flat and vertical but top mounting point is offset from bottom mounting point.</li>
            <li>From the high end sharper image mirror/radio/shower light/etc models all the way down to the kohls cheapos - this one is the best because its simple, you just add the water and it will not fog.  </li>
            <li>Mirror\\&quot; is a no-frills design that does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I paired this with a [[ASIN:B000I3F91O Sangean H201 AM/FM Digital Shower Radio]] and the radio feels like a lot more product for it&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li>but it would be a much better value at $20ish or with a larger sized mirror</li>
            <li>I recently shaved off my beard and am shaving more often</li>
            <li>First, it WILL NOT stay on the wall.  </li>
            <li>Overall, really pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is crystal clear and fog free for around 10 min...</li>
            <li>More likely then not it will fall off eventually</li>
            <li>Fill it up with hot water and start shaving.  </li>
            <li>Completely fog free</li>
            <li>So first of all, I have been an Amazon member for about 10 years now, and a prime member since they introduced Prime.</li>
            <li>First of all, the delivery.</li>
            <li>The first unit I had would not stay adhered to wall ( glass or tile).      </li>
            <li>Installation was a snap and it functions exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It must be very convenient for men to shave in the shower because my boyfriend loves this mirror!</li>
            <li>First off, to all those reviewers that have said that the suction cups don&#x27;t work - maybe it&#x27;s your shower wall tiles and not the suction cups.  </li>
            <li>it works EXACTLY as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to give this mirror 5 stars but only thing keeping me away from it</li>
            <li>The heat from the hot water warms the mirror and prevents fog.  </li>
            <li>Requires you to slide the mirror unit off a suction bracket and fill with hot water.   </li>
            <li>I have bought many shower mirrors that had various means of anti fog.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and once you put the hot water in it, it does indeed become fogless.</li>
            <li>You have to fill the mirror with hot water every time you use it.</li>
            <li>First, this is not a mirror.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient!  </li>
            <li>(I use the handheld shower head) and it immediately becomes clear and fog free.  </li>
            <li>Finally. :)</li>
            <li>and you pour some hot water on the reservoir</li>
            <li>First off this mirror has *</li>
            <li>The mirror is exactly what it claims, a fogless shower mirror</li>
            <li>Evidently they are trying to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the suction cup problem</li>
            <li>You fill up a reservoir with hot water and it&#x27;ll keep the mirror fogless for 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>The hot water reservoir  reduces fog on the mirror surface quite well.  </li>
            <li>The first time was at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Worked good for a few months.</li>
            <li>Mirror is great, may be a little warped but who cares, image is great and it actually magnifies a little.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this mirror - and if this one is as good as the last, I&#x27;ll happily come back in a few years for another one...</li>
            <li>The little hole for it to drip the water is perfect so you never have to empty the water.    </li>
            <li>Also, I have a one piece, flexible plastic shower insert in my bath, and the suction cups would not stick to this at all - I ended up adding a little clear silicon caulk to the suction cups, and it has been great.  </li>
            <li>Also if you are having trouble getting it to stick to smooth surfaces, run the cups under hot water and apply liquid hand soup which helps seal the suction better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s common sense really on how it works, but it&#x27;s great that companies have adapted this idea.</li>
            <li>This is a clean fiberglass shower that I had to scrape my old mirror off to remove the suction cups.   </li>
            <li>Again, because the \\&quot;Ace Fogless\\&quot; is just a plastic cup with a mirror on the front, it is light enough that the two powerful suction cups have no problem holding it in place.</li>
            <li>Most modern razors have thicker handles, especially ones like the battery-powered Mach-3.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups work great on glass, but I can see how some users have complained that it would not stick to tile very well.</li>
            <li>The razor holder does hold most safety razors as it is flexible rubber and can bend to open to any reasonable sized razor.  </li>
            <li>Still not very clear but better.</li>
            <li>His only comment about it would be that it would be nice if it had some kind of film to protect the mirror against hard water.  </li>
            <li>The Ace mirror on the other hand is a great product with a simple design.  </li>
            <li>i get a better shave in shower and does the job for the price will see how long it lasts though</li>
            <li>I made sure the surface of my shower was clean, wetted the cups and pressed them onto the wall firmly.  </li>
            <li>This is just an update (nice to know how a product is working down the road)</li>
            <li>The drip hole to drain is nice, though the water drips down the razor when it is hanging in the razor holder.    </li>
            <li>And when you need to clean it, use whatever bathroom cleaner you normally use and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s a reliable Chevy that could easily become a Cadillac.</li>
            <li>The image in the mirror is crystal clear, stayed fog-free for as long as I needed and the option to tilt the mirror on an upward angle is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>The hot water in the reserve tank keeps the mirror fog free for the entire length of my shower.  </li>
            <li>I guess that stuff they spray on the glass to make it fogless just isn&#x27;t strong enough and/or rubs off after a while.  </li>
            <li>It certainly works, provided you don&#x27;t mind the mirror face being covered with water droplets from shower spray</li>
            <li>I chose the Ace as much on looks as I did on the overwhelmingly positive reviews I&#x27;d read.  </li>
            <li>the removable mirror was done pretty well...which puts me in complete opposite opinion of most of the reviews here.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several shower mirrors in the past, and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Easy to remove and fill up the reservoir behind the mirror with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>so it will save time and give me a better shave due to the hot steam.</li>
            <li>My experience, after several weeks of use, is that the mirror&#x27;s suction cup attachment system works just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if the suction cups were a little stronger</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll decide to fill the reservoir partway through a shower to clean my face and it instantly de-fogs when I add the hot water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is little products like this that you use every day that makes life fun and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It has a wide mouth at the top for filling from the shower spray and really speeds up the process of shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>--ours is smooth but it stays put for at least many weeks at a time</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again and recommend it to anyone who needs one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I read the comments too much</li>
            <li>Ok - at $29.95, I expected:  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like standing within 3\\&quot; to see my whole face.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter weight...does not stay fogless forever</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any problems with the hole dripping too fast as mentioned by some.  </li>
            <li>The whole product is still intact.</li>
            <li>Pros: Doesn&#x27;t really fog up    Cons:</li>
            <li>My whole face is viewable and it seems to magnify a bit also.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was very hopeful as I was buying this for my husband.</li>
            <li>The reviews were so very helpful.</li>
            <li>it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>Suction cups are okay if you apply them carefully; once every month or so I notice one of them has come off.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>but it gets very foggy.  </li>
            <li>suction cup things that work really</li>
            <li>This one really works.  </li>
            <li>As with all suction cups, make sure they&#x27;re wet before sticking them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t want to work so much with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much difference that would make, if any.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done much testing,</li>
            <li>It will stay, but I don&#x27;t trust it that much.  </li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t design much in the way of an eyelet or hook so it can be hung.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the mirror for about 3 weeks and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well finished and works very well.</li>
            <li>This stays fog free during the entire shower.</li>
            <li>They really stink.    </li>
            <li>I spent the better</li>
            <li>My shower head covers the whole front of the mirror with water droplets while filling the reservoir (as I imagine anyone&#x27;s would)</li>
            <li>This one really does.  </li>
            <li>That worked really well</li>
            <li>AND the wall REALLY</li>
            <li>This model from Ace actually stays fog free.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use that much anyway</li>
            <li>Really impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So all in all this unit works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I like to shave in the shower--and this mirror works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li>Z&#x27;Fogless\\&quot; was that the whole contraption was way heavier than the suction cups could deal with, and spent more time on the bottom of the tub then sticking to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li>You simply fill the reservoir on the back of the mirror with warm water and the fog is history.  </li>
            <li>So it could be soap scum that&#x27;s keeping some from a good adhesion.  </li>
            <li>This fogless shower mirror works great, but it does fall off sometimes, and the suction cups do not work very well, I&#x27;m guessing poor quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a simple, effective solution.</li>
            <li>After you fill it with water the mirror will stay fogless for a good 10 minutes as the water slowly drips out the bottom.</li>
            <li>Filling it with water is an easy, minor chore.</li>
            <li>The unit is fog free (as you put hot water in the mirror basket, which slowly drips out, leaving a fog free mirror surface...</li>
            <li>just as has been stated by so many other favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>Bought this recently as a replacement for the original I had.  </li>
            <li>it works fine the way it is, but a little bigger would have been better.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, not more than many of the mirrors made of metal and which have to be immersed in water.  </li>
            <li>mirror doesnt fog up at all, however it does get water marks pretty easily, which is understandable, just need to wipe down with a tissue every now and then</li>
            <li>You fill it with hot water from your shower and it stays clear and drains itself when you are through.</li>
            <li>Also some have said the fog free effect lasts a long time once you fill it--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that is a problem with Ace or with all suction cups on that kind of tile.  </li>
            <li>You have to apply it to a clean, flat surface.  </li>
            <li>you want it to stick to your bathroom tile, you need to scrub and clean the tile back until it&#x27;s like new, then with the force of the hulk, after puny humans try to stop him, mash it to the wall.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use (fill with water and empty).  </li>
            <li>Easy and absolutely no fog, had it for a month now.</li>
            <li>Have tried many fog less mirrors for shaving in the shower and none have done the job</li>
            <li>Mirror is a decent size</li>
            <li>There are are two main problems with the design:     </li>
            <li>and that is its main purpose.  </li>
            <li>(The fog free coating wore off and it was more of a fuzzy, younger looking me in my old mirror - good for your ego, bad for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>An expensive one that attaches above the shower head and has water flowing was best before this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The amount of fog free time is limited</li>
            <li>Based on the help from the company and the redesigned product I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is a high grade mirror.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like shaving and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and so far, he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance and was relieved to find out that the arms of the razor holder are flexible and can expand to fit a wide range of razor</li>
            <li>took a couple times getting it secured to my shower wall well enough to hold on consistently (although i think that was on me for not cleaning the surface very well beforehand).  </li>
            <li>Seems smaller than I expected from just glancing at the online pictures, but its size is good enough for a shave.  </li>
            <li>these suction cups are not smooth on the underside like most cups you see</li>
            <li>On the box it says sticks to tile and glass, so I don&#x27;t know if I can blame the manufacturer, but other suction cups seem to work fine in my shower.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and simple to fill with a hand-held shower.  </li>
            <li>The entire idea of a fogless mirror is to not fog up in the shower right?</li>
            <li>The suction cups are the same as every suction up in the world, meaning they stick to the wall pretty well as long as the wall is clean when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I used a Bicycle spoke (stainless steel) and bent it into a large U to go around the suction cup mount and and then bent two u shaped hooks on the open ends</li>
            <li>And the little hole in the bottom means the water will drop out on its own after a short while.    </li>
            <li>Having bought, then thrown away many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in past years, I did not have high expectations for this one either.</li>
            <li>A few people complained about the suction cups not working very good</li>
            <li>If I ever need a new mirror, however, I will buy this again without hesitation.</li>
            <li>If/when this breaks, I will buy a new one.</li>
            <li>brand new again.  </li>
            <li>This means that if you forget to empty it, it will empty on its own.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you really wanted the back-lighting or if you wanted a radio, but the design is simple and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It works GREAT, the concept behind is so simple!  </li>
            <li>i didnt care too much about the suction cups because i was ready to put double sided tape on it</li>
            <li>(Nylon &amp; Stainless steel line about 6 inches long) Hooked it around the top suction cup and put a tiny nail in the wall above the shower  wall surround.</li>
            <li>While the mirrors that hook directly into the shower head work as well, they are too high for up for me</li>
            <li>It stays on my shower wall as the suction cups are strong enough as long as the surface is smoothe.  </li>
            <li>the mirror is well-made, crystal clear mirror, and works as promised!</li>
            <li>At first the suction cups didn&#x27;t hold, but now they are stuck on and have been for several weeks with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time and it definitely works as advertised!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I put water in the back and put it on the suction cups and within a minute it fell onto my toe.</li>
            <li>I said, a novel concept for a fogless shower mirror to actually be fogless, but this one really works!  </li>
            <li>This is the first fogless mirror that actually works!  </li>
            <li>several times first day I got it.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as promised, and after a couple of months of daily use it still works.</li>
            <li>and I have more than enough water left in the back when i&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>The first two fell short of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for the past month now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>it has a reservoir to put hot water in back of mirror that lets drops of it out automatically</li>
            <li>Let face it, unless your willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a radio that is water proof totally, you may as well forget all the gimmicks and buy this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Other than that very small problem, this mirror is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but the mirror, which isn&#x27;t that big) is the first completely fogless mirror I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The razor holder is kind of small, but not to big of a deal.</li>
            <li>It has a sound scientific principle; by filling the little well in back with hot water it neutralizes the steamy atmosphere.  </li>
            <li>I found one other mirror like this, with the reservoir on the back for warm water, but it mounted permanently with glue, and since I just spent a ton of money putting in a brand new shower stall in my new bathroom, I wasn&#x27;t about to go gluing stuff to the wall.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups stay stuck to the wall, the mirror is large enough and stays fog-free for the duration of my shave, and it conveniently drains itself.</li>
            <li>i figured id try sticking it to the large mirror over my sink, same results!</li>
            <li>By your next shower it is dry and ready to be filled for your next shave.  </li>
            <li>Fill up the hollow with hot water from the shower and there&#x27;s no fog!  </li>
            <li>This is long enough for me as I am a clean shaved person.</li>
            <li>and it stays crystal clear.</li>
            <li>and I can see my face clearly at 3 feet away.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as clear as i&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>I had a perfectly clear mirror in about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>The Ace works well and provides a clear shaving mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog.    </li>
            <li>I generally just hold the mirror, which is lightweight, and that works fine, if slightly less convenient.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep it clear of water though, so you need to wipe it off as you shave.  </li>
            <li>to try to maintain a clear mirror.</li>
            <li>mirror itself is absolutely fogless when used properly.  </li>
            <li>but I thought this mirror was supposed to be fogless naturally.  </li>
            <li>and this mirror has served me well so far.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing to say about this items anti-fogging ability, because it flunked-out before I could get that far.</li>
            <li>So far it has been about to get the job done</li>
            <li>The suction cups have worked well so far.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m keeping my old mirror just to hang it on.</li>
            <li>This mirror does not fog up unless you breath directly on it while in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mirror is completely fogged over.  </li>
            <li>Finally found a shower mirror that really works.  </li>
            <li>It has a small reservoir on the back of the mirror you fill with hot water and it gives you 20-25 minutes of fog free use.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving my face and head in the shower for nearly 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I have had 0 issues with this product so far and would recommend it to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
            <li>It has served me well for over 1 year so far, but that is where my satisfaction has ended.</li>
            <li>The one shower mirror that used to work as well was the one from Sharper Image that attaches directly to the shower head.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend who \\&quot;has it all\\&quot; but complained about never being able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>My old shower mirror did not have that feature</li>
            <li>so you have to be conscious of when you fill the reservoir.  </li>
            <li>It barely stays up when empty, and its holding power is pushed to the limit when full.</li>
            <li>He is usually skeptical when it comes to the gadgets of this kind, but he loves this one and he says it works really well.</li>
            <li>My old favorite was a hand-held rectangular mirror that I&#x27;d purchased at a local thrift store and hung on the tile surface of my shower with one of those peel-and-stick hooks you get at the local big box store.  </li>
            <li>It drains slowly over time, so eventually you start getting fog again near the top of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>there is no problem when it&#x27;s full with water, it doesn&#x27;t come crashing down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not very large, smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Well, only because I live in New York City, was this a major pain.</li>
            <li>: About 6 months in, the water doesn&#x27;t always drip out from the mirror, so make sure you are aware it might be full of cold water (relatively) when you go to refill it for its next use.</li>
            <li>The mirror has a reservoir on the back that you fill up with hot water from the shower head before you take a shower, and because the temperature is maintained between the front and back of the mirror it doesn&#x27;t fog.  </li>
            <li>There is not really any kind of magnification, it looks like it because you will probably be standing 6 inches from the mirror, and because it is small.</li>
            <li>At first I could shake it and it would drain again, but those fixes only lasted a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mirror was becoming harder and harder to see in.  </li>
            <li>The first one of these mirrors that I bought lasted about 2 years, the only reason it needed to be replaced by #2 is it fell (for the 3rd time) and broke a bit.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light on it</li>
            <li>Simply put for the price, functionality, and performance, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Given the price I would expect the mirror to be larger, but on the positive it is actually fogless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and light.  </li>
            <li>Primarily because my past purchases have been on products that coat the mirror with something that wears off after 3-6 months (planned obsolescence).  </li>
            <li>You could fill the mirror when you first get in the shower, but it seems to me that by the end of the shower, especially if it&#x27;s a long one, the water in the mirror would be cooler than the shower.</li>
            <li>Con&#x27;s...  - When you fill the reservoir (with hot water) the little hole in the bottom that allows water to escape will get clogged if you have a high mineral content in you water.</li>
            <li>Also, while it appears that the razor holder doesnt hold Mach brand razors, just peel the prong back a little and it will fit.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I&#x27;ve had issues with the mirror falling down too, but again, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the suction cups also need to be kept clean in order to maintain their adhesion.  </li>
            <li>The idea is simple enough, fill a reservoir behind the mirror with hot water, and like magic, it prevents the mirror from fogging.  </li>
            <li>In the time that I&#x27;ve owned it it has only come loose a hand full of time and likely because I&#x27;ve bumped it.</li>
            <li>The only possible issue I might have with this item is that the water drips out a tad too fast for me....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little shaver holder plastic piece falls off easily but for me that is a minor detail, I don&#x27;t use it anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started shaving in the shower recently as I was making a mess of the sink and never wanted to clean it up.  </li>
            <li>Worked well, but the rather stiff gooseneck mount made it somewhat difficult to position the mirror in an ideal location while showering/shaving.</li>
            <li>is enough to keep it clear.</li>
            <li>I fill the reservoir with water from the shower and it remains fog free for the entire time I&#x27;m in there; usually 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lick &amp; stick the suction cup on the wall, fill the body with water, instantly the mirror is clear and stays that way.</li>
            <li>The fogless image is clear, the operation simple.    </li>
            <li>Since I have a marble tile shower, the one \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; I made was applying two squares of clear packing tape to the tile so that the suction cups adhere solidly.</li>
            <li>This one, with the water in the back, stays clear.  </li>
            <li>But a simple clear silicon sealant used as a glue solved that.    </li>
            <li>Just fill with water and the mirror remains clear for the entire length of your shower.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is an open and shut case.  </li>
            <li>This thing barely functions as a mirror without the fog.  </li>
            <li>But the razor holder barely holds the razor.  </li>
            <li>They barely even stay connected to the porcelain on the bath tub itself.</li>
            <li>The Ace Fogless Mirror is - so far - a big improvement.</li>
            <li>The only complaints I have are that it is pretty small, and the suction cups don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>It barely fits some of the my disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>They barely hold the apparatus up.</li>
            <li>It drains so fast I&#x27;m tempted to fill the hole used to drain closed and then just dump the water in the reservoir out when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it offers no mounting solution except for suction cups, which don&#x27;t work on my textured tile.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t break it (although my mirror became distorted somehow and now reflects my face in a weird and somewhat amusing way) , but I don&#x27;t like bouncing around any of the razor blades I rub against my face.</li>
            <li>I have a thick Merkur HD razor, so it won&#x27;t fit on the bottom holder.  </li>
            <li>This gives up to 15 minutes of fog free viewing as the water slowly drips out the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I emailed Ace (Goody) asking them for a new base, but got some stock email reply about their great hair care products and a promise to send my comments to engineering team.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to shave in the shower without having to splash water onto the mirror continually so that you can actually see your face and not end up a bloody mess by the end of it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors over the years, most of them start off fine but within a few months the anti-fog coating has worn off and the mirrors become useless.</li>
            <li>The little holder, despite what people in other reviews say, holds the MACH 3 razors just fine.</li>
            <li>Simple, low priced, compact, easy to install (I cheated and used silicon glue on the suckers).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and shaving creams, after shave lotions, etc were not enough to prevent the redness and puffiness that were the inevitable result of shaving.</li>
            <li>There is even a clever drip hole on the bottom of the reservoir which allows it to empty over time.    </li>
            <li>noticed that most people complain about the suction cups, but I suspect that they either have a poor surface to place it on or just not cleaning or applying it properly.</li>
            <li>It looks like a funhouse mirror which makes it difficult to shave accurately if you need to make some sharp lines for a goatee or sweet mustache.  </li>
            <li>Just a little hot water before you shave</li>
            <li>As the listing and other reviews state, the removable mirror has an open chamber in the back which you fill with hot water.</li>
            <li>I was shocked how effective this concept was, and it works much better than the standard fogless mirrors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>and that is the only drawback, but the reservoir is drained by a small hole, just enough time to shave and clean up any missed spots.  </li>
            <li>This is especially perplexing if when you step in a nice hot shower and pull up on the reservoir to remove it, it breaks loose and freezing cold water (in comparison) splashes on your nether region causing instant paralysis and screams of terror.    </li>
            <li>Every attempt to roto-rooter out the pin sized drain hole has failed and even Super Glue has not adhered the razor holder back in place because it is too smooth and is always wet.    </li>
            <li>I take long showers, but the mirror stays clear, so that&#x27;s the answer to SOFTWARE #2</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower (after my facial hairs had become soft and whatnot) was the only viable solution, and rubbing my face was the only way of detecting where the razor needed to be applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My one small issue is that I wish the mirror secured a bit more tightly to the backing which suctions to the shower wall or whatever surface.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this from the beginning b/c when you have a face full of suds with your eyes closed; the suction cups lose their grip and the entire unit crashes down on the shower floor, you will stop singing that joyful tune.      </li>
            <li>Mirror easily detaches for quick filling, and has small drain hole that slowly drains empty.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to clean the soap scum off periodically, but that&#x27;s no design flaw, simply the cost of keeping something in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and/or having to wipe the whole thing down before use.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have an alternative for you, but if you are looking for a high quality mirror that is truly fog free, I was look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>After reading a few positive reviews on the website and having to need to purchase another item - I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.      </li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower is just part of my shower routine and besides - it means one less time I have to clean the frak&#x27;ing little hairs out of my sink.    </li>
            <li>With the water droplets plus the poor refective capabilities, it is hard to get a good shave with this item.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you forget to empty the chamber after shower because there is a tiny opening on the bottom to drain the water very slowly.</li>
            <li>Some other negative posters have mentioned the suction cups aren&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>

            <li> A great purchase.</li>
            <li> my  husband cussing (lol)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great product as advertised.</li>
            <li> The quality of the mirror itself is great.     </li>
            <li> but it sticks GREAT on my glass door.</li>
            <li> It does not fog up, is attractive</li>
            <li> Its a great mirror that never fogs up.</li>
            <li> But break off the razor holder and you still have a great mirror for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great idea ...</li>
            <li> The mirrir itself and the water chamber are great.</li>
            <li> This mirror Still fogs  up in the shower and the suction cups do not work great.</li>
            <li> The fogless feature works great</li>
            <li> This mirror has been great.</li>
            <li> The razor hook also works great with my Mach 3 Turbo razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great design, there is no fogless film, it uses water temp.  </li>
            <li> Great product and design.</li>
            <li> and it is a great value.</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> great travel accessory.</li>
            <li> Really a great product</li>
            <li> mirror works great for shaving in shower to prevent fogging.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a fraction of the cost of others.</li>
            <li> That works just great.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups work great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li> it worked great</li>
            <li> (My wife cannot use my shower holder to hold her razor)which is a huge plus for me!!!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say he is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> If this had better suction cups, this would be the best shower mirror out there, but until they improve this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless you plan to glue it to your wall.</li>
            <li> For all that, it&#x27;s held up remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> ON A NOT SO FRIENDLY SHOWER WALL!!!  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly well and is easy to use.    </li>
            <li> The razor holder works fine for him, it holds it perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have a basket on the shower head arm where it fits perfectly and works as intended.  </li>
            <li> I knew I needed a good shower mirror and tried a couple of Zadro products.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking for a good shower mirror.</li>
            <li> Cons -  Suction cups - suck...and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> fair image, until the mirror surface deteriorates to a cloudy surface over time.    </li>
            <li> this mirror and get rid of fog for good.</li>
            <li> The mirror is good.</li>
            <li> Would have been 4 stars if the suction cups good hold the mirror</li>
            <li> Good product, though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually good with suction cups.</li>
            <li> I have a clock and a over the shower rack that would take a good amount of force to pry off.  </li>
            <li> and so they can&#x27;t make a good seal against a known non-porous surface like a mirror or tile.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> The water drips out on its own which is great</li>
            <li> It will give you a good 5 mins of fog-free time for shaving (plenty of time for me).  </li>
            <li> if you like to shave in the shower and don&#x27;t need lights, radios or special holders for shave cream or brush, this is an excellent choice...</li>
            <li> Good job on this product, we are very very pleased.</li>
            <li> The fog-free feature, however, works perfectly, and as this is the main reason I chose this mirror, I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> but it needs a better mechanism for staying put!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You will love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that my exuberance lasts for but the moment, I&#x27;m stoked and pleased to recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ace, time to invest in better suction cups!</li>
            <li> This does what it says, great suction hold, easy to fill, drains itself and the mirror stays fog-free.  </li>
            <li> and it works great, but you do have to permanently attach it, which is fine with me since I plan to always shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great product and would recommend this to others looking for a fog free mirror.</li>
            <li> Great job on fog free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it may sound like this wasn&#x27;t a great experience...</li>
            <li> The razor holder is a nice add on as well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all mount to fill it with warm water before each use)  </li>
            <li> It impressed me so much that I reviewed it on my own site.</li>
            <li> However the mirror does what it says and is fogless which is nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the principle, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The built-in drain is a nice feature as the water slowy drains on its own, so you don&#x27;t have to do it after each use and no mildew builds.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came with some kind of shower wall hook in addition to the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> The walls in my shower have a kind of matte finish and they do not stick to it at all.  </li>
            <li> I do that as soon as I get in the shower and have warm water coming out of the shower head.</li>
            <li> Effective solution to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I used to have the \\&quot;Sharper Image\\&quot;-type shower mirror---the kind that hooks inline with the shower nozzle plumbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, a fogless mirror that you can stick to the wall - they&#x27;re much better than the ones that attach to your showerhead.</li>
            <li> When I got mine I liked it a lot, but then some problems began to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice holder for the razor.    </li>
            <li> So I got the kind that was advertised as fog-free, and required no shower attachment.  </li>
            <li> The razor holder is flexible and my Gillette Fusion fits in it nicely.    </li>
            <li> For the price that you pay, this might be the best available - anything better, may cost multiples more...</li>
            <li> I liked the style and the suction cup on the Oxo model</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> The Ace mirror just attaches to a glass surface with suction cups, and you fill it with warm water when you need it to be fogless.</li>
            <li> They have held nicely for about a week now.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;one of my theories is that the cleaning lady cleaned it with some kind of chemical that ruined it&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does the job brilliantly and really works!</li>
            <li> The suction cups do not do a great job of sticking and the mirror keeps falling - luckily it is shatterproof.  </li>
            <li> I take the mirror off the mount (very easy to do)</li>
            <li> Its very easy to fill the \\&quot;basin\\&quot; with shower water</li>
            <li> He can use this very easily and it adjusts to his tall height (6&#x27;4).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Best mirrow I&#x27;ve used as far as preventing the glass from fogging up.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the fogless mirrors I have purchesed for my husband, this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> but by far this one works the best.  </li>
            <li> than that it&#x27;s brilliant: I love it, I kept trying to fog it by blowing hot air at it, just does not get foged.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hopefully someday someone will invent a mirror that works effectively on its own and stays fog free without having to fill a reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Those worked great at first but in a couple of months would need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> The concept is smart, the product is sturdy, and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I have had the one that attaches to your shower and uses water this one is way better.</li>
            <li> and/or more of a rubberized finish.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups did not hold it to the shower wall, so there&#x27;s nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I think four would be better.  </li>
            <li> Mounted it to the shower wall and filled it with warm shower water and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> was expecting more from the reviews, but can say it is just ok.</li>
            <li> I see now that the product is fulfilled by amazon, probably because more and more people are ordering it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding ACE product.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I filled the mirror with the warm shower water per the instructions and guess what....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall and it develops spots that i havent been able to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Zadro anti-fog shower mirrors, and they worked okay;</li>
            <li> The suction cups are more than ample to hold this thing up</li>
            <li> Lovely...</li>
            <li> Suction cups seem to work better that way.</li>
            <li> This is more just a cosmetic issue I have with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we made sure that neither suctions cups were over the grout line.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using mine for many months now.</li>
            <li> What more can one ask for.</li>
            <li> would purchase it again, but I would like it to have better quality suction cups.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any \\&quot;fog free\\&quot;</li>
            <li> OK Shower Shave Mirror.</li>
            <li> As far as being fog free, this mirror is excellent.</li>
            <li> Very simple and the self draining hole is awesome.</li>
            <li> Ok so if you want this mirror to shave in the shower, look somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> Ok - so I get in the shower, shampoo up an bit, then turn to shave.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sold on the technology (or, perhaps better stated, the simplicity of the technology).  </li>
            <li> Instead of a coating on the mirror that seems to wear off or get covered with soap or minerals, this mirror works by raising the temperature of the mirror through shower water you put into the top of it.</li>
            <li> This has been an excellent purchase for me, I now only use this for shaving.  </li>
            <li> These do not stick to any surface in our shower for more than 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Having gone through so many mirrors, this one I feel is the closest to fogless yet.  </li>
            <li> The design is ingenious.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I know of works better.</li>
            <li> I have a removable shower head, so I just spray water in the top of the mirror and in about 5 seconds any fog on the mirror disappears.  </li>
            <li> My husband (for shaving his face) and daughter (for shaving her armpits) both love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly switching out my mirror for the latest and greatest \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; shaving mirror.  </li>
            <li> I figured the more</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Simple and functional, and a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to recommend a product I&#x27;ve found that works better here</li>
            <li> Having to fill this and wipe this adds a lot of fiddling around that it seems like could be eliminated by a better product or better design.</li>
            <li> I waited a month before writing this review to make sure it worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve beens shaving in shower for decades, and have tried many approaches/devices etc.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> as others have noted, the suction cups could be a bit more robust.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> If they put better suction cups on</li>
            <li> Okay but does fall off at times.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are great, a very underrated feature with a shower product.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for more than a month now, and it works just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> If you need more time you can always refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 2 years ago and the product was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> It needs to be appropriately cared for and it will continue to work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried many, and let me tell you.  </li>
            <li> The suction has fallen off a couple times but overall I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> the mirrors that I had purchased before these would typically last a month or two before the anti-fogging material would wear off, making shaving a \\&quot;best guess\\&quot; scenario...  </li>
            <li> All in all, a decent price for a great mirror.</li>
            <li> If you just really love yourself and want to be able to see how awesome you look with a wet face and shampoo in your eye, buy this mirror.  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely superior to the first.  </li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time, in fact, I&#x27;m going to order another one now just as a backup!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you ACE for a great product, (But please keep in mind to change those suction cups when making a new product).</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t huge; I can&#x27;t see my whole face in the mirror at once, but it is a great size for</li>
            <li> It actually remains fog free and does its job perfectly.  </li>
            <li> - The Single razor is perfect for me</li>
            <li> My advice is to clean your tiles!  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s enjoyed being able to shave in the shower and meet my standards of a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have been amazingly happy.  </li>
            <li> The mirror stays clear, the no fog feature works great.  </li>
            <li> I decided a wall-mounted mirror looked like a more flexible option, and I liked the idea of the built-in hot water reservoir on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as fog, its great, doesnt fog, even after all the water dripped out.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work if we had smooth tiles though.</li>
            <li> Wow, great idea.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shower mirror I have ever owned, and for $12 I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  </li>
            <li> The mirror has a huge opening at the top which makes it really easy to fill it up with water.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is easily removable to fill with water, works well.  </li>
            <li> It fills up with water easily before shaving.</li>
            <li> The mirror with the water chamber can be easily detached.</li>
            <li> (it falls once in a while), but it is relatively easy to move as well.</li>
            <li> Water beads on the surface really easily.</li>
            <li> Filling the reservoir is easy (either with a cup or by lifting the mirror out of its v-shaped holder slot).</li>
            <li> The drain hole works well, but it is just as easy to lift the mirror and dump any remaining water at the end of the shower.</li>
            <li> thankfully Amazon provided an easy return</li>
            <li> Not so easy to clip and unclip the razor with one hand.</li>
            <li> An easy step, not a deal breaker.      </li>
            <li> My Gilette Track II razor fits easily in the holder.</li>
            <li> It easily comes off the bracket for filling and with the built in 20 minute</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this mirror to anyone who enjoys shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> After 2+ years of use it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> the suction cups arent that strong, so i could not leave it at its spot in the shower,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be certain you have a smooth surface and good light to shave.  </li>
            <li> (you can probably figure you better than i can by clicking on me) -- it is now a full 4 stars</li>
            <li> Honestly, there&#x27;s just not much to go wrong.</li>
            <li> use the hot water from the shower to keep the mirror warm and stop it from fogging up in the shower.    </li>
            <li> My first fog-free mirror was the kind that attached to the shower head.  </li>
            <li> I guess you have to make sure the wall is clean and smooth before you put the suction cups in.</li>
            <li> My razor fits fine in the holder.</li>
            <li> The plastic holder for a razor is somewhat flexible and should hold any razor (held my Personna M5 Magnum just fine).    </li>
            <li> Suction to the wall works fine.  </li>
            <li> I stick it to a glass, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> This things sticks perfectly fine to the tile in my shower.  </li>
            <li> The mirror does have a slight distortion from a distance, but for the close work of shaving, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> (my partner doesn&#x27;t complain and he shaves just fine in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this being great since you could remove the mirror and fill it with hot water so the steam didn&#x27;t collect.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups stick to my tile just fine.  </li>
            <li> If your shower has super-smooth tile, then you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, but you have to wait a couple of minutes for the condensation to dissipate.</li>
            <li> My Gillette razor fits just fine in the holder - you turn it sideways to pull or push the thinnest part of the razor</li>
            <li> The suction cups seem to work just fine as well.  </li>
            <li> Looks fine, attached well to the shower wall and works.</li>
            <li> That process was fine except that I had to keep purchasing the bottles of solution.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is simply made and easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are plenty strong enough for holding the light-weight mirror and the water reservoir was a GREAT idea for keeping the mirror fog free.   </li>
            <li> It is still working great and no problems except what I mentioned above about securing to the wall.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is great, stays fog-free when water is in the back.</li>
            <li> The mirror&#x27;s concept is fantastic, in fact, I wish I&#x27;d thought of it myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all, and none fit.</li>
            <li> Great idea guys, but back to the drawing board.    </li>
            <li> Stays fog free for the length of my showers (10 mins or so).  </li>
            <li> But mine is standard tile, works great.</li>
            <li> I am a scuba diver and have experience with fog free sprays, coatings, and the like for lenses under water.</li>
            <li> It makes mornings stress free, as you just rinse the face away in the shower.    </li>
            <li> but eventually the surfaces would become corroded and would not remain fog free.    </li>
            <li> This product, however, is fantastic.</li>
            <li> You must have smooth face tile, plastic walls or glass.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t know there is a problem unless it&#x27;s filled with water.    </li>
            <li> always wanted to try the Sharper Image fog free mirror which was attached to the showerhead and kept the mirror fog free by temperature control, but I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $29.95 for it.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bead up with water that much either which is nice.</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great product and well excecuted.  </li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase and well worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> Seems rather cheap in design</li>
            <li> It would be great for a smaller stall shower.</li>
            <li> So, I read all the reviews on here, having just lost my &#x27;fog free&#x27; mirror to the fades of time.</li>
            <li> After filling it up with water the reservoir keeps the mirror fog free.  </li>
            <li> I have, in fact, relocated it twice, and found it securely attached when I attempted to relocate it.</li>
            <li> It remains fog free throughout a shower and shave.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t fit my Gillette Mach 3</li>
            <li> I saw some stuff at different vendors for cheaper but this is a larger mirror and has a tilt capability so you can see under your chin and jaw bones better to make sure you got that perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll freely admit up front -</li>
            <li> This mirror stayed fog free /past/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The filling the mirror with water idea keeps the mirror fog free.  </li>
            <li> This product has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It has remained steadfastly stuck to the smooth fiberglass wall in my shower since I placed it there over two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not conclusive whether mine has good suction or not, but it is quite easy to push on it every now and again--and it apparently works fine doing that.  </li>
            <li> When I attached it to the shower wall the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick and my razor wouldn&#x27;t fit in the attached holder.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all of the so-called fogless mirrors available so that I can shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Once mirror cavity is filled with water it is indeed fog free.</li>
            <li> It is great to see when simple science can can come together with a well thought out design to meet your needs.</li>
            <li> The important part is the fogless mirror.  </li>
            <li> a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide and the handle doesn&#x27;t fit in the holder.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> However, he loved that it stayed clear even in the shower.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect, it is a little small, but can still see easily and the water resevoir to keep it from fogging is perfect.</li>
            <li> It works great... except that I had to cut out the original suction cups and force some larger ones in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it falling unless it is not applied to a smooth, clean surface, or that it is accidentally struck by the shower occupant.  </li>
            <li> After you mount it to your shower wall (clean smooth walls</li>
            <li> The resivor on the back for water keeps the mirror nice and clean, the suction cup is very strong.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to install and suction cup holds to wall really well.</li>
            <li> but the great thing about this one is you can slide it out quickly, rinse, slide back in...</li>
            <li> Really excellent, a bit small</li>
            <li> I originally saw at the \\&quot;Grooming</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product were generally quite good, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li> : ok i am bumping this up to 4 stars now -- it&#x27;s lasted and stayed in the shower since i first wrote this review, some time ago - 6 or 7 months?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed one bit.      </li>
            <li> Fix these two small issues and it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Suction cups kind of wear out and falls off the wall sometimes due to the weight of the mirror when filled with water (to avoid fogging, you need to fill the mirror with warm water).  </li>
            <li> So eventually I will have to clean the mirror with a bathroom solvent.  </li>
            <li> , never feel like I can get my face clean from the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my husband as I thought it might be easier for him to shave while he showers, not to mention the benefit of not having to clean after him every time he shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing if your shower tiles aren&#x27;t clean then the suction cups won&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good cheap solution.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t clean your mounting surface suction hold is limiting and your unit can fall.  </li>
            <li> Clean the suction cups</li>
            <li> Trying to clean the glass</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never shaved in the shower before purchasing this mirror, and now I&#x27;ll never do it at the sink again--no more irritation or razor burn, no mess, and it saves precious morning minutes.</li>
            <li> New one came, and it&#x27;s just as good as the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried poking a needle into the drip hole with very mild success, I think I may try CLR next as we have fairly \\&quot;hard\\&quot; water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have special tile, just tile.  </li>
            <li> Great suction cups keep it on the tile without slipping.  </li>
            <li> Although it functions in the way that I need it to, its pretty cheaply made and the reflection isn&#x27;t terribly precise.  </li>
            <li> Over all a good product though, the only mirror I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
            <li> the mirror (with full reservoir)</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good shower mirror, look no further.</li>
            <li> Plus, it looks cool and</li>
            <li> It goes a full shower without fogging up.</li>
            <li> again, this is a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I went from having to shave in front of the sink to being able to shave in the shower (and being that I shave my head, too, that&#x27;s really convenient).  </li>
            <li> If you hold this \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; up to a true mirror, you will see the difference.  </li>
            <li> - The design is really cool</li>
            <li> and you get a true fogless mirror.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much more about it, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pleased with the mirror and really dislike shaving without it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year - much longer than any of my previous mirrors - and it still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> have extremely hot water in a easily steamed-up bathroom and this thing does not fog a bit.  </li>
            <li> The fog-free function works fine and the wall suction does not fail on my gloss-finish tile.  </li>
            <li> , I did a lot more research and came across this simple and awesome fogless shaving mirror for half</li>
            <li> so make sure you have decent lighting in your shower area.  </li>
            <li> The mounting system is adequate, it has not fallen once in the 2 week period that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best $15 I have ever spent on amazon.</li>
            <li> Luckily that wasn&#x27;t a problem for us.</li>
            <li> In short if you are the maker of this product and would like to make it better get a spring loaded suction cup for the top and include a cleanout button for the bottom of the reservoir.</li>
            <li> My shower has a smooth fiberglass surround, which should be perfect for a suction cup to adhere to, but it kept falling, be it when it was full of water and being used, or empty and in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> and i havent found the right product to clean it</li>
            <li> You use the HOT shower water, to fill the mirror, equalizing the temperatures, keeping the mirror fog free.</li>
            <li> You put hot water in the reservoir and it stays fog free for 15 minutes, genius.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, stays fog free.  </li>
            <li> This is true of any mirror, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> You fill it up with hot water and the heat of the water keeps the mirror warm and the mirror stays clear.  </li>
            <li> : I bought a similar but superior shower mirror by ToiletTree here, and I&#x27;ve been putting the water in when I first hop in the shower.</li>
            <li> The stated 20 minute drain time is a gross exaggeration, more like 5!</li>
            <li> The top one is strong enough, so it&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> As an alternative, the mirror easily slips upward and off its mount to be filled remotely--no water spills and no trouble latching or sliding it off the mount.  </li>
            <li> This mirror works great and because of the design, requires no special coating to keep the fog away.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large size mirror and the bracketing that allows you to remove the mirror and fill with water is rather smart and elegant.</li>
            <li> When ordering the unit, be certain you have a smooth surface to stick the unit to.    </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaving mirror, except for, as you guessed it, the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> In concept, the idea of a reservoir of hot water helping to keep the mirror fog free and usable for shaving or other shower activities is a good one.  </li>
            <li> I have a clean, new, perfectly smooth shower wall (plastic) and</li>
            <li> The mirror really does stay fog free so you can see what your doing shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have a smooth shower wall and the suction cups hold very well.</li>
            <li> It really does stay fog free.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror after reading reviews for all the others that do not do very well at staying fog free.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you need to fill it with warm water and that means it gets covered in water droplets.</li>
            <li> For the price though, this can&#x27;t be beat and is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> It rarely stays fog free and the suction cups don&#x27;t stay stuck to the shower wall very well.  </li>
            <li> Setup and installation is easy and the construction is decent, too.  </li>
            <li> My issue is that I want to use the mirror for shaving in the shower, so I need to be able to see my face clearly.  </li>
            <li> However, there were enough favorable reviews plus the attractive price that convinced me to complete the purchase.</li>
            <li> The razor holder sticks out in the way, it would be nice if it could be folded back out of the way when not being used.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is really useful.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is clear and does not appear to be distorted, but it doesn&#x27;t make me look any better.</li>
            <li> :)  So far, the suction cups have held the mirror in place without falling off the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> Am I supposed to be impressed it hasn&#x27;t broken yet?  </li>
            <li> This Ace mirror is phenomenal, and it STAYS fog free for my entire shower.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a second to fill it with warm water from the shower head</li>
            <li> worth it.    </li>
            <li> the height adjustment is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to hang, easy to fill, and absolutely crystal clear!  </li>
            <li> Strong suction cups, clever easy to fill chamber that easily drops back onto the hanger, et viola!</li>
            <li> It is just the right mirror for the price</li>
            <li> (now I just remember to re-press them in every once in awhile), the anti-fog system for the mirror works well, and the razor holder fits my Merkur just right.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most ingenious idea and it actually works!  </li>
            <li> fog free mirrors couldn&#x27;t handle this or would only stay fog free for a month or two before their coating stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Low tech, low cost fogless shower mirrow that works great every time.</li>
            <li> I would say about half as good as when new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many fogless mirrors and eventually they loose their fogless feature (and I don&#x27;t clean them with Windex, etc).  </li>
            <li> So far the top cup holds the whole thing pretty well.      </li>
            <li> (And, it&#x27;s strong enough when it&#x27;s full of water.)  </li>
            <li> The fog-less part works as advertised and is much better than any other cheap fog-less mirror I ever tried.</li>
            <li> My shower is a plastic lined affair and where mirror is mounted the surface is not flat and vertical but top mounting point is offset from bottom mounting point.</li>
            <li> From the high end sharper image mirror/radio/shower light/etc models all the way down to the kohls cheapos - this one is the best because its simple, you just add the water and it will not fog.  </li>
            <li> Mirror\\&quot; is a no-frills design that does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I paired this with a [[ASIN:B000I3F91O Sangean H201 AM/FM Digital Shower Radio]] and the radio feels like a lot more product for it&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li> but it would be a much better value at $20ish or with a larger sized mirror</li>
            <li> I recently shaved off my beard and am shaving more often</li>
            <li> First, it WILL NOT stay on the wall.  </li>
            <li> Overall, really pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is crystal clear and fog free for around 10 min...</li>
            <li> More likely then not it will fall off eventually</li>
            <li> Fill it up with hot water and start shaving.  </li>
            <li> Completely fog free</li>
            <li> So first of all, I have been an Amazon member for about 10 years now, and a prime member since they introduced Prime.</li>
            <li> First of all, the delivery.</li>
            <li> The first unit I had would not stay adhered to wall ( glass or tile).      </li>
            <li> Installation was a snap and it functions exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It must be very convenient for men to shave in the shower because my boyfriend loves this mirror!</li>
            <li> First off, to all those reviewers that have said that the suction cups don&#x27;t work - maybe it&#x27;s your shower wall tiles and not the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> it works EXACTLY as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to give this mirror 5 stars but only thing keeping me away from it</li>
            <li> The heat from the hot water warms the mirror and prevents fog.  </li>
            <li> Requires you to slide the mirror unit off a suction bracket and fill with hot water.   </li>
            <li> I have bought many shower mirrors that had various means of anti fog.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and once you put the hot water in it, it does indeed become fogless.</li>
            <li> You have to fill the mirror with hot water every time you use it.</li>
            <li> First, this is not a mirror.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient!  </li>
            <li> (I use the handheld shower head) and it immediately becomes clear and fog free.  </li>
            <li> Finally. :)</li>
            <li> and you pour some hot water on the reservoir</li>
            <li> First off this mirror has *</li>
            <li> The mirror is exactly what it claims, a fogless shower mirror</li>
            <li> Evidently they are trying to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the suction cup problem</li>
            <li> You fill up a reservoir with hot water and it&#x27;ll keep the mirror fogless for 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> The hot water reservoir  reduces fog on the mirror surface quite well.  </li>
            <li> The first time was at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Worked good for a few months.</li>
            <li> Mirror is great, may be a little warped but who cares, image is great and it actually magnifies a little.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this mirror - and if this one is as good as the last, I&#x27;ll happily come back in a few years for another one...</li>
            <li> The little hole for it to drip the water is perfect so you never have to empty the water.    </li>
            <li> Also, I have a one piece, flexible plastic shower insert in my bath, and the suction cups would not stick to this at all - I ended up adding a little clear silicon caulk to the suction cups, and it has been great.  </li>
            <li> Also if you are having trouble getting it to stick to smooth surfaces, run the cups under hot water and apply liquid hand soup which helps seal the suction better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s common sense really on how it works, but it&#x27;s great that companies have adapted this idea.</li>
            <li> This is a clean fiberglass shower that I had to scrape my old mirror off to remove the suction cups.   </li>
            <li> Again, because the \\&quot;Ace Fogless\\&quot; is just a plastic cup with a mirror on the front, it is light enough that the two powerful suction cups have no problem holding it in place.</li>
            <li> Most modern razors have thicker handles, especially ones like the battery-powered Mach-3.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups work great on glass, but I can see how some users have complained that it would not stick to tile very well.</li>
            <li> The razor holder does hold most safety razors as it is flexible rubber and can bend to open to any reasonable sized razor.  </li>
            <li> Still not very clear but better.</li>
            <li> His only comment about it would be that it would be nice if it had some kind of film to protect the mirror against hard water.  </li>
            <li> The Ace mirror on the other hand is a great product with a simple design.  </li>
            <li> i get a better shave in shower and does the job for the price will see how long it lasts though</li>
            <li> I made sure the surface of my shower was clean, wetted the cups and pressed them onto the wall firmly.  </li>
            <li> This is just an update (nice to know how a product is working down the road)</li>
            <li> The drip hole to drain is nice, though the water drips down the razor when it is hanging in the razor holder.    </li>
            <li> And when you need to clean it, use whatever bathroom cleaner you normally use and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s a reliable Chevy that could easily become a Cadillac.</li>
            <li> The image in the mirror is crystal clear, stayed fog-free for as long as I needed and the option to tilt the mirror on an upward angle is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> The hot water in the reserve tank keeps the mirror fog free for the entire length of my shower.  </li>
            <li> I guess that stuff they spray on the glass to make it fogless just isn&#x27;t strong enough and/or rubs off after a while.  </li>
            <li> It certainly works, provided you don&#x27;t mind the mirror face being covered with water droplets from shower spray</li>
            <li> I chose the Ace as much on looks as I did on the overwhelmingly positive reviews I&#x27;d read.  </li>
            <li> the removable mirror was done pretty well...which puts me in complete opposite opinion of most of the reviews here.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several shower mirrors in the past, and this is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Easy to remove and fill up the reservoir behind the mirror with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> so it will save time and give me a better shave due to the hot steam.</li>
            <li> My experience, after several weeks of use, is that the mirror&#x27;s suction cup attachment system works just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if the suction cups were a little stronger</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll decide to fill the reservoir partway through a shower to clean my face and it instantly de-fogs when I add the hot water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is little products like this that you use every day that makes life fun and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It has a wide mouth at the top for filling from the shower spray and really speeds up the process of shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> --ours is smooth but it stays put for at least many weeks at a time</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again and recommend it to anyone who needs one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I read the comments too much</li>
            <li> Ok - at $29.95, I expected:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like standing within 3\\&quot; to see my whole face.  </li>
            <li> It is much lighter weight...does not stay fogless forever</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problems with the hole dripping too fast as mentioned by some.  </li>
            <li> The whole product is still intact.</li>
            <li> Pros: Doesn&#x27;t really fog up    Cons:</li>
            <li> My whole face is viewable and it seems to magnify a bit also.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very hopeful as I was buying this for my husband.</li>
            <li> The reviews were so very helpful.</li>
            <li> it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> Suction cups are okay if you apply them carefully; once every month or so I notice one of them has come off.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> but it gets very foggy.  </li>
            <li> suction cup things that work really</li>
            <li> This one really works.  </li>
            <li> As with all suction cups, make sure they&#x27;re wet before sticking them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t want to work so much with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much difference that would make, if any.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done much testing,</li>
            <li> It will stay, but I don&#x27;t trust it that much.  </li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t design much in the way of an eyelet or hook so it can be hung.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mirror for about 3 weeks and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well finished and works very well.</li>
            <li> This stays fog free during the entire shower.</li>
            <li> They really stink.    </li>
            <li> I spent the better</li>
            <li> My shower head covers the whole front of the mirror with water droplets while filling the reservoir (as I imagine anyone&#x27;s would)</li>
            <li> This one really does.  </li>
            <li> That worked really well</li>
            <li> AND the wall REALLY</li>
            <li> This model from Ace actually stays fog free.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use that much anyway</li>
            <li> Really impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So all in all this unit works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower--and this mirror works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li> Z&#x27;Fogless\\&quot; was that the whole contraption was way heavier than the suction cups could deal with, and spent more time on the bottom of the tub then sticking to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> You simply fill the reservoir on the back of the mirror with warm water and the fog is history.  </li>
            <li> So it could be soap scum that&#x27;s keeping some from a good adhesion.  </li>
            <li> This fogless shower mirror works great, but it does fall off sometimes, and the suction cups do not work very well, I&#x27;m guessing poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a simple, effective solution.</li>
            <li> After you fill it with water the mirror will stay fogless for a good 10 minutes as the water slowly drips out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Filling it with water is an easy, minor chore.</li>
            <li> The unit is fog free (as you put hot water in the mirror basket, which slowly drips out, leaving a fog free mirror surface...</li>
            <li> just as has been stated by so many other favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> Bought this recently as a replacement for the original I had.  </li>
            <li> it works fine the way it is, but a little bigger would have been better.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, not more than many of the mirrors made of metal and which have to be immersed in water.  </li>
            <li> mirror doesnt fog up at all, however it does get water marks pretty easily, which is understandable, just need to wipe down with a tissue every now and then</li>
            <li> You fill it with hot water from your shower and it stays clear and drains itself when you are through.</li>
            <li> Also some have said the fog free effect lasts a long time once you fill it--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is a problem with Ace or with all suction cups on that kind of tile.  </li>
            <li> You have to apply it to a clean, flat surface.  </li>
            <li> you want it to stick to your bathroom tile, you need to scrub and clean the tile back until it&#x27;s like new, then with the force of the hulk, after puny humans try to stop him, mash it to the wall.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use (fill with water and empty).  </li>
            <li> Easy and absolutely no fog, had it for a month now.</li>
            <li> Have tried many fog less mirrors for shaving in the shower and none have done the job</li>
            <li> Mirror is a decent size</li>
            <li> There are are two main problems with the design:     </li>
            <li> and that is its main purpose.  </li>
            <li> (The fog free coating wore off and it was more of a fuzzy, younger looking me in my old mirror - good for your ego, bad for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> An expensive one that attaches above the shower head and has water flowing was best before this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount of fog free time is limited</li>
            <li> Based on the help from the company and the redesigned product I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a high grade mirror.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like shaving and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and so far, he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance and was relieved to find out that the arms of the razor holder are flexible and can expand to fit a wide range of razor</li>
            <li> took a couple times getting it secured to my shower wall well enough to hold on consistently (although i think that was on me for not cleaning the surface very well beforehand).  </li>
            <li> Seems smaller than I expected from just glancing at the online pictures, but its size is good enough for a shave.  </li>
            <li> these suction cups are not smooth on the underside like most cups you see</li>
            <li> On the box it says sticks to tile and glass, so I don&#x27;t know if I can blame the manufacturer, but other suction cups seem to work fine in my shower.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and simple to fill with a hand-held shower.  </li>
            <li> The entire idea of a fogless mirror is to not fog up in the shower right?</li>
            <li> The suction cups are the same as every suction up in the world, meaning they stick to the wall pretty well as long as the wall is clean when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I used a Bicycle spoke (stainless steel) and bent it into a large U to go around the suction cup mount and and then bent two u shaped hooks on the open ends</li>
            <li> And the little hole in the bottom means the water will drop out on its own after a short while.    </li>
            <li> Having bought, then thrown away many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in past years, I did not have high expectations for this one either.</li>
            <li> A few people complained about the suction cups not working very good</li>
            <li> If I ever need a new mirror, however, I will buy this again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> If/when this breaks, I will buy a new one.</li>
            <li> brand new again.  </li>
            <li> This means that if you forget to empty it, it will empty on its own.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you really wanted the back-lighting or if you wanted a radio, but the design is simple and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It works GREAT, the concept behind is so simple!  </li>
            <li> i didnt care too much about the suction cups because i was ready to put double sided tape on it</li>
            <li> (Nylon &amp; Stainless steel line about 6 inches long) Hooked it around the top suction cup and put a tiny nail in the wall above the shower  wall surround.</li>
            <li> While the mirrors that hook directly into the shower head work as well, they are too high for up for me</li>
            <li> It stays on my shower wall as the suction cups are strong enough as long as the surface is smoothe.  </li>
            <li> the mirror is well-made, crystal clear mirror, and works as promised!</li>
            <li> At first the suction cups didn&#x27;t hold, but now they are stuck on and have been for several weeks with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and it definitely works as advertised!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I put water in the back and put it on the suction cups and within a minute it fell onto my toe.</li>
            <li> I said, a novel concept for a fogless shower mirror to actually be fogless, but this one really works!  </li>
            <li> This is the first fogless mirror that actually works!  </li>
            <li> several times first day I got it.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as promised, and after a couple of months of daily use it still works.</li>
            <li> and I have more than enough water left in the back when i&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> The first two fell short of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for the past month now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> it has a reservoir to put hot water in back of mirror that lets drops of it out automatically</li>
            <li> Let face it, unless your willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a radio that is water proof totally, you may as well forget all the gimmicks and buy this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Other than that very small problem, this mirror is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but the mirror, which isn&#x27;t that big) is the first completely fogless mirror I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The razor holder is kind of small, but not to big of a deal.</li>
            <li> It has a sound scientific principle; by filling the little well in back with hot water it neutralizes the steamy atmosphere.  </li>
            <li> I found one other mirror like this, with the reservoir on the back for warm water, but it mounted permanently with glue, and since I just spent a ton of money putting in a brand new shower stall in my new bathroom, I wasn&#x27;t about to go gluing stuff to the wall.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups stay stuck to the wall, the mirror is large enough and stays fog-free for the duration of my shave, and it conveniently drains itself.</li>
            <li> i figured id try sticking it to the large mirror over my sink, same results!</li>
            <li> By your next shower it is dry and ready to be filled for your next shave.  </li>
            <li> Fill up the hollow with hot water from the shower and there&#x27;s no fog!  </li>
            <li> This is long enough for me as I am a clean shaved person.</li>
            <li> and it stays crystal clear.</li>
            <li> and I can see my face clearly at 3 feet away.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as clear as i&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I had a perfectly clear mirror in about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li> The Ace works well and provides a clear shaving mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog.    </li>
            <li> I generally just hold the mirror, which is lightweight, and that works fine, if slightly less convenient.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep it clear of water though, so you need to wipe it off as you shave.  </li>
            <li> to try to maintain a clear mirror.</li>
            <li> mirror itself is absolutely fogless when used properly.  </li>
            <li> but I thought this mirror was supposed to be fogless naturally.  </li>
            <li> and this mirror has served me well so far.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing to say about this items anti-fogging ability, because it flunked-out before I could get that far.</li>
            <li> So far it has been about to get the job done</li>
            <li> The suction cups have worked well so far.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m keeping my old mirror just to hang it on.</li>
            <li> This mirror does not fog up unless you breath directly on it while in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror is completely fogged over.  </li>
            <li> Finally found a shower mirror that really works.  </li>
            <li> It has a small reservoir on the back of the mirror you fill with hot water and it gives you 20-25 minutes of fog free use.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my face and head in the shower for nearly 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I have had 0 issues with this product so far and would recommend it to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
            <li> It has served me well for over 1 year so far, but that is where my satisfaction has ended.</li>
            <li> The one shower mirror that used to work as well was the one from Sharper Image that attaches directly to the shower head.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who \\&quot;has it all\\&quot; but complained about never being able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> My old shower mirror did not have that feature</li>
            <li> so you have to be conscious of when you fill the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> It barely stays up when empty, and its holding power is pushed to the limit when full.</li>
            <li> He is usually skeptical when it comes to the gadgets of this kind, but he loves this one and he says it works really well.</li>
            <li> My old favorite was a hand-held rectangular mirror that I&#x27;d purchased at a local thrift store and hung on the tile surface of my shower with one of those peel-and-stick hooks you get at the local big box store.  </li>
            <li> It drains slowly over time, so eventually you start getting fog again near the top of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> there is no problem when it&#x27;s full with water, it doesn&#x27;t come crashing down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and not very large, smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Well, only because I live in New York City, was this a major pain.</li>
            <li> : About 6 months in, the water doesn&#x27;t always drip out from the mirror, so make sure you are aware it might be full of cold water (relatively) when you go to refill it for its next use.</li>
            <li> The mirror has a reservoir on the back that you fill up with hot water from the shower head before you take a shower, and because the temperature is maintained between the front and back of the mirror it doesn&#x27;t fog.  </li>
            <li> There is not really any kind of magnification, it looks like it because you will probably be standing 6 inches from the mirror, and because it is small.</li>
            <li> At first I could shake it and it would drain again, but those fixes only lasted a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mirror was becoming harder and harder to see in.  </li>
            <li> The first one of these mirrors that I bought lasted about 2 years, the only reason it needed to be replaced by #2 is it fell (for the 3rd time) and broke a bit.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light on it</li>
            <li> Simply put for the price, functionality, and performance, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Given the price I would expect the mirror to be larger, but on the positive it is actually fogless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and light.  </li>
            <li> Primarily because my past purchases have been on products that coat the mirror with something that wears off after 3-6 months (planned obsolescence).  </li>
            <li> You could fill the mirror when you first get in the shower, but it seems to me that by the end of the shower, especially if it&#x27;s a long one, the water in the mirror would be cooler than the shower.</li>
            <li> Con&#x27;s...  - When you fill the reservoir (with hot water) the little hole in the bottom that allows water to escape will get clogged if you have a high mineral content in you water.</li>
            <li> Also, while it appears that the razor holder doesnt hold Mach brand razors, just peel the prong back a little and it will fit.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ve had issues with the mirror falling down too, but again, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the suction cups also need to be kept clean in order to maintain their adhesion.  </li>
            <li> The idea is simple enough, fill a reservoir behind the mirror with hot water, and like magic, it prevents the mirror from fogging.  </li>
            <li> In the time that I&#x27;ve owned it it has only come loose a hand full of time and likely because I&#x27;ve bumped it.</li>
            <li> The only possible issue I might have with this item is that the water drips out a tad too fast for me....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little shaver holder plastic piece falls off easily but for me that is a minor detail, I don&#x27;t use it anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started shaving in the shower recently as I was making a mess of the sink and never wanted to clean it up.  </li>
            <li> Worked well, but the rather stiff gooseneck mount made it somewhat difficult to position the mirror in an ideal location while showering/shaving.</li>
            <li> is enough to keep it clear.</li>
            <li> I fill the reservoir with water from the shower and it remains fog free for the entire time I&#x27;m in there; usually 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Lick &amp; stick the suction cup on the wall, fill the body with water, instantly the mirror is clear and stays that way.</li>
            <li> The fogless image is clear, the operation simple.    </li>
            <li> Since I have a marble tile shower, the one \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; I made was applying two squares of clear packing tape to the tile so that the suction cups adhere solidly.</li>
            <li> This one, with the water in the back, stays clear.  </li>
            <li> But a simple clear silicon sealant used as a glue solved that.    </li>
            <li> Just fill with water and the mirror remains clear for the entire length of your shower.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is an open and shut case.  </li>
            <li> This thing barely functions as a mirror without the fog.  </li>
            <li> But the razor holder barely holds the razor.  </li>
            <li> They barely even stay connected to the porcelain on the bath tub itself.</li>
            <li> The Ace Fogless Mirror is - so far - a big improvement.</li>
            <li> The only complaints I have are that it is pretty small, and the suction cups don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> It barely fits some of the my disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> They barely hold the apparatus up.</li>
            <li> It drains so fast I&#x27;m tempted to fill the hole used to drain closed and then just dump the water in the reservoir out when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it offers no mounting solution except for suction cups, which don&#x27;t work on my textured tile.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t break it (although my mirror became distorted somehow and now reflects my face in a weird and somewhat amusing way) , but I don&#x27;t like bouncing around any of the razor blades I rub against my face.</li>
            <li> I have a thick Merkur HD razor, so it won&#x27;t fit on the bottom holder.  </li>
            <li> This gives up to 15 minutes of fog free viewing as the water slowly drips out the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I emailed Ace (Goody) asking them for a new base, but got some stock email reply about their great hair care products and a promise to send my comments to engineering team.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to shave in the shower without having to splash water onto the mirror continually so that you can actually see your face and not end up a bloody mess by the end of it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors over the years, most of them start off fine but within a few months the anti-fog coating has worn off and the mirrors become useless.</li>
            <li> The little holder, despite what people in other reviews say, holds the MACH 3 razors just fine.</li>
            <li> Simple, low priced, compact, easy to install (I cheated and used silicon glue on the suckers).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving creams, after shave lotions, etc were not enough to prevent the redness and puffiness that were the inevitable result of shaving.</li>
            <li> There is even a clever drip hole on the bottom of the reservoir which allows it to empty over time.    </li>
            <li> noticed that most people complain about the suction cups, but I suspect that they either have a poor surface to place it on or just not cleaning or applying it properly.</li>
            <li> It looks like a funhouse mirror which makes it difficult to shave accurately if you need to make some sharp lines for a goatee or sweet mustache.  </li>
            <li> Just a little hot water before you shave</li>
            <li> As the listing and other reviews state, the removable mirror has an open chamber in the back which you fill with hot water.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how effective this concept was, and it works much better than the standard fogless mirrors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> and that is the only drawback, but the reservoir is drained by a small hole, just enough time to shave and clean up any missed spots.  </li>
            <li> This is especially perplexing if when you step in a nice hot shower and pull up on the reservoir to remove it, it breaks loose and freezing cold water (in comparison) splashes on your nether region causing instant paralysis and screams of terror.    </li>
            <li> Every attempt to roto-rooter out the pin sized drain hole has failed and even Super Glue has not adhered the razor holder back in place because it is too smooth and is always wet.    </li>
            <li> I take long showers, but the mirror stays clear, so that&#x27;s the answer to SOFTWARE #2</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower (after my facial hairs had become soft and whatnot) was the only viable solution, and rubbing my face was the only way of detecting where the razor needed to be applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one small issue is that I wish the mirror secured a bit more tightly to the backing which suctions to the shower wall or whatever surface.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this from the beginning b/c when you have a face full of suds with your eyes closed; the suction cups lose their grip and the entire unit crashes down on the shower floor, you will stop singing that joyful tune.      </li>
            <li> Mirror easily detaches for quick filling, and has small drain hole that slowly drains empty.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to clean the soap scum off periodically, but that&#x27;s no design flaw, simply the cost of keeping something in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and/or having to wipe the whole thing down before use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have an alternative for you, but if you are looking for a high quality mirror that is truly fog free, I was look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> After reading a few positive reviews on the website and having to need to purchase another item - I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.      </li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower is just part of my shower routine and besides - it means one less time I have to clean the frak&#x27;ing little hairs out of my sink.    </li>
            <li> With the water droplets plus the poor refective capabilities, it is hard to get a good shave with this item.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you forget to empty the chamber after shower because there is a tiny opening on the bottom to drain the water very slowly.</li>
            <li> Some other negative posters have mentioned the suction cups aren&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say \\&quot;bad mirror, decent mount\\&quot; while most are sayingthe opposite.    </li>
            <li> I occasionally have trouble keeping the suction cups mounted on the wall, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected after constant exposure to hot showers.</li>
            <li> The mirror has a habit of falling down periodically, but thankfully, usually not when actually using it.  </li>
            <li> Aside from a little soap scum that was easily cleaned off this weekend, this thing is still crystal clear even with the bathroom door closed and</li>
            <li> I knocked a star off because the mirror is large enough to use but feels uncomfortably small.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the suction cups, which don&#x27;t suck very much, which sucks.  </li>
            <li> real complaint is that the razor holder doesn&#x27;t really hold the gillette fusion very well</li>
            <li> Then I intentionally left it alone after installation to see how long it would last.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long lasting low maintainance mirror this one is it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s small enough to keep the hot water for fogless use but enough for water to drip out if you forget to empty it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also a very sturdy mirror--the suction cup has dropped a few times but the mirror is still reflective and intact!</li>
            <li> If fed hot water beforehand, it remains fogless for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fog up at all as long as the water is in the back.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This cleared the mirror up for long enough for me to shave.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s almost like a flat cup) from the suction cup part</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed in this mirror after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The water slowly drips out the back, which is good to avoid stale water in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, the minerals in the water adhere to the mirror, you clean it, and voila - no more fogless coating.  </li>
            <li> Razor slot is soft rubber allowing you to push razor in rather than slide handle down.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer I have tried other shower mirrors and after a while I had to resort to putting a thin film of soap on them to keep them relatively fog free.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to fill it up completely with water half or even 1/3</li>
            <li> I understand though that glass would be dangerous in the shower and plus that would make the mirror heavier and more likely to fall.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Water spots on the mirror</li>
            <li> It is a non-flexible circular enclosure that is only wide enough to hold a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Actually the two times it did fall it was empty, so it definitely can hold the water.  </li>
            <li> but it was expensive and now my new shower is located higher up thus making it infeasible.  </li>
            <li> The ACE may not be as pretty or fancy looking as the others, but at least it works 100% every single time.  </li>
            <li> other (more expensive)</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off the top suction cup and using a ratcheting type suction cup with a hook to make it work.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried this one, it failed completely.  </li>
            <li> The actual mirror (reflective surface) is about 6\\&quot; x 4.5\\&quot; at the center cross-section.    </li>
            <li> They work, but not for long.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m long gone before the thing finishes draining.</li>
            <li> I have to manually empty the water reservoir after each use, which isn&#x27;t that big a deal.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned it was a waste of money and a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I was tired of putting soap or shampoo on my old \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror every time to try to make it just clear enough to make out the outline of my face.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re carefully filling it from a faucet or tub spout beforehand, you&#x27;re likely planning to use the shower head to fill it.  </li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, being as it costs about the same as my previous one, but had a different look about it.</li>
            <li> The idea of putting heated water right behind the mirror is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror in place for the better part of the year now and while I was originally disappointed that it seemed to be losing its \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; capabilities, which other negative reviewers have also mentioned, I found the solution that restored it to its original capabilities.  </li>
            <li> (more expensive models include a little squeegee to wipe those off).</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that it sometimes falls off the wall due to fact that the suction cups can&#x27;t support the weight.</li>
            <li> Big enough for me to see my face, small enough not to take up alot of wall space.  </li>
            <li> I have seen other reviewers say the same thing.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is, I wish it were just a little bigger -</li>
            <li> I suspect the reason could be because I took some Windex and throughly scrubbed, then dry buffed the area, then dampened the suction cups with water, and my shower is fiberglass, not tile or glass.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive, worked great for a while, but broke way too soon for something that expensive.  </li>
            <li> Second, the razor holder will not fit any standard size razor.</li>
            <li> Although I initially had trouble with it sticking to the wall - which was overcome by adding some dish soap detergent suds to the 2 suction cups, the actual fogless mirror concept \\&quot;technology\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Mirror worked great, but the suction cups on the base of mine would only hold for a few hours, then the mirror would come crashing down.</li>
            <li> It falls off my wall every single time.      </li>
            <li> I keep a small sponge in the shower to squeegee off the water droplets, and am rewarded with a crystal clear reflexion; which can be a shock in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the mirror is not as big as I expected, but this again was not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> The concept of the Ace is to fill a reservoir behind the mirror with hot water from your shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it fall or come loose from my ceramic tile wall.</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;ll take it off and clean behind it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Some day I&#x27;m going to track down a tiny squeegee to put in the holder at the bottom....</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the water drips down the handle of the razor in the holder.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the razor holder is too small to hold a Gillette Fusion, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> but then again all that extra weight might make the suction cups fail ;]</li>
            <li> The fogless mirror I have used for the past 10 years finally died, so I looked for a moderately priced replacement.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is also small enough to be carried with you when you&#x27;re traveling, which I am looking forward to doing next month.    </li>
            <li> (Just because I tried it dry and wet) none worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mirrors in the past, and this one actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am rating this a 4 stars instead of 5 is because the water runs through in less than 20 minutes, so you have to fill it up again in the shower.  </li>
            <li> You fill a reservoir behind the mirror with warm water when you start shaving and that keeps the outside temp the same as the temp behind the mirror meaning it cannot fog!!  </li>
            <li> I just got the mirror today, opened the box and to my surprise was a tiny little mirror.</li>
            <li> The suction cups could be a little larger, but have had no problems with it adhering to the plastic surround in my shower.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally it slides a little bit, but has never fallen off.    </li>
            <li> Could do with being a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The little razor holder finally broke off</li>
            <li> /&gt;After cleaning with lemon juice to remove mineral deposits, I got a little functionality back.</li>
            <li> As far as the mirror fogging up as some have complained, I have had NONE of this.</li>
            <li> The science behind this product works very well.  </li>
            <li> but it may not fit some larger razors.      </li>
            <li> I did wet the suction cups before attaching to the shower wall.</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s not real glass.</li>
            <li> I washed the wall, washed the cups, wet them both and pressed on the mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is maybe 4 inches wide by 8 inches tall.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t see the dimensions of the mirror listed, it&#x27;s roughly 4 1/2\\&quot;</li>
            <li> wide and 7 1/4\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> - The suction cups are minimally rated.</li>
            <li> The drain in the bottom also allows for minimal maintainance so mold or mildew is not an issue.</li>
            <li> received this mirror a couple of days ago and wet the cups to stick it to the tile and within 30 seconds both suction cups released and the the mirror fell off, so</li>
            <li> It even had drain hole to empty water out of cavity after a while.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> The tile in my shower is rough and it did not stick there.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> The mirror isn&#x27;t glass, so it&#x27;s not completely straight, but it doesn&#x27;t affect shaving at all.   </li>
            <li> so there is no need to empty it.  </li>
            <li> With the Zadro, I would spray the mirror after I got in the shower (not the night before); it would wet the mirror and keep it from fogging.  </li>
            <li> The only thing he didnt like was that the razor holder did not fit his razor.</li>
            <li> The small hole in the bottom of the mirror allows the hot water to heat the mirror and then drain slowly so you don&#x27;t have to do it manually.  </li>
            <li> My only two complaints would be the size (it is a little small) and the razor holder is too small for a normal Mach 3 razor.    </li>
            <li> I took extra care before installing the mirror (selecting a flat surface and cleaning soap scum &amp; dirt) and you should too.</li>
            <li> Inevitably, every few weeks that suction cup fails, and the entire assembly falls off the shower wall with a loud clatter.</li>
            <li> I do live in an area with very hard water, though.</li>
            <li> One fogged after about a month and the other never stuck to the shower walls and fell and broke.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much useless.  </li>
            <li> Other mirrors I have purchased would work for a while</li>
            <li> more so for big ticket items but for random items that are questionable like a \\&quot;fogless mirror\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have shaved in the shower for past 30 years and have gone through dozens of \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors which last about 6 months before they start fogging or getting gunked up as the coating</li>
            <li> Hear other reviewers had problems with it sticking to tile.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this mirror is that the razor holder is somewhat small.    </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product seems to work as advertized.</li>
            <li> All other suction cups work... just not these.</li>
            <li> Its small, enough said.</li>
            <li> Amazon reviews, other reviews -</li>
            <li> However, I am used to pushing it against the wall every now and then, because other mirrors that I&#x27;ve owned have fallen off unless I repeatedly re-secure the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> Fogless shower mirror/ radios and other stand-alone shower mirrors.</li>
            <li> I have a glass wall and it sticks extremely well.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I just ordered another one for the other bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other fogless mirrors with no luck.</li>
            <li> The only fault that I found was that it was not able to hold my Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary of placing my order after reading several reviews that complain that the mirror will not remain fixed to the wall.</li>
            <li> Only issue I had was the tiny hole that drains got clogged but a thin wire cleared it out.  </li>
            <li> By filling the reservoir behind the mirror with shower-temperature water, the mirror warms up almost instantly, and fog simply never forms.</li>
            <li> When the water slowly drips out of the mirror, it runs down the razor and directly into the tub-not down the wall!</li>
            <li> Again, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor problem with the \\&quot;Ace Fogless\\&quot; is that the small attachment to hold a razor in the front is two small.  </li>
            <li> and my choice came down to this Ace mirror and one other.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried some Lime-Away, which removes mineral deposits left from hard water.  </li>
            <li> Fixes solidly to wall of shower with two suckers.  </li>
            <li> (Has fallen twice in the past few months, but the water was left in the tank</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that the suction cups won&#x27;t work on all surfaces.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 6 Months now and the only complaint I might have had would have been the suction cups (which I did not even try)</li>
            <li> The base hasn&#x27;t moved in the 2 months that I&#x27;ve had this product even after pulling the mirror off it many times to fill it with water.  </li>
            <li> gripe is that occasionally the pin hole at the bottom where the water slowly drips out becomes clogged.</li>
            <li> It has fallen down on me a couple of times (but not broken) because the suction cups failed.  </li>
            <li> I have used the expensive ones, and they did not last half this long or even stay fogless or adhere to the wall as long as this version has.</li>
            <li> It has gotten to the point that I put it up and take it down with each use.  </li>
            <li> The mirror tilt is adjustable so one can comb one&#x27;s hair, then pivot down to focus on the beard for shaving.  </li>
            <li> The mirror has not come crashing down.</li>
            <li> that, when i just connected it out of the box, it fell down every two hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just take the mirror down when not in use and leave the holder on the wall 24/7.</li>
            <li> The mirror will stay up for a while, but at some point it will come crashing down.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I take the mirror down is that it gets clogged and won&#x27;t drain.</li>
            <li> or so I have to take it down and reapply it the wall.  </li>
            <li> and it has slipped down to the bottom of the shower or fallen off four times.</li>
            <li> I have seen the reviews saying that it falls down.  </li>
            <li> TRY WETTING DOWN THE SUCTION CUPS, THEN RUB HAND SOAP OR EVEN HAIR GEL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total failure in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After being thoroughly disappointed with the more technically advanced and thus worthless [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> These are far too wide to stick into the holder making it a useless decoration.</li>
            <li> However, I am not going to downgrade the product for this slight matter.    </li>
            <li> &gt;shave in the shower when the beard is its softest (less aftershave bumps, smoother shave)  </li>
            <li> Less mess/clean up    </li>
            <li> Smoother shave/face, less \\&quot;bathroom time\\&quot;, and less shaving cream everywhere.</li>
            <li> Previously I would shave in the shower by touch alone.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe there is anything on it that can rust like our previous ones.</li>
            <li> I have bought COUNTLESS number of fogless mirrors, some at ridiculously expensive prices (especially at bedbathandbeyond)that</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to fumble with the suction cups while you may be half asleep in the morning.</li>
            <li> Mine does not; the tile has a slightly sandy, dimpled surface that does NOT work with the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a quick shower taker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and it works as well as those that attach to the shower for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than a week and the suction cups gave way causing the mirror to fall.</li>
            <li> I have been using show mirrors for the last 20 years and most of them are horrible.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought my husband a clock radio with a mirror for the shower.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shatter, but it was leaking slightly</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this mirror, with the caveat you need a viable plan B if the suction cups fail in their calling.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to mess with the suction cups</li>
            <li> My bathroom is always cold and my showers always hot.  </li>
            <li> only real complaint: the razor holder is located where the water drains from the reservoir, so if you put a razor in the holder it will get (or remain) wet for some time.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving in the sh.ower everyday alot less hasle</li>
            <li> After falling a few times, the mirror slightly cracked in the bottom corner, but never shattered.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill since the mirror/cup lifts off the base.  </li>
            <li> My Mach # razor fits with a little prompting, but no issues.  </li>
            <li> well, maybe for a little while, sort of.  </li>
            <li> A little bulky for my toiletry bag</li>
            <li> The little reservoir is genius.  </li>
            <li> only areas for improvement I can think of are that it could be a little bit bigger and the apparatus to hold the razor is pretty pathetic.  </li>
            <li> It also feels flimsy, so much so that I&#x27;m afraid it might eventually break off.  </li>
            <li> but once water is placed in the mirror it will fall off the wall in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So i tried cleaning the area behind the suction cups with some soap and that helped and it didn&#x27;t fall the second time.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review, even though I purchase a few items every week.</li>
            <li> I wanted a fogless mirror for a few reasons:  </li>
            <li> It uses water in the resevoir to keep the mirror unfogged and this concept will not wear out after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few fogless mirrors before I bought this one</li>
            <li> and if you are having trouble it&#x27;s user error (either a unsuitable surface</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my partner who&#x27;s always shaving in the shower and always missing spots.</li>
            <li> My tile grout  and uneven surface in my tile design didn&#x27;t hold the suctions cups.  </li>
            <li> when you shower is to soak the wall where you want to hand it, then soak the suction cups and firmly put in place.</li>
            <li> The suction cup doesn&#x27;t work with my shower tile, falls within few minutes.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve encountered is after a few uses, the drain hole clogged up.</li>
            <li> Well, quite a few times.</li>
            <li> A few comments:    </li>
            <li> It has an open resevoir behind the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on those; after owning two of them, I can say definitively that they don&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> there are some things missing / design flaws that need to be addressed.   </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes the mirror fogged up and fell on the floor.  </li>
            <li> A few hours after each shower I&#x27;d hear it fall and bounce around in the tub.    </li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of money, time and plastic.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a few weeks before I made my decision.</li>
            <li> Every month or so the drain hole will get plugged, but takes just a few seconds to remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tape is hardly visible, and allows the suction cups to maintain contact on marble or other uncooperative tile surfaces.</li>
            <li> My shower stall is very slightly bevelled.</li>
            <li> I lost the base between moves but it lasted me 4 years before I had to finally order this new one.</li>
            <li> only problem I have had with this mirror is that the suction cups work very poorly (i.e. not at all), but this i attribute to the fact that the walls of my shower are (ever so slightly) textured.</li>
            <li> The water in my house is on the hard side and any mirror I have had previously gets some build up on it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty irritating when it happens in the middle of the night, leading one to believe that a violent prowler has entered their home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 6 or 7 other fogless mirrors that have all ultimately ended with disappointment, I don&#x27;t think this can be beaten.</li>
            <li> They even thought about putting a little hole at the bottom of the mirror that slowly lets the water out.  </li>
            <li> You put hot water in a little dispenser attached as a base to the mirror and it prevents fogging while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but since they have small pores in them the suction cups won&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> Now instead of a small opening on the bottom, there is a crack where water is leaking out faster than it should.</li>
            <li> A bit small and no magnification,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small, but that depends on your standards and needs.</li>
            <li> As advertised, the mirror has a small hole at the bottom to drain the water out.</li>
            <li> I have tried putting a film of petrolatum-based gel on the inner surface of the working suction cup to improve its seal, but it still fails after awhile.</li>
            <li> mirror that I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried duplicating this once, but came to the same unfortunate ending.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the cups are too small or what the issue is -</li>
            <li> , my shave usually takes 10minutes</li>
            <li> My only con would be the razor holder is useless as it&#x27;s way too small.</li>
            <li> I like the small size.  </li>
            <li> I will let you know if they fail to hold later on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i still gave this 4 stars because im not entirely sure what happened to the glass</li>
            <li> Too bad had high hopes for it too.</li>
            <li> Clip/hook for the shaver came off after a few days, weak glue.</li>
            <li> Without building into the wall with a heating system, it&#x27;s just hard to accomplish.  </li>
            <li> Pros -  doesn&#x27;t fog up (at least it hasn&#x27;t yet)  </li>
            <li> at least - then finish my shower.  </li>
            <li> The mirror fell off my wall at least 3 times a month, under the weight of the water inside the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Loses suction.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about emptying the reservoir, because it has a slow drip out the bottom that empties the mirror in about twenty minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it self drains slowly</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t just slide it in if razor handle is thick.</li>
            <li> It has a hole at the bottom that slowly drips the water out.  </li>
            <li> It slowly drips and it is still dripping after I step out.</li>
            <li> This mirror was one of the least expensive mirrors I have purchased and it has definately out-performed even the $50 dollar mirrors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless fogless mirrors and ended up disappointed with them all.  </li>
            <li> the suction cups are so weak that they won&#x27;t hold the mirror onto the smoothest of surfaces.     </li>
            <li> At first I thought this mirror was terrible.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are too weak.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I will use it during a shower and it will fall down and shatter on the floor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fog too much but the suction cups that come with this thing are awful.  </li>
            <li> The product is poorly made.  </li>
            <li> My last one was from Sharper Image and was just as worthless as all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> And it also happens to be the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> Hubby not happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you they did something wrong.</li>
            <li> I pull it off of the base, fill it with water, and by the time I have re-situated it on the base, it&#x27;s already beginning to clear up.  </li>
            <li> Now the mirror doesn&#x27;t hold water at all and is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the suction does not work because the tiles in our shower are textured.</li>
            <li> The suction cups on the other hand are terrible.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be as dangerous if it shatters  up/down</li>
            <li> However, this mirror, at least for me, has failed miserably.    </li>
            <li> And leaves the razor hanging exposed in a dangerous way: don&#x27;t hit your elbow while shampooing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> maybe its just dirty</li>
            <li> I mean these things are so bad it wont even hold up the base...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely useless!    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but lo and behold, it works!  </li>
            <li> Wrong!      </li>
            <li> if it weren&#x27;t for the piece of crap suction cups this little mirror wouldn&#x27;t be that bad, but until they fix the problem DON&#x27;T BUY this piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> splash will get on the mirror and be almost as bad as fog.    </li>
            <li> The mirror itself is not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll take some time to go bad (as all of them do).</li>
            <li> My mirror does not fog, but the water beads up and sticks on the surface of the mirror making the viewing terribly distorted and virtually useless for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> FOR ALL YOU IDIOTS GIVING BAD REVIEWS....</li>
            <li> I ended-up drilling the base into my shower wall using a couple of anchor screws</li>
            <li> (the mirror removes from the base to fill with water).  </li>
            <li> For years I shaved with electric because I wanted to avoid razor burn and hate shaving AFTER my shower</li>
            <li> This mirror is crap.  </li>
            <li> but they are worthless to us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY - this thing is terrible - fogs up immediately - suction cup does not work - literally no reason to buy this thing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It does fog up like all others under 30 dollars but I still use it. Just throw some water on it then I can see again... Again you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> The mirror really does stay fog free so you can see what your doing shaving in the shower. You don&#x27;t even need to fill it up completely with water half or even 1/3 is enough to keep it clear.The only bummer is the suction cups. They will not, I repeat will not keep it on the wall. You are going to have to glue it to the wall or hang it with a nail and some cord - or both. I used a fishing line leader. (Nylon &amp; Stainless steel line about 6 inches long) Hooked it around the top suction cup and put a tiny nail in the wall above the shower  wall surround. Then I used a dab of adhesive calk on suction cups and the Corian shower wall I have. My razor fits fine in the holder.When the water slowly drips out of the mirror, it runs down the razor and directly into the tub-not down the wall! This is a winner. Ive tried 4 or 5 over a 10 year span and this is the best. Couldn&#x27;t find it locally anywhere so I bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/3/2010 This is just an update (nice to know how a product is working down the road) It is still working great and no problems except what I mentioned above about securing to the wall. I would buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaving mirror, except for, as you guessed it, the suction cups.  I have a clean, new, perfectly smooth shower wall (plastic) and the suction cups just won&#x27;t hold.  Fortunately, I have a basket on the shower head arm where it fits perfectly and works as intended.  It has a wide mouth at the top for filling from the shower spray and really speeds up the process of shaving in the shower.  So I highly recommend this mirror, with the caveat you need a viable plan B if the suction cups fail in their calling.</li>
            <li> Holds my razor and does not fog up.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is an open and shut case.  The only possible issue I might have with this item is that the water drips out a tad too fast for me....but it takes about two seconds to refill so it&#x27;s not a big deal. The water in my house is on the hard side and any mirror I have had previously gets some build up on it.  So eventually I will have to clean the mirror with a bathroom solvent.  It is my hopes that because this mirror uses the warmness of the water to prevent fogging that it will not be affected.  I&#x27;ll let you know if I run into any issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this shower mirror. The suction cups stay stuck to the wall, the mirror is large enough and stays fog-free for the duration of my shave, and it conveniently drains itself. I&#x27;d never shaved in the shower before purchasing this mirror, and now I&#x27;ll never do it at the sink again--no more irritation or razor burn, no mess, and it saves precious morning minutes. The only problem is that the razor holder is too small to hold a Gillette Fusion, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. All in all, a decent price for a great mirror.</li>
            <li> I have tried prolly 5 fogless shower mirrors in the shower over the years. This one is the best out of all of them. I have had the one that attaches to your shower and uses water this one is way better. Just a little hot water before you shave and it stays crystal clear. Suction works great !</li>
            <li> After being thoroughly disappointed with the more technically advanced and thus worthless [[ASIN:B000UZH1E8 Zadro Z&#x27;Fogless Lighted Shaving Mirror]], I did a lot more research and came across this simple and awesome fogless shaving mirror for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Ace Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; is a no-frills design that does exactly what it is supposed to.  The technology involved is fool proof.  The mirror has a reservoir on the back that you fill up with hot water from the shower head before you take a shower, and because the temperature is maintained between the front and back of the mirror it doesn&#x27;t fog.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about emptying the reservoir, because it has a slow drip out the bottom that empties the mirror in about twenty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is absolutely fogless when used properly.  It isn&#x27;t huge; I can&#x27;t see my whole face in the mirror at once, but it is a great size for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my big problems with the \\&quot;Zadro Z&#x27;Fogless\\&quot; was that the whole contraption was way heavier than the suction cups could deal with, and spent more time on the bottom of the tub then sticking to the shower wall.  Again, because the \\&quot;Ace Fogless\\&quot; is just a plastic cup with a mirror on the front, it is light enough that the two powerful suction cups have no problem holding it in place. Again, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor problem with the \\&quot;Ace Fogless\\&quot; is that the small attachment to hold a razor in the front is two small.  It is a non-flexible circular enclosure that is only wide enough to hold a disposable razor.  Most modern razors have thicker handles, especially ones like the battery-powered Mach-3.  These are far too wide to stick into the holder making it a useless decoration.</li>
            <li> This is mirror does a great job of remaining fogless in the shower. But the big drawback I have with this product is it won&#x27;t remain stuck to the shower walls. With no water in it the suction cups can hold it up but once water is placed in the mirror it will fall off the wall in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I started shaving in the shower recently as I was making a mess of the sink and never wanted to clean it up.  I knew I needed a good shower mirror and tried a couple of Zadro products.  One fogged after about a month and the other never stuck to the shower walls and fell and broke.  So I tried this one  So far I have been amazingly happy.  The science behind this product works very well.  You fill a reservoir behind the mirror with warm water when you start shaving and that keeps the outside temp the same as the temp behind the mirror meaning it cannot fog!!  No worries if the protective coating will ever wear away, there isnt one!!  The razor holder is a nice add on as well but it may not fit some larger razors.      The only flaw on this item is the suction cups.  The bottom cup on mine never seems to stay stuck.  I have tried everything but I cant get it to stay.  So far the top cup holds the whole thing pretty well.      I would absolutely buy this again and recommend it to anyone who needs one.</li>
            <li> The mirror stays clear, the no fog feature works great.  The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on my shower wall...  it always seems to fall off a couple hours later.  It has gotten to the point that I put it up and take it down with each use.  Over all a good product though, the only mirror I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
            <li> Maybe I read the comments too much but I thought this mirror was supposed to be fogless naturally.  That is definitely not the case.  You want to buy the anti-fog solution with it because if not, you&#x27;ll be wiping condensation from the mirror every couple of seconds.  This mirror fogs up faster than the glass surround of my shower.</li>
            <li> It will not stay stuck to the, the suction cups suck.  The mirror itself is great, stays fog-free when water is in the back.</li>
            <li> Ok - at $29.95, I expected:  1) A larger mirror.  I don&#x27;t like standing within 3\\&quot; to see my whole face.  2) A more expensive feeling plastic. I paired this with a [[ASIN:B000I3F91O Sangean H201 AM/FM Digital Shower Radio]] and the radio feels like a lot more product for it&#x27;s price.  The fog-free function works fine and the wall suction does not fail on my gloss-finish tile.  I like it but it would be a much better value at $20ish or with a larger sized mirror and/or more of a rubberized finish.  This could also provide some shock-absorption if you dropped it. (You remove it from it&#x27;s all mount to fill it with warm water before each use)  In short, it&#x27;s a reliable Chevy that could easily become a Cadillac.</li>
            <li> I attached the suction cups to my glass shower two weeks ago and it hasn&#x27;t slipped once. After you fill it with water the mirror will stay fogless for a good 10 minutes as the water slowly drips out the bottom. Mirror is a decent size and I can see my face clearly at 3 feet away.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several mirrors that I can use in the shower.  This is by far the best.  You fill it up with hot water and the heat of the water keeps the mirror warm and the mirror stays clear.  I really don&#x27;t like shaving and have sensitive skin.  I recently shaved off my beard and am shaving more often and this mirror has served me well so far.  It impressed me so much that I reviewed it on my own site. [...]    Be well!    Hal</li>
            <li> The mirror&#x27;s concept is fantastic, in fact, I wish I&#x27;d thought of it myself. The idea is simple enough, fill a reservoir behind the mirror with hot water, and like magic, it prevents the mirror from fogging.  It actually works!  There is even a clever drip hole on the bottom of the reservoir which allows it to empty over time.    There are are two main problems with the design:     First, it WILL NOT stay on the wall.  The suction cups simply are not robust enough to hold this thing on my shower wall. It barely stays up when empty, and its holding power is pushed to the limit when full. I can&#x27;t count the number of times the mirror has fallen off the wall in the middle of the night and come crashing to the floor!  I finally started detaching the mirror from its cradle after each use. Perhaps I&#x27;ll try siliconing it to the wall.    Second, the razor holder will not fit any standard size razor. I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all, and none fit. It&#x27;s completely useless!    Great idea guys, but back to the drawing board.    Richard B.</li>
            <li> Really excellent, a bit small and that is the only drawback, but the reservoir is drained by a small hole, just enough time to shave and clean up any missed spots.  The reservoir is easily removable to fill with water, works well.  My Mach # razor fits with a little prompting, but no issues.  Overall, really pleased.  I originally saw at the \\&quot;Grooming Lounge\\&quot; in Atlanta for $25.00, here for $8.00 and some change.  A great purchase. JNA</li>
            <li> I have nothing to say about this items anti-fogging ability, because it flunked-out before I could get that far. The suction cups did not hold it to the shower wall, so there&#x27;s nothing more to say. It&#x27;s a total failure in my opinion.</li>
            <li> At first the suction cups didn&#x27;t hold, but now they are stuck on and have been for several weeks with no problem.  The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog when you fill the back with water.  The drip hole to drain is nice, though the water drips down the razor when it is hanging in the razor holder.    Overall, seems a bit lightweight but who can complain when it works!</li>
            <li> Four stars instead of five because two suction cups sometimes aren&#x27;t enough.  I think four would be better.  It has fallen down on me a couple of times (but not broken) because the suction cups failed.  But suction cups do that, and the mirror didn&#x27;t break.    Other than that very small problem, this mirror is great.  It simply doesn&#x27;t fog up.  It installs in seconds, it works, and what else matters?  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Pros: It is crystal clear and fog free for around 10 min...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The suction cups don&#x27;t work... I tried it on the shower wall and the shower door... I mean these things are so bad it wont even hold up the base... let alone the mirror (with full reservoir)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a week now and it&#x27;s work flawlessly.  Mounted it to the shower wall and filled it with warm shower water and that&#x27;s it.  Stays fog free for the length of my showers (10 mins or so).  Great product and would recommend this to others looking for a fog free mirror.</li>
            <li> The fogless feature is spot-on as described and works well.  After about three months though, the suction cups had worn-out.  I ended-up drilling the base into my shower wall using a couple of anchor screws (the mirror removes from the base to fill with water).  I would recommend this from the beginning b/c when you have a face full of suds with your eyes closed; the suction cups lose their grip and the entire unit crashes down on the shower floor, you will stop singing that joyful tune.      Yes, I still give it four stars, just mount it permanently and you have an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed in this mirror after reading the good reviews. I hear a crash and my  husband cussing (lol) almost every morning as this falls off the wall mid-shave. I think the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; feature works well but it needs a better mechanism for staying put!</li>
            <li> was expecting more from the reviews, but can say it is just ok. The mounts suck</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and it definitely works as advertised!  For the price, it can&#x27;t be beaten.  The suction cups are plenty strong enough for holding the light-weight mirror and the water reservoir was a GREAT idea for keeping the mirror fog free.   The small hole in the bottom of the mirror allows the hot water to heat the mirror and then drain slowly so you don&#x27;t have to do it manually.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a way to shave in the shower.  The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light on it so make sure you have decent lighting in your shower area.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is the best shower mirror I have ever used.  IT DOES NOT FOG UP!!! and that is its main purpose.  While the mirrors that hook directly into the shower head work as well, they are too high for up for me (im 5&#x27;8&#x27;&#x27;).  The suction cups are the same as every suction up in the world, meaning they stick to the wall pretty well as long as the wall is clean when you put it on.  More likely then not it will fall off eventually but the mirror is well made so i doubt it will break.  Also, while it appears that the razor holder doesnt hold Mach brand razors, just peel the prong back a little and it will fit.</li>
            <li> I just got the mirror today, opened the box and to my surprise was a tiny little mirror. No where on Amazon did it say the mirror was actually only 6in x 5in, especially given the price. However the mirror does what it says and is fogless which is nice. The first time I used it I put water in the back and put it on the suction cups and within a minute it fell onto my toe. So i tried cleaning the area behind the suction cups with some soap and that helped and it didn&#x27;t fall the second time. Given the price I would expect the mirror to be larger, but on the positive it is actually fogless.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  The mirror truly is fogless, and seems to be a well designed product.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This thing barely functions as a mirror without the fog.  Add fog and it&#x27;s pretty much useless.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> As the listing and other reviews state, the removable mirror has an open chamber in the back which you fill with hot water. The plastic mirror absorbs the heat from the water and thus does not allow water to condense on its surface. The mounting system is adequate, it has not fallen once in the 2 week period that I&#x27;ve had it. The plastic holder for a razor is somewhat flexible and should hold any razor (held my Personna M5 Magnum just fine).    My shower and bathtub are white, so I wish this mirror came in white, but no matter. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the mirror is not as big as I expected, but this again was not a huge issue. The actual mirror (reflective surface) is about 6\\&quot; x 4.5\\&quot; at the center cross-section.    Would recommend to anyone looking for a good shower mirror.</li>
            <li> Been stuck on the glass door for almost a month. It fills up with water easily before shaving. No fog, not in the way, and priced well.</li>
            <li> Fill it up with hot water and start shaving.  Completely fog free and it self drains slowly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about dumping it out.  Suction to the wall works fine.  It&#x27;s small and light.  Holds my razor snug.  No batteries to rust and corrode.</li>
            <li> So first of all, I have been an Amazon member for about 10 years now, and a prime member since they introduced Prime. I have never written a review, even though I purchase a few items every week. So here it goes...    First of all, the delivery. I see now that the product is fulfilled by amazon, probably because more and more people are ordering it. When I ordered it, it was shipped with UPS but DELIVERED by USPS. A service they have if they want to skimp on the shipping costs. Well, only because I live in New York City, was this a major pain. So if you are shipping to place where the postman doesn&#x27;t leave packages but just notes, beware you may be making the hike to your local USPS. BUT, it seems now that they have taken this product to ship themselves, so I don&#x27;t see this being a problem anymore    Next the product.    The best thing in the world. The price, out of this world, the quality, what you would expect. Seems sturdy, doesn&#x27;t warp or bend when you squeeze it, I like that the mirror is plastic, so when you drop it in the tub you are stepping in glass shards. The suction cups are standard, if you have a tile or wall that isn&#x27;t like glass, forget about using them. But mine is standard tile, works great. Also keep in mind, if you have a bathroom window that is opaque, or textured, the cups might not seal. I mounted the cups 2 months ago, and they haven&#x27;t moved a mm.    THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MIRROR, is the design. You use the HOT shower water, to fill the mirror, equalizing the temperatures, keeping the mirror fog free. I am a scuba diver and have experience with fog free sprays, coatings, and the like for lenses under water. They work, but not for long. The way this mirror works will keep it working.    There is not really any kind of magnification, it looks like it because you will probably be standing 6 inches from the mirror, and because it is small. The little holder, despite what people in other reviews say, holds the MACH 3 razors just fine. The little hole for it to drip the water is perfect so you never have to empty the water.    This is by far the best $15 I have ever spent on amazon. It makes mornings stress free, as you just rinse the face away in the shower.    Buy this now, and get online and write a review just like this.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter weight...does not stay fogless forever but the great thing about this one is you can slide it out quickly, rinse, slide back in...you don&#x27;t have to mess with the suction cups</li>
            <li> Great job on fog free. The first unit I had would not stay adhered to wall ( glass or tile).      I emailed ACE and was contacted with an apology for my problems as well as a replacement product.  The gesture alone speaks volumes!    The replacement unit has what appears to be redesigned suction cups which solved the problem of falling off the wall.      Based on the help from the company and the redesigned product I highly recommend this product.  It works...</li>
            <li> I have always shaved in the shower. Other mirrors I have purchased would work for a while but eventually the surfaces would become corroded and would not remain fog free.    This product, however, is fantastic. Installation was a snap and it functions exactly as advertised. I fill the reservoir with water from the shower and it remains fog free for the entire time I&#x27;m in there; usually 15 minutes. Shaving is a snap with this mirror.    The only thing I wish it had was the ability to magnify. The magnification is 1X (I believe) and that can&#x27;t be changed. However, I am not going to downgrade the product for this slight matter.    I recommend this mirror for anyone that likes to shave while showering.</li>
            <li> For years I shaved with electric because I wanted to avoid razor burn and hate shaving AFTER my shower, never feel like I can get my face clean from the shaving cream.  This mirror is perfect, it is a little small, but can still see easily and the water resevoir to keep it from fogging is perfect. The suction cups could be a little larger, but have had no problems with it adhering to the plastic surround in my shower.  Occasionally it slides a little bit, but has never fallen off.    Actually came back to this page because I am buying another one for my brother.</li>
            <li> The unit is fog free (as you put hot water in the mirror basket, which slowly drips out, leaving a fog free mirror surface... Great suction cups keep it on the tile without slipping.  Outstanding ACE product.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who has to (over) research  the heck out of an item before I buy it...more so for big ticket items but for random items that are questionable like a \\&quot;fogless mirror\\&quot;...well that is one I researched.  After reading a few positive reviews on the website and having to need to purchase another item - I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.      I wanted a fogless mirror for a few reasons:  &gt;shave in the shower when the beard is its softest (less aftershave bumps, smoother shave)  &gt;Save time in the mornings  &gt;Less mess/clean up    So this mirror fits the bill.    Pros -  doesn&#x27;t fog up (at least it hasn&#x27;t yet)  Has suction cups to stick to wall/glass  holds razor  plastic mirror...won&#x27;t be as dangerous if it shatters  up/down adjustment  Removable/movable    Cons -  Suction cups - suck...and not in a good way. You must have smooth face tile, plastic walls or glass. I have porcelain tiles that are made to look like they are stone but since they have small pores in them the suction cups won&#x27;t work...would like to see option to use double sided tape(so it is on my glass doors) Also if you are having trouble getting it to stick to smooth surfaces, run the cups under hot water and apply liquid hand soup which helps seal the suction better.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with the hole dripping too fast as mentioned by some.  But the razor holder barely holds the razor.  Would like bigger razor holder and maybe a shaving can holder unless the weight would be an issue.    works well and does the job.  Smoother shave/face, less \\&quot;bathroom time\\&quot;, and less shaving cream everywhere.</li>
            <li> It must be very convenient for men to shave in the shower because my boyfriend loves this mirror! It looks very trendy, the design is great! There are two suction cups on the back attached to the frame where the mirror sits on. The mirror with the water chamber can be easily detached. Fill it up with shower water and the mirror will not fog!  It&#x27;s ok if you forget to empty the chamber after shower because there is a tiny opening on the bottom to drain the water very slowly. The quality of the mirror itself is great.     My boyfriend left the mirror suctioned to the shower wall...overtime...the whole thing fell off a few times. Now instead of a small opening on the bottom, there is a crack where water is leaking out faster than it should. The whole product is still intact. You wouldn&#x27;t know there is a problem unless it&#x27;s filled with water.    Just don&#x27;t leave the mirror suctioned on the wall and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> So, you order it, you get the mirror, you moisten the suction cups and it sticks to the wall.  Perfectly simple.  No chemicals, no putting something together.  The best part is it&#x27;s described as a \\&quot;fogless shower mirror\\&quot; and it IS actually fogless.  You simply fill the reservoir on the back of the mirror with warm water and the fog is history.  Perfect for shaving in the shower.  They even thought about putting a little hole at the bottom of the mirror that slowly lets the water out.  This is in case you forget to pour the water out of the reservoir when your finished with your shower which helps avoid the water from getting moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, a novel concept for a fogless shower mirror to actually be fogless, but this one really works!  If you want to shave in the shower, buy this mirror.  If you want to look at yourself and pretend you&#x27;re in a shampoo comercial, but this mirror.  If you just really love yourself and want to be able to see how awesome you look with a wet face and shampoo in your eye, buy this mirror.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> Before buying this mirror I read a lot of the reviews. A few people complained about the suction cups not working very good and I was concerned. I&#x27;m here to tell you they did something wrong. I took extra care before installing the mirror (selecting a flat surface and cleaning soap scum &amp; dirt) and you should too. Then I intentionally left it alone after installation to see how long it would last. It fell off alright.... after 3 months.     The fog-less part works as advertised and is much better than any other cheap fog-less mirror I ever tried. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you need to fill it with warm water and that means it gets covered in water droplets. Some day I&#x27;m going to track down a tiny squeegee to put in the holder at the bottom.... but then again all that extra weight might make the suction cups fail ;]</li>
            <li> I have owned several fogless mirrors over the years.  Primarily because my past purchases have been on products that coat the mirror with something that wears off after 3-6 months (planned obsolescence).  The Ace is a different concept.  It uses water in the resevoir to keep the mirror unfogged and this concept will not wear out after a few months.  The suction cups work great on glass, but I can see how some users have complained that it would not stick to tile very well.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It works, and works well.  The concept is smart, the product is sturdy, and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and I wanted to start doing it in the shower so it will save time and give me a better shave due to the hot steam. I&#x27;ve tried a few fogless mirrors before I bought this one and they did not work they fogged up!? The entire idea of a fogless mirror is to not fog up in the shower right? Well this mirror is perfect. You put hot water in the reservoir and it stays fog free for 15 minutes, genius. I would recommend this mirror to anybody. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> This is the only fogless mirror I&#x27;ve found that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It has a sound scientific principle; by filling the little well in back with hot water it neutralizes the steamy atmosphere.  And it does that beautifully.  I shave both my head and face and have plenty of time to do both with time to spare.  I use two razors, the Schick Tracer FX and a Schick SlimTwin.  The latter has a skinny handle and slides effortlessly into the razor holder, and I simply stand the former in the well in back.  I&#x27;ve not had a problem with the mirror falling off the way some customers have had.  I suspect the reason could be because I took some Windex and throughly scrubbed, then dry buffed the area, then dampened the suction cups with water, and my shower is fiberglass, not tile or glass.  So it could be soap scum that&#x27;s keeping some from a good adhesion.  I just wish I&#x27;d bought the Ace Fogless Shower Mirror sooner, it would have saved me a lot of time drying the bathroom mirror with a hair dryer.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless fogless mirrors and ended up disappointed with them all.  Until I tried this one.  It actually remains fog free and does its job perfectly.  With others, I had to eventually resort to applying a thin layer of soap or the diver&#x27;s trick (saliva) to get the mirror to stay fog free.  Not with this mirror.  My search is finally over.</li>
            <li> This things gets the job done. Filling it with water is an easy, minor chore. It&#x27;d be nice if the suction cups were a little stronger (it falls once in a while), but it is relatively easy to move as well.</li>
            <li> Pros: Doesn&#x27;t really fog up    Cons: Water beads on the surface really easily. I&#x27;d recommend placing it on the wall opposite of the shower head or else splash will get on the mirror and be almost as bad as fog.    For the price though, this can&#x27;t be beat and is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have shaved in the shower for past 30 years and have gone through dozens of \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors which last about 6 months before they start fogging or getting gunked up as the coating dissolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted to try the Sharper Image fog free mirror which was attached to the showerhead and kept the mirror fog free by temperature control, but I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $29.95 for it.  I liked the principle, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ACE product works similarly, but you don&#x27;t need to overhaul your showerhead.  Simple idea.  Works perfectly.  I stick it to a glass, and it works fine.  Hear other reviewers had problems with it sticking to tile.  A bit small and no magnification, but I don&#x27;t need that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is little products like this that you use every day that makes life fun and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my husband as I thought it might be easier for him to shave while he showers, not to mention the benefit of not having to clean after him every time he shaves.:) He is usually skeptical when it comes to the gadgets of this kind, but he loves this one and he says it works really well. He&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy !</li>
            <li> I got this mirror so that I could start shaving in the shower.  it doesn&#x27;t stick to my stone tile all that well but it sticks GREAT on my glass door. It doesn&#x27;t fog up at all as long as the water is in the back. it doesn&#x27;t bead up with water that much either which is nice.</li>
            <li> Best mirrow I&#x27;ve used as far as preventing the glass from fogging up. The built-in drain is a nice feature as the water slowy drains on its own, so you don&#x27;t have to do it after each use and no mildew builds. I occasionally have trouble keeping the suction cups mounted on the wall, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected after constant exposure to hot showers. Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this mirror after wanting one for quite a while. Previously I would shave in the shower by touch alone. I have sensitive skin and shaving creams, after shave lotions, etc were not enough to prevent the redness and puffiness that were the inevitable result of shaving. Shaving in the shower (after my facial hairs had become soft and whatnot) was the only viable solution, and rubbing my face was the only way of detecting where the razor needed to be applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have had with this mirror is that the suction cups work very poorly (i.e. not at all), but this i attribute to the fact that the walls of my shower are (ever so slightly) textured. The fog-free feature, however, works perfectly, and as this is the main reason I chose this mirror, I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3J40TXXRGTPK7]]It works. check out the video review. Peace, Lou</li>
            <li> The price is right, not more than many of the mirrors made of metal and which have to be immersed in water.  This one uses the fogless tank in the rear of the mirror and it works.  It stays on my shower wall as the suction cups are strong enough as long as the surface is smoothe.  The razor holder does hold most safety razors as it is flexible rubber and can bend to open to any reasonable sized razor.  The mirror tilt is adjustable so one can comb one&#x27;s hair, then pivot down to focus on the beard for shaving.  My whole face is viewable and it seems to magnify a bit also.  It is just the right mirror for the price and yes, it truly is fogless.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very hopeful as I was buying this for my husband. I am pleased to say he is very happy with it. It does not fog up, is attractive and I don&#x27;t believe there is anything on it that can rust like our previous ones. They not only rusted but they did fog up. The reviews were so very helpful. Bottom line is when my hubby is happy I&#x27;m happy!!! Good job on this product, we are very very pleased.</li>
            <li> First off, to all those reviewers that have said that the suction cups don&#x27;t work - maybe it&#x27;s your shower wall tiles and not the suction cups.  I&#x27;m guessing if your shower tiles aren&#x27;t clean then the suction cups won&#x27;t stick.  My advice is to clean your tiles!  This things sticks perfectly fine to the tile in my shower.  The razor holder holds the razor perfectly too (Im using a Gillette Sensor).  I filled the mirror with the warm shower water per the instructions and guess what....it works EXACTLY as advertised.  The image in the mirror is crystal clear, stayed fog-free for as long as I needed and the option to tilt the mirror on an upward angle is a nice touch.  Overall, I think this is a great product and well excecuted.  Glad I made the purchase and well worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> This mirror is crap.  It rarely stays fog free and the suction cups don&#x27;t stay stuck to the shower wall very well.  Seems rather cheap in design and I&#x27;m afraid I will use it during a shower and it will fall down and shatter on the floor.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its a great mirror that never fogs up. My shower has a smooth fiberglass surround, which should be perfect for a suction cup to adhere to, but it kept falling, be it when it was full of water and being used, or empty and in the middle of the night.  I ended up cutting off the top suction cup and using a ratcheting type suction cup with a hook to make it work.</li>
            <li> I have bought COUNTLESS number of fogless mirrors, some at ridiculously expensive prices (especially at bedbathandbeyond)that only kinda work and for only a couple of weeks.  I guess that stuff they spray on the glass to make it fogless just isn&#x27;t strong enough and/or rubs off after a while.  The ACE may not be as pretty or fancy looking as the others, but at least it works 100% every single time.  Have had it for a year now and use it daily in the shower.  I just wish it came with some kind of shower wall hook in addition to the suction cups.  Those cups don&#x27;t work on all types of shower walls.  Luckily that wasn&#x27;t a problem for us.</li>
            <li> took a couple times getting it secured to my shower wall well enough to hold on consistently (although i think that was on me for not cleaning the surface very well beforehand).  mirror doesnt fog up at all, however it does get water marks pretty easily, which is understandable, just need to wipe down with a tissue every now and then</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall and it develops spots that i havent been able to remove. So far it has been about to get the job done but it isn&#x27;t as clear as i&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is not that bad.  It doesn&#x27;t fog too much but the suction cups that come with this thing are awful.  The walls in my shower have a kind of matte finish and they do not stick to it at all.  They barely even stay connected to the porcelain on the bath tub itself.</li>
            <li> Aside from a little soap scum that was easily cleaned off this weekend, this thing is still crystal clear even with the bathroom door closed and the shower water piping hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most other (more expensive) fog free mirrors couldn&#x27;t handle this or would only stay fog free for a month or two before their coating stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that Ace has cracked the code here on how to reliably keep a mirror fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real complaint is that the razor holder doesn&#x27;t really hold the gillette fusion very well but that&#x27;s what the shower caddy is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 6 or 7 other fogless mirrors that have all ultimately ended with disappointment, I don&#x27;t think this can be beaten.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. The resivor on the back for water keeps the mirror nice and clean, the suction cup is very strong.Makes shaving in the sh.ower everyday alot less hasle</li>
            <li> Fixes solidly to wall of shower with two suckers.  Mirror easily detaches for quick filling, and has small drain hole that slowly drains empty.  Razor slot is soft rubber allowing you to push razor in rather than slide handle down.  Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I tried it..it REALLY works. Lick &amp; stick the suction cup on the wall, fill the body with water, instantly the mirror is clear and stays that way. My showers are short so I&#x27;m long gone before the thing finishes draining. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Zadro anti-fog shower mirrors, and they worked okay; fair image, until the mirror surface deteriorates to a cloudy surface over time.    The Ace Fogless Mirror is - so far - a big improvement. The fogless image is clear, the operation simple.    Since I have a marble tile shower, the one \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; I made was applying two squares of clear packing tape to the tile so that the suction cups adhere solidly. The tape is hardly visible, and allows the suction cups to maintain contact on marble or other uncooperative tile surfaces.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shower mirror for about a month now and it is working perfectly. I have a smooth shower wall and the suction cups hold very well. Filling the reservoir is easy (either with a cup or by lifting the mirror out of its v-shaped holder slot). This does not fog at all in the course of a shower. The drain hole works well, but it is just as easy to lift the mirror and dump any remaining water at the end of the shower. The mirror does have a slight distortion from a distance, but for the close work of shaving, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Fill the reservoir with water and it doesn&#x27;t fog up. It&#x27;s a bit small, but that depends on your standards and needs. It would be great for a smaller stall shower.</li>
            <li> The fogless mirror I have used for the past 10 years finally died, so I looked for a moderately priced replacement.  The reviews on this product were generally quite good, so I took a chance.  In concept, the idea of a reservoir of hot water helping to keep the mirror fog free and usable for shaving or other shower activities is a good one.  However, this mirror, at least for me, has failed miserably.    Setup and installation is easy and the construction is decent, too.  My issue is that I want to use the mirror for shaving in the shower, so I need to be able to see my face clearly.  My mirror does not fog, but the water beads up and sticks on the surface of the mirror making the viewing terribly distorted and virtually useless for my purposes.  I have tried cleaning the mirror surface several times with no change in results.</li>
            <li> This mirror is awesome. This morning  I allowed it to fog up a bunch before filling it up with water from my shower to see what it would do. I had a perfectly clear mirror in about 45 seconds. If you fill it up before the bathroom gets steamy you CANNOT get this thing to fog up. Period. The suction cups are more than ample to hold this thing up and if you are having trouble it&#x27;s user error (either a unsuitable surface or you&#x27;re not moistening the suction cups)Get this mirror and get rid of fog for good. Great design too!</li>
            <li> Mirror worked great, but the suction cups on the base of mine would only hold for a few hours, then the mirror would come crashing down. I emailed Ace (Goody) asking them for a new base, but got some stock email reply about their great hair care products and a promise to send my comments to engineering team. Lovely...thankfully Amazon provided an easy return and I just bought a different mirror.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shower mirror now for about two weeks to shave in the shower. It really does work. You do have to fill it up with warm/hot water before using it. I do that as soon as I get in the shower and have warm water coming out of the shower head. The mirror has a huge opening at the top which makes it really easy to fill it up with water. Just hold it in front of the shower head for may be three seconds. One thing I did not know about this mirror is that it slides up and out of the suction cup assembly so you don&#x27;t have to fumble with the suction cups while you may be half asleep in the morning. The suction cups have worked well so far. The mirror has not come crashing down. I did wet the suction cups before attaching to the shower wall. Suction cups seem to work better that way. As advertised, the mirror has a small hole at the bottom to drain the water out. This gives you about 15-20 minutes to shave. This is long enough for me as I am a clean shaved person. This mirror is also small enough to be carried with you when you&#x27;re traveling, which I am looking forward to doing next month.    The only problem I have with this mirror is that the razor holder is somewhat small.    I would strongly recommend this mirror to anyone who enjoys shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my partner who&#x27;s always shaving in the shower and always missing spots. He&#x27;s enjoyed being able to shave in the shower and meet my standards of a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1 - Doesn&#x27;t fall off. (Has fallen twice in the past few months, but the water was left in the tank so that&#x27;s our fault.)&lt;br /&gt;2 - Doesn&#x27;t fog up.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Easy to remove and fill up the reservoir behind the mirror with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;4 - Holds razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1 - It&#x27;s not real glass. I understand though that glass would be dangerous in the shower and plus that would make the mirror heavier and more likely to fall.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Water spots on the mirror (my partner doesn&#x27;t complain and he shaves just fine in the mirror. This is more just a cosmetic issue I have with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good shower mirror, look no further.</li>
            <li> Effective solution to shave in the shower. Mirror is great, may be a little warped but who cares, image is great and it actually magnifies a little. Suction cups are okay if you apply them carefully; once every month or so I notice one of them has come off. There are two suction cups so the mirror never actually fell. The only thing I would like to see improved is the razor holder. Not so easy to clip and unclip the razor with one hand. Can&#x27;t just slide it in if razor handle is thick. And leaves the razor hanging exposed in a dangerous way: don&#x27;t hit your elbow while shampooing. But break off the razor holder and you still have a great mirror for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> After trying countless, so called, fogless mirrors, I finally found one that holds up to it&#x27;s name. The Ace fogless mirror gets an A++. It is inexpensive and it totally works. Simple, low priced, compact, easy to install (I cheated and used silicon glue on the suckers). I love it!</li>
            <li> the mirror is well-made, crystal clear mirror, and works as promised! Strong suction cups, clever easy to fill chamber that easily drops back onto the hanger, et viola! Works very well.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this being great since you could remove the mirror and fill it with hot water so the steam didn&#x27;t collect.  The suction cups do not do a great job of sticking and the mirror keeps falling - luckily it is shatterproof.  One similar one is made by Toiletree ([[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]]) and it works great, but you do have to permanently attach it, which is fine with me since I plan to always shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this mirror for my dad for Christmas because it had the best reviews for the price.  Well for starters... The mirror would NOT stick to the bathroom wall.  We have the standard 4\\&quot; x 4\\&quot; tacky tile in the shower room so we made sure that neither suctions cups were over the grout line.  That didn&#x27;t help.  It continued to fall time after time.  So, I just decided it might be best to just leave the mirror in there and have the guy hold it while shaving which is an inconvenience in itself.  WHICH we only came to find that it infact is not fogless... but it gets very foggy.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and so far, he absolutely loves it.  We had another \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shaving mirror in the shower, and it always fogged and stayed that way.  He couldn&#x27;t shave.  This one, with the water in the back, stays clear.  His only comment about it would be that it would be nice if it had some kind of film to protect the mirror against hard water.  Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my husband.  He uses it daily in the shower and loves it.  The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up and it&#x27;s easy to use (fill with water and empty).  It works exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s never fallen off and it prevents steam build up.  Overall, he loves it a lot and it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> So, I read all the reviews on here, having just lost my &#x27;fog free&#x27; mirror to the fades of time. (The fog free coating wore off and it was more of a fuzzy, younger looking me in my old mirror - good for your ego, bad for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, being as it costs about the same as my previous one, but had a different look about it. I have to say, if this was a one word review, I&#x27;d say it was &#x27;meh.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fog up if you fill it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you want it to stick to your bathroom tile, you need to scrub and clean the tile back until it&#x27;s like new, then with the force of the hulk, after puny humans try to stop him, mash it to the wall. Then maybe it will stick. (3 days so far)&lt;br /&gt;Before that, when i just connected it out of the box, it fell down every two hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 17.99 one it was replacing had one of those lever + suction cup things that work really well - and the 7$ iPhone holder I bought had one - why can&#x27;t they use that here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, anyways, it does work as a mirror, and it&#x27;s been 3 days since it fell so -- like i said, &#x27;meh&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: ok i am bumping this up to 4 stars now -- it&#x27;s lasted and stayed in the shower since i first wrote this review, some time ago - 6 or 7 months? (you can probably figure you better than i can by clicking on me) -- it is now a full 4 stars</li>
            <li> If you have a glass (or glass-like) surface to mount it on this mirror will be perfect for you.  I have a tile-walled shower, and found that the suction cups would stick for about 5 minutes, or up to 15 minutes if I scrubbed the tile super-clean before applying them.  Then the mirror would clatter to the floor.    I ended up fabricating a copper bracket to hang this mirror off of my shower head.    Other than that -- the fogless feature works as designed.  The razor holder fits my Mach3 razor well.  The mirror survived multiple falls onto tile without breaking.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> This works awesome. After 2+ years of use it is still going strong. My only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that once in a while it becomes un-sucked from the tile wall and crashes to the tub. For this reason I dont leave the mirror attached and it has only happened 2x since. This is a great product and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> This is the first fogless mirror that actually works!  I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas so that he can shave in the shower.  We are not experiencing any problems with suction but we also never pull the mirror/reservoir portion off. We keep a cup in the shower and we use that to fill the reservoir.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll decide to fill the reservoir partway through a shower to clean my face and it instantly de-fogs when I add the hot water.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used to have the \\&quot;Sharper Image\\&quot;-type shower mirror---the kind that hooks inline with the shower nozzle plumbing. Worked well, but the rather stiff gooseneck mount made it somewhat difficult to position the mirror in an ideal location while showering/shaving. I decided a wall-mounted mirror looked like a more flexible option, and I liked the idea of the built-in hot water reservoir on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using mine for many months now. It certainly works, provided you don&#x27;t mind the mirror face being covered with water droplets from shower spray (more expensive models include a little squeegee to wipe those off). However, one of the two suction cups on mine is patently defective and cannot adhere at all. Consequently, the remaining suction cup has to work overtime. Inevitably, every few weeks that suction cup fails, and the entire assembly falls off the shower wall with a loud clatter. Pretty irritating when it happens in the middle of the night, leading one to believe that a violent prowler has entered their home. I have tried putting a film of petrolatum-based gel on the inner surface of the working suction cup to improve its seal, but it still fails after awhile. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shower mirror I have ever owned, and for $12 I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.  The suction cups stick to my tile just fine.  I don&#x27;t have special tile, just tile.  Works great.  The razor holder is big enough to hold any of the newer fancy fazors (Mach, Pro Glide, etc...).  After filling it up with water the reservoir keeps the mirror fog free.  I haven&#x27; yet had an issue with fog or it falling off the shower wall. Plus, it looks cool and since it&#x27;s not metal it doesnt get all soap scummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to give this mirror 5 stars but only thing keeping me away from it are the suction cups... They just don&#x27;t stay on, and heared (BANG) from my bathroom several times first day I got it. (Just because I tried it dry and wet) none worked. When shaving in the shower I just kept pushing it every minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s brilliant: I love it, I kept trying to fog it by blowing hot air at it, just does not get foged. Maybe it&#x27;ll take some time to go bad (as all of them do). I will be buying another one as a present for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ACE for a great product, (But please keep in mind to change those suction cups when making a new product).</li>
            <li> Holds to the shower wall fimrly with 2 suction cups, and the mirror is removable.  Just hold the mirror under the water for 5 seconds, and the resovior on the back will fill up. Place it back on the stand and away you go. Easy and absolutely no fog, had it for a month now.</li>
            <li> The concept of the Ace is to fill a reservoir behind the mirror with hot water from your shower.  The heat from the hot water warms the mirror and prevents fog.  Requires you to slide the mirror unit off a suction bracket and fill with hot water.   An easy step, not a deal breaker.      The Ace works well and provides a clear shaving mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog.    The one draw back is the mounting system.  I would like to see a glue or double sided tape mounting system rather than suction cups.  Some fogless mirrors offer you a choice.  When ordering the unit, be certain you have a smooth surface to stick the unit to.    My issues arose when I  could not mount the unit to my tile surface.  The side of the shower I wanted.  My tile grout  and uneven surface in my tile design didn&#x27;t hold the suctions cups.  I had to mount it on my shower door.      Overall, good cheap solution.  Doesn&#x27;t require any tools. Be certain you have a smooth surface and good light to shave.  If you don&#x27;t clean your mounting surface suction hold is limiting and your unit can fall.  I give the unit a B+.  Improvements would be the mounting system.</li>
            <li> I have bought many shower mirrors that had various means of anti fog.  An expensive one that attaches above the shower head and has water flowing was best before this.  But that got corroded and did not work with 100% efficiency.  This one really works.  It is inexpensive for what it does.  Buy it.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> It works.  Just fill it with water, and no fog.      Only problem is the razor holder isn&#x27;t big enough for my razor.  So I&#x27;m keeping my old mirror just to hang it on.</li>
            <li> Mirror is simply made and easy to install and works great. What more can one ask for. It is very easy to install and suction cup holds to wall really well. It has been fogless since the day I had it and is very happy with this product. Should anything happen to this mirror, I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary of placing my order after reading several reviews that complain that the mirror will not remain fixed to the wall. However, there were enough favorable reviews plus the attractive price that convinced me to complete the purchase. My experience, after several weeks of use, is that the mirror&#x27;s suction cup attachment system works just fine. I have, in fact, relocated it twice, and found it securely attached when I attempted to relocate it. I can&#x27;t imagine it falling unless it is not applied to a smooth, clean surface, or that it is accidentally struck by the shower occupant.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s performance is just as has been stated by so many other favorable reviews. It remains fog free throughout a shower and shave.</li>
            <li> Seems smaller than I expected from just glancing at the online pictures, but its size is good enough for a shave.  Suctioncups have only fallen once in 2+ months (now I just remember to re-press them in every once in awhile), the anti-fog system for the mirror works well, and the razor holder fits my Merkur just right.</li>
            <li> This fogless shower mirror works great, but it does fall off sometimes, and the suction cups do not work very well, I&#x27;m guessing poor quality.  The razor holder sticks out in the way, it would be nice if it could be folded back out of the way when not being used.  Also it doesn&#x27;t fit my Gillette Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase it again, but I would like it to have better quality suction cups.</li>
            <li> The mirror is good. It goes a full shower without fogging up. The suction cups on the other hand are terrible. They can&#x27;t hold the mirror overnight. Trick to get the suction cups to work for when you shower is to soak the wall where you want to hand it, then soak the suction cups and firmly put in place. It will be solid until the area dries. I just take the mirror down when not in use and leave the holder on the wall 24/7. I am using a tile wall. Would have been 4 stars if the suction cups good hold the mirror 24/7.</li>
            <li> Just fill with water and works perfect. Honestly, there&#x27;s just not much to go wrong. It&#x27;s a large size mirror and the bracketing that allows you to remove the mirror and fill with water is rather smart and elegant.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.  As with all suction cups, make sure they&#x27;re wet before sticking them.  The base hasn&#x27;t moved in the 2 months that I&#x27;ve had this product even after pulling the mirror off it many times to fill it with water.  Razor holder works well also.  Outstanding product.  I&#x27;d absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea ... use the hot water from the shower to keep the mirror warm and stop it from fogging up in the shower.    It&#x27;s a \\&quot;crummy\\&quot; execution ... the suction cups are so weak that they won&#x27;t hold the mirror onto the smoothest of surfaces.     My workaround was to use silicon caulk to hold it to the wall.</li>
            <li> This is the second fogless mirror I&#x27;ve owned.  This one is definitely superior to the first.  It&#x27;s a simple design, but it works well.  My one small issue is that I wish the mirror secured a bit more tightly to the backing which suctions to the shower wall or whatever surface.  -But again, this is a good product overall.</li>
            <li> Mirror does what it was designed to do. Works better than any \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirror that I have owned in the past. Only drawback is that it sometimes falls off the wall due to fact that the suction cups can&#x27;t support the weight. I now just pour out the water when I am done to avoid this. For the price it is definitely a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The suction cup doesn&#x27;t work with my shower tile, falls within few minutes. But I&#x27;ve screwed on hooks from hardware store on each side and hung it on the curtain bar using fishing line. Other than that, the product seems to work as advertized.</li>
            <li> This product gets 5 stars because it works as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t fog up, suction cups remain in place. I&#x27;ve tried several mirrors in the past, and this one actually seems to work. Great!</li>
            <li> This mirror is really useful.  I went from having to shave in front of the sink to being able to shave in the shower (and being that I shave my head, too, that&#x27;s really convenient).  The one drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is that the suction cups don&#x27;t always work.  If your shower has super-smooth tile, then you should be fine.  Mine does not; the tile has a slightly sandy, dimpled surface that does NOT work with the suction cups.  I generally just hold the mirror, which is lightweight, and that works fine, if slightly less convenient.  Good product, though.  And the mirror is durable, too; I&#x27;ve dropped it twice, and it didn&#x27;t scratch or break.  Oh, and once you put the hot water in it, it does indeed become fogless.</li>
            <li> OK Shower Shave Mirror. The problem I&#x27;ve encountered is after a few uses, the drain hole clogged up. I do live in an area with very hard water, though. I have to manually empty the water reservoir after each use, which isn&#x27;t that big a deal. As far as being fog free, this mirror is excellent. I was tired of dealing with cheap mirrors that didn&#x27;t work that well and needed replacing every 6 months. This product seems to be well made and I expect it to last a long time.  Overall, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It works great... except that I had to cut out the original suction cups and force some larger ones in. My shower stall is very slightly bevelled. All other suction cups work... just not these. They are too rigid and not malliable enough to sctually suck themselves to the wall. The mirrir itself and the water chamber are great. Very simple and the self draining hole is awesome. Would have been 4 stars with no issues. I guess now it is 4 stars but I really didn&#x27;t want to work so much with it.</li>
            <li> Ok so if you want this mirror to shave in the shower, look somewhere else.  It looks like a funhouse mirror which makes it difficult to shave accurately if you need to make some sharp lines for a goatee or sweet mustache.  As far as fog, its great, doesnt fog, even after all the water dripped out.    Its small, enough said.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, a fogless mirror that you can stick to the wall - they&#x27;re much better than the ones that attach to your showerhead. When I got mine I liked it a lot, but then some problems began to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HARDWARE:&lt;br /&gt;  1) The suction cups won&#x27;t keep the mirror on the wall. I&#x27;m usually good with suction cups. I washed the wall, washed the cups, wet them both and pressed on the mirror. Well, quite a few times. The mirror will stay up for a while, but at some point it will come crashing down. That doesn&#x27;t break it (although my mirror became distorted somehow and now reflects my face in a weird and somewhat amusing way) , but I don&#x27;t like bouncing around any of the razor blades I rub against my face. I take the mirror off the mount (very easy to do) when I&#x27;m done with it, and that helps.&lt;br /&gt;  2) One of the reasons I take the mirror down is that it gets clogged and won&#x27;t drain. At first I could shake it and it would drain again, but those fixes only lasted a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOFTWARE:&lt;br /&gt;  1) This is true of any mirror, but worth mentioning. It&#x27;s at face level or lower and very likely it will become covered with droplets of water. You can wipe them off or rub the mirror&#x27;s surface with a bit of soap.&lt;br /&gt;  2) You have to fill the mirror with hot water every time you use it. I am, at the moment, filling it at the end of my shower, when I shave. That&#x27;s fine, but you have to wait a couple of minutes for the condensation to dissipate. You could fill the mirror when you first get in the shower, but it seems to me that by the end of the shower, especially if it&#x27;s a long one, the water in the mirror would be cooler than the shower. I don&#x27;t know how much difference that would make, if any. I haven&#x27;t done much testing, I confess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: I bought a similar but superior shower mirror by ToiletTree here, and I&#x27;ve been putting the water in when I first hop in the shower. I take long showers, but the mirror stays clear, so that&#x27;s the answer to SOFTWARE #2, I think.</li>
            <li> First, this is not a mirror.  It is a piece of plastic with a reflective coating applied to it.  If you hold this \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; up to a true mirror, you will see the difference.  With the water droplets plus the poor refective capabilities, it is hard to get a good shave with this item.    Secondly, the suction cups don&#x27;t work.  It falls off my wall every single time.      Returned the item.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried this one, it failed completely.  Never buy this one for the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; function.</li>
            <li> This mirror does not fog up unless you breath directly on it while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It has a handle play for your razor to sit.&lt;br /&gt;It sticks to the wall of my shower without flaw.&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit more on the expensive side.. I saw some stuff at different vendors for cheaper but this is a larger mirror and has a tilt capability so you can see under your chin and jaw bones better to make sure you got that perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d reccomend it to my friends if they have a bit of extra money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll freely admit up front - I&#x27;m a shower shaver and I&#x27;m not ashamed of it.  Shaving in the shower is just part of my shower routine and besides - it means one less time I have to clean the frak&#x27;ing little hairs out of my sink.    I&#x27;ve had probably a dozen shower mirrors over the years.  My old favorite was a hand-held rectangular mirror that I&#x27;d purchased at a local thrift store and hung on the tile surface of my shower with one of those peel-and-stick hooks you get at the local big box store.  Whenever I used it, I&#x27;d just put a dab of soap on my finger and wipe it on the mirror.  This cleared the mirror up for long enough for me to shave.  And this mirror lasted for several months, then dissolved into a pile of shiny glass shards when the stick gave way on the hook.  I&#x27;d tried duplicating this once, but came to the same unfortunate ending.    So I searched.  Amazon reviews, other reviews - and my choice came down to this Ace mirror and one other.  I chose the Ace as much on looks as I did on the overwhelmingly positive reviews I&#x27;d read.  And let me tell you - I&#x27;m not disappointed one bit.      Ok - so I get in the shower, shampoo up an bit, then turn to shave.  The mirror is completely fogged over.  I pull it off of the base, fill it with water, and by the time I have re-situated it on the base, it&#x27;s already beginning to clear up.  I shave - a couple of minutes affair at least - then finish my shower.  I&#x27;m not a quick shower taker.  15 - 20 minutes is my norm.  This mirror stayed fog free /past/ the end of my shower and beyond.  I&#x27;m impressed and I&#x27;m sold on the technology (or, perhaps better stated, the simplicity of the technology).  And, I&#x27;m please with the fact that the mirror appears to be made of some non-breakable polymer rather than the glass that I&#x27;d had before.    I&#x27;m hoping that my exuberance lasts for but the moment, I&#x27;m stoked and pleased to recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Having bought, then thrown away many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in past years, I did not have high expectations for this one either. But this one actually works. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and am very happy with it. Instead of a coating on the mirror that seems to wear off or get covered with soap or minerals, this mirror works by raising the temperature of the mirror through shower water you put into the top of it. It works exactly as promised, and after a couple of months of daily use it still works. I was very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to shave in the shower without having to splash water onto the mirror continually so that you can actually see your face and not end up a bloody mess by the end of it.</li>
            <li> The filling the mirror with water idea keeps the mirror fog free.  It doesn&#x27;t keep it clear of water though, so you need to wipe it off as you shave.  That part of it is awesome.  My biggest problem are the suctions cups.  They will not stay on my fiberglass shower.  On the box it says sticks to tile and glass, so I don&#x27;t know if I can blame the manufacturer, but other suction cups seem to work fine in my shower.  I have a clock and a over the shower rack that would take a good amount of force to pry off.  I am considering using an adhesive pad to attach it to my shower, but I don&#x27;t want to do any damage.</li>
            <li> This product has been fantastic.  A few comments:    * As advertised, it does not fog.  I was skeptical, but lo and behold, it works!  * It&#x27;s very light and not very large, smaller than I expected.  The mirror is maybe 4 inches wide by 8 inches tall.  That works well enough for me.  * It sticks to the wall well, except for the bottom suction cup.  That one keeps coming off.  The top one is strong enough, so it&#x27;s not a problem.  (And, it&#x27;s strong enough when it&#x27;s full of water.)  * It has a hole at the bottom that slowly drips the water out.  This means that if you forget to empty it, it will empty on its own.  Very convenient!  * The mirror is shatter proof, a BIG plus for the shower.  * It has a nice holder for the razor.    This has been an excellent purchase for me, I now only use this for shaving.  I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> These do not stick to any surface in our shower for more than 10 seconds.  I don&#x27;t know if the cups are too small or what the issue is - but they are worthless to us.</li>
            <li> This thing is great!  It has remained steadfastly stuck to the smooth fiberglass wall in my shower since I placed it there over two weeks ago.  It is easy and simple to fill with a hand-held shower.  I keep a small sponge in the shower to squeegee off the water droplets, and am rewarded with a crystal clear reflexion; which can be a shock in the morning.  My Gilette Track II razor fits easily in the holder.</li>
            <li> The truly fogless shower mirror is one of those pieces of technology that mankind will probably search for forever.  Without building into the wall with a heating system, it&#x27;s just hard to accomplish.  Having gone through so many mirrors, this one I feel is the closest to fogless yet.  Fill up the hollow with hot water from the shower and there&#x27;s no fog!  It drains slowly over time, so eventually you start getting fog again near the top of the mirror.  The only complaints I have are that it is pretty small, and the suction cups don&#x27;t work very well.  About every week or so I have to take it down and reapply it the wall.  It will stay, but I don&#x27;t trust it that much.  But for what it is, this mirror will let you shave in the shower or do whatever without the hassle of wiping the fog off every time.</li>
            <li> If you shave in the shower this is a must have. I have been battling \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors for 30 years, but this is the Cadilac of all shower mirrors. I would only suggest they incorporate a digital FM radio with it and they would have the Bomb!</li>
            <li> Finally found a shower mirror that really works.  It has an open resevoir behind the mirror.  It is open like a vase, but there is a pinhole at the bottom.  You fill the resevoir with water. (I use the handheld shower head) and it immediately becomes clear and fog free.  Takes 15 minutes for all the water to leave the resevoir via the pinhole in the bottom &#x3D; no standing water &#x3D; no mold/mildew.  By your next shower it is dry and ready to be filled for your next shave.  I would have given this mirror 5 stars...but they didn&#x27;t design much in the way of an eyelet or hook so it can be hung.  You have to use their suction cup or improvise (like I did).  I have it hanging on a piece of poly clothes line off of the shower rod.  Works.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower.  My first fog-free mirror was the kind that attached to the shower head.  It was expensive, worked great for a while, but broke way too soon for something that expensive.  So I got the kind that was advertised as fog-free, and required no shower attachment.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on those; after owning two of them, I can say definitively that they don&#x27;t work...well, maybe for a little while, sort of.  Which brings me to this mirror - awesome!  I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and it works as well as those that attach to the shower for less than half the price.  The design is ingenious.  Easy to hang, easy to fill, and absolutely crystal clear!  Nothing I know of works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mirror for about 3 weeks and it works very well.  It was a gift from my wife.  I have a removable shower head, so I just spray water in the top of the mirror and in about 5 seconds any fog on the mirror disappears.  As an alternative, the mirror easily slips upward and off its mount to be filled remotely--no water spills and no trouble latching or sliding it off the mount.  The mirror is clear and does not appear to be distorted, but it doesn&#x27;t make me look any better. :)  So far, the suction cups have held the mirror in place without falling off the shower wall.  However, I am used to pushing it against the wall every now and then, because other mirrors that I&#x27;ve owned have fallen off unless I repeatedly re-secure the suction cups.  So it&#x27;s not conclusive whether mine has good suction or not, but it is quite easy to push on it every now and again--and it apparently works fine doing that.  The water slowly drips out the back, which is good to avoid stale water in the mirror.  The only drawback is that the water drips down the handle of the razor in the holder.  For me this isn&#x27;t a problem because I use disposable razors, but it might cause mildew/sediment build up for reusable razors.  The razor holder is the only less-than-ideal part.  It barely fits some of the my disposable razors.  It also feels flimsy, so much so that I&#x27;m afraid it might eventually break off.  I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple months to report on the razor holder.</li>
            <li> Part of my daily must have.  Suction cups kind of wear out and falls off the wall sometimes due to the weight of the mirror when filled with water (to avoid fogging, you need to fill the mirror with warm water).  After falling a few times, the mirror slightly cracked in the bottom corner, but never shattered.  Overall, it works- just make sure the suction cups are well attached!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY - this thing is terrible - fogs up immediately - suction cup does not work - literally no reason to buy this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all: Fogless shower mirror/ radios and other stand-alone shower mirrors. For $10 this mirror is perfect. It&#x27;s well finished and works very well. The stated 20 minute drain time is a gross exaggeration, more like 5! No biggie just plan accordingly and fill the tank just before you shave. Combined with the Sony ICFS79W shower radio I have a perfect shower solution. Finally. :)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, stays fog free.  It&#x27;s easy to fill since the mirror/cup lifts off the base.  The razor holder is flexible and my Gillette Fusion fits in it nicely.    Since I don&#x27;t see the dimensions of the mirror listed, it&#x27;s roughly 4 1/2\\&quot; wide and 7 1/4\\&quot;.    I knew that the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t work on the textured tile in my shower.  I attached it using a piece of 3M VHB inside each suction cup and it&#x27;s not going anywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the back of the 4 star review on Amazon from a \\&quot;large-enough\\&quot; sample size.  Although it functions in the way that I need it to, its pretty cheaply made and the reflection isn&#x27;t terribly precise.  Maybe this is the best that can be done with a plastic mirror but I was unimpressed.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have an alternative for you, but if you are looking for a high quality mirror that is truly fog free, I was look elsewhere.  For the price that you pay, this might be the best available - anything better, may cost multiples more...</li>
            <li> This mirror Still fogs  up in the shower and the suction cups do not work great. It has already fallen off the shower wall twice in 3 days. Buyers Beware</li>
            <li> I have had several shower mirrors in the twenty years I have been shaving in the shower and I have mixed feelings about this one. while the mirror itself is of an excellent grade and the idea is exceptional there are some things missing / design flaws that need to be addressed.   Pro&#x27;s...  - The design is really cool I like filling the reservoir with water. (Yeah I am 41 and like to play in the shower sue me)   - The Single razor is perfect for me (My wife cannot use my shower holder to hold her razor)which is a huge plus for me!!!  - The Mirror Tilts with a screw adjuster on the bottom suction cup  - It is a high grade mirror.  Con&#x27;s...  - When you fill the reservoir (with hot water) the little hole in the bottom that allows water to escape will get clogged if you have a high mineral content in you water. This is especially perplexing if when you step in a nice hot shower and pull up on the reservoir to remove it, it breaks loose and freezing cold water (in comparison) splashes on your nether region causing instant paralysis and screams of terror.    - The suction cups are minimally rated. They barely hold the apparatus up. I have had my mirror installed for two months now and it has slipped down to the bottom of the shower or fallen off four times. This is a clean fiberglass shower that I had to scrape my old mirror off to remove the suction cups.   In short if you are the maker of this product and would like to make it better get a spring loaded suction cup for the top and include a cleanout button for the bottom of the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Bought this recently as a replacement for the original I had.  This one simply does not want to stick to the tile in the shower, thus rendering it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ace, time to invest in better suction cups!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but the mirror, which isn&#x27;t that big) is the first completely fogless mirror I&#x27;ve used.  If you&#x27;re looking for a mirror in the shower, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> The product is poorly made.  When I attached it to the shower wall the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick and my razor wouldn&#x27;t fit in the attached holder.  Within a few minutes the mirror fogged up and fell on the floor.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned it was a waste of money and a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  You take off the mirror part (it&#x27;s almost like a flat cup) from the suction cup part and you pour some hot water on the reservoir and it defogs the mirror!  It lasts around 20 - 30 minutes.  I have a thick Merkur HD razor, so it won&#x27;t fit on the bottom holder.  After about 2.5 months of use, the mirror did fall and didn&#x27;t break.  I guess you have to make sure the wall is clean and smooth before you put the suction cups in.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this mirror was terrible. A few hours after each shower I&#x27;d hear it fall and bounce around in the tub.    Then I read and followed the instructions. I moistened the suction cups and it&#x27;s been up for a couple of weeks now.    I knocked a star off because the mirror is large enough to use but feels uncomfortably small.</li>
            <li> The suction cups won&#x27;t even stay on the wall.  It has crashed three time now.  Am I supposed to be impressed it hasn&#x27;t broken yet?  Want a fogless shower mirror?  Get one that connects to the plumbing so the water keeps the temperature equalized to prevent condensation. This thing is a waste of money, time and plastic.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a few weeks before I made my decision. I bought it mid October and use it weekly. I have to say that it has met my expectations. Some people say it falls off, well I only hang it up when im shaving and during that time it has never fallen off. The fogless feature works great, my shave usually takes 10minutes and I have more than enough water left in the back when i&#x27;m done. Simply put for the price, functionality, and performance, I would highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors over the years, most of them start off fine but within a few months the anti-fog coating has worn off and the mirrors become useless. This mirror has been great. It has a small reservoir on the back of the mirror you fill with hot water and it gives you 20-25 minutes of fog free use. The drain in the bottom also allows for minimal maintainance so mold or mildew is not an issue. This mirror was one of the least expensive mirrors I have purchased and it has definately out-performed even the $50 dollar mirrors I have used in the past. If you are looking for a long lasting low maintainance mirror this one is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than a week and the suction cups gave way causing the mirror to fall. This broke the glue that holds the two sides of the mirror together. Now the mirror doesn&#x27;t hold water at all and is completely useless.</li>
            <li> This stays fog free during the entire shower. My husband (for shaving his face) and daughter (for shaving her armpits) both love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the so-called fogless mirrors available so that I can shave in the shower.  I went through several of the type that have the fogless coating.  After a few months, the minerals in the water adhere to the mirror, you clean it, and voila - no more fogless coating.  They really stink.    The Ace mirror on the other hand is a great product with a simple design.  It works as advertised, just fill the reservoir with water and the fog disappears.  And when you need to clean it, use whatever bathroom cleaner you normally use and it still works like new.  I have had this for over a year - much longer than any of my previous mirrors - and it still works perfectly.  The only negative thing I can say is that the suction cups won&#x27;t work on all surfaces.  They won&#x27;t stick to the stone tile in my shower so I have to stick it on the glass door.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is a problem with Ace or with all suction cups on that kind of tile.  If I ever need a new mirror, however, I will buy this again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my face and head in the shower for nearly 5 years.  I&#x27;m constantly switching out my mirror for the latest and greatest \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; shaving mirror.  My last one was from Sharper Image and was just as worthless as all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I figured the more I spent the better the mirror would be.  Wrong!      This Ace mirror is phenomenal, and it STAYS fog free for my entire shower.  I found one other mirror like this, with the reservoir on the back for warm water, but it mounted permanently with glue, and since I just spent a ton of money putting in a brand new shower stall in my new bathroom, I wasn&#x27;t about to go gluing stuff to the wall.  This mounts with suction cups and is perfect.  It easily comes off the bracket for filling and with the built in 20 minute drain I don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to pour out the water.      This is the best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time, in fact, I&#x27;m going to order another one now just as a backup!</li>
            <li> This is my third attempt at finding a fogless shower mirror.  The first two fell short of my expectations.  After reading reviews of this product, I thought I&#x27;d try again.  Finally, this one is truly fogless.  I just follow these simple steps... 1. Get water to desired temperature. 2. Fill the reservoir with water.  3.  That&#x27;s it!!  No fog!!</li>
            <li> Low tech, low cost fogless shower mirrow that works great every time. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I have shaved in the shower for years now and always would have to buy mirrors with that coating to stop them from fogging up. Those worked great at first but in a couple of months would need to be replaced. This mirror works great and because of the design, requires no special coating to keep the fog away.   My only con would be the razor holder is useless as it&#x27;s way too small. Not a big deal for me, keep my razor somewhere else anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mirror for about six months now and I love it. Just fill it from the shower head and watch the fog disappear. I didn&#x27;t mount mine using the supplied suction cups. Instead I Removed the suction cups and mounted the hanging bracket to my shower caddy using plastic zip ties that can be picked up at any hardware store. This mounting technique guarentees that the mirror is well secured and won&#x27;t fall off during use. The razor hook also works great with my Mach 3 Turbo razor.</li>
            <li> Clip/hook for the shaver came off after a few days, weak glue. It doesn&#x27;t have a drain hole and I always forget to drain it after use. Drill a hole at the bottom that&#x27;s small enough to keep the hot water for fogless use but enough for water to drip out if you forget to empty it.</li>
            <li> received this mirror a couple of days ago and wet the cups to stick it to the tile and within 30 seconds both suction cups released and the the mirror fell off, so i figured id try sticking it to the large mirror over my sink, same results! these suction cups are not smooth on the underside like most cups you see and so they can&#x27;t make a good seal against a known non-porous surface like a mirror or tile. if it weren&#x27;t for the piece of crap suction cups this little mirror wouldn&#x27;t be that bad, but until they fix the problem DON&#x27;T BUY this piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> This is the only shower mirror that I have ever owned so I am not an expert but I can tell you that it is a well made product that does what I want it to do.  My shower is a plastic lined affair and where mirror is mounted the surface is not flat and vertical but top mounting point is offset from bottom mounting point. This is no problem because bottom suction cup is adjustable to allow you to make mirror plumb vertically.  Suction cups have not lost there suction after weeks of hanging on surface. Once mirror cavity is filled with water it is indeed fog free. It even had drain hole to empty water out of cavity after a while.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many fogless mirrors and eventually they loose their fogless feature (and I don&#x27;t clean them with Windex, etc).  This is a great design, there is no fogless film, it uses water temp.  It just takes a second to fill it with warm water from the shower head and you get a true fogless mirror.  I bought this one as a backup.</li>
            <li> I looked for a fogless mirror for a couple months and after reading review after review I came across this mirror on Amazon. I have used it for the past month now and absolutely love it. It is a very basic mirror so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you really wanted the back-lighting or if you wanted a radio, but the design is simple and it works very well. Its very easy to fill the \\&quot;basin\\&quot; with shower water and you can see the fog disappear as soon as you put it back on the holster. Simple and functional, and a great price!</li>
            <li> Out of all of the fogless mirrors I have purchesed for my husband, this one is by far the best!  And it also happens to be the least expensive.  It has a simple, no brainer design that keeps the mirror from ever fogging.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I finally have found a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up!  After you mount it to your shower wall (clean smooth walls preferred)with suction cups, all you need to do is remove the mirror part, fill it with the shower water you are using, and put it back in the holder.  This gives up to 15 minutes of fog free viewing as the water slowly drips out the bottom.  A bit disconcerting after you shut things off, since the water continues to drip out, but it&#x27;s dripping into a shower so no worries.  Great product and design.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm!  I was shocked how effective this concept was, and it works much better than the standard fogless mirrors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was tired of putting soap or shampoo on my old \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror every time to try to make it just clear enough to make out the outline of my face. So, I ran across this, read the reviews and decided to get one. After using this for a couple months now I will never use anything else for my shower mirror. It has worked flawlessly! It is great to see when simple science can can come together with a well thought out design to meet your needs. I have had 0 issues with this product so far and would recommend it to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is truly fog-free. You fill it with hot water from your shower and it stays clear and drains itself when you are through. It couldn&#x27;t be simpler!</li>
            <li> After scouring amazon for a shower mirror, I decided on this one--currently the highest rated shower mirror I could find.  With shipping and tax (via Target; amazon didn&#x27;t have it) this was like $26, and I have to say it&#x27;s not even close to worth it.    First off this mirror has *no* fog-free characteristics whatsoever unless you fill it with water.  Unless you&#x27;re carefully filling it from a faucet or tub spout beforehand, you&#x27;re likely planning to use the shower head to fill it.  My shower head covers the whole front of the mirror with water droplets while filling the reservoir (as I imagine anyone&#x27;s would) so no matter what I&#x27;m shaving through those and/or having to wipe the whole thing down before use.  I think the reservoir \\&quot;funnel\\&quot; has to be a LOT bigger and/or a different shape to not have to soak the entire front of the thing while filling it.  I could take any mirror and hose it off in the shower and it would be \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; for a couple of minutes.    Also some have said the fog free effect lasts a long time once you fill it--a claim I vehemently disagree with.  The box says the mirror should not drain totally until 20 minutes have passed--mine takes about 3 minutes to drain totally after filling and then it&#x27;s covered with fog.  It drains so fast I&#x27;m tempted to fill the hole used to drain closed and then just dump the water in the reservoir out when I&#x27;m done.  The drain cuts the time on this WAY too short.    Some have had problems with the suction mechanism--mine seems to stay attached to the wall well.  Have they changed the cups since those reviews were written?  Perhaps this depends a lot on your shower wall surface--ours is smooth but it stays put for at least many weeks at a time--I&#x27;ll take it off and clean behind it every few weeks. It seems to me like the design of the suction and the removable mirror was done pretty well...which puts me in complete opposite opinion of most of the reviews here.  I&#x27;d say \\&quot;bad mirror, decent mount\\&quot; while most are sayingthe opposite.    I&#x27;d love to recommend a product I&#x27;ve found that works better here but I don&#x27;t have one.  It seems the shower mirror thing is still a work in progress.  Hopefully someday someone will invent a mirror that works effectively on its own and stays fog free without having to fill a reservoir.  Having to fill this and wipe this adds a lot of fiddling around that it seems like could be eliminated by a better product or better design.</li>
            <li> The mirror is exactly what it claims, a fogless shower mirror and it is a great value. I have used the expensive ones, and they did not last half this long or even stay fogless or adhere to the wall as long as this version has. It has served me well for over 1 year so far, but that is where my satisfaction has ended. In the last 30 days, the resevoir \\&quot;drain\\&quot; has become clogged and the \\&quot;razor holder\\&quot; has fallen off. Every attempt to roto-rooter out the pin sized drain hole has failed and even Super Glue has not adhered the razor holder back in place because it is too smooth and is always wet.    That said, it is the best fogless shower mirror I have EVER purchased....</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  Simple design, suction cups that stick where you put them, shows a reflection.  Does everything it said it would, and I&#x27;m trilled with the pricepoint.</li>
            <li> This works great.  It really does stay fog free.  I purchased this mirror after reading reviews for all the others that do not do very well at staying fog free.  This one really does.  The razor holder is kind of small, but not to big of a deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using show mirrors for the last 20 years and most of them are horrible.  This is by far the most ingenious idea and it actually works!  Only issue I had was the tiny hole that drains got clogged but a thin wire cleared it out.  Forget attaching plumbing, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I fill it with water and it is fog-free throughout my shower. It slowly drips and it is still dripping after I step out. I have a glass wall and it sticks extremely well. The tile in my shower is rough and it did not stick there. Like another reviewer I have tried other shower mirrors and after a while I had to resort to putting a thin film of soap on them to keep them relatively fog free.  The one shower mirror that used to work as well was the one from Sharper Image that attaches directly to the shower head.  That worked really well but it was expensive and now my new shower is located higher up thus making it infeasible.  I don&#x27;t understand any of the reviewers who claim this fogs up. My bathroom is always cold and my showers always hot.  EVERYTHING fogs up except this mirror.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am rating this a 4 stars instead of 5 is because the water runs through in less than 20 minutes, so you have to fill it up again in the shower.  Other than that, it does what it states and works well. good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the company who produces this product.  I&#x27;ve owned since July 2010.  The suctions cups did start having a problem with sticking.  I contacted the company and they immediately offered a replacement without me even asking.  Evidently they are trying to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the suction cup problem but they backed their product up immeidately.  Below are some tips for keeping it stuck to your bathroom wall.      Clean the suction cups AND the wall REALLY WELL youre attaching it to and you&#x27;ll have no problem with this product.  To keep it stuck longer on the wall, use a drop of mineral on the rim of the suction cups.  It works GREAT, the concept behind is so simple!  No chemicals to use.  I&#x27;ve had fogless mirrors for years but by far this one works the best.  I waited a month before writing this review to make sure it worked.  I wish they made a magnified one?</li>
            <li> Have tried many fog less mirrors for shaving in the shower and none have done the job this mirror does providing a view for shaving...  if you like to shave in the shower and don&#x27;t need lights, radios or special holders for shave cream or brush, this is an excellent choice...</li>
            <li> great travel accessory. A little bulky for my toiletry bag</li>
            <li> This mirror is wonderful for shaving in the shower.    It works perfectly well and is easy to use.    My only two complaints would be the size (it is a little small) and the razor holder is too small for a normal Mach 3 razor.    The suction system works well (it hasn&#x27;t come off in over a month).    This mirror will not fog at all if you fill it up with water!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve beens shaving in shower for decades, and have tried many approaches/devices etc. to try to maintain a clear mirror. Sprays, \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors, etc.    This product solves the problem the old-fashioned way, by simply eliminating the cause: the temperature difference between the mirror surface and the surrounding air. By filling the reservoir behind the mirror with shower-temperature water, the mirror warms up almost instantly, and fog simply never forms. Nothing to apply, nothing that wears out, etc. And the little hole in the bottom means the water will drop out on its own after a short while.    My only gripe is that it offers no mounting solution except for suction cups, which don&#x27;t work on my textured tile. But a simple clear silicon sealant used as a glue solved that.    Overall, a simple, effective solution.</li>
            <li> This does what it says, great suction hold, easy to fill, drains itself and the mirror stays fog-free.  Really a great product and I can now see to shave up close without having to wash off the mirror every 10 seconds.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Worked good for a few months. Fell off the wall about once a month. Now the bottom suction will not stick at all. I&#x27;ve tried on glass and tile, no luck. I&#x27;ll be buying a different one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who \\&quot;has it all\\&quot; but complained about never being able to shave in the shower. Gone are those days! He can use this very easily and it adjusts to his tall height (6&#x27;4). The water drips out on its own which is great and it&#x27;s also a very sturdy mirror--the suction cup has dropped a few times but the mirror is still reflective and intact!</li>
            <li> This would have been the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had. It always stayed fog-free every time I used it, but there is one big problem with it. The suction cups are too weak. The mirror fell off my wall at least 3 times a month, under the weight of the water inside the reservoir. If this had better suction cups, this would be the best shower mirror out there, but until they improve this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless you plan to glue it to your wall.</li>
            <li> Solid product. Using for over a year every day.&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups on this thing still did not fail.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  I just ordered another one for the other bathroom.  It works perfectly, except, as others have noted, the suction cups could be a bit more robust.  My Gillette razor fits just fine in the holder - you turn it sideways to pull or push the thinnest part of the razor handle through the mirror holder arms.  There are two of us who use it and the height adjustment is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> mirror works great for shaving in shower to prevent fogging. it has a reservoir to put hot water in back of mirror that lets drops of it out automatically so you dont have to remove it. i get a better shave in shower and does the job for the price will see how long it lasts though</li>
            <li> I had previously bought my husband a clock radio with a mirror for the shower.  Off course it didn&#x27;t work! Let face it, unless your willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a radio that is water proof totally, you may as well forget all the gimmicks and buy this mirror.  It does the job brilliantly and really works! What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  It works.  You fill up a reservoir with hot water and it&#x27;ll keep the mirror fogless for 10 minutes or so.  The mirror isn&#x27;t glass, so it&#x27;s not completely straight, but it doesn&#x27;t affect shaving at all.   If/when this breaks, I will buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This mirror works great!  I love it.  Fill the back reservoir with shower water and hang it back up on the suction cup mount.  It self drains so there is no need to empty it.  I have seen the reviews saying that it falls down.  You have to apply it to a clean, flat surface.  I put it up 3 months ago and no problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the Oxo fogless shower mirror.  I liked the style and the suction cup on the Oxo model but it would fog up every minute or two.  This model from Ace actually stays fog free.  If I run the shower for a bit before filling the reservoir it will fog up, but once I put water in the reservoir the fog goes away and stays away on it&#x27;s own.  The suction cups seem to work just fine as well.  It hasn&#x27;t fallen off since I mounted it to the shower wall a week ago.  I like the small size.  Big enough for me to see my face, small enough not to take up alot of wall space.  This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a fraction of the cost of others. Looks fine, attached well to the shower wall and works. Could do with being a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Fell apart wouldn&#x27;t recommend it . Too bad had high hopes for it too. Didn&#x27;t work out. Hubby not happy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who shaves in the shower. Unfortunately, the suction does not work because the tiles in our shower are textured. I&#x27;m sure it would work if we had smooth tiles though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a truly fog-less mirror look no further.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a year and it is an excellent fog-less mirror.  It has worked brilliantly for me. Never has it let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that most people complain about the suction cups, but I suspect that they either have a poor surface to place it on or just not cleaning or applying it properly. In the time that I&#x27;ve owned it it has only come loose a hand full of time and likely because I&#x27;ve bumped it. I simply fill it with water at every shower and voila it stays fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe is that occasionally the pin hole at the bottom where the water slowly drips out becomes clogged. I just run it under the stream and it clears up no problem.&lt;br /&gt;This is the mirror you need. Trust me.</li>
            <li> This is almost the perfect shower mirror.  The only problem is the suction cups, which don&#x27;t suck very much, which sucks.  The mirror has a habit of falling down periodically, but thankfully, usually not when actually using it.  I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve gone to the shower in the morning to find the mirror on the tub floor.  For all that, it&#x27;s held up remarkably well.  The little razor holder finally broke off but I didn&#x27;t use that much anyway so I&#x27;m not to upset about that.  The important part is the fogless mirror.  That works just great.  You&#x27;ll want to clean the soap scum off periodically, but that&#x27;s no design flaw, simply the cost of keeping something in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned several shower mirrors in the past, and this is by far the best one.  If they put better suction cups on I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent fogless mirror for shower shaving. Just fill with water and the mirror remains clear for the entire length of your shower. The suction cups work great, it has yet to fall off in 2 months of owning it. The price is right. If your are looking for a mirror for your shower I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Works Okay but does fall off at times. Loses suction.</li>
            <li> This is a simple solution for a fogless mirror in a shower. I used to have a mirror that attached to the water pipe, but that required a more complicated installation, and it moved the shower head our further from the wall. The Ace mirror just attaches to a glass surface with suction cups, and you fill it with warm water when you need it to be fogless. I love the simplicity of it.</li>
            <li> I have had multiple shower mirrors that claim they are \\&quot;anti-fog.\\&quot;  This is the ONLY one that actually lives up to its title!  I used one from Brookstone for a while and I had to put soapy water on it every time before I used it, starting day 3.  This one works perfectly.  No fog whatsoever.  The little reservoir is genius.  I only wish I had thought of it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only areas for improvement I can think of are that it could be a little bit bigger and the apparatus to hold the razor is pretty pathetic.  I have a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide and the handle doesn&#x27;t fit in the holder.  I have seen other reviewers say the same thing.  Fix these two small issues and it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  You put hot water in a little dispenser attached as a base to the mirror and it prevents fogging while in the shower.  The suction cups are great, a very underrated feature with a shower product.  Can&#x27;t really say much more about it, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I had tried other fogless mirrors with no luck. I have had this for more than a month now, and it works just as advertised.  The hot water in the reserve tank keeps the mirror fog free for the entire length of my shower.  The only downside is, I wish it were just a little bigger - it works fine the way it is, but a little bigger would have been better.  Also, I have a one piece, flexible plastic shower insert in my bath, and the suction cups would not stick to this at all - I ended up adding a little clear silicon caulk to the suction cups, and it has been great.  Instead of taking the mirror off and on all the time, I Just keep a plastic cup in the shower and refill the tank when I get in the shower.</li>
            <li> Wow, great idea.  The hot water reservoir  reduces fog on the mirror surface quite well.  My old shower mirror did not have that feature so I had to buy Zadro anti-fog spray.  With the Zadro, I would spray the mirror after I got in the shower (not the night before); it would wet the mirror and keep it from fogging.  That process was fine except that I had to keep purchasing the bottles of solution.  Now, with the ACE mirror -- no Zadro needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of fog free time is limited so you have to be conscious of when you fill the reservoir.  It will give you a good 5 mins of fog-free time for shaving (plenty of time for me).  If you need more time you can always refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was contemplating this purchase I was concerned that the razor holder would not hold my razor (disposable Mach III).  I took a chance and was relieved to find out that the arms of the razor holder are flexible and can expand to fit a wide range of razor brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the suction cups work too.  I made sure the surface of my shower was clean, wetted the cups and pressed them onto the wall firmly.  They have held nicely for about a week now.  I will let you know if they fail to hold later on.</li>
            <li> Although I initially had trouble with it sticking to the wall - which was overcome by adding some dish soap detergent suds to the 2 suction cups, the actual fogless mirror concept \\&quot;technology\\&quot; / engineering used by this mirror does work perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely hot water in a easily steamed-up bathroom and this thing does not fog a bit.  Really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little shaver holder plastic piece falls off easily but for me that is a minor detail, I don&#x27;t use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ACE, excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 2 years ago and the product was outstanding. It does what it says it does. It&#x27;s common sense really on how it works, but it&#x27;s great that companies have adapted this idea. The only fault that I found was that it was not able to hold my Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband about a year and a half ago. it&#x27;s fantastic. he uses it all the time! It&#x27;s only fallen off the wall twice in all the time we&#x27;ve had it.  He leaves it up all the time- there is no problem when it&#x27;s full with water, it doesn&#x27;t come crashing down. Actually the two times it did fall it was empty, so it definitely can hold the water.  The razor holder works fine for him, it holds it perfectly.  So far, it&#x27;s still going strong! Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror even though people said the suction cups don&#x27;t work well, what lick &amp; stick suction cups do? I used a Bicycle spoke (stainless steel) and bent it into a large U to go around the suction cup mount and and then bent two u shaped hooks on the open ends now it hangs over the shower door. End of suction cup problem. As far as the mirror fogging up as some have complained, I have had NONE of this. I have been using this for over 6 Months now and the only complaint I might have had would have been the suction cups (which I did not even try) So all in all this unit works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror in place for the better part of the year now and while I was originally disappointed that it seemed to be losing its \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; capabilities, which other negative reviewers have also mentioned, I found the solution that restored it to its original capabilities.  My mirror was becoming harder and harder to see in.  I tried some windex, that did nothing.  Then I tried some Lime-Away, which removes mineral deposits left from hard water.  The \\&quot;water droplet\\&quot; stains on the mirror all vanished and the mirror works likes it brand new again.  Some other negative posters have mentioned the suction cups aren&#x27;t strong enough.  Occasionally, I&#x27;ve had issues with the mirror falling down too, but again, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the suction cups also need to be kept clean in order to maintain their adhesion.  This is not a set it and forget it mirror.  It needs to be appropriately cared for and it will continue to work as advertised.  And for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Ive tried many, and let me tell you.  From the high end sharper image mirror/radio/shower light/etc models all the way down to the kohls cheapos - this one is the best because its simple, you just add the water and it will not fog.  The suction has fallen off a couple times but overall I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it. The only thing he didnt like was that the razor holder did not fit his razor. He had to still place that around the tub. However, he loved that it stayed clear even in the shower.</li>
            <li> pros&lt;br /&gt;1. the science actually works, it is the only mirror ive had that i didn&#x27;t have to&lt;br /&gt;rinse every 2 to 3 min&lt;br /&gt;2. it worked great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;1. the suction cups arent that strong, so i could not leave it at its spot in the shower,&lt;br /&gt;i had to place it every time and remove it afterwards,&lt;br /&gt;the suction cups only worked on my glass door, they did not work on marble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;others&lt;br /&gt;1. i didnt care too much about the suction cups because i was ready to put double sided tape on it&lt;br /&gt;once i found found the perfect spot, but then after a year it stopped working&lt;br /&gt;the glass got all white, i tried cleaning with a lot of things but they just didnt work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i still gave this 4 stars because im not entirely sure what happened to the glass&lt;br /&gt;one of my theories is that the cleaning lady cleaned it with some kind of chemical that ruined it&lt;br /&gt;although maybe its just dirty and i havent found the right product to clean it</li>
            <li> Been using this mirror for close to a year now and have yet to see any fog when shaving.  The included suction cups hold well and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I bought this, and now after over 6 months of use I can say it has lived up to its rating. If fed hot water beforehand, it remains fogless for at least 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve never had it fall or come loose from my ceramic tile wall. Every month or so the drain hole will get plugged, but takes just a few seconds to remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint: the razor holder is located where the water drains from the reservoir, so if you put a razor in the holder it will get (or remain) wet for some time.</li>
            <li> After a year or so.... so foggy I see nothing. Trying to clean the glass but no luck... It&#x27;s not glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update..&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning with lemon juice to remove mineral deposits, I got a little functionality back. Still not very clear but better. I would say about half as good as when new.&lt;br /&gt;changing update to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The first one of these mirrors that I bought lasted about 2 years, the only reason it needed to be replaced by #2 is it fell (for the 3rd time) and broke a bit.  It didn&#x27;t shatter, but it was leaking slightly so I decided it would make sense to replace it.  New one came, and it&#x27;s just as good as the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it may sound like this wasn&#x27;t a great experience... the mirrors that I had purchased before these would typically last a month or two before the anti-fogging material would wear off, making shaving a \\&quot;best guess\\&quot; scenario...  The idea of putting heated water right behind the mirror is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mirror - and if this one is as good as the last, I&#x27;ll happily come back in a few years for another one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: About 6 months in, the water doesn&#x27;t always drip out from the mirror, so make sure you are aware it might be full of cold water (relatively) when you go to refill it for its next use. I&#x27;ve tried poking a needle into the drip hole with very mild success, I think I may try CLR next as we have fairly \\&quot;hard\\&quot; water. I&#x27;m still pleased with the mirror and really dislike shaving without it. I&#x27;ve often wondered why hotels don&#x27;t have industrial, non removable versions of these.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this mirror. The first time was at Walmart. I lost the base between moves but it lasted me 4 years before I had to finally order this new one. Works great!!  FOR ALL YOU IDIOTS GIVING BAD REVIEWS....TRY WETTING DOWN THE SUCTION CUPS, THEN RUB HAND SOAP OR EVEN HAIR GEL. MINE STUCK PERFECT ON A NOT SO FRIENDLY SHOWER WALL!!!  i&#x27;m buying another for my 2nd bathroom</li>
            <li> For what it is, a shaving mirror, it works great! Simple idea, well made, does not fog up, I use it daily, wish I had one years ago.</li>
            <li> The hubby has this in the shower and uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.... he likes it!</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower--and this mirror works very well for the price.  You have to fill the back of it with water before using it in the shower.  I think that it stays fog-free for about ten minutes.</li>
