            <li>don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d venture to speculate that most folks who spend upwards of $30 on hand cream aren&#x27;t the type to \\&quot;scam a company\\&quot; for hand lotion!  </li>
            <li>but this one sure does!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Just absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff that I have been using for about 5 years now.  </li>

            <li>Love the  coriander and olive scent...not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>not too many creams work for me</li>
            <li>In addition, I use Cucina Hand Wash Foaming and love that too.  </li>
            <li>and it is definitely the best I ever used!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite soap and hand cream.</li>
            <li>Love this hand cream for the kitchen.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>All scents are light and refreshing.   </li>
            <li>Cucina is easy to use</li>
            <li>I loved the first bottle so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect scent &amp; texture -- not too strong of an odor, just a subtle olive scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for at least 10 years and it is the best!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in the kitchen where you don&#x27;t want a bunch of gooey lotion to get transferred to other food or dishes</li>
            <li>Love the eco friendly refill package rather than having to purchase a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and scent is mild.  </li>
            <li>Both this hand lotion and the hand wash in this scent are my new favorite products.  </li>
            <li>High quality!!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily with no greasy feeling, yet leaves even dry skin feeling smooth and smelling clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and find it to be far superior to anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Most give nice initial relief from dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions.  </li>
            <li>In fact, after 3 emails in which they asked me to somehow scoop out the mixture, put it in a beaker or glass jar, photograph it, scan the photo into the computer or mail it to them, they also told me I&#x27;d be responsible for paying return freight, insurance, and customs charges just to the</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The handcream and soaps from Cucina are worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>My hands are so soft!</li>
            <li>I t is also excellent for feet that have been in cold wet conditions.  </li>
            <li>Ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go along with the hand soap...keep it in the kitchen, and use it frequently after I wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>No, they&#x27;re likely similar to me; a middle-aged business owner who took time out of her day to contact them about a faulty product: complete with SKU number, lot number and batch</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the best!!!!!  The Olive Oil is the magic ingredient.   All scents are light and refreshing.   I keep a supply in bathrooms, kitchen and at work!!!!    I&#x27;ve shared Cucina with many friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions.  Most give nice initial relief from dry skin.  The Cucina lotion does that, but it also lasts and lasts.  Amazing stuff that I have been using for about 5 years now.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Cucina makes the best products.  Great hand cream with wonderful fragrance.  Not greasy at all. Keep it on your kitchen counter.</li>
            <li> The handcream and soaps from Cucina are worth the extra money.  They smell great, but aren&#x27;t overpowering.  We keep them in the kitchen and bathrooms, and Amazon has a great price for the original containers and the refills.</li>
            <li> Both this hand lotion and the hand wash in this scent are my new favorite products.  And I have tried a ton of brands. I loved the first bottle so much I immediately ordered a refill just to make sure I don&#x27;t ever have to go without!  It&#x27;s a perfect scent &amp; texture -- not too strong of an odor, just a subtle olive scent.  And not too greasy or buttery -- perfect thickness of lotion.    It&#x27;s great in the kitchen where you don&#x27;t want a bunch of gooey lotion to get transferred to other food or dishes but I also have it in all of my bathrooms as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a fav of mine-it really smooths and softens the hands and a little goes a long way.High quality!!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff.  The seller was great too!!  The transaction went as planned.  The hand soap is incredible.  A friend gave me the soap and lotion in a ceramic dish as a gift.  I fell in love with it and now cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Cucina products ever since I received hand cream as a gift.  It is so silky and smooth...not greasy.  Love the  coriander and olive scent...not overpowering.  Luxurious at a great price.  Makes a wonderful hostess gift!</li>
            <li> I thought spending this much money on hand lotion was ridiculous.  Until I smelled it.  Then I loved it.....................Then I hated it.  It separated.  Pushing the pump deposited an oily water-like substance in my hand.  No amount of shaking it up would make the cement-like cream in the bottom remix with the oily water on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went all the way back to the manufacturer in Canada and offered to return it to them for a replacement.  They \\&quot;don&#x27;t do that.\\&quot;  In fact, after 3 emails in which they asked me to somehow scoop out the mixture, put it in a beaker or glass jar, photograph it, scan the photo into the computer or mail it to them, they also told me I&#x27;d be responsible for paying return freight, insurance, and customs charges just to the get them the bottle.......................for them to look at................BEFORE they even gave me an answer on a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d venture to speculate that most folks who spend upwards of $30 on hand cream aren&#x27;t the type to \\&quot;scam a company\\&quot; for hand lotion!  No, they&#x27;re likely similar to me; a middle-aged business owner who took time out of her day to contact them about a faulty product: complete with SKU number, lot number and batch number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, Fruits &amp; Passion {Cucina}.  Shame on you.</li>
            <li> Because this cream smells good and its a great product and it does work for my hands! not too many creams work for me but this one sure does!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 10 years and it is the best!  Not greasy and scent is mild.  In addition, I use Cucina Hand Wash Foaming and love that too.  Please continue to carry this forever!</li>
            <li> I use both the hand soap and hand lotion in the kitchen and it is definitely the best I ever used! My hands are so soft! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite soap and hand cream. It was a gift I Got for Mother&#x27;s day several years ago. Sense I have moved, I am happy I can still get it.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, pleasant scent, silky feel.  Love the eco friendly refill package rather than having to purchase a new bottle.  Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Great price.  I like the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> There are two products I use when weather and conditions cause painful dryness and cracking of the skin on the hands.  One is \\&quot;Bag Balm\\&quot; used by dairy farmers on cows.  With bag Balm I put it on my hands then wear latex gloves.  This works well at night.  I learned this trick from river boaters.  The other whiclh is easier to use any time of the day is Cucina Lotion.  I t is also excellent for feet that have been in cold wet conditions.  Cucina is easy to use may be used any time of day or night.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream for the kitchen. Works perfectly while cooking and washing hands so often. Ingredients are natural. I have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with the hand soap...keep it in the kitchen, and use it frequently after I wash my hands.  Just absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and find it to be far superior to anything I have ever used.  It absorbs easily with no greasy feeling, yet leaves even dry skin feeling smooth and smelling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Perfect with the purifying hand wash</li>
