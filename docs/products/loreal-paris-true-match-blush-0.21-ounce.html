    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>is the best dupe for dandelion by benefit.  </li>
            <li>Very happy to find it and amazon always has the best prices.</li>
            <li>, I just knew I was very fair.</li>
            <li>which is a great plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it as a &amp;#34;all over the face&amp;#34; powder, it is then a perfect match</li>
            <li>This color is great on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it still looks good after 10 hours of work.  </li>
            <li>Always loved this blush.</li>
            <li>A good deal.</li>
            <li>One arrived in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this blush.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I currently own both of the products</li>
            <li>Nice shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy add more by layering without the color becoming too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>also love the Subscribe &amp; Save price.</li>
            <li>I really love this blush by L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>I love that the colors are divided into cool, warm, and neutral tones, and there are about 4 or 5 selections in each category.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re in (Warm, Neutral, or Cool)</li>
            <li>When it showed up (very quickly)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blush right now!</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice, healthy, natural looking flush.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone with a light complexion.</li>
            <li>I thought, man this is too light.</li>
            <li>so if you decide you want to smooth it in with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it (located in the bottom compartment of the compact) works well as an applicator (it doesn&#x27;t feel like one of those cheap drugstore brushes)</li>
            <li>This was too light a blush for me, even though their site color match said Baby Blossom was the color I needed.</li>
            <li>I have dark eyes and hair and although it appears to be for more fair complexions it suited me just fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to blend into your foundation/powder</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fairly simple to pick a color that will look good on you.  </li>
            <li>Loreal true match blush in baby blossom</li>
            <li>I had no idea my skin was a cool color</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shade of pink to make me look like I have natural color in my face.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing makeup for years but am new to wearing blush and this is the first powder blush I&#x27;ve purchased (the others I own</li>
            <li>When it first goes on you&#x27;ll notice a light sweep of color that enhances your complexion.  </li>
            <li>color I&#x27;m reviewing, Baby Blossom (a cool tone), is very pink and rosy and gives my fair-skinned complexion a bright, fresh look.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth it.</li>
            <li>Ilike it very much as I am older and it is easy to put on without getting to much and look like a clown.</li>
            <li>Most people think that I rarely wear makeup when I actually wear this makeup every day.  </li>
            <li>IT does look very natural and is light.</li>
            <li>take the quiz, and amazon shipped it very fast.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use two different colors.  </li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and look natural.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and still love it</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a cute, natural looking blush, but the baby blossom color has zero pigment &amp; barely shows up on my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I really needed a blush brush.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>but I use a blush brush from E.L.F. that works really well too.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink and rosy Baby Blossom shade and can&#x27;t wait to try out others in the collection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right shade - very soft, very subtle, goes on perfectly and stays on relatively well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular blush for years.  </li>
            <li>but there are usually $1-$2 coupons in weekend papers or online that make this product very affordable for most budgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product itself once you open and use it, but there was a weird sticky substance on the clear outside top of the blush and it almost made me not want to open the product.</li>
            <li>and I must say they look and feel almost exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty pink that has a bit of shimmer to it.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural when I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the True Match line of cosmetics for a little over 3 years</li>
            <li>The applicator for this is a small brush that works fine, however I use a larger brush by Eco-Tools for the application.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they were either damaged from shipping or damaged before shippping.  </li>
            <li>I am a pale person so finding the right blush has always been tricky for me.  </li>

            <li> This is my favorite blush right now! Would recommend it to anyone with a light complexion. Very pleased with this blush.</li>
            <li> Ilike it very much as I am older and it is easy to put on without getting to much and look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the True Match line of cosmetics for a little over 3 years and I LOVE it! Once you figure out which undertone group you&#x27;re in (Warm, Neutral, or Cool), it&#x27;s fairly simple to pick a color that will look good on you.  I use the shade \\&quot;Baby Blossom.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a very pretty pink that has a bit of shimmer to it.  It looks natural when I&#x27;m wearing it.  Most people think that I rarely wear makeup when I actually wear this makeup every day.  The shimmer isn&#x27;t obvious unless I hold my face within centimeters of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it to my cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin.  It gives me a nice, healthy, natural looking flush.  Some days if I get a little heavy with it, coworkers will ask me if I&#x27;ve been outside in the sun.  It lasts most of the day.  It does fade a little but I feel like it still looks good after 10 hours of work.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it being messy.  You get a lot of product that seems to last me for a while.  I don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with, which is oddly shaped for a blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Subscribe &amp; Save price.</li>
            <li> Loreal true match blush in baby blossom is the best dupe for dandelion by benefit.  I currently own both of the products and I must say they look and feel almost exactly the same.  Very happy to find it and amazon always has the best prices.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use two different colors.  They go on smoothly and look natural.  I have continued to purchase for about a year.</li>
            <li> Always loved this blush. Not too dark, it just barely highlights your cheeks. Only complaint is that it is very fragile and breaks easily which can make it a mess.</li>
            <li> The applicator for this is a small brush that works fine, however I use a larger brush by Eco-Tools for the application.</li>
            <li> I am a pale person so finding the right blush has always been tricky for me.  This is the perfect shade of pink to make me look like I have natural color in my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and still love it</li>
            <li> I took the quiz on the Loreal Paris website to see what color I should get. I had no idea my skin was a cool color, I just knew I was very fair. I ordered the color they suggested for me. When it showed up (very quickly) I thought, man this is too light. It&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So take the quiz, and amazon shipped it very fast.</li>
            <li> A good deal. I bought it because I really needed a blush brush.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Nice shade. Not high pigment. Breaks into bits before it is done.</li>
            <li> Great product itself once you open and use it, but there was a weird sticky substance on the clear outside top of the blush and it almost made me not want to open the product. I scrubbed it off with a cloth and soap and water, but still it was not appealing.</li>
            <li> I really love this blush by L&#x27;Oreal.  I have been wearing makeup for years but am new to wearing blush and this is the first powder blush I&#x27;ve purchased (the others I own are cream).  When it first goes on you&#x27;ll notice a light sweep of color that enhances your complexion.  It&#x27;s very easy add more by layering without the color becoming too overpowering.  It&#x27;s also super easy to blend into your foundation/powder so if you decide you want to smooth it in with your fingers.  The brush that comes with it (located in the bottom compartment of the compact) works well as an applicator (it doesn&#x27;t feel like one of those cheap drugstore brushes) but I use a blush brush from E.L.F. that works really well too.  It lasts all day on your face, even through 8-10 hours of school, work, humidity, sweat, etc. which is a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color I&#x27;m reviewing, Baby Blossom (a cool tone), is very pink and rosy and gives my fair-skinned complexion a bright, fresh look.  I love that the colors are divided into cool, warm, and neutral tones, and there are about 4 or 5 selections in each category.  The in-store price is around $8 but there are usually $1-$2 coupons in weekend papers or online that make this product very affordable for most budgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and believe you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I love the pink and rosy Baby Blossom shade and can&#x27;t wait to try out others in the collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular blush for years.  It&#x27;s just the right shade - very soft, very subtle, goes on perfectly and stays on relatively well.  Never obvious.</li>
            <li> This was too light a blush for me, even though their site color match said Baby Blossom was the color I needed. But I use it as a face powder and then a slightly darker blush. I love it as a &amp;#34;all over the face&amp;#34; powder, it is then a perfect match but I needed a darker blush to give a little color to my cheeks. IT does look very natural and is light. I like L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> I have dark eyes and hair and although it appears to be for more fair complexions it suited me just fine! I do not think you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 blushes.  One arrived in good condition.  The other two are crumbled, crushed remnants of formerly pressed powder.  I  can&#x27;t use them, so I&#x27;ll throw them away.  I&#x27;d NEVER ORDER this product online again.  Apparently, they were either damaged from shipping or damaged before shippping.  Whatever.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a cute, natural looking blush, but the baby blossom color has zero pigment &amp; barely shows up on my skin. Not even worth it.</li>
            <li> This color is great on my fair skin. It looks really natural and its hard to over-do it.</li>
