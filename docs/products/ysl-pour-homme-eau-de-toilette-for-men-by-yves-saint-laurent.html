    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Bought this as a gift, a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>This Yves St. Laurent cologne is perhaps one of the best Men&#x27;s colognes made by this Parfumeur.</li>
            <li>&#x27;just love it!!!!</li>
            <li>(For those who need help in math lol ).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that great though.</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne.</li>
            <li>And great shipping time.</li>
            <li>Very sophisticated scent that goes with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I placed this order, for those who know this particular brand will be happy as well.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for this perfume for so many years.  </li>
            <li>My order was filled and shipped expeditiously.</li>
            <li>After it settles in, the scent tones down and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It attracts the more mature women... which is good;)</li>
            <li>However the longer lasting musky earth tones were nowhere as good as the original.</li>
            <li>This has that crisp clean citrusy-woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>I still have some of the original left and was able to compare side to side.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m happily married and my wife loves the scent also.</li>
            <li>I hope it was not a fake one.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong and will last about 4 hours or so on you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>the smell of the Eau De Toilette lasted for couple of hours, but its the old smell all right.</li>
            <li>Some scents are timeless in that they are clean and simple; this is one of them.</li>
            <li>Brings back sweet memories for me</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>It smell very little like sandlewood and more like citrus.</li>
            <li>Starts out citrus crisp and evolves into a deep woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>Original did not have such a citrusy initial smell which isn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li>I got my first one, a set of toilet water, after shave, two belts (blue and tan), and a YSL weaved logo buckle at 18 over thirty years ago and always had one bottle around since.  </li>
            <li>it was a gift for may father and he was really surprised i get his old  cologne back.</li>
            <li>Stays long and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>the service was fast but some how the smell wont last long time.</li>
            <li>The back story is that I used to wear the cologne when I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>never got tired of its sweet classic smell...</li>
            <li>The price is right and the usual YSL quality has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>

            <li> I had been looking for this perfume for so many years.  I thought they were discontinued but I was wrong.  The back story is that I used to wear the cologne when I was 15 years old.  Now I am 42. (Do the math). I met my wife when we were both 15 (school sweetheart) so today when I got the perfume, I sprayed a little on my wrist and I asked her to smell without telling her what it was.  She immediately recognized the smell, and said \\&quot;that is the perfume when I met you 27 years ago. (For those who need help in math lol ). I am so happy that I placed this order, for those who know this particular brand will be happy as well.  Brings back sweet memories for me</li>
            <li> A classic. It is one of my all time favorites. Have been using it for years. Stays long and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This has that crisp clean citrusy-woodsy scent. I used to wear this when I was single and on the hunt back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s. Now I&#x27;m happily married and my wife loves the scent also. Starts out citrus crisp and evolves into a deep woodsy scent. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I still have some of the original left and was able to compare side to side.  Original did not have such a citrusy initial smell which isn&#x27;t a big deal.  However the longer lasting musky earth tones were nowhere as good as the original.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite a bit different than i imagined. It&#x27;s not all that great though. It smell very little like sandlewood and more like citrus. It&#x27;s pretty strong and will last about 4 hours or so on you. After it settles in, the scent tones down and is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> the service was fast but some how the smell wont last long time. the smell of the Eau De Toilette lasted for couple of hours, but its the old smell all right. I hope it was not a fake one.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it. It is not Funky Cold Medina, but women still dig it!</li>
            <li> Strange citrusy aroma but within a half hour no fragrance left.  Should have listened to previous reviewers.  Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> I have Opium from YSL and always like it cause it lasts all day,I&#x27;m kinda  disappointed with Pour Homme cause I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> It attracts the more mature women... which is good;)</li>
            <li> it was a gift for may father and he was really surprised i get his old  cologne back.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, a wonderful scent. Excellent product. And great shipping time.</li>
            <li> My order was filled and shipped expeditiously. This Yves St. Laurent cologne is perhaps one of the best Men&#x27;s colognes made by this Parfumeur. Very sophisticated scent that goes with my body chemistry. I have been using this cologne ever since my stint at University in Toulouse, France. I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> I got my first one, a set of toilet water, after shave, two belts (blue and tan), and a YSL weaved logo buckle at 18 over thirty years ago and always had one bottle around since.  The belts died along the way but I still have the buckle, somewhere.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle there was no smell coming from the bottle. I feel I was sold a bottle of colored liquid. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this scent at Champs Elysees way back and been wearing it ever since...never got tired of its sweet classic smell...&#x27;just love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Some scents are timeless in that they are clean and simple; this is one of them. The price is right and the usual YSL quality has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
