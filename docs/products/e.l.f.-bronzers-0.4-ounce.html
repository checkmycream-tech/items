            <li>The bronzer is perfect for me and my friends.</li>
            <li>Best purchase ever!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>The items arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The colors are excellent and the coverage is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great bronzer!</li>
            <li>this 3$ bronzer is the best I have used!!</li>
            <li>Best bargain bronzer I have come across yet!</li>
            <li>yet my skin doesnt look oily when applied its perfect</li>
            <li>rather use it separated to cr√©ate a flawless look applying the lighter color like a highlighter and the others to contour or kinda gold blush.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is the best bronzer I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Great bronzer for a great glow!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and avoid the sun because of it, so this bronzer is really great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s simply beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I think it works great..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for me.  </li>
            <li>The colors blend together great though and had it not been for the cracking I would have rated 5 stars.</li>
            <li>All of them where great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and is just as great as my NARS bronzer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to any makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Very nice bronzer/ highlighter for the price.</li>
            <li>Amazing value!</li>
            <li>The shimmer is also not over the top or anything, it creates just the perfect glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a great product that all of them loved.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this works great.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is perfect for the very fair who don&#x27;t really like bronzer.  </li>
            <li>good product, delivery on time</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I totally loved this.</li>
            <li>Good blend of colors.</li>
            <li>Still a good product</li>
            <li>However, it makes for one of the most beautiful highlighters</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been inspired by Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s golden perfect glow on her cheeks.</li>
            <li>I found them to be too light to provide any kind of bronzing effect (and I have very fair skin).  </li>
            <li>I love bargain!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the thing, I was looking for some nice bronzer to work as contouring powder as well.</li>
            <li>Product still gets four stars though because I picked my own color and should have known it would&#x27;ve needed to have been darker.</li>
            <li>then i would have liked.</li>
            <li>It is definitely great for the price but unless you want/need a very very light bronzer, I would suggest picking a darker shade than &amp;#34;golden.&amp;#34; I have light skin tone</li>
            <li>It is the perfect bronzer because it gives you color but is also a highlighter that gives you a soft glow.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and this is way too light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s not one color, the four colors blend together to form a nice, complimentary shade that&#x27;s really good to highlight with.</li>
            <li>I have been seriously striking out with the E.L.F brand of  cosmetics..  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
            <li>like some of the ELF products (mostly the studio brushes - fantastic!)</li>
            <li>and this is one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>I just love the colors and texture.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I love how it looks on my skin, I have combination skin</li>
            <li>Absolutely love how balanced the glow is after applying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I think there are some better products, but I did love it.</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>While it looks shimmery in the compact, it looks more matte when applied.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this powder.</li>
            <li>but when I put this bronzer on I look much more &amp;#34;alive.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this bronzer and bought many of these for family/friends as a gift.</li>
            <li>I think this pallette would make a better hilight color or could be used for contour.  </li>
            <li>Over all, I am pleased with the product, I just wish I would have ordered a darker bronzer.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I use this all the time and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but it really leaves a nice glow!</li>
            <li>Good thing about this &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; is that I use the lightest color as a high light and the golden for a eye shadow with is great</li>
            <li>I swear chose the warm bronzer, but received the golden bronzer.</li>
            <li>It is very shiny and does not look good on my face for bronzer.</li>
            <li>it brightens just right to give you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth buying especially for the wonderful price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t make my skin looks ashy.</li>
            <li>I agree this is true for most people.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer stays true all day and does not leave you with Barbie orange glow :)</li>
            <li>The cool bronzer is matte, unlike the shimmery golden and warm ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is fine.</li>
            <li>Good for fair skin since it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li>Also if you have any kind of oiliness to your skin, this will greatly inhibit your efforts to keep shine down -</li>
            <li>This bronzer gives you a nice glow but its not something that could be used if your looking for a good dark bronzer, I use this and then put a darker bronzer over top</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and having quality makeup you can trust is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li>Such a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>It is way too light.</li>
            <li>It just gives you a light sun-kissed look (by swirling all the colors together).</li>
            <li>Too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li>It looks good on my naturally tanned-olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s a good bronzer.</li>
            <li>Order 2 more they came packaged by itself from the other things I ordered and came in great condition...</li>
            <li>Very good price, fast shipping, I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Both the golden and the warm bronzer are nearly identical but the golden would be better if you have a neutral complexion.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>,I HAVE THE COOL</li>
            <li>SO I HAVE THIS ONE FOR HIGHLIGHT AND THE COOL FOR CONTOUR.</li>
            <li>I have auburn hair, blue eyes, super fair skin with freckles which burns in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The price tag is also pretty sweet!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the reasonable shipping cost since I live outside USA.</li>
            <li>Now, that I&#x27;m a bit better (I still don&#x27;t know much, but I feel I know more than the new people)</li>
            <li>It has a great color pallet which I also order in light medium and heavy.</li>
            <li>but those are SUPER pricey.</li>
            <li>I tried to combat this problem by applying more to my face and the only  affect was adding more shimmer.  </li>
            <li>The big mirror is very handy and the compact is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t normally use bronzer because I have yet to find one appropriate for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>got it pretty fast love this bronzer</li>
            <li>I use a matte foundation (Revlon Colorstay in problem areas with organic wear powder in translucent light all over) and I really like shine and glitter</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of ordering the E.L.F Golden Bronzer before I read even one review and I am paying for that mistake now.  </li>
            <li>This quad might  be nice for a younger woman.</li>
            <li>At Target and Walmart it retails for 3.00 - if you have one near you that is a better option.  </li>
            <li>This product, though lovely, is just too shimmery for the natural look for which I was going.</li>
            <li>Golden color is for fairer complexions.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and fresh like I&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun :)</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth application and great subtle, build-able color.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply just a tiny amount of glow right where you want it.  </li>
            <li>I have this in golden tones, and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend for light skinned people.</li>
            <li>It is a thin and sleek compact which is great, fits easily into my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>The colors in the Golden quad look really pretty while in the packaging but the bronzers do not transfer to skin.</li>
            <li>so its at least nice to be able to find it here.  </li>
            <li>I love this pallet, I use it everyday because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I love the sheer colours.</li>
            <li>I order 2 the first time..</li>
            <li>I love the case it comes in too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from my local \\&quot;T\\&quot; store.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought this product.</li>
            <li>Love the different tones to help for a blended look</li>
            <li>I bought this bronzer as my first bronzer</li>
            <li>The two patches on the left side of the \\&quot;Golden\\&quot; compact are better suited for highlighting -</li>
            <li>I was intimidated at first because this bronzer has shimmer, but once you apply it on the skin</li>
            <li>Very affordable and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; is not very dark like a bronzer would be it light and shimmers a lot , also product falls off.</li>
            <li>This is a simple bronzer palette, a touch on the lighter side which is great because I often find bronzers too dark.</li>
            <li>The color looks amazing but it broke and was a mess</li>
            <li>Nice, but a little lighter</li>
            <li>Very shimmery .</li>
            <li>This bronzer does not add much pigmentation to the skin at all...</li>
            <li>ELF has three different colored bronzers which are all lightly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>It is very shiny.  </li>
            <li>If you use a dewy foundation or prefer matte finish everywhere, it may be too much shine.  </li>
            <li>people have said that this isn&#x27;t really a bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li>For the price, you really cannot beat this bronzer.</li>
            <li>The color is very shimmery, so I think I will be purchasing a darker bronzer separately somewhere else.</li>
            <li>but  really wouldn&#x27;t pay almost $6 for something that is $3 in a drug store</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s VERY shimmery.  </li>
            <li>It is very shimmery</li>
            <li>Not too much shine</li>
            <li>Very silky when applied.</li>
            <li>and I live in a hot &amp; humid climate).</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love E.L.F lip glosses, that&#x27;s why I decided to try other E.L.F product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you look like a disco ball like so many other Highlighters do.</li>
            <li>When used properly, it gives skin a beautiful, dewy glow that&#x27;s actually hard to achieve from a powder makeup.</li>
            <li>I have tried all different kinds that come in many different price ranges and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it instead of the caked on and harmful products</li>
            <li>I apply a mix of the pink and light brown as a blush.  </li>
            <li>It does crumble if you are rough with it, but if you have a light touch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more long lasting than when I wear it alone.</li>
            <li>Now I can have a subtle and healthy glow on my cheeks too!</li>
            <li>The golden bronzer from elf is definitely too light to be a bronzer-I&#x27;m fairly pale</li>
            <li>The pallets on the left are fairly light , so this is not much of a bronzer</li>
            <li>However, the bronzer contains so much shimmer stuff that trying to actually bronze your face with it will leave you looking like a disco ball.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with it sticking once it is on my face.  </li>
            <li>I had to transfer the colors to a screw top round pot that I had left over from some used up night cream.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of Bronzers, But this one has a light and silky feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pale and it actually functions more as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>ELF products have little lists of ingredients and I am SUPER sensitive to make-up</li>
            <li>However, if you just want a normal bronzer for a lighter-toned skin, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>but again very shiny and looks kind of crazy.</li>
            <li>People with medium or dark complexions may like it very much as an illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very high shine to pigment ratio, which means you can get very \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; with very little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it barely shows up on me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re starting out, you shouldn&#x27;t buy anything too expensive.</li>
            <li>Firstly all of the bronzers powders have already cracked and chunks of powder or missing from all four colors.  </li>
            <li>One was fine the 2nd one was all broken up...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this all the time and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> but it really leaves a nice glow!</li>
            <li> Good thing about this &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; is that I use the lightest color as a high light and the golden for a eye shadow with is great</li>
            <li> I swear chose the warm bronzer, but received the golden bronzer.</li>
            <li> It is very shiny and does not look good on my face for bronzer.</li>
            <li> it brightens just right to give you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth buying especially for the wonderful price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t make my skin looks ashy.</li>
            <li> I agree this is true for most people.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer stays true all day and does not leave you with Barbie orange glow :)</li>
            <li> The cool bronzer is matte, unlike the shimmery golden and warm ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is fine.</li>
            <li> Good for fair skin since it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> Also if you have any kind of oiliness to your skin, this will greatly inhibit your efforts to keep shine down -</li>
            <li> This bronzer gives you a nice glow but its not something that could be used if your looking for a good dark bronzer, I use this and then put a darker bronzer over top</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and having quality makeup you can trust is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is way too light.</li>
            <li> It just gives you a light sun-kissed look (by swirling all the colors together).</li>
            <li> Too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> It looks good on my naturally tanned-olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s a good bronzer.</li>
            <li> Order 2 more they came packaged by itself from the other things I ordered and came in great condition...</li>
            <li> Very good price, fast shipping, I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Both the golden and the warm bronzer are nearly identical but the golden would be better if you have a neutral complexion.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> ,I HAVE THE COOL</li>
            <li> SO I HAVE THIS ONE FOR HIGHLIGHT AND THE COOL FOR CONTOUR.</li>
            <li> I have auburn hair, blue eyes, super fair skin with freckles which burns in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The price tag is also pretty sweet!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the reasonable shipping cost since I live outside USA.</li>
            <li> Now, that I&#x27;m a bit better (I still don&#x27;t know much, but I feel I know more than the new people)</li>
            <li> It has a great color pallet which I also order in light medium and heavy.</li>
            <li> but those are SUPER pricey.</li>
            <li> I tried to combat this problem by applying more to my face and the only  affect was adding more shimmer.  </li>
            <li> The big mirror is very handy and the compact is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally use bronzer because I have yet to find one appropriate for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the color is very pretty.</li>
            <li> got it pretty fast love this bronzer</li>
            <li> I use a matte foundation (Revlon Colorstay in problem areas with organic wear powder in translucent light all over) and I really like shine and glitter</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering the E.L.F Golden Bronzer before I read even one review and I am paying for that mistake now.  </li>
            <li> This quad might  be nice for a younger woman.</li>
            <li> At Target and Walmart it retails for 3.00 - if you have one near you that is a better option.  </li>
            <li> This product, though lovely, is just too shimmery for the natural look for which I was going.</li>
            <li> Golden color is for fairer complexions.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and fresh like I&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun :)</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth application and great subtle, build-able color.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply just a tiny amount of glow right where you want it.  </li>
            <li> I have this in golden tones, and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend for light skinned people.</li>
            <li> It is a thin and sleek compact which is great, fits easily into my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The colors in the Golden quad look really pretty while in the packaging but the bronzers do not transfer to skin.</li>
            <li> so its at least nice to be able to find it here.  </li>
            <li> I love this pallet, I use it everyday because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love the sheer colours.</li>
            <li> I order 2 the first time..</li>
            <li> I love the case it comes in too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from my local \\&quot;T\\&quot; store.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought this product.</li>
            <li> Love the different tones to help for a blended look</li>
            <li> I bought this bronzer as my first bronzer</li>
            <li> The two patches on the left side of the \\&quot;Golden\\&quot; compact are better suited for highlighting -</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first because this bronzer has shimmer, but once you apply it on the skin</li>
            <li> Very affordable and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; is not very dark like a bronzer would be it light and shimmers a lot , also product falls off.</li>
            <li> This is a simple bronzer palette, a touch on the lighter side which is great because I often find bronzers too dark.</li>
            <li> The color looks amazing but it broke and was a mess</li>
            <li> Nice, but a little lighter</li>
            <li> Very shimmery .</li>
            <li> This bronzer does not add much pigmentation to the skin at all...</li>
            <li> ELF has three different colored bronzers which are all lightly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> It is very shiny.  </li>
            <li> If you use a dewy foundation or prefer matte finish everywhere, it may be too much shine.  </li>
            <li> people have said that this isn&#x27;t really a bronzer.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> For the price, you really cannot beat this bronzer.</li>
            <li> The color is very shimmery, so I think I will be purchasing a darker bronzer separately somewhere else.</li>
            <li> but  really wouldn&#x27;t pay almost $6 for something that is $3 in a drug store</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s VERY shimmery.  </li>
            <li> It is very shimmery</li>
            <li> Not too much shine</li>
            <li> Very silky when applied.</li>
            <li> and I live in a hot &amp; humid climate).</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love E.L.F lip glosses, that&#x27;s why I decided to try other E.L.F product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you look like a disco ball like so many other Highlighters do.</li>
            <li> When used properly, it gives skin a beautiful, dewy glow that&#x27;s actually hard to achieve from a powder makeup.</li>
            <li> I have tried all different kinds that come in many different price ranges and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it instead of the caked on and harmful products</li>
            <li> I apply a mix of the pink and light brown as a blush.  </li>
            <li> It does crumble if you are rough with it, but if you have a light touch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more long lasting than when I wear it alone.</li>
            <li> Now I can have a subtle and healthy glow on my cheeks too!</li>
            <li> The golden bronzer from elf is definitely too light to be a bronzer-I&#x27;m fairly pale</li>
            <li> The pallets on the left are fairly light , so this is not much of a bronzer</li>
            <li> However, the bronzer contains so much shimmer stuff that trying to actually bronze your face with it will leave you looking like a disco ball.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with it sticking once it is on my face.  </li>
            <li> I had to transfer the colors to a screw top round pot that I had left over from some used up night cream.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of Bronzers, But this one has a light and silky feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pale and it actually functions more as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> ELF products have little lists of ingredients and I am SUPER sensitive to make-up</li>
            <li> However, if you just want a normal bronzer for a lighter-toned skin, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> but again very shiny and looks kind of crazy.</li>
            <li> People with medium or dark complexions may like it very much as an illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very high shine to pigment ratio, which means you can get very \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; with very little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it barely shows up on me.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re starting out, you shouldn&#x27;t buy anything too expensive.</li>
            <li> Firstly all of the bronzers powders have already cracked and chunks of powder or missing from all four colors.  </li>
            <li> One was fine the 2nd one was all broken up...</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product, however,  I&#x27;ve used ita couple times and am just not very impressed by it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s no where near dark enough to bronze up my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely try other colours in the future!</li>
            <li> Not worth it to me to buy more expensive bronzers anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer‚Ä¶..  but its a little expensive here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am sad to report that the E.L.F Golden Bronzer was a total miss.  </li>
            <li> The shipping came average, not too long.</li>
            <li> I do think its a little dark for my ghostly white face, but I took the risk anyway.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is hard to apply and gives essentially no color.</li>
            <li> and I thought that since it was cheap, that it was going to be bad.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for a dark coloring for cheeks</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that once the squares got about half used it started cracking and breaking up.</li>
            <li> I apply the lightest color down my nose.  </li>
            <li> From my light pale skin with freckles to my friends olive skin with bad acne.</li>
            <li> As my skin is on the dark side, I think I&#x27;ll just use this set as an eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> you want to buy this for the bronzing effects, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I always test it on myself and a few friends.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is barely any pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this bronzer is that it only lasts up to 5 hours or so (maybe because I have combination skin</li>
            <li> Very little pigment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past including maybe line, cover girl, prescriptives.</li>
            <li> You have to use an excessive amount just to get it to show up.</li>
            <li> the mornings I am usually very pale for at least an hour after I wake up</li>
            <li> I like that the squares are next to eachother but not in a crazy design or pattern</li>
            <li> Prefect color combination, subtle tones</li>
            <li> Subtle color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very pale, so this bronzer gives me a touch of color and lasts all day without having to reapply!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I clicked on the wrong one or it was delivered wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using expensive bronzers (Hoola, Sephora brand, theBalm Hula)</li>
            <li> Problem solved when I wear pre make up base though.</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product will not get again.</li>
            <li> Horrible doesn&#x27;t even show up on ur face</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> got it pretty fast love this bronzer</li>
            <li> ELF products have little lists of ingredients and I am SUPER sensitive to make-up so their makeup is the only way I can wear any. I appreciate the company sticking to the basics and being so affordable. The bronzer is perfect for me and my friends. From my light pale skin with freckles to my friends olive skin with bad acne. Highly recommend it instead of the caked on and harmful products I&#x27;ve used in the past including maybe line, cover girl, prescriptives. Only one it compares to is my bobbi brown and yves rocher but those are SUPER pricey.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t show up on any skin tone , it jut shows up as a shimmer of whit‚Ä¶. very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this pallet, I use it everyday because I love it so much! Best purchase ever! Defiantly worth buying especially for the wonderful price!</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that the E.L.F Golden Bronzer was a total miss.  Firstly all of the bronzers powders have already cracked and chunks of powder or missing from all four colors.  I made the mistake of ordering the E.L.F Golden Bronzer before I read even one review and I am paying for that mistake now.  I have been seriously striking out with the E.L.F brand of  cosmetics..  The colors in the Golden quad look really pretty while in the packaging but the bronzers do not transfer to skin. Unfortunately there is barely any pigmentation.  I tried to combat this problem by applying more to my face and the only  affect was adding more shimmer.  This quad might  be nice for a younger woman. This product gets my stamp of disapproval.</li>
            <li> Very shimmery . The pallets on the left are fairly light , so this is not much of a bronzer but I&#x27;ll still be using it. I like the quality in which it came &amp; how it includes a mirror. The shipping came average, not too long. Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for a great glow!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Luxxe Beauty. I was very happy with the reasonable shipping cost since I live outside USA. Anyway, I love E.L.F lip glosses, that&#x27;s why I decided to try other E.L.F product. This bronzer is a pleasant surprise. I love the sheer colours. It&#x27;s not too shimmery yet it makes my face look glowing. I&#x27;ve always been inspired by Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s golden perfect glow on her cheeks. Now I can have a subtle and healthy glow on my cheeks too! The only bad thing about this bronzer is that it only lasts up to 5 hours or so (maybe because I have combination skin and I live in a hot &amp; humid climate). Problem solved when I wear pre make up base though. It&#x27;s more long lasting than when I wear it alone. I&#x27;ll definitely try other colours in the future! You can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
            <li> I have this in golden tones, and I like it very much. It has 4 tones so you can blend them, or use separately. but I want to warn that it glitters like a lot. But it&#x27;s perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> This bronzer does not add much pigmentation to the skin at all... You have to use an excessive amount just to get it to show up. However, the bronzer contains so much shimmer stuff that trying to actually bronze your face with it will leave you looking like a disco ball.</li>
            <li> I order 2 the first time.. One was fine the 2nd one was all broken up... Amazon credit it back. Order 2 more they came packaged by itself from the other things I ordered and came in great condition... My daughter friend told me to try this bronzer and I think it works great.. Would buy again..</li>
            <li> The color looks amazing but it broke and was a mess so I didnt bother to even start swatching. &#x3D;*(</li>
            <li> ELF has three different colored bronzers which are all lightly pigmented.  Both the golden and the warm bronzer are nearly identical but the golden would be better if you have a neutral complexion.  The cool bronzer is matte, unlike the shimmery golden and warm ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally use bronzer because I have yet to find one appropriate for my complexion.  I have auburn hair, blue eyes, super fair skin with freckles which burns in about 5 minutes.  This bronzer is perfect for the very fair who don&#x27;t really like bronzer.  It is very easy to apply just a tiny amount of glow right where you want it.  I am a bronzer convert now.  After my foundation and powder I swirl all the colors and apply to the temples.  I apply the darkest color to the hollows of my cheeks and the sides of my nose.  I apply the lightest color down my nose.  I apply a mix of the pink and light brown as a blush.  It is very shiny.  I use a matte foundation (Revlon Colorstay in problem areas with organic wear powder in translucent light all over) and I really like shine and glitter so it&#x27;s great for me.  If you use a dewy foundation or prefer matte finish everywhere, it may be too much shine.  It has a very high shine to pigment ratio, which means you can get very \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; with very little color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have said that this isn&#x27;t really a bronzer.  I agree this is true for most people.  People with medium or dark complexions may like it very much as an illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like some of the ELF products (mostly the studio brushes - fantastic!) and this is one of the better ones.  It does crumble if you are rough with it, but if you have a light touch it is fine. I have no trouble with it sticking once it is on my face.  I love the case it comes in too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from my local \\&quot;T\\&quot; store.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> good product, delivery on time</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that once the squares got about half used it started cracking and breaking up. I had to transfer the colors to a screw top round pot that I had left over from some used up night cream. The colors blend together great though and had it not been for the cracking I would have rated 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My go-to bronzer. Good for fair skin since it&#x27;s not too dark. It&#x27;s only $3 at Target. Not worth it to me to buy more expensive bronzers anymore.</li>
            <li> For the price, you really cannot beat this bronzer. I&#x27;ve very pale, so this bronzer gives me a touch of color and lasts all day without having to reapply!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer‚Ä¶..  but its a little expensive here on Amazon.  At Target and Walmart it retails for 3.00 - if you have one near you that is a better option.  But for me- I don&#x27;t- so its at least nice to be able to find it here.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, I was looking for some nice bronzer to work as contouring powder as well. This product, though lovely, is just too shimmery for the natural look for which I was going. However, if you just want a normal bronzer for a lighter-toned skin, I would definitely recommend. For the price, this cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> The golden bronzer from elf is definitely too light to be a bronzer-I&#x27;m fairly pale and it&#x27;s no where near dark enough to bronze up my skin. However, it makes for one of the most beautiful highlighters I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not one color, the four colors blend together to form a nice, complimentary shade that&#x27;s really good to highlight with. The shimmer is also not over the top or anything, it creates just the perfect glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy this for the bronzing effects, don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy another shade that&#x27;s darker. But, if you want a highlighter, this is my number one go to product!</li>
            <li> I totally loved this. I am not a huge fan of Bronzers, But this one has a light and silky feel. It has a great color pallet which I also order in light medium and heavy. All of them where great. I am a makeup artist and having quality makeup you can trust is a huge plus in my book. I tend to buy several brands for use on my clients. E.l.F is one of my fave brands. This is the first time I have bought this product. I always test it on myself and a few friends. This was a great product that all of them loved. Does not look cakey and covers well. Also it does not over do it it brightens just right to give you a nice glow. Def recommend this</li>
            <li> The items arrived on time and in perfect condition. The colors are excellent and the coverage is wonderful. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is hard to apply and gives essentially no color.</li>
            <li> Prefect color combination, subtle tones which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer! It&#x27;s inexpensive and is just as great as my NARS bronzer. It&#x27;s easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t make my skin looks ashy.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer. It is the perfect bronzer because it gives you color but is also a highlighter that gives you a soft glow. I have tried all different kinds that come in many different price ranges and this 3$ bronzer is the best I have used!!</li>
            <li> I just love the colors and texture.  I will continue to buy. I love bargain!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I clicked on the wrong one or it was delivered wrong... I swear chose the warm bronzer, but received the golden bronzer. Thats my fault I guess for not double checking. The color is very shimmery, so I think I will be purchasing a darker bronzer separately somewhere else. Nevertheless, the color is very pretty. As my skin is on the dark side, I think I&#x27;ll just use this set as an eyeshadow! the delivery took awhile..</li>
            <li> Such a great product for the price. I use this bronzer daily for an overall glow, even on my neck and collar bone. Subtle color but adds just enough shimmer to stand out. Best bargain bronzer I have come across yet!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; is not very dark like a bronzer would be it light and shimmers a lot , also product falls off. I bought this at TARGET for $3 . Good thing about this &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; is that I use the lightest color as a high light and the golden for a eye shadow with is great but  really wouldn&#x27;t pay almost $6 for something that is $3 in a drug store , btw I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t like shimmer and I don&#x27;t know who could pull this off as a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS,IT HAS SOME SHIMMER IN IT SO I USE IT AS A HIGHLIGHT,I HAVE THE COOL AND THE COLORS ARE NOT SHIMMERY IN THAT PALETTE SO I HAVE THIS ONE FOR HIGHLIGHT AND THE COOL FOR CONTOUR.</li>
            <li> This is not a bronzer. It is way too light. It does work as an all over face shimmer. I have a fair complexion and this is way too light.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> I love how it looks on my skin, I have combination skin yet my skin doesnt look oily when applied its perfect</li>
            <li> Horrible doesn&#x27;t even show up on ur face just looks like sparkles. And if u go to target u can find it for 3 dollars . Rip off</li>
            <li> Absolutely love how balanced the glow is after applying.  It doesn&#x27;t make you look like a disco ball like so many other Highlighters do. Very nice bronzer/ highlighter for the price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good price, fast shipping, I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and love it. The bronzer stays true all day and does not leave you with Barbie orange glow :)</li>
            <li> You can use this whether combined or by separated and Works just amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I rather use it separated to cr√©ate a flawless look applying the lighter color like a highlighter and the others to contour or kinda gold blush. It looks good on my naturally tanned-olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> Love the different tones to help for a blended look</li>
            <li> I bought this bronzer as my first bronzer and I thought that since it was cheap, that it was going to be bad. Honestly, if you&#x27;re starting out, you shouldn&#x27;t buy anything too expensive. Now, that I&#x27;m a bit better (I still don&#x27;t know much, but I feel I know more than the new people) I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I think there are some better products, but I did love it.</li>
            <li> The two patches on the left side of the \\&quot;Golden\\&quot; compact are better suited for highlighting - I found them to be too light to provide any kind of bronzing effect (and I have very fair skin).  Instead of bronzed this makes me look like I rubbed gold eyeshadow all over my skin.  Also if you have any kind of oiliness to your skin, this will greatly inhibit your efforts to keep shine down - it&#x27;s VERY shimmery.  Some people might like the look this bronzer gives, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend any E.L.F products! A+</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first because this bronzer has shimmer, but once you apply it on the skin it&#x27;s simply beautiful. It just gives you a light sun-kissed look (by swirling all the colors together). The big mirror is very handy and the compact is very sturdy. You can also use the shades individually as contours, blushes, highlights or even eyeshadows. Amazing value!</li>
            <li> Too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using expensive bronzers (Hoola, Sephora brand, theBalm Hula) and this one rivals those more expensive products. While it looks shimmery in the compact, it looks more matte when applied. It gives a smooth application and great subtle, build-able color. It&#x27;s a great addition to any makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder. I&#x27;m quite pale and it actually functions more as a highlighter. It is very shimmery so I can understand why others may night like it. I use it quite sparingly. One compact will last me around 6 months with daily use. When used properly, it gives skin a beautiful, dewy glow that&#x27;s actually hard to achieve from a powder makeup. Since there are 4 different colors found inside the compact, it can also serve multiple purposes. All 4 shades can be used as eye shadows. The lighter shades can be used to highlight brow bones and inner corners of the eyes, and of course highlighting and contouring. It&#x27;s the only bronzer/highlighter powder I buy. The price tag is also pretty sweet! Only $3 at Target!</li>
            <li> This bronzer is the best bronzer I have ever used! You can see the difference when you put it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mornings I am usually very pale for at least an hour after I wake up but when I put this bronzer on I look much more &amp;#34;alive.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This bronzer gives you a nice glow but its not something that could be used if your looking for a good dark bronzer, I use this and then put a darker bronzer over top so I have alittle glow and also a darker tint. So if your looking for a dark coloring for cheeks this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love it. This is a simple bronzer palette, a touch on the lighter side which is great because I often find bronzers too dark. I actually use the lightest one for a highlight. I like that the squares are next to eachother but not in a crazy design or pattern so I can isolate and use the colors seperately also. It is a thin and sleek compact which is great, fits easily into my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Good blend of colors. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s a good bronzer. I do think its a little dark for my ghostly white face, but I took the risk anyway.</li>
            <li> Very little pigment. Lots of shimmer. Won&#x27;t buy again and don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> LOVE this bronzer and bought many of these for family/friends as a gift. Golden color is for fairer complexions. I use a powder brush for application.</li>
            <li> Not too much shine but it really leaves a nice glow! Very affordable and well worth the price. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the elf website last week and it arrived yesterday. It is definitely great for the price but unless you want/need a very very light bronzer, I would suggest picking a darker shade than &amp;#34;golden.&amp;#34; I have light skin tone and it barely shows up on me. It has a lot of shimmer though, which I like from time to time. I think this pallette would make a better hilight color or could be used for contour.  Over all, I am pleased with the product, I just wish I would have ordered a darker bronzer. Product still gets four stars though because I picked my own color and should have known it would&#x27;ve needed to have been darker. Still a good product</li>
            <li> Nice, but a little lighter then i would have liked.Very silky when applied.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product, however,  I&#x27;ve used ita couple times and am just not very impressed by it. It is very shiny and does not look good on my face for bronzer. I started to use it for blush and it works okay but again very shiny and looks kind of crazy. Very disappointed in this product will not get again.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and LOVE it. I am very fair skinned and avoid the sun because of it, so this bronzer is really great. It gives an all over glow when I run the brush over the two lighter shades and if I want to accentuate my cheekbones and temple areas, I use the darker shade, then NARS Orgasm blush on the apples of my cheeks. It looks natural and fresh like I&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun :)&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend for light skinned people.</li>
