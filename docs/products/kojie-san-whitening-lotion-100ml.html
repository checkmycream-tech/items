    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i use it for about a week before i see result</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference with this product. I&#x27;m also very picky when it comes to ingredients because of the fact that I am acne prone.This product contains mineral oil which is unnatural and pore-clogging.</li>
            <li> This did not lighten my skin I even used it with the Kojie soap. I&#x27;m Mexican and I wanted to look more pale.  Even though it didn&#x27;t lighten my skin, it defiantly moisturized it.</li>
            <li> ok so i bought this few weeks ago and i use it after a shower and before bed. the bottle is small/medium. the product smells good. and it does work.&lt;br /&gt;im Hispanic and my color is kinda like beige/yellow/carmel. idk some thing there. but i started to use this product and WOW it works. i turned lighter so i can say im a LIGHT beige whatever but my results are awesome. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i will be buying from this seller again. and i recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST be patient and if your a darker color dont expect to turn like snow white, no you will just be lighter than before. but i bet if you keep using it for more than 2 months you will be seeing way better results.&lt;br /&gt;anyways. good luck.&lt;br /&gt;i give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and helps me greatly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Hawaii and didn&#x27;t expect it to help me lighten at all, but it had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a month, I got 2 shades lighter on my arms. I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing ..waste of money,, along with the face cream..should have gotten a refund but didn&#x27;t I know next time</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and thought this would be effective.  I only put it on my left lower leg.  After using it daily and finishing the whole tube I can&#x27;t even see a remote difference.  I also used the soap.</li>
            <li> I Have no problems about shipping.. It&#x27;s fast. I have used this product about two weeks.It whitens my skin,(there is really a difference before i used this lotion)  I also used the Kojie san soap. after shower it makes my skin little bit dry, so i decided to buy this lotion and it works good on me and buy more from this seller.since I have no problems using this lotion. thanks</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to using the soap. I purchased this for quicker results but at this date I have seen any yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice with purchasing this product is buy two one time cause I took a while to get this one and it&#x27;s almost finished only had it 13days so far</li>
            <li> Quick results, arrived in two days standard shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient dries out skin- this lotion is a prefect way to avoid this problem and be used in tandem with the soap for accelerated results.</li>
            <li> it does not work as promised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but as just a face lotion but I haven seen any changes and I&#x27;m using it with the soap.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved this lotion! she said it made her skin have a natural glow ; i notice how healthy her skin looked and she was excited as well , i was thinking it really wouldnt make such a difference but i notiiced a change!SO PLAN TO BUY MORE!</li>
            <li> The lotion did moisturize, but the bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full, and I actually think it had been used. The lotion also seemed to lighten my skin, but not very much.</li>
            <li> The product description above states that this lotion &amp;#34;helps even out skin tone&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;lightens skin and reduces dark spots&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;prevents the formation of new dark spots&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;reduces skin blemishes&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;restores skin suppleness&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturizes skin&amp;#34;. LIES! Only those last two have any ring of the truth to them.  I did a test on one arm where I used it in conjunction with the soap, wore sunblock, kept out of the sun, etc. Absolutely NO change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it smells heavenly! I wish they sold that fragrance separate, because it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. However, that and the moisturizing properties alone are not reason enough for me to purchase this product again, at least not for that much money.</li>
            <li> This whitening lotion (like the Kojie San face lotion) didn&#x27;t do anything to improve my acne scars. I recommend using Kojie San soap if you want to see effects.</li>
            <li> Kojie San lightened and evened out my skin. I&#x27;m using the lotion too. It smells amazing and exfoliates like a dream. If you do but kojie San, but from \\&quot;rarebookkid\\&quot; on amazon because he will have it to you within 2 days. I ordered from another company during this months purchase and haven&#x27;t gotten it yet and it&#x27;s been a week. Only order from rarebookkid if you want it fast</li>
            <li> nothing happen, just like water you put on your skin, doesnt soften your skin. lotion should soften your skin , this one doesnt. i would not recommendt this product.</li>
            <li> only last one week didn&#x27;t se the effect either</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything.. I&#x27;d put in on after using soap did not lighten up or remove dark spots. I need something stronger. I ran across product Tonique bleaching cream however its pretty expensive. .</li>
            <li> Nothing great, I bought for my hands that tend to get darker being on the wheel when I drive but it didn&#x27;t change a thing</li>
            <li> My mom uses this and she loves it. She is so clear and blemish free. It gave my mom a paler skin and the smell is amazing. It smells soo goood!&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about buying it myself.</li>
