            <li>BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you don&#x27;t care what kind of lotion you are buying</li>
            <li>The large bottle was a great buy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I bought many products from Summer Hill and will continue to purchase these products.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on the scent this lotion leaves on your skin.</li>
            <li>I wear it all the time and as I have allergic reactions to many</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Crabtree and Evelyn scent.  </li>
            <li>Price was better than any I have found.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like it - would love to know if it every goes on sale!!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for someone very familiar with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a happy, soapy floral clean scent that I find very very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Love the light spring-like fragrance, not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is full to the brim!</li>
            <li>I think any age will enjoy this scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a feminine light airy smell.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a generously filled container, and she does not notice any changes in its composition.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and has a clean flowery scent to it.</li>
            <li>I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products and the delicate scent of Summer Hill is perfect all year.  </li>
            <li>Rich</li>
            <li>specially is you used after shower</li>
            <li>this is so subtle it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Still my favorite lotion, but am suspicious as to why it isn&#x27;t pink any more?  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fresh summer scent.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I like the way it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth, and the light delicate scent is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>good if they don&#x27;t tell the public who expects the same product everytime they order.</li>
            <li>I bought it to reward myself for a large weight loss.  </li>
            <li>She really likes this product.</li>
            <li>This is NOT THE REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have been buying the smaller sized bottles but this is much more economical if you use Summer Hill on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The color is now white vs. a lovely warm cream, the lotion is thick and gooey and goes on like wax, leaving a thick film vs. a nice silky feel and</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this many years ago, from a hotel, and finally, (about 20 years later) ordered a bottle for myself.</li>
            <li>I have never had a reaction to a skin care product and this new formula caused me to break out in hives everywhere</li>
            <li>I thought it may have been a fluke but tried a patch test three different times over three months and the hives returned exactly where I applied this lotion.</li>
            <li>I first had my suspicions when the bottle felt heavier than normal and was filled more than previous bottles, however my suspicions were solidified when I actually tried the lotion which was much thicker and the wrong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its also much easier to get the very last dab out of the bottle with the rounded neck rather than the square tops of the smller bottles.</li>
            <li>She loves it and always wants it for a present.  </li>
            <li>My 2 cents: customer loyalty is worth far more than cutting production costs</li>
            <li>Being near &amp;#34;60&amp;#34; I need a body lotion to moisturize deeply and C.&amp;E.</li>
            <li>Crabtree and Evelyn for some reason have changed the ingredients in their Summer Hill formula (I checked an old bottle with one that I just received) and it is no longer the same product.</li>
            <li>PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLD FORMULA.</li>
            <li>but this is so subtle it&#x27;s fine.</li>

            <li> Even my husband likes it, and he is unable to smell my other fragrances.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this every day after showering, and sometimes in between.  I like the way it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth, and the light delicate scent is pleasant.  I often receive compliments about the good smell.</li>
            <li> Being near &amp;#34;60&amp;#34; I need a body lotion to moisturize deeply and C.&amp;E. Summer Hill does that wonderfully and smells like heaven!  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  The fragrance is wonderful!  Even my husband likes it, and he is unable to smell my other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what it is, but this scent reminds me of pleasant things and places.  My mom has this scent in soap form in her vacation home in Florida &amp; when I put this lotion on, it takes me there.  It&#x27;s a happy, soapy floral clean scent that I find very very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Summer Hill by Crabtree and Evelyn for years and therefore could detect the knock off that was sent to me as this product. Although this lotion was in the Summer Hill by Crabtree and Evelyn bottle, there is no way it was actually the lotion I am used to. I first had my suspicions when the bottle felt heavier than normal and was filled more than previous bottles, however my suspicions were solidified when I actually tried the lotion which was much thicker and the wrong fragrance. I am very disappointed in this purchase! I have been buying Summer Hill off amazon for years since it is so hard to find in the store and have always had luck with the products that were delivered to me, which makes this incident so much harder to take. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK</li>
            <li> I used before and never founded in stores&lt;br /&gt;scent is delicious and take forever... specially is you used after shower</li>
            <li> it is a good product and great price thank you very much will buy again  good scent nice sixe bottle</li>
            <li> Still my favorite lotion, but am suspicious as to why it isn&#x27;t pink any more?  Please make it pink again.  I&#x27;m afraid some ingredient other than the coloring has been left out~</li>
            <li> The name says it all....it&#x27;s a fresh summer scent.  The large bottle was a great buy.  I think any age will enjoy this scent.  I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Great value. One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and great moisturizer.  I bought many products from Summer Hill and will continue to purchase these products.  It is a feminine light airy smell.  Not overwhelming</li>
            <li> My signature fragrance.  Love the light spring-like fragrance, not overpowering at all.  A little goes a long way so bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 for my wife, she will not use the one bottle, it is different color, smell, texture.&lt;br /&gt;Summer Hill changed formula from what I have read on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;Not good if they don&#x27;t tell the public who expects the same product everytime they order.</li>
            <li> The bottle is full to the brim! What did I purchase? I don&#x27;t know. CE was sold to Kuan Choo International Limited in 2012(Hong Kong), about the time the 1 star reviews started. You will find similar reviews on the Crabtree web site.   Maybe she will like it, if so I will raise the rating. I will now check Wikipedia before I make any purchase. My 2 cents: customer loyalty is worth far more than cutting production costs but if you can accomplish both...you will become a success, a legendary company....   She really likes this product. It comes in a generously filled container, and she does not notice any changes in its composition. I have raised my rating from 3 to 5 stars...Great packaging, Delivered on time. Rich</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before and loved it. This was a very good buy for the cost. Would order again!</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on the scent this lotion leaves on your skin. It is not too strong and has a clean flowery scent to it. Love it !!!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrance!  I wear it all the time and as I have allergic reactions to many this is so subtle it is wonderful.  I have the lotion, cologne &amp; bath powder</li>
            <li> I have worn Summer Hill Body Lotion for years and have always gotten compliments from both women and men. No longer. Crabtree and Evelyn for some reason have changed the ingredients in their Summer Hill formula (I checked an old bottle with one that I just received) and it is no longer the same product. The color is now white vs. a lovely warm cream, the lotion is thick and gooey and goes on like wax, leaving a thick film vs. a nice silky feel and the fragrance no longer smells like Summer Hill. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Why would Crabtree and Evelyn change a proven product. PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLD FORMULA.</li>
            <li> great value, easy pump style, very happy!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. It is worth the money. I would receamend this lotion to anyone. It would even be a great gift for someone you think a lot of</li>
            <li> This lotion was not the same scent that I usually get. It was also white, when it is usually an off white almost peach color. It looks like this company was trying to re-create the crabtree and evelyn summer hill scent.</li>
            <li> I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products and the delicate scent of Summer Hill is perfect all year.  I don&#x27;t always like any scent during the summer but this is so subtle it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have used Summer Hill lotion for years but Crabtree and Evelyn have changed their product. Everything is different, the texture, color, consistency and scent. I have never had a reaction to a skin care product and this new formula caused me to break out in hives everywhere I used it. I thought it may have been a fluke but tried a patch test three different times over three months and the hives returned exactly where I applied this lotion. I contacted customer service at Crabtree and Evelyn and they did not return an email. It is very disappointing what they have done to this product.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Crabtree and Evelyn scent.  I bought it to reward myself for a large weight loss.  Price was better than any I have found.  It was well-packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and the feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone very familiar with this product. This is NOT THE REAL DEAL. Amazon graciously refunded my money BUT it should be taken off the site. The packaging is wrong. The decent is wrong. The color is wrong. The texture is wrong.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you don&#x27;t care what kind of lotion you are buying</li>
            <li> Very very nice. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the smaller sized bottles but this is much more economical if you use Summer Hill on a regular basis. Its also much easier to get the very last dab out of the bottle with the rounded neck rather than the square tops of the smller bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  I wish it lasted longer after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I really like it - would love to know if it every goes on sale!!  I would buy one every other month if they were not quite as expensive!</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my daughter every Christmas and her Birthday.  She loves it and always wants it for a present.  Anyone wanting a good lotion should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this many years ago, from a hotel, and finally, (about 20 years later) ordered a bottle for myself. It is expensive, but worth it. No greasy feel, wonderful fragrance..</li>
