            <li>I ordered these to help with the bathroom process and I am very happy I did!</li>
            <li>Tucks is the best one.</li>
            <li>Perfect for postpartum.</li>
            <li>They helped give me some comfort during that recovery period and are great to have on hand for any flare ups.</li>
            <li>This product is very effective and does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>These come in very handy and help ease the painfulness of a swollen or irritated hemorrhoid.  </li>
            <li>This one felt good whether sore or not to begin with.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>They feel so good on the inflammed tissue.</li>
            <li>Good product and takes all the burn and each away in a day</li>
            <li>Good item and good value</li>
            <li>These pads are wonderful, and very cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I was in recovery, so I was thrilled to get some more at home to continue using.</li>
            <li>But they r a lifesaver for very pregnant women!</li>
            <li>There must be a better way to package these things, failing that they do the job</li>
            <li>im much better....</li>
            <li>So glad I planned ahead and bought these.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tucks for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Baby wipes would seriously be a better alternative.</li>
            <li>And they do give you a lot, so you can use as many as you need.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure even more do after birth</li>
            <li>and that is what is most important to me.</li>
            <li>Effective and gentle for cleaning tender areas - hemorrhoids or skin burned by acidic diarrhea, for example.</li>
            <li>People who suffer from trying to get clean while its sore might appreciate this, and for the price i bought 2.</li>
            <li>These help to ease the itching and help to keep the area clean.</li>
            <li>The witch hazel is very old school and effective.</li>
            <li>The effect is good, can only be used at night.</li>
            <li>IT SOOTHES AND HELPS THE IRRITATION TO DISAPPEAR QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li>Overall; very pleased.</li>
            <li>and these are just the right pads after this special event.</li>
            <li>so it would last awhile if i liked it.</li>
            <li>I started using these right</li>
            <li>I was being destroyed by regular toilet paper and am so happy to have found these soothing wipes.</li>
            <li>Your seriously can make your own pads, much better ones, for $2 bucks by going to the dollar store for a bottle of witch hazel and a pack of thicker quality cotton pads.</li>
            <li>These pads helped so much!</li>
            <li>When I didn&#x27;t use the pads, hours later, my parts did not hurt and felt as though they were feeling better.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing, cooling, such a life-saver.</li>
            <li>at first it helped</li>
            <li>They work, but smell funny.</li>
            <li>With my 2nd child I decided to be better prepared and ordered these as I new my unwanted visitors from my first delievery would make an appearance after I gave birth.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>it really soothes the area and refresh it...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soothing for hemorrhoids and perineal tears.</li>
            <li>I recommend the product highly!</li>
            <li>I used to travel a lot for work and the lifestyle stressed me out so much that I&#x27;d get butt polyps.</li>
            <li>after I had my son and they offered good relief and after about a week and half everything was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was wrapped individually for when I travel, I didn&#x27;t look closely to see that they were not wrapped individually, otherwise the product is okay...</li>
            <li>Well, it did provide a little soothing sensation and helped it feel cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>Like others have said before, these pads work great for the reason you want them to, but they ARE difficult to take out of the jar they come in.</li>
            <li>I get them repeatedly and they are useful on a daily basis or whenever you need to use these.</li>
            <li>Same good product as usual, you can depend on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Got my first external hemorrhoid and turned to Amazon for help.</li>
            <li>I really feel they helped with my soreness, especially since I already had hemorrhoids during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I tried one other similiar tucks product in the past, and it was not soothing or gentle, it burned more than it cooled.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product, though I do wish the pads had a larger surface area which would help protect my fingers from the danger zone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked by the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I barely made it to the bathroom, by crawling after spending 10 minutes trying to get to the floor from the hospital bed.  </li>
            <li>These are nothing more than micro thin cotton pads drenched in witch hazel.</li>

            <li> These are nothing more than micro thin cotton pads drenched in witch hazel.</li>
            <li> They are intended to sooth the skin, and in the process they clean it of any residue left behind by wiping.</li>
            <li> These are not a substitute for toilet tissue or the big rectangular cleaning wipes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re suppose to be able to &amp;#34;tuck&amp;#34; these pads in those sore areas and soak, but they are so thin and wet, they just bunch up quickly and are completely useless.</li>
            <li> I had a long labor and delivered vaginally with tearing.</li>
            <li> If you think I am being too sensitive, I used them off and on for a few weeks, then I stopped and healed almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Like everyone else said, I was kinda surprised by how small the pads were.</li>
            <li> I noticed serious irritation in my area only after several hours, when the pads were no longer wet.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the pads stick together and hard to only get one at a time</li>
            <li> The bad thing was that at the same time it was keeping her stitches wet when they were supposed to be kept dry to heal properly.</li>
            <li> I think I paid about $8 bucks for this jar; Absolutely not worth it!</li>
            <li> The nurses at the hospital had me use these for the few days</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the container must have a very small crack since it leaks... sounds like a common complaint though.</li>
            <li> i use them cuz someone recommended them when i told her i had a small hemorrhoid</li>
            <li> They are too thin and too wet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> just not handy at all for traveling.</li>
            <li> I think it was delaying them to heal and irritating them.</li>
            <li> They are rather expensive but they meet the promises of their advertising.</li>
            <li> and it was very uncomfortable during and after going to the bathroom....</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that the maternity ward provided these to me after the birth of my baby girl.  </li>
            <li> Witch Hazel does wonders in helping you to deal with this nasty, painful issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate these things!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I had a long labor and delivered vaginally with tearing. These pads helped so much! I also used an anesthetic spray in conjunction with these pads. I really feel they helped with my soreness, especially since I already had hemorrhoids during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I tried one other similiar tucks product in the past, and it was not soothing or gentle, it burned more than it cooled.  This one felt good whether sore or not to begin with. People who suffer from trying to get clean while its sore might appreciate this, and for the price i bought 2. so it would last awhile if i liked it.</li>
            <li> Like others have said before, these pads work great for the reason you want them to, but they ARE difficult to take out of the jar they come in. There must be a better way to package these things, failing that they do the job and that is what is most important to me.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT AFTER I HAD MY BABY AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS WHENEVER I HAD ANY IRRITATION.  IT SOOTHES AND HELPS THE IRRITATION TO DISAPPEAR QUICKLY.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE.  I HAVE NEVER HAD HEMORRHOIDS SO I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR THAT.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective and does what it says it does.  My mom used to muse it ages ago.  The witch hazel is very old school and effective.</li>
            <li> Buy a bag of jumbo cotton balls and a bottle of witch hazel and save money.  I prefer the softness of the cotton balls to the layered fabric used in this product.  Product does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I just had a baby and these are just the right pads after this special event. The pads themselves are TINY though. Should have looked closer to the size. Overall; very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that the maternity ward provided these to me after the birth of my baby girl.  I had a 3rd degree tear and couldn&#x27;t walk after giving birth at all.  I barely made it to the bathroom, by crawling after spending 10 minutes trying to get to the floor from the hospital bed.  As I was in the hospital, I was given TUCKS pads with my kit for the healing process of my lady bits.  They also recommended them for home use.  I noticed serious irritation in my area only after several hours, when the pads were no longer wet.  When I didn&#x27;t use the pads, hours later, my parts did not hurt and felt as though they were feeling better.  I associate the lack of healing with these pads.  If you think I am being too sensitive, I used them off and on for a few weeks, then I stopped and healed almost immediately.  Also, Percocets will delay the healing process as well.  Good luck ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend these pads for the vaginal area.  Just the anus.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  I get them repeatedly and they are useful on a daily basis or whenever you need to use these.</li>
            <li> ESSENTIAL while recovering from childbirth! Refreshing, cooling, such a life-saver. They feel so good on the inflammed tissue. The nurses at the hospital had me use these for the few days I was in recovery, so I was thrilled to get some more at home to continue using.</li>
            <li> Got my first external hemorrhoid and turned to Amazon for help. I ordered these to help with the bathroom process and I am very happy I did! These help to ease the itching and help to keep the area clean. Can&#x27;t imagine going through this ordeal without them.</li>
            <li> i do not use these because i gave birth..i use them cuz someone recommended them when i told her i had a small hemorrhoid and it was very uncomfortable during and after going to the bathroom.... since i started using these...im much better....it really soothes the area and refresh it...i cant be without them</li>
            <li> These are a must have in a pelvic care kit for postpartum care. They&#x27;re very soothing for hemorrhoids and perineal tears.</li>
            <li> Same good product as usual, you can depend on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I would order again. Tucks is the best one.</li>
            <li> These come in very handy and help ease the painfulness of a swollen or irritated hemorrhoid.  This is our second purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Works well. The only negative is that the pads stick together and hard to only get one at a time</li>
            <li> These pads are wonderful, and very cleansing.  Witch Hazel does wonders in helping you to deal with this nasty, painful issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can sometimes be an issue separating the pads, but it is not too big of a deal.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a vaginal delivery and ended up with a c section, but they have been a life saver for hemorrhoid. So glad I planned ahead and bought these. My only complaint is the container must have a very small crack since it leaks... sounds like a common complaint though.</li>
            <li> I got these while preparing for a colonoscopy... at first it helped but I don&#x27;t think ANYTHING can help you when you&#x27;re doing that!</li>
            <li> I have been using Tucks for many years.  They are rather expensive but they meet the promises of their advertising.</li>
            <li> Good product and takes all the burn and each away in a day or so you get a lot of them and they are well packaged</li>
            <li> Purchased tucks pads and were shipped ahead of time.  No problems with product at all.  Same as if you purchased them from the store.  I recommend the product highly!</li>
            <li> My wife got these because she had read that they provided pain relief for perineal area in postpartum. Well, it did provide a little soothing sensation and helped it feel cool and fresh. The bad thing was that at the same time it was keeping her stitches wet when they were supposed to be kept dry to heal properly. I think it was delaying them to heal and irritating them. She would not recommend their use in perineal area if you got stitches.</li>
            <li> The effect is good, can only be used at night.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  My only wish is that they were bigger. But they are soothing and they do the job!  Good item and good value</li>
            <li> Works as advertised...</li>
            <li> Perfect for postpartum.</li>
            <li> I hate these things! I&#x27;m shocked by the great reviews. These are nothing more than micro thin cotton pads drenched in witch hazel. They are too thin and too wet. Your seriously can make your own pads, much better ones, for $2 bucks by going to the dollar store for a bottle of witch hazel and a pack of thicker quality cotton pads. I think I paid about $8 bucks for this jar; Absolutely not worth it! You&#x27;re suppose to be able to &amp;#34;tuck&amp;#34; these pads in those sore areas and soak, but they are so thin and wet, they just bunch up quickly and are completely useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product! Baby wipes would seriously be a better alternative.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Like everyone else said, I was kinda surprised by how small the pads were. I guess pictures leave a lot of interpretation. And they do give you a lot, so you can use as many as you need.</li>
            <li> With my 2nd child I decided to be better prepared and ordered these as I new my unwanted visitors from my first delievery would make an appearance after I gave birth.  I started using these right after I had my son and they offered good relief and after about a week and half everything was back to normal.  They helped give me some comfort during that recovery period and are great to have on hand for any flare ups.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was wrapped individually for when I travel, I didn&#x27;t look closely to see that they were not wrapped individually, otherwise the product is okay...just not handy at all for traveling.</li>
            <li> Cools, heals, and medicates. Anybody using this will benefit.  I would recommend this product, it does the job it advertises.</li>
            <li> Effective and gentle for cleaning tender areas - hemorrhoids or skin burned by acidic diarrhea, for example. And unlike the generic lookalike I tried, these are flushable.  These are not a substitute for toilet tissue or the big rectangular cleaning wipes. They are intended to sooth the skin, and in the process they clean it of any residue left behind by wiping.</li>
            <li> They work, but smell funny. Even after u wash your hands the smell lingers. But they r a lifesaver for very pregnant women! And I&#x27;m sure even more do after birth</li>
            <li> I used to travel a lot for work and the lifestyle stressed me out so much that I&#x27;d get butt polyps. I was being destroyed by regular toilet paper and am so happy to have found these soothing wipes. Highly recommend the product, though I do wish the pads had a larger surface area which would help protect my fingers from the danger zone.</li>
