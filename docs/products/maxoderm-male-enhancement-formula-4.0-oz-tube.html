            <li> This is a great product and would recommend it anyone. Thanks just what I expected it would be. Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff thinking it would just be another waste of money. But it really does enhance your sexual experience. I had stronger erection and a better climax. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its not what it advertizes about, it dont work or do nothing for me, would not recommend to use it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do and I got too busy at work to get on the computer to be able to return for a refund. Will I still be able to?</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work the way I expected. I was expecting an instant erection after application and just a little massaging, didn&#x27;t happen. Anyone that massage themselves after 5 minute with any type of lubrication should get an erection unless they have deeper problems. Once an erection was achieved it was not maintained. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> ??  What is up with this?  This doesn&#x27;t work at all!! Not only that, it sucks as a lubricant to even masturbate with! Ugh!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me, i tried it several times but did not get the desired effect, the product surely did not satisfy its claim, i emptied it in the toilet, i would not personally recommend this</li>
            <li> No it had a burning sensation! Sorry can not recommend - would love to get reimbursed for this if possible.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, do as advertised.  I will give it another try.  Reviews were great, but in my case, it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED MAXODERM BEFORE THROUGH THE COMPANY. THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED THROUGH AMAZON GAVE ME THE SAME RESULTS. WORKS GREAT...THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE SMELL...ITS VERY NOTICABLE IF YOUR TRYING TO BE DESCREET WITH YOUR PARTNER.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Tried it several times had no effect at all waste of money. My erection was the same as always and did not stay up any longer than normal</li>
            <li> I broke out first time I used so I tried it two more times same awful rash and no results plus tube was leaking when I opened it from another spot definitely sending it back</li>
            <li> This helped my marriage so much. It made me go back to my teens in potency! It smells good too! My wife loves it and me now! Thank you Maxoderm! You have help save my marriage!</li>
            <li> Good product, kind of like viagra when some medications make it difficult, I have been using for several years but I am most pleased with the customer service the sender provided me! They were Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Again!</li>
            <li> absolute waste of money, don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
            <li> Produces desired results. Apply after any oral. Pleasant warming sensation. I would  recommend this to anyone with E.D.Somewhat expensive. No unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> Amazing results! If you are looking for something to enhance your performance without having to take it internally---this is it!</li>
