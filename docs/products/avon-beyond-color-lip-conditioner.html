    <ol>
            <li>Best lipstick underliner.  </li>
            <li>nice moisturizer, does NOT plump!!!!</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer but NO PLUMPING!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good at conditioning.</li>
            <li>but the product feels good!  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li>It really is great.</li>
            <li>Great getting it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>it smells great on.</li>
            <li>but it does condition it and feels great on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a great moisturizing effect and it leaves a skin colored shade on my lips.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great product, great experience.</li>
            <li>I look forward to ordering more of this from the seller, whose customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>These product was a really good product.</li>
            <li>I had been out for awhile and forgot how good it was.  </li>
            <li>feels good on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a cheap, good moisturizer Avon would be good for you..</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Does not plump as much as I thought it would, but it is still a wonderful lip softener.</li>
            <li>, however, it is an excellent filler for pre-lipstick application and is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product for the lips, keeping them moist and with a rich radiance.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip stick, so I was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as Revlon&#x27;s lip conditioner, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find at retail or onine.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this lip conditioner and was excited to find it on amazon once I could no longer purchase it through Avon.</li>
            <li>It has a good wear time and is glossy on and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I have it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; feeling type of lip plumping that most temporary plumpers have.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it again.</li>
            <li>The longer you use it, the better the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the entire line of Avon&#x27;s Beyond Color lipsticks are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I use it just for the conditioning :)</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite bc</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite lip balm, I am never without it.</li>
            <li>Adds a lovely sheen.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The Buxom line is better.</li>
            <li>lipstick, nothing more.</li>
            <li>but it works love</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, if you don&#x27;t like using carmex you would love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved to say something positive</li>
            <li>conditioner could be better - doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li>not bad as a conditioner I guess, but it does not plump your lips!  </li>
            <li>Avon&#x27;s Lip Conditioner truly does soften and smooth the lips.</li>
            <li>They have their own tube in their bathroom, as boys really smash lip stuff with when using it.  </li>
            <li>remember, smooth lips ARE plumper lips.</li>
            <li>I cannot say I see where it really plumped anything but has a nice silky feel I would not buy again because it didn&#x27;t appear to do what it said</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>All of the Beyond Color products, Lip Conditioner included, contain retinol, which (in my understanding) helps smooth and hydrate skin, as well as helping skin cells regenerate quickly.</li>
            <li>This line goes on smoothly, has a moist yet almost-matte look, last for hours and is good for your lips.</li>
            <li>The saying is true you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>barely plumps, but is a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Packaging was just right.</li>
            <li>This product is okay for general moisturizing &amp; conditioning but had no &amp;#34;lip plumping&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>If you want some color, simply add a lip liner or throw it on top of your lipstick.</li>
            <li>I add this to my review since I imagine people reading reviews on the Lip Conditioner would be interested in colored versions.</li>
            <li>This conditions very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>In the case of crusty lips, I recommend gently exfoliating the lips with a quick mix of sugar and oil (or Vaseline), followed by gently buffing with a damp washcloth, then applying Lip Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the way my lips feel and it lasts for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing without being gooey, has no tint but leaves a nice matt sheen on my lips, and even has a slight plumping effect.</li>
            <li>This makes my lips super soft and plumps them a weed bit but not too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>it really does condition your lips</li>
            <li>It really smoothes lips deeply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One caveat - be sure your lips are clean and buffed, as dry skin mixed with this product is really unattractive and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know that it plumps my lips</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t plump as well as other plumbers, but does hydrate and condition better then others.  </li>
            <li>It felt so nice going on, softens the lips and isn&#x27;t slick or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly fond of the color Twig in this line and have created addicts for this color by recommending it.</li>
            <li>While it may not be instantly tingly plumping, it will improve your lips over time, especially if used in conjunction with a product that has more dedicated plumping actions.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>but I have tried MANY lip plumpers from cheapo&#x27;s to highly expensive and honeslty I love maybelline lip plumer..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any plumping and it actually left a sheer light frost color on my lips that I didn&#x27;t really like, but I did like the smell</li>
            <li>Twig looks a bit different on everyone but almost always looks like a natural lip, only better, even though the color in the tube is on the brown side.</li>
            <li>You do not get the normal sting that you do with lip plumpers</li>
            <li>It leaves a pretty pale &amp;#34;color (not quite the right word)&amp;#34; on the lips, but that disappears if you blend it in with your finger or rub your lips together, making it usable for males, too, if you can convince them.</li>
            <li>- just know that the Peter Principle is alive and well.</li>
            <li>They stay silky soft and it takes the place of any chapstick.</li>
            <li>but when you do your lips get really soft and even feel plumper.</li>
            <li>Red lipstick really ?</li>
            <li>Not sure it &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; the lips, but it does moisturize &amp; minimize fine lip lines.</li>
            <li>I believe it was reinstated after many desperate posts/reviews on Avon&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;While plumping isn&#x27;t the first thing I associate with this product, I do understand the claims of it&#x27;s plumping qualities.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a product to enhance your natural lip color and last longer than a gloss, try it.</li>
            <li>It softens the tiny lines round the top lip (from years of smoking), moisturizes the lips to give the appearance of softer lips and for ME, it does make them look a little fuller.</li>
            <li>Well worth the small cost of this product.</li>
            <li>it seems very thick &amp; doesn&#x27;t apply easily</li>

            <li> Well worth the small cost of this product.</li>
            <li> it seems very thick &amp; doesn&#x27;t apply easily</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was surprised to actually see a little added &amp;#34;plumpness&amp;#34; to my lips.  </li>
            <li> This is a distant second choice to what Avon used to sell.  </li>
            <li> I bought not from Amazon but from Avon..execellent moisturizer and last for quite a while but absolutely NO plumping affect..</li>
            <li> Smoother lips means less wrinkles on the surface of the lips, which does create the appearance of a smoother and younger lip.</li>
            <li> I repeat, less wrinkled lips do look younger and fuller.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products, including Lipfusion, which I thought did seem to work a little bit also, but without the added benefits of this Avon Anew product.</li>
            <li> ALLEGEDLY FULLER LIPS</li>
            <li> For me, yes, because the other products make my lips shrink.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find a company that spent their time improving a product rather than shaving it down to &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I dont understand any negative reviews, as this is my total go to.</li>
            <li> so not worth buying it if your looking forward to seeing your lips plump.</li>
            <li> but you have to reapply constantly which kinda sucks</li>
            <li> Not sure what will happen long term</li>
            <li> Absolutely way too expensive for a lipstick</li>
            <li> I decided to use it at night for moisture, and over my darker lipstick to tone it down.</li>
            <li> but they were softer, and smoother and I thougt a slight bit fuller looking.</li>
            <li> Broke in half about a week in.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my climate, but it&#x27;s now a lumpy mess.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a non-invasive way to add a little fullness.  </li>
            <li> a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over 4 years, always keeping a few on hand after a &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; time when Avon temporarily discontinued it.</li>
            <li> a little too greasy and heavy on the lip</li>
            <li> The nude color makes me look dead; I had a nude lip color before that just about matched the faint rosiness of my natural lips.</li>
            <li> Our wear it beneath any color/gloss for a smooth base.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding any products that don&#x27;t make my lips flake or crease, there always seems to be some wax that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Both the Lip Conditioner and colors go on sale often, usually 2 for $7/8, on the Avon site and in the catalog.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about sales on Amazon, though.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> It feels pointless putting it on...</li>
            <li> this is a thick, pale lipstick.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product but should have realized that for the price it probably wasn&#x27;t going to work as well as the more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I used to use it all the time, then I had a very hard time finding it.  </li>
            <li> I have pencil thin lips,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to leave your lips that way once you take the lipstick off, so if that&#x27;s what is expected, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any plumping of my lips, sorry not happy with it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my lips so it was useless.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it bruised my lips and gave me some painful sores.</li>

            <li> This product is okay for general moisturizing &amp; conditioning but had no &amp;#34;lip plumping&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I used to use it all the time, then I had a very hard time finding it.  Glad I have it again.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast.  Packaging was just right.</li>
            <li> Does not work,Not even a tingle!Also not the color it looks like.more like a shiny cover up color.weird!  CAT in PA.</li>
            <li> conditioner could be better - doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li> This is a distant second choice to what Avon used to sell.  Wish I could find a company that spent their time improving a product rather than shaving it down to &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t know if this is to protect R&amp;D jobs or to save money - just know that the Peter Principle is alive and well.</li>
            <li> this is a thick, pale lipstick.  I saw no conditioning or plumping effects.  I can&#x27;t even get myself to use it as a chapstick at night.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip stick, so I was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was surprised to actually see a little added &amp;#34;plumpness&amp;#34; to my lips.  I have pencil thin lips,  so  I am always looking for a non-invasive way to add a little fullness.  I have tried several products, including Lipfusion, which I thought did seem to work a little bit also, but without the added benefits of this Avon Anew product. It felt so nice going on, softens the lips and isn&#x27;t slick or sticky.  Not to exagurate, I didn&#x27;t get  Angelina Jolee  lips,... but they were softer, and smoother and I thougt a slight bit fuller looking. Well worth the small cost of this product.</li>
            <li> I wear this overnight.. Sorta like a lip lotion</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good at conditioning.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; feeling type of lip plumping that most temporary plumpers have. But I can tell you, that when I use  this regularly my lips are fuller even when I dont have it on. They stay silky soft and it takes the place of any chapstick. I dont understand any negative reviews, as this is my total go to. If you want some color, simply add a lip liner or throw it on top of your lipstick. I sleep with it on, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lip conditioner before and I loved it and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it again. A lot of the time, Avon is sold out. I like it basically because for me, it DOES plump my lips a bit. It softens the tiny lines round the top lip (from years of smoking), moisturizes the lips to give the appearance of softer lips and for ME, it does make them look a little fuller. It may not work for everyone, but it does work for me. And it&#x27;s not just psychosymatic (ie, you think it works, therefore it does). I see a difference. It&#x27;s not going to leave your lips that way once you take the lipstick off, so if that&#x27;s what is expected, you will be disappointed. Anyway, I like this stuff and I hope this seller continues to have it so I can order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change my lips were the same . It didn&#x27;t help my lips in the plumping..so not worth buying it if your looking forward to seeing your lips plump.</li>
            <li> I really like this it really does condition your lips but you have to reapply constantly which kinda sucks but when you do your lips get really soft and even feel plumper. ItIf i make sense</li>
            <li> These product was a really good product. I enjoyed it very much. I am so happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> There seems to be confusion on the plumping effects of Avon&#x27;s Lip Conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over 4 years, always keeping a few on hand after a &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; time when Avon temporarily discontinued it. I believe it was reinstated after many desperate posts/reviews on Avon&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;While plumping isn&#x27;t the first thing I associate with this product, I do understand the claims of it&#x27;s plumping qualities. All of the Beyond Color products, Lip Conditioner included, contain retinol, which (in my understanding) helps smooth and hydrate skin, as well as helping skin cells regenerate quickly. Avon&#x27;s Lip Conditioner truly does soften and smooth the lips. Smoother lips means less wrinkles on the surface of the lips, which does create the appearance of a smoother and younger lip. I believe that is the key to the claims of plumping.&lt;br /&gt;This product has the moisturizing relief of a chapstick and the smoothness of a gloss, all without feeling sticky, gummy or pasty. It leaves a pretty pale &amp;#34;color (not quite the right word)&amp;#34; on the lips, but that disappears if you blend it in with your finger or rub your lips together, making it usable for males, too, if you can convince them. My boys, ages 10 &amp; 13, have used this for years to treat their crusty, chapped winter lips (and summer and spring and fall). They have their own tube in their bathroom, as boys really smash lip stuff with when using it.  In the case of crusty lips, I recommend gently exfoliating the lips with a quick mix of sugar and oil (or Vaseline), followed by gently buffing with a damp washcloth, then applying Lip Conditioner. It really smoothes lips deeply.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a tube by my bedside to use before sleep, since I always wake with parched lips. One caveat - be sure your lips are clean and buffed, as dry skin mixed with this product is really unattractive and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a product to enhance your natural lip color and last longer than a gloss, try it. Our wear it beneath any color/gloss for a smooth base. I repeat, less wrinkled lips do look younger and fuller. The longer you use it, the better the results.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the entire line of Avon&#x27;s Beyond Color lipsticks are wonderful. Every time I wear them, my youngest says, &amp;#34;Mama, your lips look SO SOFT!&amp;#34; And he&#x27;s right-they do! This line goes on smoothly, has a moist yet almost-matte look, last for hours and is good for your lips. I&#x27;m particularly fond of the color Twig in this line and have created addicts for this color by recommending it. Twig looks a bit different on everyone but almost always looks like a natural lip, only better, even though the color in the tube is on the brown side. It really is great. I add this to my review since I imagine people reading reviews on the Lip Conditioner would be interested in colored versions. Both the Lip Conditioner and colors go on sale often, usually 2 for $7/8, on the Avon site and in the catalog. I&#x27;m not sure about sales on Amazon, though.&lt;br /&gt;Give this Lip Conditioner a try. While it may not be instantly tingly plumping, it will improve your lips over time, especially if used in conjunction with a product that has more dedicated plumping actions.&lt;br /&gt;And remember, smooth lips ARE plumper lips.</li>
            <li> not bad as a conditioner I guess, but it does not plump your lips!  I was very disappointed in the product but should have realized that for the price it probably wasn&#x27;t going to work as well as the more expensive products.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my lips so it was useless. I won&#x27;t be order anything like that again. Thanks</li>
            <li> The saying is true you get what you pay for. DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I would have loved to say something positive but unfortunately it bruised my lips and gave me some painful sores. Sorry!</li>
            <li> I bought not from Amazon but from Avon..execellent moisturizer and last for quite a while but absolutely NO plumping affect..I know it states that its a lip plumper but I have tried MANY lip plumpers from cheapo&#x27;s to highly expensive and honeslty I love maybelline lip plumer..but if you are looking for a cheap, good moisturizer Avon would be good for you..</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed... I waited forever for this item to come... Opened it up and what do I get?!? Red lipstick really ? Never again! Will I order from here</li>
            <li> Best lipstick underliner.  I had been out for awhile and forgot how good it was.  Great getting it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This conditions very well! I love the way my lips feel and it lasts for a pretty long time. You do not get the normal sting that you do with lip plumpers but I also do not notice any plump at all. I use it just for the conditioning :)</li>
            <li> feels good on. I cannot say I see where it really plumped anything but has a nice silky feel I would not buy again because it didn&#x27;t appear to do what it said</li>
            <li> Hate this. No plumping. No moisture. Like a waxy product that is cakes. Awful alone or with lipstick over it. I wanted to love it. It&#x27;s trash.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite bc it seems very thick &amp; doesn&#x27;t apply easily</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lip conditioner and was excited to find it on amazon once I could no longer purchase it through Avon.</li>
            <li> This makes my lips super soft and plumps them a weed bit but not too much.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite lip balm, I am never without it. I have trouble finding any products that don&#x27;t make my lips flake or crease, there always seems to be some wax that irritates my skin. Does it plump? For me, yes, because the other products make my lips shrink.</li>
            <li> barely plumps, but is a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t plump as well as other plumbers, but does hydrate and condition better then others.  Wish it plumped like it said.  Nice color.</li>
            <li> Not sure what will happen long term but the product feels good!  I forget to use it and must start carrying it in my purse.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the lips, keeping them moist and with a rich radiance.  I look forward to ordering more of this from the seller, whose customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> Broke in half about a week in. Maybe it&#x27;s my climate, but it&#x27;s now a lumpy mess.</li>
            <li> Adds a lovely sheen. Not sure it &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; the lips, but it does moisturize &amp; minimize fine lip lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any plumping of my lips, sorry not happy with it</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me waste of money</li>
            <li> nice moisturizer, does NOT plump!!!! Can I have my money back????</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any plumping and it actually left a sheer light frost color on my lips that I didn&#x27;t really like, but I did like the smell</li>
            <li> I notice no lip plumping whatsoever. Satisfactory lip conditioner. Not as effective as Revlon&#x27;s lip conditioner, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find at retail or onine.</li>
            <li> I love this it smells great on. It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;plump&#x27; my  lips but it does condition it and feels great on. It has a good wear time and is glossy on and very pretty. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t work as a lip plumber. The Buxom line is better.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does not plump as much as I thought it would, but it is still a wonderful lip softener.</li>
            <li> No plumping, ad I can&#x27;t use it as a chap stick because it deals out my kids. It doesn&#x27;t have a great moisturizing effect and it leaves a skin colored shade on my lips. My kids say I look like a vampire (?) when I use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely way too expensive for a lipstick and that&#x27;s just what it is..lipstick, nothing more. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> a little too greasy and heavy on the lip but it works love it also has a hint of white tint</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, if you don&#x27;t like using carmex you would love this conditioner.  I try to buy as much as possible, everyone seems to get ride of thing we like.  lol</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a lip-plumping-lipstick, this isn&#x27;t it. The only reason I rated it &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; was because it&#x27;s suppose to moisturize and it does do that...a little. The nude color makes me look dead; I had a nude lip color before that just about matched the faint rosiness of my natural lips. So rather than send it back I decided to use it at night for moisture, and over my darker lipstick to tone it down. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for lip plumping, though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know that it plumps my lips, however, it is an excellent filler for pre-lipstick application and is very moisturizing.  I wear a color-stay type of lip color and it stays as advertised with this under it.</li>
            <li> Great product, great experience. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing without being gooey, has no tint but leaves a nice matt sheen on my lips, and even has a slight plumping effect.</li>
            <li> ALLEGEDLY FULLER LIPS</li>
            <li> It has no plumbing or color either... It feels pointless putting it on...</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but NO PLUMPING! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
