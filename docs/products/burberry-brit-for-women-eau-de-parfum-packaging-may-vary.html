            <li>She plans on purchasing the original sized product very soon.</li>
            <li>just right not musky at all</li>
            <li>My fav fragrance of all time- a great little bottle every woman should keep stashed in her purse!</li>
            <li>Has a light sweet smell simular to Viva La Juicy but a little better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I thought that I should just try something new, so I sampled this perfume and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Guessing this isn&#x27;t how it&#x27;s supposed to be and that it separated the first time I opened it.</li>
            <li>Like a very smell sample size do just be aware.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price and a small bottle</li>
            <li>so much I bought some for myself.</li>

            <li>So tiny, and can&#x27;t take an idea of the real size by this image..</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a contemporary scent that women might like to wear-- especially for the office.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cap - it&#x27;s in 2 pieces with the inner stopper being tight to the bottle top.</li>
            <li>All the Chanels, Alien, Versace Crystal Noir, D&amp;G Light Blue.  </li>

            <li> but this particular one is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Sad I know, I&#x27;m 26 and its the first perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought,having said that I would definitely be inclined to buy the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I only have to put a little of it on and the smells lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the item separated after only being on my shelf a few days..</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not much to lose.  </li>
            <li> after receiving this item i was right off the bat skeptical.</li>
            <li> A little lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but you must be very careful with it !</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive, for way too little amount.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t order any bigger of a bottle i would of been angered then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have it, I get angry.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t like to see me angry.</li>

            <li> I was feeling like what if I don&#x27;t like the smell of this parfume and should I take a chance on this purchase. I&#x27;m extremely happy I took the chance. The parfume smells WONDERFUL!!! I will buy this fragrance again!</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loves burberry britt,..we been checking out the perfume I am pleased , im happy as long as my granddaughter is happy.ty</li>
            <li> Definitely will reorder this</li>
            <li> after receiving this item i was right off the bat skeptical. the packaging was o.k. but it  was leaking as soon as i took off the cap and then replaced it, you couldn&#x27;t tilt the bottle at all or it would start dripping out. that was sketchy .&lt;br /&gt;the item separated after only being on my shelf a few days.. the consistency of the product on my skin was oily to the touch and was shiny??&lt;br /&gt;very happy i didn&#x27;t order any bigger of a bottle i would of been angered then.&lt;br /&gt;i do not recommend this product. Buy from a department store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a scent that I could wear that my kids would know &amp;#34;That is my mommy!&amp;#34; just by smelling it...now I have it!</li>
            <li> Way to expensive, for way too little amount. I could go to walmart and get a better deal. Seriously, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Super small bottle. Like a very smell sample size do just be aware. Smells good though! Looking for a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is fabulous and last a long time.  I wear this fragrance each day, it makes me feel adorable.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sample size of this perfume for the seller.  When I received it looked like oil and water. The perfume was separating into a yellow and red substance.  I tried contacting the seller but I did not get a response.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and absolutely loved it. She plans on purchasing the original sized product very soon.</li>
            <li> The scent is described nicely, it smells just like I thought it would.  The scent is warm while not being overpowering and it lasts all day.  Nice size to try a new fragrance but this particular one is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Its ok smells good but the bottle doesn&#x27;t have a spray top you have to dab it on but it smells good</li>
            <li> My niece loves Burberry, so I thought I would try a sample of it.  It smells nice and light.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;i like its smile so much (nice and sexy).&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it for all my friends.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Has a light sweet smell simular to Viva La Juicy but a little better in my opinion. Not overpowering and scent lasts all day. Will buy again. :)</li>
            <li> This tiny little Burberry cologne is the perfect stocking stuffer, and a nice way to try out a new fragrance before investing in a whole bottle.  It&#x27;s a contemporary scent that women might like to wear-- especially for the office.</li>
            <li> So tiny, and can&#x27;t take an idea of the real size by this image..anyway the bottle is elegant &amp; perfume so nice..</li>

It&#x27;s hard to describe scents, but  I can tell you what other fragrances I enjoy to let you know my taste:  All the Chanels, Alien, Versace Crystal Noir, D&amp;G Light Blue.  It&#x27;s a good price and a small bottle so there&#x27;s not much to lose.  This also makes a great stocking stuffer and is a nice way to let someone else sample a few new scents.</li>
            <li> This is a great sent. People always tell me how great I smell and I like that it is a light sent.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It smells really good.  The bottle is super tiny, but it smells really good.  I only have to put a little of it on and the smells lasts for a long time.  It fits well into a super small purse so that you can take it out quickly and freshen up if needed.  I am pleased with my purchase and will order again from this seller.</li>

            <li> I saw this item on your web site and decided to give it a try.i was wonderfully surprised at how much I liked it. I would say love first smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a sampler and am please with the scent. A little lasts a long time. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cap - it&#x27;s in 2 pieces with the inner stopper being tight to the bottle top. Have to use my fingernails to open it. Guessing this isn&#x27;t how it&#x27;s supposed to be and that it separated the first time I opened it. Not a biggie</li>
            <li> Great purchase for stocking stuffing. I purchased my favorite fragrance in this size to used when I go out with a small evening bag and these fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> They advertise 0.17 oz and the bottle is actually 0.16 oz. Do not buy this product. Its a rip off.</li>
            <li> My fav fragrance of all time- a great little bottle every woman should keep stashed in her purse! Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I was happy with my purchase! The travel size is perfect for my purse or luggage and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> IT WAS OK ONCE I WAS ABLE TO GET THE TOP OFF OF IT!!  IT WAS BROKE I HAD TO TAKE MY TEETH AND GET THE STOPPER THING OF THE BOTTLE!!!!</li>
            <li> Burberrry Brit has always been my go-to perfume. When I don&#x27;t have it, I get angry. People don&#x27;t like to see me angry.</li>
            <li> i will be buying a bigger bottle of this bcuz it smells sooo good not strong but not to lite smells just right not musky at all</li>
            <li> This product smell pretty good I would recommend it for your love one or as nice gift for someone special</li>
            <li> fiance loves the perfume. she had been wanting to try it so i got her the sample size one. she loves it.</li>
            <li> like the tittle reads the perfume its nice but very very small. recommend you only get it if you are looking to only get a test of what it smells like</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO GOOD.  SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itty bitty, of course.  But SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> i only got to use this once before the product leaked everywhere! it smells nice but you must be very careful with it !</li>
