            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite hand soap.  </li>
            <li>The smell to this product is nearly overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It also came in a container, not a pouch, which was ok.</li>
            <li>Safe product that&#x27;s earth friendly and THEY DO NOT TEST ON ANIMALS!  </li>

            <li>Lovely scent, clean ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Smell is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>the geranium scent is so nice, it leaves my whole house smelling refreshed - not like chemicals!  </li>

            <li>Product was as described and received quickly!</li>
            <li>like the large refill size.&lt;br /&gt;Honeysuckle also has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Mrs. Meyers individual sized soap containers are really pretty sturdy, so I&#x27;ve been able to refill them with this pouch 2-3 times and they are still in great shape.</li>
            <li>It also is pretty natural and works great.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and am so glad I can get refills instead of having to buy new pump dispensers all the time.  </li>
            <li>This is light, cleans great, don&#x27;t leave my hands super dry.  </li>
            <li>Geranium is the right quick burst of light and cheerful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to be overly concerned about chemicals, but I do like my skin to feel nice and soft and this soap just doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>Plus this soap has no bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Soft and fresh!!!</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and without problems.</li>
            <li>I love the refill size that it came in and will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I will continue buying Mrs. Meyers products, and I am glad Amazon offers them at a good price and with such variety.</li>
            <li>Not as great as the other Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s flavors but arrived on-time and without any leaks!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and packaging as always it is wonderful to reduce the waste in the environment and with little people it is easy to refill</li>
            <li>The stores sell Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s but I rarely see the Geranium fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like the basil better, but my better half prefers this.</li>
            <li>Natural soap refill works fine in my soap dispenser and smells like geranium.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love mrs. Meyers geranium hand soap, but my local stores aren&#x27;t carrying this scent anymore.</li>
            <li>so much more economic than buying each individually.</li>
            <li>The large refill size is convenient.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is gentle and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands as so many others do.  </li>
            <li>My daughter introduced us to this product, now the whole family loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works really well for my family.  </li>
            <li>Really like the smell-will order again</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until I really investigated the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, but it&#x27;s too much really.  </li>
            <li>Very floral, and a lot stronger scent than most of the other varieties of Meyer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I would say its actually smells like a fresh cut flower, a bit earthly and floral.</li>
            <li>and i love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hands especially in winter months</li>
            <li>While I love the way this soap smells, it left my hands really dry.</li>
            <li>This soap tends to dry my hands out more than other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>Leaves hands soft</li>
            <li>I water it down a little to stretch out the soap and it makes the fragrance a little less strong, but it still smells great.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it.</li>

            <li> A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> I honestly hate the lemon verbena scent (light on the lemon, heavy on the verbena), which is quite a bit stronger and has more staying power than the other scents, so I avoid that, but those are just my preferences.</li>
            <li> This soap has the sweetest smell and the smell stays on your hands for a long time.  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s the point of refilling if you are still creating the same amount of waste?</li>
            <li> The postal carrier who delivered it to me put a sticker on the box saying &amp;#34;Recevied Damaged&amp;#34; and the postal carrier also said the she reported it as damaged, upon opening the package I see the bottle of soap is completly empty and the soap has saturated the other item in my package.</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointed I&#x27;ve ever been with a purchase through amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the hand soap refills in regular stores.</li>
            <li> I dilute this down about 7:1 - 10:1 with water to use in a reused foamer pump.</li>
            <li> This brand is a little on the pricier side compared to other hand soaps</li>
            <li> Can buy at Target for much less.</li>
            <li> The hand soaps all have subtle scents that are pleasing and the soap doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> So, you waste a lot because you can&#x27;t get the soap out like this one where you can squeeze out the remaining.</li>
            <li> but disappointed that the 32oz refill came in the same type of plastic bottle as the regular pumps, not the refill pouch as expected.</li>
            <li> Germs don&#x27;t scare me, harsh chemicals do!</li>
            <li> Thrifty and Green!</li>
            <li> We usually buy the basil scent, but opted for the Geranium this time.</li>
            <li> It is a bulky hard plastic container.</li>
            <li> Slowly trying to replace cosmetics with parabens with those without.  </li>
            <li> Container very small for the price.  </li>
            <li> Bottle came broken, leaked all over the box and the shampoo I ordered (which also had a broken pump).  </li>
            <li> Would purchase again, disapointed by the leakage and poor packaging.  </li>

            <li> I just love the smell of this product and use it every day - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This soap has the sweetest smell and the smell stays on your hands for a long time.  Arrived quickly and without problems.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and received quickly!</li>
            <li> Love your product, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Love the Geranium fragrance of this hand soap.  Have purchased it before and will again.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and how it leaves my hands feel nice and clean, not dry, and a nice lingering smell in the kitchen and bath.....</li>
            <li> I love the Mrs. Meyers cleaning products lines, and buying a 33 ounce refill package has been a great option for me. I LOVE the Geranium scent, it is cheery and fresh in the kitchen without being too overpowering (though Honeysuckle and Basil scents also great), and gets my hands clean. The lavender scent is also quite nice, though I prefer the others. I often find lavender the most in stores, so I am glad Amazon is offering better variety here. Lavender is great in the Mrs. Meyers laundry detergent. I honestly hate the lemon verbena scent (light on the lemon, heavy on the verbena), which is quite a bit stronger and has more staying power than the other scents, so I avoid that, but those are just my preferences. Geranium is the right quick burst of light and cheerful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good price for the refill, which saves some plastic. The Mrs. Meyers individual sized soap containers are really pretty sturdy, so I&#x27;ve been able to refill them with this pouch 2-3 times and they are still in great shape. I will continue buying Mrs. Meyers products, and I am glad Amazon offers them at a good price and with such variety.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Leaves hands soft</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it. Germs don&#x27;t scare me, harsh chemicals do!</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t going to be for everyone, but I love it. Very floral, and a lot stronger scent than most of the other varieties of Meyer&#x27;s. I dilute this down about 7:1 - 10:1 with water to use in a reused foamer pump. It lasts forever and still gets hands clean and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the hand soap refills in regular stores. I like to have a fancy soap pump and refill it so this is perfect. Out of all the scents, geranium is my favorite!</li>
            <li> My favorite hand soap ever. It smells beautifully of geranium and rose. The scent is refreshing and uplifting and the soap leaves my hands soft, clean, and happy.</li>
            <li> I leave my bathroom sniffing my hands after using the Geranium hand soap.  It is wonderful and the scent lasts.  I wish they would make a hand lotion in Geranium.</li>
            <li> i wish we could get samples of all the scents to try so i can pick which one i prefer the soap is great and i love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hands especially in winter months</li>
            <li> I love it, not too drying and the smell is wonderful. My children now smell like flowers! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and i love the way my hands smell post washing because of this soap.  The refill will allow you to refill Two Mrs Meyers soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> This brand is a little on the pricier side compared to other hand soaps but I love this scent.</li>
            <li> This soap tends to dry my hands out more than other soaps I have used. I will probably stop using it when my last order finishes. Also, the packaging it comes in, is not what is pictured. It is a bulky hard plastic container. So, you waste a lot because you can&#x27;t get the soap out like this one where you can squeeze out the remaining.</li>
            <li> So happy that I found this product! I love mrs. Meyers geranium hand soap, but my local stores aren&#x27;t carrying this scent anymore. And so I thought I&#x27;d check out amazon... Bam there it is! It&#x27;s at a wonderful price, and I can refill all the dispensers in my house! Thrifty and Green!</li>
            <li> Not as great as the other Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s flavors but arrived on-time and without any leaks!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent.  Great lather. Hiqh Quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a good value because it is diluted in a spray  bottle. The bonus is that geranium scent repels bugs!</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this product because it was packaged in the pouch instead of the plastic bottle but in actuallity received a bottle.</li>
            <li> excellent product, use your own container. clean and fresh and does not leave a residue - best scent ever - great!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this soap and wish I could find this in the stores.  The stores sell Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s but I rarely see the Geranium fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will continue to order this. Smells wonderful</li>
            <li> love the product! but disappointed that the 32oz refill came in the same type of plastic bottle as the regular pumps, not the refill pouch as expected. what&#x27;s the point of refilling if you are still creating the same amount of waste?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this handsoap. My only critique is that I wish it was sold in a pouch. I&#x27;m concerned about the amount of packaging that goes out of our house.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome and it smells great!</li>
            <li> i love this soap. i use it in the bathroom dispenser and it smells so good! my family members love it too.</li>
            <li> The package I receive with the soap refill in it has leaked all over the inside of the package and seeped through the box . The postal carrier who delivered it to me put a sticker on the box saying &amp;#34;Recevied Damaged&amp;#34; and the postal carrier also said the she reported it as damaged, upon opening the package I see the bottle of soap is completly empty and the soap has saturated the other item in my package. This is the most disappointed I&#x27;ve ever been with a purchase through amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and packaging as always it is wonderful to reduce the waste in the environment and with little people it is easy to refill</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling liquid hand soap.  I love the refill size that it came in and will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> The scent of this soap is absolutely wonderful. If you like geranium scent it will make you happy just to wash your hands. It also is pretty natural and works great. Perfect for a kitchen soap. We have the dish soap as well.</li>
            <li> Natural soap refill works fine in my soap dispenser and smells like geranium.&lt;br /&gt; Good price for the refill and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> Love the geranium smell!!! Soft and fresh!!!</li>
            <li> Great soap. I love the scent. Works great in my auto-soap-dispenser.</li>
            <li> Love the scent  - we use all Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products throughout our hime.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sooooooo good. I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> Makes me wash my hands with delight every time I can.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, clean ingredients.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it moisturizing, but not stripping either.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and how well it works on me and all the kidos. I definitely recommend getting this even just for the smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced us to this product, now the whole family loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the large refill size.&lt;br /&gt;Honeysuckle also has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this hand soup - so much better then the products sold at the grocery store!!  My delivery was timely and I will order from them again!</li>
            <li> so much more economic than buying each individually. smells like a rose garden!</li>
            <li> Container very small for the price.  Can buy at Target for much less.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap.  I water it down a little to stretch out the soap and it makes the fragrance a little less strong, but it still smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and am so glad I can get refills instead of having to buy new pump dispensers all the time.  This works really well for my family.  The geranium is my favorite scent</li>
            <li> Love Mrs. Meyers products.  This should come in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Love Mrs Myers products. Geranium is my favorite and also works as an air freshener in my home</li>
            <li> Really like the smell-will order again</li>
            <li> Soap was great.  Bottle came broken, leaked all over the box and the shampoo I ordered (which also had a broken pump).  Would purchase again, disapointed by the leakage and poor packaging.  Reported to Amazon, never heard anything.</li>
            <li> Good price, very quick shipping, great packaging. What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this, my new FAVORITE hand soap ! Will not use anything else from now on even friends that have been her enjoyed the brand and scent. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great hand soap love the smell!</li>
            <li> Meyers&#x27; products are wonderful - they really work, smell great...the geranium scent is so nice, it leaves my whole house smelling refreshed - not like chemicals!  Safe product that&#x27;s earth friendly and THEY DO NOT TEST ON ANIMALS!  This is very important and needs to be included in all their products descriptions.  Thank you Meyers!</li>
            <li> Yep, I&#x27;m in love with a scent! Smells like heaven in liquid form.</li>
            <li> I love all of Meyer&#x27;s cleaning supplies. The hand soaps all have subtle scents that are pleasing and the soap doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my hands. Buying the replacements is comparable to individual containers of competing brands. We usually buy the basil scent, but opted for the Geranium this time. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, and it&#x27;s hand to describe the scent. I would say its actually smells like a fresh cut flower, a bit earthly and floral. I like the basil better, but my better half prefers this.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean smelling.  Plus this soap has no bad chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> While I love the way this soap smells, it left my hands really dry. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until I really investigated the ingredient list. Although Mrs. Meyers claims that it&#x27;s all-natural, it does have some SLS-like components, which do not agree with my skin. I also believe the chemical fragrance may be contributing to the dryness. I&#x27;m not one to be overly concerned about chemicals, but I do like my skin to feel nice and soft and this soap just doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> This scent is heavenly!  The soap itself is gentle and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands as so many others do.  The large refill size is convenient.</li>
            <li> Effective with a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Slowly trying to replace cosmetics with parabens with those without.  This is light, cleans great, don&#x27;t leave my hands super dry.  It&#x27;s my favorite hand soap.  I almost want to sneak in a bottle just for work. :D</li>
            <li> The smell to this product is nearly overwhelming.  I really like the smell, but it&#x27;s too much really.  It also came in a container, not a pouch, which was ok.</li>
