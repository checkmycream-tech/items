    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I found best results by spraying this product on a Q-tip and rubbing along the hairline.</li>
            <li>but this lace release is the best for wig removal.</li>
            <li>Awesome product used 4 or 5 times it reverts the glue product&lt;</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Rubbing alcohol is still my best friend.</li>
            <li>This is the best glue-remover I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>This Is The Best Lace Release.</li>
            <li>the best and the most excellent product for lace release is MsLola</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is really handy and everyone should have some for wardrobe malfunctions.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be super good for you..</li>
            <li>This works really great and really really fast..</li>
            <li>Okay when I use it to get the glue off my face and even my hands it does not work at all and just produces this baby powder like odor which means nothing if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I Love This Stuff</li>
            <li>Works great and fast for removing my full lace unit.</li>
            <li>It has a strong alcohol scent.</li>
            <li>to its original state making it easy to remove from lace</li>
            <li>I recently bought the Davlyn tape residue and adhesive remover which works great.</li>
            <li>No need to worry about pulling at your own natural hair.  </li>
            <li>worth buying again.</li>
            <li>It is not messy and it is better for the lace.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the investment if you wear lacefront wigs.  </li>
            <li>You can lift the wig right off without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off my skin.</li>
            <li>I once spilled my glue bottle on my desk and this stuff helped get it right up.</li>
            <li>I used to just pull my wigs right off my head or use oil</li>
            <li>Lace comes right off.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with the first reviewer.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles of it after my first one.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>this product is really hard to use because the adhensive would not release immediately and the alochol did not work good  along with this product almost had to use the whole bottle for the lace to be release,</li>
            <li>This works real well.</li>
            <li>It makes removal of glue/ tapes around the hairline much easier.</li>
            <li>And I really like that it&#x27;s a spray</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>when I am ready to remove one of my lace front I can count on this product to deliver what it says it is going to.</li>
            <li>Necessary for quick removal when the wig just wants to stick!</li>
            <li>It has a high alcohol content so it is drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>Much better and quicker results with plain old rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I will order more of this, although it look like it maybe some time because as I said I only had to use a little of this product to achieve what I needed</li>
            <li>There is no harsh smell and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>this is one of the choice because it was much lower in price it works with extra work</li>

            <li> It takes a little work for this to completely get the lace product off my scalp, but I recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a long time to wait for the tape to come off either.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great though, its like inhaling some nasty chemical.</li>
            <li> Therefore, not much is needed.</li>
            <li> It took only a few sprays to remove the adhesive on the wig and attached to me.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need any other tools for removing the tape!</li>
            <li> I have bought it a few times now.</li>
            <li> Spray a little on and in seconds it releases!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really good for taking glue off the lace but it does help loosen it a little.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Ill continue using something else</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even expensive!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to agree with the first reviewer. This works really great and really really fast.. Just spray and wait a couple of seconds. You can lift the wig right off without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well. worth buying again.If you are a lace front or closure wearer this product is a must have.</li>
            <li> This works real well. I bought 3 bottles of it after my first one. Use a Q-tip and it comes right off my skin. It&#x27;s not really good for taking glue off the lace but it does help loosen it a little. I once spilled my glue bottle on my desk and this stuff helped get it right up. It has a strong alcohol scent. Spray it away from your face and nose because it stings! The smell dissipates in seconds though.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will. It makes removal of glue/ tapes around the hairline much easier. It has a high alcohol content so it is drying to the skin. Therefore, not much is needed. I found best results by spraying this product on a Q-tip and rubbing along the hairline.</li>
            <li> I used to just pull my wigs right off my head or use oil but this lace release is the best for wig removal. It is not messy and it is better for the lace. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time to wait for the tape to come off either. I will use this product for now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really handy and everyone should have some for wardrobe malfunctions. It works for a lot of different clothes besides just lingerie.</li>
            <li> Okay when I use it to get the glue off my face and even my hands it does not work at all and just produces this baby powder like odor which means nothing if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  Maybe others like it but to me it&#x27;s useless. I recently bought the Davlyn tape residue and adhesive remover which works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome product used 4 or 5 times it reverts the glue product&lt;br /&gt;back to its original state making it easy to remove from lace&lt;br /&gt;and from scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use and often. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the investment if you wear lacefront wigs.  It&#x27;s real simple to use.  No need to worry about pulling at your own natural hair.  Removes unit with no problem.  It&#x27;s a must for lacefront wearing!</li>
            <li> Works well for removing adhesive from lace wigs.</li>
            <li> Works well on tape extensions and is inexpensive. I have bought it a few times now. The smell isn&#x27;t great though, its like inhaling some nasty chemical. Can&#x27;t be super good for you.. gets the job done though!</li>
            <li> Lace comes right off. It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Much better and quicker results with plain old rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball. Just makes my forehead feel greasy. It does what it says it&#x27;ll do, so I can&#x27;t give it one star, but at the end of the day, I just want my wig off so I can relax... I don&#x27;t need this protracted quest to remove the tape. Rubbing alcohol is still my best friend.</li>
            <li> This is the best glue-remover I&#x27;ve ever had. It works really good and it wasn&#x27;t even expensive! And I really like that it&#x27;s a spray so you don&#x27;t need any other tools for removing the tape!</li>
            <li> This product works exactly like it is suppose to. I have not complaints. I will say. regular alcohol will also do the trick.</li>
            <li> Maybe the problem is my glue but this product isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> kinda oily - spills and drips but it does remove the tape!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Spray a little on and in seconds it releases! This product does what it says and is priced well to boot!</li>
            <li> I use this for one of my clients in my hair salon it smells like alcohol and burns her head ouch! Ill continue using something else</li>
            <li> Lifts the toughest wig adhesive in seconds!</li>
            <li> Necessary for quick removal when the wig just wants to stick!</li>
            <li> I Love This Stuff It Removes The Tape And Without Pulling Your Hair!! This Is The Best Lace Release. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great and fast for removing my full lace unit. Spray and your done!</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises. It took only a few sprays to remove the adhesive on the wig and attached to me. I will order more of this, although it look like it maybe some time because as I said I only had to use a little of this product to achieve what I needed so there is plenty left!</li>
            <li> It takes a little work for this to completely get the lace product off my scalp, but I recommend it.  There is no harsh smell and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Does exactly what it says it is supposed to do. It removes the lace and adhesive from your skin. It is lightweight and not too greasy. I like that when I am ready to remove one of my lace front I can count on this product to deliver what it says it is going to. Great product. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> this product is really hard to use because the adhensive would not release immediately and the alochol did not work good  along with this product almost had to use the whole bottle for the lace to be release, the best and the most excellent product for lace release is MsLola I did compare the two and when I cannot order MsLola Release this is one of the choice because it was much lower in price it works with extra work</li>
