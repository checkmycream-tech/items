            <li>and I think that this a great hydrating cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for twist outs.</li>
            <li>It works great and gives my hair sheen and curl, and helps if I want to set my hair in a curl also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, arrive in 3 days.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it helps me with the humidity, and it has a great smell.</li>
            <li>For the price I can&#x27;t believe what a great product it is</li>
            <li>It is perfect for refreshing wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for waves, it&#x27;s a light non-thick formula that you can feel working as you apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to work on finding a good moisturizer that is compatible with this product.     </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this a great holding product but just add some Eco styler for a nice defined look.</li>
            <li>smells good also</li>
            <li>The cream smells good but way too greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer and for 8 bucks, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite curling creams!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>it was amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>I liked that my curls had bounce which is not the case when I use Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly on each twist along with a dab of gel (any kind of gel works).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, it smells nice and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>The smell of it was very strong.</li>
            <li>Honestly, though, it works great on my daughter&#x27;s straight hair.</li>
            <li>Of course, it did not make my hair 3a, but it really defined my curls beautifully.</li>
            <li>I moisturized my niece&#x27;s, mom&#x27;s and my own hair with it last night, and we all had the most beautiful wavy curls!  </li>
            <li>The price of this is great compared to many of the much higher priced products on the market, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I found this to be better than Kinky Curly curling custard.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the price.</li>
            <li>I also used and loved the Great Detangler in the same product line.</li>
            <li>I believe that women with looser curls will benefit more from Miss Waajid&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>my curls came out so juicy and sexy and voluminous</li>
            <li>I have since tried it with a firmer hold gel on top but didn&#x27;t like the texture/</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying the curl definition, control and shine</li>
            <li>I was expecting to have to try many diff products</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite hair styling product.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I found something that isn&#x27;t too watery or to waxy for my hair.</li>
            <li>Just started with this product, recommended by my girlfriend, needs more time to do an evaluation.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nice product because it smells great and gives natural and semi-processed hair the desired curl definition.</li>
            <li>In fact, sectioning the hair, THEN twisting is better way to</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Also product has a clean, lite scent which is nice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller; arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my hair feels so soft and my curls look great.</li>
            <li>This product worked great on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I put some on top of her dry hair for flyaways, and it worked brilliantly.</li>
            <li>It seems Ms. Waajid really cares about providing the best natural ingredients in her products, because I read the label of everything that I put on my hair.  </li>
            <li>also Wave Builders has a  STRONG perfume fragrance............</li>
            <li>If you have fine curly hair STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product that is light and does wonders for my curls.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of sticky and isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>i was informed of teh item i seem to enjoy it at this moment</li>
            <li>It is really light on my hair.</li>
            <li>but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have purchased from the Taaliah Waajid line and because of this, I want to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I have been &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; afro-curly for many years now, and have tried several brands and types of creams, lotions, and potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from making my own hair moisturizer, this cream is what I prefer to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells good and has a nice heavy consistency.  </li>
            <li>both products are full of Petroleum &amp; Lanolin...</li>
            <li>Great for daily use and does not require large amounts to work</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the products feels good in the...doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it completely changes my curls into a soft bouncy texture.</li>
            <li>I have tried other creams TJ by far is the best.</li>
            <li>This cream by far gives the best curl definition in comparison to the other creams on the market.</li>
            <li>But this time I used only this product and a light gel and my curls were lovely and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I try to be very careful, and so far, I can say her Curly Curl Hair Cream makes my curls and waves do the bump and the happy dance too!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, soft, touchable curls the next day!</li>
            <li>I used on my 3 year old and it lays her edges down beautifully!</li>
            <li>you can wash her hair put this through your hair and it actually define your curls even without doing a two strand twists or even without doing braids it&#x27;s and amazing Product.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is defined, soft, residue free (some products do NOT mix well), bouncy and have a nice soft sheen.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my natural hair feel.</li>
            <li>Waajid is far superior to some of my old stand by products like Sportn&#x27; Waves &amp; Wave Builders</li>
            <li>I paid $8.00, and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny....</li>
            <li>I have 4b/4c natural hair if wondering :)</li>
            <li>freshly washed, conditioned and damp hair</li>
            <li>I love many of the other products, but this one was a miss for me.</li>
            <li>I order it, and it comes right to my home.</li>
            <li>The price was right, $8.00 and change.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with several curl creams since going natural and I must say I absolutely love this curl cream, but more than that</li>
            <li>I think it defines curls and looks good without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The first is with the product and the second is without :)</li>
            <li>This product provided the exact curls I was looking for in my hair.</li>
            <li>Just tried this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>The second time I lightly moisturized my hair with Carols Daughter Marjories Miracle hair dress after a fresh wash, and then applied the Curly Curl cream to each section before twisting and wrapping in bantu knots.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it 4 stars because I would have liked a little  more shine</li>
            <li>I will admit that I was amazed at how it really does define waves and curls with out even using that much!</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft and did not have the greasy feel that I get from Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance, and a little goes quite a ways.</li>
            <li>This a great curl cream for natural hair, my  hair is fairly thick but just a little amount about a quarter size gave amazing results.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put it on my hair right after washing for tight, cute, carefree, no work, ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t like that build up greasy affect  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>This product leaves no film and rubs in really well.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy consistency and it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>maybe i used too much coconut oil underneath the product.</li>
            <li>look of my hair nearly as much.</li>
            <li>Product makes my hair very greasy....</li>
            <li>The smell was really overpowering, even nauseating at times.</li>
            <li>I guess this shouldn&#x27;t have been much of a surprise.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very moisturizing, and just what my hair needed.  </li>
            <li>but I absolutely loooooove this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really leave my hair with any shine</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love how the product smells, but the first thing that caught my attention after applying the product was how heavy it was on my hair.</li>
            <li>i would definitely buy the full size.</li>
            <li>I think this product may be become my new number ONE!</li>
            <li>On freshly washed hair I used my whipped shea butter mix and a dab of the curly cream on a braid out and the next day my hair was very shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>my hair felt like i had i had put a gallon of this stuff on when i only used  a quarter size amount  on fresh washed hair  </li>
            <li>I normally would use a leave-in, a curl enhancer and a gel.</li>
            <li>It is thick and kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is thick, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>be easy on how much you apply if your heavy handed.</li>
            <li>The only good thing i would say is that it really defined my 3C/4A curls on the first day and maybe because its heavy but other than that.</li>
            <li>This product is mainly for African-Americans hair is in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay for me as there are few products on the market that bring a shine to my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Rejuvenates my curls in dry or wet hair but really works even better after hair has been just washed.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly but has some straight areas but this product curled the straight areas and gave my hair a different curl pattern.</li>
            <li>I follow the Curly Girl method and forgot some of my hair products when traveling, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to coconut products and some proteins.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for slicking your hair back and having it look neat and pretty.</li>
            <li>Boy was I happily surprised!</li>
            <li>Another plus is the natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I saw the curl cream used on short hair and it curled pretty good but not for thick long hair.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a new product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It defined my natural curls without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 2 day old hair.</li>
            <li>Here is a picture of my five day old hair being retwisted</li>
            <li>natural hair looooves this stuff..</li>
            <li>it felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The Curl Enhancing Smoothie leaves somewhat of a white film on your hair that you have to really rub in.</li>
            <li>The result was soft, bouncy, elongated curls without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this at the natural hair show.</li>
            <li>My curls were so incredibly soft and defined but still lasted all day without drooping.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used after washing and conditioning my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Its not too light, or too heavy.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and bouncy and felt moisturized, it just didn&#x27;t look like it.</li>
            <li>Purchased it to do twist outs on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>but if yue hair is dry like mine, then I tecommend putting oil in first.</li>
            <li>i was taking a chance (because no one wants to look like a hot mess on their birthday) and used it in a bantu knot/twist.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work on my natural African hair!</li>
            <li>there was barely any in my case.</li>
            <li>it barely lasted to day 3 before i had to co-wash.</li>
            <li>This stuff Worked Wonders on my very short natural fro.</li>
            <li>remains soft for the entire day and even withstands the abuse of my office air</li>
            <li>I am a new natural sistah and have very dry bushy hair.</li>
            <li>It is, however, very heavy and builds up residue quite quickly.</li>
            <li>it is so hard in the natural world  to find the right products ...</li>
            <li>i would appreciate it if the full size was at least 8oz.</li>
            <li>I use it every single day on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed as soon as I started using this my hair laid down flatter and had a shine that was vibrant.</li>

            <li> I found this to be better than Kinky Curly curling custard.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the price.</li>
            <li> I also used and loved the Great Detangler in the same product line.</li>
            <li> I believe that women with looser curls will benefit more from Miss Waajid&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> my curls came out so juicy and sexy and voluminous</li>
            <li> I have since tried it with a firmer hold gel on top but didn&#x27;t like the texture/</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the curl definition, control and shine</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have to try many diff products</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite hair styling product.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I found something that isn&#x27;t too watery or to waxy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Just started with this product, recommended by my girlfriend, needs more time to do an evaluation.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product because it smells great and gives natural and semi-processed hair the desired curl definition.</li>
            <li> In fact, sectioning the hair, THEN twisting is better way to</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Also product has a clean, lite scent which is nice.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller; arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my hair feels so soft and my curls look great.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I put some on top of her dry hair for flyaways, and it worked brilliantly.</li>
            <li> It seems Ms. Waajid really cares about providing the best natural ingredients in her products, because I read the label of everything that I put on my hair.  </li>
            <li> also Wave Builders has a  STRONG perfume fragrance............</li>
            <li> If you have fine curly hair STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that is light and does wonders for my curls.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of sticky and isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> i was informed of teh item i seem to enjoy it at this moment</li>
            <li> It is really light on my hair.</li>
            <li> but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have purchased from the Taaliah Waajid line and because of this, I want to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I have been &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; afro-curly for many years now, and have tried several brands and types of creams, lotions, and potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from making my own hair moisturizer, this cream is what I prefer to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells good and has a nice heavy consistency.  </li>
            <li> both products are full of Petroleum &amp; Lanolin...</li>
            <li> Great for daily use and does not require large amounts to work</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the products feels good in the...doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it completely changes my curls into a soft bouncy texture.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams TJ by far is the best.</li>
            <li> This cream by far gives the best curl definition in comparison to the other creams on the market.</li>
            <li> But this time I used only this product and a light gel and my curls were lovely and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I try to be very careful, and so far, I can say her Curly Curl Hair Cream makes my curls and waves do the bump and the happy dance too!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, soft, touchable curls the next day!</li>
            <li> I used on my 3 year old and it lays her edges down beautifully!</li>
            <li> you can wash her hair put this through your hair and it actually define your curls even without doing a two strand twists or even without doing braids it&#x27;s and amazing Product.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is defined, soft, residue free (some products do NOT mix well), bouncy and have a nice soft sheen.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my natural hair feel.</li>
            <li> Waajid is far superior to some of my old stand by products like Sportn&#x27; Waves &amp; Wave Builders</li>
            <li> I paid $8.00, and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny....</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c natural hair if wondering :)</li>
            <li> freshly washed, conditioned and damp hair</li>
            <li> I love many of the other products, but this one was a miss for me.</li>
            <li> I order it, and it comes right to my home.</li>
            <li> The price was right, $8.00 and change.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with several curl creams since going natural and I must say I absolutely love this curl cream, but more than that</li>
            <li> I think it defines curls and looks good without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The first is with the product and the second is without :)</li>
            <li> This product provided the exact curls I was looking for in my hair.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> The second time I lightly moisturized my hair with Carols Daughter Marjories Miracle hair dress after a fresh wash, and then applied the Curly Curl cream to each section before twisting and wrapping in bantu knots.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because I would have liked a little  more shine</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was amazed at how it really does define waves and curls with out even using that much!</li>
            <li> My hair was super soft and did not have the greasy feel that I get from Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance, and a little goes quite a ways.</li>
            <li> This a great curl cream for natural hair, my  hair is fairly thick but just a little amount about a quarter size gave amazing results.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put it on my hair right after washing for tight, cute, carefree, no work, ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like that build up greasy affect  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This product leaves no film and rubs in really well.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy consistency and it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> maybe i used too much coconut oil underneath the product.</li>
            <li> look of my hair nearly as much.</li>
            <li> Product makes my hair very greasy....</li>
            <li> The smell was really overpowering, even nauseating at times.</li>
            <li> I guess this shouldn&#x27;t have been much of a surprise.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very moisturizing, and just what my hair needed.  </li>
            <li> but I absolutely loooooove this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really leave my hair with any shine</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love how the product smells, but the first thing that caught my attention after applying the product was how heavy it was on my hair.</li>
            <li> i would definitely buy the full size.</li>
            <li> I think this product may be become my new number ONE!</li>
            <li> On freshly washed hair I used my whipped shea butter mix and a dab of the curly cream on a braid out and the next day my hair was very shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> my hair felt like i had i had put a gallon of this stuff on when i only used  a quarter size amount  on fresh washed hair  </li>
            <li> I normally would use a leave-in, a curl enhancer and a gel.</li>
            <li> It is thick and kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> be easy on how much you apply if your heavy handed.</li>
            <li> The only good thing i would say is that it really defined my 3C/4A curls on the first day and maybe because its heavy but other than that.</li>
            <li> This product is mainly for African-Americans hair is in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay for me as there are few products on the market that bring a shine to my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Rejuvenates my curls in dry or wet hair but really works even better after hair has been just washed.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly but has some straight areas but this product curled the straight areas and gave my hair a different curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I follow the Curly Girl method and forgot some of my hair products when traveling, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to coconut products and some proteins.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for slicking your hair back and having it look neat and pretty.</li>
            <li> Boy was I happily surprised!</li>
            <li> Another plus is the natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li> I saw the curl cream used on short hair and it curled pretty good but not for thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It defined my natural curls without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 2 day old hair.</li>
            <li> Here is a picture of my five day old hair being retwisted</li>
            <li> natural hair looooves this stuff..</li>
            <li> it felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The Curl Enhancing Smoothie leaves somewhat of a white film on your hair that you have to really rub in.</li>
            <li> The result was soft, bouncy, elongated curls without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this at the natural hair show.</li>
            <li> My curls were so incredibly soft and defined but still lasted all day without drooping.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used after washing and conditioning my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Its not too light, or too heavy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and bouncy and felt moisturized, it just didn&#x27;t look like it.</li>
            <li> Purchased it to do twist outs on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but if yue hair is dry like mine, then I tecommend putting oil in first.</li>
            <li> i was taking a chance (because no one wants to look like a hot mess on their birthday) and used it in a bantu knot/twist.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work on my natural African hair!</li>
            <li> there was barely any in my case.</li>
            <li> it barely lasted to day 3 before i had to co-wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff Worked Wonders on my very short natural fro.</li>
            <li> remains soft for the entire day and even withstands the abuse of my office air</li>
            <li> I am a new natural sistah and have very dry bushy hair.</li>
            <li> It is, however, very heavy and builds up residue quite quickly.</li>
            <li> it is so hard in the natural world  to find the right products ...</li>
            <li> i would appreciate it if the full size was at least 8oz.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I noticed as soon as I started using this my hair laid down flatter and had a shine that was vibrant.</li>
            <li> I used this right after I got out the shower to two-strand twist my hair for the next day; I barely used any of this, because it&#x27;s so thick that a tiny amount could be used for half of my head.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, but it keeps my hair moisturized and soft throughout the entire day.  </li>
            <li> next day,  my twist out was soft, well defined, bouncy but a little</li>
            <li> Even my two-strand twits did not last a very long time after leaving the product on my hair for ours.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so be careful not to apply to much, there will be shrinkage</li>
            <li> My main reason is because the product will turn your Z shapped curls into  3c curls after you apply it, then your hair will turn into an Afro with very little curl definitions after the product dries out.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the next day that it left my hair feeling STIFF and left white sticky residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair very dry after I washed it</li>
            <li> , I use to use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie, and this one beats it by a long run.</li>
            <li> It leaves a film coating on my hair that feels sticky after a day and feels dry.</li>
            <li> I use for my 2-strand twist outs...on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t dry out and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch between washes.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my 3c-4a hair and apart from the build up and stickiness, my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at Walmart for $8.00 and some change and did a twist out on dry (TWA) hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on both dry and damped hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it the first time and it worked, but my hair was a little on the dull side.</li>
            <li> and theres still half a jar left because i WONT be using anymore of it.</li>
            <li> , I dont recommend you use like regular gel unless you dont mind the whitish look, my hair is black so its visible if I dont brush.</li>
            <li> It builds up and made my hair very dry and brittle feeling.</li>
            <li> The one drawback is that although it was very soft, my hair appeared a little dull on the second day.</li>
            <li> It says to apply to wet or dry hair, but I prefer to apply it to wet hair.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t do what i expected for my hair</li>
            <li> I used this product to twist my wet hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from walgreens for roughly round the same price on here.</li>
            <li> I really expected this cream to just moisturize...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and I mean several curl creams, gels and puddings</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For a looser curl look, I let my hair dry a little, put it in 4-6 sections and add cream to each section and braid.  </li>
            <li> The cream gets really messy if you sweat before your hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> dull.&lt;br /&gt;No need to slather on, a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A must for my curly/wavy hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> Eco Styler gel leaves my hair crunchy, but it does not weight the hair down like that.</li>
            <li> One thing like other viewers is to remember to use a little and distribute evenly, thats how I kept the flaking down</li>
            <li> and i bought a jar of this about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> If I want a fuller, less defined look, I&#x27;ll use it by itself (when used by itself, my hair gets little to no definition).  </li>
            <li> Tried this on my niece 4b hair and after a few hours, her hair was dry and dull.</li>
            <li> and I am little concerned about one ingredient (DMDM Hydantoin)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The results:  defined hair with a little hold.  </li>
            <li> I just use a little bit.</li>
            <li> was a little worried because the product consistency is sticky and thick.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars hands down!</li>
            <li> It rehydrates my curls without leaving them heavy and oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> The product is too heavy.</li>
            <li> The product is too expensive and it takes to long too dry.</li>
            <li> My advice is to use a little on small sections at a time to create your curls.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> a little goes a looong way!</li>
            <li> I have a 2b-3a curl pattern in my hair and feared this would be too heavy for me!</li>
            <li> I applied small amounts with my fingers to define my curl pattern</li>
            <li> but I took small sections..because I was going to do two strand twist...</li>
            <li> Usually, I have to retwist my hair almost every night, not with this product.</li>
            <li> the smell is quite annoying and the texture is sooo THICK and super sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy sticky, smelly nor does it leave a hard crunch  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Talia Waajid products and was left disappointed as well; even the kids line.</li>
            <li> My hair was still damp, used a dime size amount of this product on my short hair and was left with an awful residue that eventually dried into a frizzy fro.</li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and thick which I did not expect.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length thick hair</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the thick side</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed because Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie goes on as a heavy  white paste that takes forever to dry &amp; absorb into the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dampened the section and rubbed a very small amount of cream on the section and</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and kinky.</li>
            <li> and I have a very thick, 3c 4a TWA,</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t spend unnecessary money</li>
            <li> and this was the absolute worst product i have used.</li>
            <li> And after talking to another hair stylist she informed me that this has silicones in it and mineral oil after this bogus stylist told me it doesnt, and my hair hates silicones, so that made it worse.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I needed for my fairly thin hair.</li>
            <li> Real thick product, sticky but does define curls and waves.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased.</li>
            <li> I two strand twisted over night.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product and won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way this makes my natural hair feel.</li>
            <li> I just purchased  Waajid Curl Cream this week I will admit that I was amazed at how it really does define waves and curls with out even using that much! I am only giving it 4 stars because I would have liked a little  more shine and I am little concerned about one ingredient (DMDM Hydantoin)&lt;br /&gt;  This product is not greasy sticky, smelly nor does it leave a hard crunch  a little goes a looong way! I was hoping to get these same results from Shea Moisture Curling Enhancing Smoothie but I was very disappointed because Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie goes on as a heavy  white paste that takes forever to dry &amp; absorb into the hair.&lt;br /&gt; Waajid is far superior to some of my old stand by products like Sportn&#x27; Waves &amp; Wave Builders both products are full of Petroleum &amp; Lanolin... also Wave Builders has a  STRONG perfume fragrance............ I think this product may be become my new number ONE!</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t like that build up greasy affect  i only used the product once after it settled about an hour after use  my hair felt gucky  if that&#x27;s a word  my hair felt like i had i had put a gallon of this stuff on when i only used  a quarter size amount  on fresh washed hair  the product might work wonders on a different texture  it just didn&#x27;t do what i expected for my hair i suggest (and i will take my advice also) go to my local beauty supply store to see if they have a sample to try then come back to amazon(they seem to have the best prices) to purchase the item if i like it that way i don&#x27;t spend unnecessary money it is so hard in the natural world  to find the right products ...</li>
            <li> I lucked up and found this cream for my 4cc (yes I put cc......lol) hair. My hair is very thick and kinky. I have tried other creams TJ by far is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for waves, it&#x27;s a light non-thick formula that you can feel working as you apply it. I noticed as soon as I started using this my hair laid down flatter and had a shine that was vibrant. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I found this to be better than Kinky Curly curling custard. The Kinky curly stuff didn&#x27;t seem to define my curls like Taliah Waajid cream. I am totally impressed!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based off a recommendation from a coworker. I had reservations b/c he has 3a 3b hair and I have a very thick, 3c 4a TWA, but I was not disappointed. Of course, it did not make my hair 3a, but it really defined my curls beautifully. It is a little sticky, but it keeps my hair moisturized and soft throughout the entire day.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love many of the other products, but this one was a miss for me. It builds up and made my hair very dry and brittle feeling. It was awful.</li>
            <li> I do not like it.  It is thick and kind of sticky.  It is definitely not for my hair type. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I use this in my daughter&#x27;s hair to do twists. Love the smell and the products feels good in the...doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It is a curl cream, so it does cause some shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new product for my natural hair. I was in the process of ordering Design Essential. However, i seen this product and decided to purchase. This was exactly what I needed. It defined my natural curls without leaving any residue. Works great as a moisturizer and adds shine!!!!!! I will be usong this product!</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance, and a little goes quite a ways. I use after wetting my hair as the final step in my hair regimen.    It lasted almost 2 months between my daughter and I. This product worked great on my natural hair. I paid $8.00, and it&#x27;s worth the money. A must for my curly/wavy hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. It sets the curls in place, as well as moisturizes. I use it daily as part of my hair regimen. The product is white, so don&#x27;t use a lot..massage into the hair well. I use it to lock my daughter&#x27;s curls in place as well. A Keeper for me!    Will purchase again in a day.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work on my natural African hair! I&#x27;m just disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is perfect for refreshing wash and go&#x27;s. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite curling creams! It smells great, but is a bit sticky. I use this on my 2 day old hair. Here is a picture of my five day old hair being retwisted</li>
            <li> Worth every penny....natural hair looooves this stuff..no sticky residue after multiple uses for weeks, yes weeks, at a time. Smells wonderful. Great product. This product has mixed chicks products beat</li>
            <li> It smells so good! It&#x27;s sticky and thick which I did not expect. It works well but if yue hair is dry like mine, then I tecommend putting oil in first. Morocco oil or coconut oil works well. After that then put in this stuff! I think it defines curls and looks good without weighting my hair down. You be the judge. The first is with the product and the second is without :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with several curl creams since going natural and I must say I absolutely love this curl cream, but more than that I love the price. This cream by far gives the best curl definition in comparison to the other creams on the market. This cream is a definite must-buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. The moment I put it onto my hair it felt soft and moisturized. This is the first product I have purchased from the Taaliah Waajid line and because of this, I want to purchase more. It&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer and for 8 bucks, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. I WILL be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use to use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie, and this one beats it by a long run. The Curl Enhancing Smoothie leaves somewhat of a white film on your hair that you have to really rub in. This product leaves no film and rubs in really well.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found a cheaper alternative to Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding (the purple stuff). I used this product to twist my wet hair after shampooing. After drying overnight, I removed the twists. The result was soft, bouncy, elongated curls without a greasy feel. I liked that my curls had bounce which is not the case when I use Miss Jessie&#x27;s. My hair was super soft and did not have the greasy feel that I get from Miss Jessie&#x27;s. The one drawback is that although it was very soft, my hair appeared a little dull on the second day. I&#x27;ll need to work on finding a good moisturizer that is compatible with this product.     I also used and loved the Great Detangler in the same product line.</li>
            <li> Great product, i like it a lot .. After i have cowashed &amp; deep conditioned my hair i apply my leave in conditioner then apply this product while my hair is still damp and i get great results. A little goes a long way so be easy on how much you apply if your heavy handed. The scent lingers a bit but throughout the day but i don&#x27;t mind having great smelling hair all day. I have 4b/4c natural hair if wondering :)</li>
            <li> I love how the product smells, but the first thing that caught my attention after applying the product was how heavy it was on my hair. Eco Styler gel leaves my hair crunchy, but it does not weight the hair down like that. This product is not a gel. It has a creamy consistency and it is very moisturizing.  I would never recommend this product to somebody who has 4c hair type like mine. My main reason is because the product will turn your Z shapped curls into  3c curls after you apply it, then your hair will turn into an Afro with very little curl definitions after the product dries out. If your hair type is anywhere between 3a and 3c, I would recommend this product for wash and gos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I did get some curl definition with this product, but the curls did not last. Even my two-strand twits did not last a very long time after leaving the product on my hair for ours. The product is too expensive and it takes to long too dry. The cream gets really messy if you sweat before your hair is completely dry. It also left my hair very dry after I washed it out.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this product was not created for all hair types. I believe that women with looser curls will benefit more from Miss Waajid&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this at the natural hair show. tried it out the night before my birthday. i was taking a chance (because no one wants to look like a hot mess on their birthday) and used it in a bantu knot/twist. oh my word. the results were amazing. my curls came out so juicy and sexy and voluminous (i&#x27;m a volume fiend!)  it was amazing. i was getting complements all day. the only thing i had a problem with was the hold.  there was barely any in my case. maybe i used too much coconut oil underneath the product. it barely lasted to day 3 before i had to co-wash. either way i would definitely buy the full size. the only thing left to do is decide whether or not to by it here or scour the shelves for it.&lt;br /&gt;also one discrepancy about the size. i would appreciate it if the full size was at least 8oz.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products that I have found.  I recommend it for slicking your hair back and having it look neat and pretty.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, and smells nice. I have thick 4c hair. When I use the product it leaves my hair tacky. No residue just tacky, and makes it clump together. It somewhat softens my hair, but my ends at the end of the would need additional moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is mainly for African-Americans hair is in it&#x27;s natural state. It  does what it says it defines your curls you can wash her hair put this through your hair and it actually define your curls even without doing a two strand twists or even without doing braids it&#x27;s and amazing Product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have a 2b-3a curl pattern in my hair and feared this would be too heavy for me! I follow the Curly Girl method and forgot some of my hair products when traveling, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to coconut products and some proteins. Since this didn&#x27;t have any obvious offenders and I don&#x27;t have a degree in cosmetic chemistry, I gave it a try. Boy was I happily surprised! My hair looked great! My waves were definitely reaching their potential with this product. The smell is like a fruity shampoo, very pleasant. My curls were so incredibly soft and defined but still lasted all day without drooping. I normally would use a leave-in, a curl enhancer and a gel. But this time I used only this product and a light gel and my curls were lovely and frizz free. I have since tried it with a firmer hold gel on top but didn&#x27;t like the texture/look of my hair nearly as much. I found it at CVS for $8.49 and it will continue to be a staple in my hair regimen!</li>
            <li> This product provided the exact curls I was looking for in my hair. I love this product! Great product and I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair moist and luxurious looking, but it does cause a lot of shrinkage.  It smells good and has a nice heavy consistency.  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Product makes my hair very greasy....hate it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product.  It is very thick and I love it.  It is comparable to Design Essentials.</li>
            <li> great product. my wife used product on her and my daughter&#x27;s hair and she loves it. i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I like the texture ans smell. My hair feels moisturized when I use it. Definitely a keeper! I&#x27;m a 4c hair type</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! The smell is amazing and so is the consistency of the product. A little bit goes a long way. Leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; use sparingly. I prefer with a blend of quality organic lotion (no fragrance, parabens, etc.).</li>
            <li> This stuff Worked Wonders on my very short natural fro. I applied small amounts with my fingers to define my curl pattern and I&#x27;m very happy with the outcome. Also product has a clean, lite scent which is nice. Another reviewer said this left hair \\&quot;gunky\\&quot;. My advice is to use a little on small sections at a time to create your curls.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your curls, girls.</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length thick hair so i had a problem trying to get my hair to curl. I saw the curl cream used on short hair and it curled pretty good but not for thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair, I would like to make them curly and smoothy. I want to avoid using relaxer creme.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time yesterday. I bought mine from walgreens for roughly round the same price on here. I have kinky curly shoulder length 4a/b hair and I think that this a great hydrating cream. On freshly washed hair I used my whipped shea butter mix and a dab of the curly cream on a braid out and the next day my hair was very shiny and moisturized. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a great holding product but just add some Eco styler for a nice defined look. I did not get any residue or build up</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a bogus hairstylist who acted like she knew everything and this was the absolute worst product i have used. The only good thing i would say is that it really defined my 3C/4A curls on the first day and maybe because its heavy but other than that. The smell was really overpowering, even nauseating at times. It leaves a film coating on my hair that feels sticky after a day and feels dry. And after talking to another hair stylist she informed me that this has silicones in it and mineral oil after this bogus stylist told me it doesnt, and my hair hates silicones, so that made it worse. The shampoo and detangler smell the same way, and now the whole line and 2 jars of this are sitting staring at me everyday</li>
            <li> I love it! Does wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li> Very good for the hair I remmend this</li>
            <li> Got this stuff from Wal-mart with the hopes of finding an alternative to Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. I used after washing and conditioning my natural hair. My hair was still damp, used a dime size amount of this product on my short hair and was left with an awful residue that eventually dried into a frizzy fro. I could&#x27;t wait to wash it out. Very disappointed in this product and won&#x27;t be buying again. I&#x27;ve tried other Talia Waajid products and was left disappointed as well; even the kids line. I guess this shouldn&#x27;t have been much of a surprise.</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday and my hair LOVES it!  I moisturized my niece&#x27;s, mom&#x27;s and my own hair with it last night, and we all had the most beautiful wavy curls!  Its not too light, or too heavy.  I found it to be very moisturizing, and just what my hair needed.  I&#x27;ll be buying more!  Another plus is the natural ingredients!  It seems Ms. Waajid really cares about providing the best natural ingredients in her products, because I read the label of everything that I put on my hair.  I try to be very careful, and so far, I can say her Curly Curl Hair Cream makes my curls and waves do the bump and the happy dance too! Yippie!</li>
            <li> The smell of it was very strong. Used it once. Never used it again.  Sorry I purchased. ..... It .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and I mean several curl creams, gels and puddings but I absolutely loooooove this stuff.  I use it every single day on my natural hair.  Sometimes I put it on my hair right after washing for tight, cute, carefree, no work, ringlet curls.  For a looser curl look, I let my hair dry a little, put it in 4-6 sections and add cream to each section and braid.  Voila! Beautiful, soft, touchable curls the next day!</li>
            <li> It defines curls but it leaves a film on your hair which I don&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the curl definition, control and shine this product provides. It&#x27;s also great for twist outs. I highly recommend this product and seller; arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I use for my 2-strand twist outs...on dry hair.  It took some time/patience in figuring out how to use the product correctly for my type of hair (4B/C) but once I devised the correct method, it has been a breeze.  I use it sparingly on each twist along with a dab of gel (any kind of gel works).  The results:  defined hair with a little hold.  If I want a fuller, less defined look, I&#x27;ll use it by itself (when used by itself, my hair gets little to no definition).  This product doesn&#x27;t really leave my hair with any shine but that&#x27;s okay for me as there are few products on the market that bring a shine to my natural hair.  The price of this is great compared to many of the much higher priced products on the market, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have 3b texture and i bought a jar of this about a year and a half ago and theres still half a jar left because i WONT be using anymore of it. It just does not do anything for me at all..the smell is quite annoying and the texture is sooo THICK and super sticky. I also noticed the next day that it left my hair feeling STIFF and left white sticky residue in my hair. If you have fine curly hair STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> this is some very good stuff not greasy</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that is light and does wonders for my curls. This product is it. Rejuvenates my curls in dry or wet hair but really works even better after hair has been just washed. Keeps the curl for the entire day and even after having slept on the hair.  This is an excellent product. Great for daily use and does not require large amounts to work (that is saying a lot because my hair is quite thick).&lt;br /&gt;Hair remains soft for the entire day and even withstands the abuse of my office air condition.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that this is not sold in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Real thick product, sticky but does define curls and waves. smells good also</li>
            <li> I am a new natural sistah and have very dry bushy hair. I really expected this cream to just moisturize...but I took small sections..because I was going to do two strand twist...I dampened the section and rubbed a very small amount of cream on the section and what definition!!! I was expecting to have to try many diff products b4 finding one to define my curls but this stuff is awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I found this at my local Sally&#x27;s when I felt like giving up on my curly hair. This stuff is awesome! My hair is curly but has some straight areas but this product curled the straight areas and gave my hair a different curl pattern. I used on my 3 year old and it lays her edges down beautifully!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  It rehydrates my curls without leaving them heavy and oily feeling.  YES!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite hair styling product. I have been &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; afro-curly for many years now, and have tried several brands and types of creams, lotions, and potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from making my own hair moisturizer, this cream is what I prefer to use on my hair. It works great and gives my hair sheen and curl, and helps if I want to set my hair in a curl also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it smells nice and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I tried it the first time and it worked, but my hair was a little on the dull side. My hair was soft and bouncy and felt moisturized, it just didn&#x27;t look like it. The second time I lightly moisturized my hair with Carols Daughter Marjories Miracle hair dress after a fresh wash, and then applied the Curly Curl cream to each section before twisting and wrapping in bantu knots. Now my hair is defined, soft, residue free (some products do NOT mix well), bouncy and have a nice soft sheen.  I have a mix of 3c/4a/4b hair and I am glad I found something that isn&#x27;t too watery or to waxy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year. I love the fact that my hair feels so soft and my curls look great. My hair doesn&#x27;t dry out and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch between washes. I just wash my hair using my regular shampoo and conditioner, then I apply my curl cream. I just use a little bit. It says to apply to wet or dry hair, but I prefer to apply it to wet hair. Also, I used to buy it from a beauty supply shop then I saw it on Amazon and with shipping included, IT WAS ACTUALLY CHEAPER! I order it, and it comes right to my home.</li>
            <li> This a great curl cream for natural hair, my  hair is fairly thick but just a little amount about a quarter size gave amazing results. One thing like other viewers is to remember to use a little and distribute evenly, thats how I kept the flaking down, I dont recommend you use like regular gel unless you dont mind the whitish look, my hair is black so its visible if I dont brush.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 3a/3b hair but it&#x27;s kind of sticky and isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.  Honestly, though, it works great on my daughter&#x27;s straight hair. I put some on top of her dry hair for flyaways, and it worked brilliantly.</li>
            <li> Just started with this product, recommended by my girlfriend, needs more time to do an evaluation.</li>
            <li> This sucks. Tried this on my niece 4b hair and after a few hours, her hair was dry and dull. This leaves a lot of residue and gave her flakes. It did provide hold with her twists though. Tried this on my 3c-4a hair and apart from the build up and stickiness, my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> The cream smells good but way too greasy. Purchased it to do twist outs on my natural hair. The product is too heavy.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrive in 3 days. When using the product don&#x27;t use daily because it clumps up. However leaves wonderful curls</li>
            <li> this is the best thing for your heir.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> i was informed of teh item i seem to enjoy it at this moment</li>
            <li> Nice product because it smells great and gives natural and semi-processed hair the desired curl definition. It is, however, very heavy and builds up residue quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars hands down! I purchased it at Walmart for $8.00 and some change and did a twist out on dry (TWA) hair. Usually, I have to retwist my hair almost every night, not with this product. I twist my hair Sunday and my twist out lasted until my next weekly wash. A little goes a long way, so be careful not to apply to much, there will be shrinkage but I don&#x27;t mind it helps me with the humidity, and it has a great smell. My hair was soft and manageable. For the price I can&#x27;t believe what a great product it is and I will purchase it again! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Picked this product up at my local Wal-Mart.  The price was right, $8.00 and change.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried because the product consistency is sticky and thick.&lt;br /&gt;On freshly washed, conditioned and damp hair I two strand twisted over night.&lt;br /&gt;The next day,  my twist out was soft, well defined, bouncy but a little dull.&lt;br /&gt;No need to slather on, a small amount goes a long way.  In fact, sectioning the hair, THEN twisting is better way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend &amp; would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. The smell is great and it completely changes my curls into a soft bouncy texture. It is a bit on the thick side but that&#x27;s what I needed for my fairly thin hair.</li>
            <li> Too sticky and leaves a residue</li>
            <li> My hair is quite coarse and I must admit it works. I use it on both dry and damped hair. It is really light on my hair. non greasy at all. I like the way it makes my hair look even days after i use it.</li>
            <li> I used this right after I got out the shower to two-strand twist my hair for the next day; I barely used any of this, because it&#x27;s so thick that a tiny amount could be used for half of my head.</li>
    </ol>
