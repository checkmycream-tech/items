            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it makes my hair feel soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to spend more for this kind of quality.</li>
            <li>i wish the made the conditioner too, but other than that its wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed that the color has become more rich and also, thicker, which is the result I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, baby-thin strands growing.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it so it will take a while to genuinely know whether it is effective or not.</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous.</li>
            <li>very useful.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and shiny without stripping the color or moisture.</li>
            <li>and it did nothing special to my hair.</li>
            <li>it works really well and has done wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, but once a week is great.</li>
            <li>I now use it once or twice a week in between a daily shampoo and it works nicely, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it had</li>
            <li>So far my hair is enjoying it.</li>
            <li>so when we found it on Amazon she bought it right away.</li>
            <li>This is my first review of a product so that should say something there.</li>
            <li>I found out from my Davines stylist that the ingredients in this product really only grow the fine, baby-thin hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>However, I used it as directed for over a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed too much hair growth.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I at first thought that as well, but after using it the smell reminded me of a spa that my wife and I visited frequently in Santa Cruz.</li>
            <li>Added luster without weight, and bounce without extra product being used; nice subtle fragrance is pleasant but does not compete with other scents.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff, and the slight tingle I feel when I use it.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended me to wash my hair with clothes detergent (YES, that white powder for clothes) to remove all the product that has been concentrated in my hair for several weeks and after doing I couldn&#x27;t believe how many times I had to rinse my hair to remove all the product.</li>
            <li>And i have seen new hair growth.</li>
            <li>When I used it more lazily (every 3 days) I didn&#x27;t see results at all.</li>
            <li>The price is awesone in the regular market is twice, delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit stronger than the ones in the old Davines bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this all the time and was surprised by the smell.</li>
            <li>The first day there are no problems, but by the 2nd or 3rd day in a row (I wash my hair every day)</li>
            <li>but my shedding has really slowed down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use it once very week (or if possibles less) to avoid the greasiness.</li>
            <li>It feels a little tingly and my hair/scalp seem to get gently cleaned.</li>

            <li> I love this line, it&#x27;s 80% pure ingredients and does a wonderful job, my hair is waist length, and wavy so this helps keep it under control.  I go between this one and the LOVE one. been using it for years and I still like Davine&#x27;s brand the best!</li>
            <li> It really helps you with the hair loss (I don&#x27;t know other product like this one);  but if you use it on a daily basis your hair becomes greasy, too heavy and tough. My stylist recommended me to wash my hair with clothes detergent (YES, that white powder for clothes) to remove all the product that has been concentrated in my hair for several weeks and after doing I couldn&#x27;t believe how many times I had to rinse my hair to remove all the product. I&#x27;m trying to use it once very week (or if possibles less) to avoid the greasiness.</li>
            <li> My wife had a hard time finding this stuff so when we found it on Amazon she bought it right away. She LOVES this product and has been using it for years. WORKS wonders for her hair.</li>
            <li> Being paranoid, I was careful to use only this shampoo the entire time, so that I can tell if it works.  After 4 months of use, I can say that this reduces the amount of hair I see in my shower drain.  And with the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo I had to wash my hair every day, with this shampoo I now shower only once every two days.  Also I like the way my hair feels.  I&#x27;m willing to spend more for this kind of quality.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. The smell is fabulous. It lathers really nicely. And i have seen new hair growth.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the regrowth of hair would recommend to clients because i do hair and recommend to all my clients;-)</li>
            <li> Love it! It is excellent, and I recommend it to others. It leaves my hair clean and shiny without stripping the color or moisture. It &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34; and smells very pleasant. I really like it and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> no additional comments</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, and the slight tingle I feel when I use it. After about 6 weeks of nearly daily use (sometimes I skip a day) I notice my hair is fuller. I have gene-related hair loss, so I&#x27;m very happy to find such a lovely product that gives me hope. Though it is a little expensive, it is not nearly as much as the french product (Rene Furterer) I was researching that is also for hair loss. I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the packaging is awesome!</li>
            <li> Incredible product! it works really well and has done wonders for my hair!! a person in the beauty salon recomended it after i had my baby and started experiencing hairloss.. i also use the hair lotion that works in combination with the shampoo to prevent hair loss and thinning!!!! i wish the made the conditioner too, but other than that its wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over 3 months now and I absolutely love it! This is my first review of a product so that should say something there. I&#x27;ve read other reviews of people complaining of the medicinal smell of the shampoo and I at first thought that as well, but after using it the smell reminded me of a spa that my wife and I visited frequently in Santa Cruz. My scalp just feels better after I use the shampoo and I like the slight tingle that I get when I use it. I&#x27;ll be trying one of the other shampoos next time I need one because I didn&#x27;t realize this was for thinning hair. I just hope that I get the same experience from the next purchase.</li>
            <li> Was not thrilled with this product. The smell was nit delicious and it did nothing special to my hair.</li>
            <li> No SLS to make scalp itchy. Too soon to tell if it keeps hair from falling, seems to be less in the drain so far but the scent of it is somewhat medicinal. Smells like coal tar!</li>
            <li> Great theraputic shampoo for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is constantly falling out. I told a hair stylist friend of mine here in NYC and she told me to try this product. When I used it EVERY DAY after awhile I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out anymore. When I used it more lazily (every 3 days) I didn&#x27;t see results at all. Also, you MUST leave in hair for several minutes...don&#x27;t rinse out immediately.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, makes your hair to look healthier, beautiful and shinny. The price is awesone in the regular market is twice, delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It feels a little tingly and my hair/scalp seem to get gently cleaned. However, I used it as directed for over a month and really haven&#x27;t noticed too much hair growth. I have a lot of fine, baby-thin strands growing. I found out from my Davines stylist that the ingredients in this product really only grow the fine, baby-thin hair. If you are expecting more thicker growth, you may be disappointed. I probably won&#x27;t buy the Energizing line again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shampoo at my hairdresser&#x27;s and loved it. I ordered a bottle immediately, but am somewhat disappointed with it because I cannot use it on a daily basis. The first day there are no problems, but by the 2nd or 3rd day in a row (I wash my hair every day) there was a lot of build-up and my hair had a greasy appearance. I was using their conditioner and their all in one milk as well, but through the process of elimination, to my surprise, it was the shampoo that was the problem. I now use it once or twice a week in between a daily shampoo and it works nicely, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it had I known that I couldn&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit stronger than the ones in the old Davines bottle. I&#x27;ve bought this all the time and was surprised by the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells very nice. So far my hair is enjoying it. And it&#x27;s color safe.</li>
            <li> Added luster without weight, and bounce without extra product being used; nice subtle fragrance is pleasant but does not compete with other scents.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky and looking healthy. Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it makes my hair feel soft and healthy.  I&#x27;ve even noticed that the color has become more rich and also, thicker, which is the result I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, gives the correct tingle!  Wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, but once a week is great.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have thinning hair and this shampoo has solved my problem. I haven&#x27;t grown any hair but my shedding has really slowed down. You should try this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Davines shampoo and this one is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, smells great, comparable price to others. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Research suggests its a good product and that caffeine is a valuable aid to counter hair thinning but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it so it will take a while to genuinely know whether it is effective or not.</li>
            <li> nice shampoo. very useful.</li>
            <li> Excellent formula for thinning hair!</li>
