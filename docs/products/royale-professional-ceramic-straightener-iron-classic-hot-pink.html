            <li>Gotta love amazon.</li>
            <li>She used it several times and said it is the best straightener she has ever used.</li>
            <li>love it better than  a GHD</li>
            <li>I love this flatiron</li>
            <li>, I decided to Google it .. found it here on Amazon for $39 :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and cheap stuff..!!!</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons I ever purchased.</li>
            <li>these flat irons and the price was so cheap!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron ever!!</li>
            <li>Great product over all, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works great on natural hair and weaves!!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, great quality, but works better with natural hair</li>
            <li>Still a great product by far!</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>My stylist loved it so much she bought them for her shop of 10 stylists.</li>
            <li>When I got home, I loved it so much I wished I had bought another</li>
            <li>The color is perfect I love pink!!!</li>
            <li>The royal pro straightener is sleek and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They break easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality seems decent; packaging is good.  </li>
            <li>But it straightens pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
            <li>so fast love it!</li>
            <li>let see if i am getting free return label or not............</li>
            <li>Really like that I could also do nice bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Not as fabulous as it claims!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and died within a month.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality and electrical problems.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased this product at the Mall Kiosk and accidently dropped it on the bathroom floor and it broke.</li>
            <li>Does not heat like my original</li>
            <li>The workers were more interested in hanging out with friends, talking in the phone, and kept leaving the kiosk.</li>
            <li>but when it pulls it in the process... how much hair are you going to be able to straighten when its all pulled out?</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>The curls were awesome and with his skilled hand it took only a few minutes to curl her hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair stayed straight and frizz free for over two weeks.</li>
            <li>The last Royale I bought from the Royale stand was amazing.  </li>
            <li>it get my hair real straight</li>
            <li>Glad I found it at a much more reasonable price than what I was pitched at my local mall.</li>
            <li>Well, the first price was full list price, which caused me about to fall out of my shoes.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair flat iron product and recommend to any woman who wants to keep their hair healthy.</li>
            <li>She has naturally curly hair and this flat iron seems to work really great for her.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say i am not happy how, i was promised a good straightener just as good as the demo, and i received something of a lot less quality..</li>
            <li>Love these flat irons, I have been using them for a few months now and they have been great.</li>
            <li>Works well on dry hair but is also an amazing straighter on damp hair also without burning or frying hair.</li>
            <li>Gets hot very fast do not have to wait for it to heat up.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves these but they usually don&#x27;t last more than a year.</li>
            <li>I first bought it for 90 bucks at a mall</li>
            <li>however mine looked used and now just after a year it stopped getting hot</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying it at the mall!</li>
            <li>My wife and I first saw this in the mall with the \\&quot;snake</li>
            <li>I was nervous to order it at first because I had bought my first Royale Straightener at a kiosk at the mall for about $120.  </li>
            <li>and I should have ordered 2 from Amazon in the first place.  </li>
            <li>However, I would have paid this for a used product in good condition, and this item is still working well after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Not easy, but with practice and time you can get really good results.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product and it came super fast!!!</li>
            <li>More than 2 weeks of calling and No refund yet Product defective, flat iron (Tourmaline Pro-Deep Purple T003)</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and I love how i can curl and straighten my hair at the same time!</li>
            <li>how easy it was, and how the one i got was of the exact same.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend says that this is not the real one, but I wouldn&#x27;t know much about flat irons because I am a guy. :)</li>
            <li>Good long term investment for only $150.00 at the time!</li>
            <li>It works great and is the exact same as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Had to have another one and found this one online for much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The heating element works very well and is at 450 degrees with in 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>My hair looks like I&#x27;be come straight out of the hair salon.</li>
            <li>oil\\&quot; salesman using it on our daughters hair - much to her chagrin.  </li>
            <li>but how much?  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves is</li>
            <li>really locks.in the moisture in my hair</li>
            <li>and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>so fast .</li>
            <li>so much I traded them out.  </li>
            <li>Friends and family keep asking how I got my hair so straight.</li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be a real Royale.  </li>
            <li>Love the savings through Amazon and as far as I can see, it&#x27;s the real thing, with the same effect as in the mall.  </li>
            <li>I am such a loyal Amazon customer, I regret not checking here in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I love the Royale Flat iron it makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use hair spray or gel with it, and the style holds up better than with any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Performs like a cheap beauty supply flat iron.</li>
            <li>I took it back to the kiosk in the mall where I bought it from, and wanted to exchange it for new one due to the warranty saying it&#x27;s good for 5 years from date of purchase, and I had my receipt.</li>
            <li>I have a very expensive brand that I was impressed with but after reading reviews on this one I bought it to keep in our camper when we travel.  </li>
            <li>My hair is about a half inch long, so it was mostly my daughters that got to enjoy this, but the results staid well in their locks</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and only have to go over the hair once or twice to straighten.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>So glad I saw it here for so much less!</li>
            <li>another cheap copy that slate other companies to try and sell products.</li>
            <li>Someone also posted that the iron doesn&#x27;t work like it did when new</li>
            <li>They told me it would be $10 cheaper to mail it to company for but longer wait(was told 2-3 weeks) to receive a new one.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, but again, I am skeptical that mine was new, and I would prefer the seller be honest.</li>
            <li>Went to the mall found out that they are selling the exact same one for over $100.00!</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise to find the EXACT same product here for 10 percent of the price.  </li>
            <li>Well, the one I got seemed to be the exact same one I got from the mall.  </li>
            <li>purchase the first one back in 2011</li>
            <li>The cord swivels which makes the iron much easier to handle especially when using to curl hair.</li>
            <li>and I dropped it today and it completely fell apart DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>I got home an hour later, the curl was straight and the straight bits were wavy, yet the part I did with my GHD&#x27;s hours earlier still looked the same!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays straight the entire day.</li>
            <li>; I nearly bought one.  </li>
            <li>So much healthier to use solid ceramic for your hair.  </li>
            <li>It came in all the same packaging as my original one, but carefully inspected it and it is definitely a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Usually when straightening it becomes frizzy and puffy very quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is ridiculous but better than the store so.....</li>
            <li>I tried it out with high hopes, despite the fact the one i received was significantly smaller then the one the lady used on my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased my Royale Flat Iron (not this exact model but similar) from a mall kiosk over 7 years ago!</li>
            <li>and it still works the same as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>I bought one and had it for a year, still looks brand new, only used it 5 times, so one day I picked it up from the box it came in, where I stored it in, a piece of the ceramic fell off.</li>
            <li>So that same day I put for a new order and it was in my door step</li>
            <li>After saying, thanks, no, the price dropped to half that before becoming less than 100 with the second one for 20.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same serum as the royale line, but the old name, and way cheaper than the mall prices.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as if it gets hot as my previous royale</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron over any other straightening iron.</li>

            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> My stylist loved it so much she bought them for her shop of 10 stylists.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I loved it so much I wished I had bought another</li>
            <li> The color is perfect I love pink!!!</li>
            <li> The royal pro straightener is sleek and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They break easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality seems decent; packaging is good.  </li>
            <li> But it straightens pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
            <li> so fast love it!</li>
            <li> let see if i am getting free return label or not............</li>
            <li> Really like that I could also do nice bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Not as fabulous as it claims!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and died within a month.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality and electrical problems.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product at the Mall Kiosk and accidently dropped it on the bathroom floor and it broke.</li>
            <li> Does not heat like my original</li>
            <li> The workers were more interested in hanging out with friends, talking in the phone, and kept leaving the kiosk.</li>
            <li> but when it pulls it in the process... how much hair are you going to be able to straighten when its all pulled out?</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> The curls were awesome and with his skilled hand it took only a few minutes to curl her hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair stayed straight and frizz free for over two weeks.</li>
            <li> The last Royale I bought from the Royale stand was amazing.  </li>
            <li> it get my hair real straight</li>
            <li> Glad I found it at a much more reasonable price than what I was pitched at my local mall.</li>
            <li> Well, the first price was full list price, which caused me about to fall out of my shoes.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair flat iron product and recommend to any woman who wants to keep their hair healthy.</li>
            <li> She has naturally curly hair and this flat iron seems to work really great for her.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say i am not happy how, i was promised a good straightener just as good as the demo, and i received something of a lot less quality..</li>
            <li> Love these flat irons, I have been using them for a few months now and they have been great.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry hair but is also an amazing straighter on damp hair also without burning or frying hair.</li>
            <li> Gets hot very fast do not have to wait for it to heat up.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these but they usually don&#x27;t last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I first bought it for 90 bucks at a mall</li>
            <li> however mine looked used and now just after a year it stopped getting hot</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying it at the mall!</li>
            <li> My wife and I first saw this in the mall with the \\&quot;snake</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order it at first because I had bought my first Royale Straightener at a kiosk at the mall for about $120.  </li>
            <li> and I should have ordered 2 from Amazon in the first place.  </li>
            <li> However, I would have paid this for a used product in good condition, and this item is still working well after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not easy, but with practice and time you can get really good results.  </li>
            <li> This is the same product and it came super fast!!!</li>
            <li> More than 2 weeks of calling and No refund yet Product defective, flat iron (Tourmaline Pro-Deep Purple T003)</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and I love how i can curl and straighten my hair at the same time!</li>
            <li> how easy it was, and how the one i got was of the exact same.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says that this is not the real one, but I wouldn&#x27;t know much about flat irons because I am a guy. :)</li>
            <li> Good long term investment for only $150.00 at the time!</li>
            <li> It works great and is the exact same as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Had to have another one and found this one online for much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The heating element works very well and is at 450 degrees with in 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like I&#x27;be come straight out of the hair salon.</li>
            <li> oil\\&quot; salesman using it on our daughters hair - much to her chagrin.  </li>
            <li> but how much?  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves is</li>
            <li> really locks.in the moisture in my hair</li>
            <li> and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> so fast .</li>
            <li> so much I traded them out.  </li>
            <li> Friends and family keep asking how I got my hair so straight.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be a real Royale.  </li>
            <li> Love the savings through Amazon and as far as I can see, it&#x27;s the real thing, with the same effect as in the mall.  </li>
            <li> I am such a loyal Amazon customer, I regret not checking here in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I love the Royale Flat iron it makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use hair spray or gel with it, and the style holds up better than with any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Performs like a cheap beauty supply flat iron.</li>
            <li> I took it back to the kiosk in the mall where I bought it from, and wanted to exchange it for new one due to the warranty saying it&#x27;s good for 5 years from date of purchase, and I had my receipt.</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive brand that I was impressed with but after reading reviews on this one I bought it to keep in our camper when we travel.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about a half inch long, so it was mostly my daughters that got to enjoy this, but the results staid well in their locks</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and only have to go over the hair once or twice to straighten.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> So glad I saw it here for so much less!</li>
            <li> another cheap copy that slate other companies to try and sell products.</li>
            <li> Someone also posted that the iron doesn&#x27;t work like it did when new</li>
            <li> They told me it would be $10 cheaper to mail it to company for but longer wait(was told 2-3 weeks) to receive a new one.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, but again, I am skeptical that mine was new, and I would prefer the seller be honest.</li>
            <li> Went to the mall found out that they are selling the exact same one for over $100.00!</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise to find the EXACT same product here for 10 percent of the price.  </li>
            <li> Well, the one I got seemed to be the exact same one I got from the mall.  </li>
            <li> purchase the first one back in 2011</li>
            <li> The cord swivels which makes the iron much easier to handle especially when using to curl hair.</li>
            <li> and I dropped it today and it completely fell apart DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I got home an hour later, the curl was straight and the straight bits were wavy, yet the part I did with my GHD&#x27;s hours earlier still looked the same!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays straight the entire day.</li>
            <li> ; I nearly bought one.  </li>
            <li> So much healthier to use solid ceramic for your hair.  </li>
            <li> It came in all the same packaging as my original one, but carefully inspected it and it is definitely a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Usually when straightening it becomes frizzy and puffy very quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous but better than the store so.....</li>
            <li> I tried it out with high hopes, despite the fact the one i received was significantly smaller then the one the lady used on my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Royale Flat Iron (not this exact model but similar) from a mall kiosk over 7 years ago!</li>
            <li> and it still works the same as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> I bought one and had it for a year, still looks brand new, only used it 5 times, so one day I picked it up from the box it came in, where I stored it in, a piece of the ceramic fell off.</li>
            <li> So that same day I put for a new order and it was in my door step</li>
            <li> After saying, thanks, no, the price dropped to half that before becoming less than 100 with the second one for 20.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same serum as the royale line, but the old name, and way cheaper than the mall prices.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as if it gets hot as my previous royale</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron over any other straightening iron.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky, and now I that I have learned the technique for making waves and spiral curls with a straightener, I don&#x27;t need any other products.</li>
            <li> This is the same flat iron they sell at the mall for $100.</li>
            <li> Such a let down and waste of money and because I rarely put heat on my hair by the time I used it I could no longer return it.</li>
            <li> Straighten in small sections and use a heat protectant spray in hair as with any and all straight irons.</li>
            <li> The Royale Flat iron also curls and straightens your hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron for my mother-in-law for christmas.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say anything negative about this product at this time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any shedding from long term use the one thing I don&#x27;t like is</li>
            <li> All because when I went to get my hair trimmed with wash and dry</li>
            <li> I let it dry naturaly and then straighten.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my hair when I do.</li>
            <li> When I saw the box not only did the box look a little banged up but the sticker on it (to keep the box closed) looked like it was removed and placed back on.</li>
            <li> When I washed, dried, and flat ironed with royale flat irons</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a royale straightener from this same vender but it fell and broke...</li>
            <li> Having naturally straightish hair it doesn&#x27;t take much to straighten but a friend who has crazy curly hair (no straighteners ever seem to work)</li>
            <li> Does not straight my hair as well as a CHI straightener...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend doing it on wet hair even though the manufacturer says  you can.  </li>
            <li> I forewarn any military graduated recruits or any military forces to buy from there as well!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I spent .it</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> I have indian and malaysian hair and it usually frizzes up within a day of washing when I wash and dry and use CHI flat irons.</li>
            <li> Also, no burning smell and fried hair like with other straighteners.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth it nor are there any guarantees that the ceramic won&#x27;t fall off again</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, coarse, and a bit thick hair.</li>
            <li> She did one curl in my hair and straightened half my head.</li>
            <li> like 3 days later seriously I couldn&#x27;t have been happier the shipping was</li>
            <li> This is the most terrible flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This item was rated to be just like the flat irons that were sold in the malls, for me this product was a major disappointment and nothing like the ones sold in the malls.</li>
            <li> Not smooth..</li>
            <li> Mall man wouldn&#x27;t come closer and told me I had wasted his time.  </li>
            <li> BELIEVE I WASTED MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> Royale customer Service giving me the runaround the past two weeks and no refund yet.</li>
            <li> So i went online to do my research turns out not only did i get the WRONG straightener.</li>
            <li> No more packing blow dryer, straightener, and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> it bit the dust after a hard fall.</li>
            <li> after I it fell hard on my bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some negative reviews with people complaining that the iron pulls at the hair and causes breakage.</li>
            <li> It has a larger base from the ceramic plates to prevent burns to the scalp and face in like some other ceramic straightening irons.</li>
            <li> I mean yes it straightens your hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously a miracle.</li>
            <li> They were trying to sell it for something ridiculous like $300.</li>
            <li> not working properly :((</li>
            <li> You can usually count on mall Kiosks to be the worst place to buy a product and in the case of this Royale product that was definitely the case.  </li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t buy them for the crazy price at the Mall Kiosks.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I will never buy anything else from them again.</li>
            <li> It had a tough time straightening out my wavy hair, In fact i never did straighten it because i got to frustrated with it.</li>
            <li> Product is dangerously defective.</li>
            <li> this was disappointing.</li>
            <li> :/ very disappointed</li>
            <li> I too bought the very expensive straightener at the mall kiosk for almost $200!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the ones in the mall. Borderline sticky? Not smooth..</li>
            <li> Not the greatest curling iron.  Burned pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> it is a great straightener.. but it pulls your hair and it hurts! I mean yes it straightens your hair. but when it pulls it in the process... how much hair are you going to be able to straighten when its all pulled out?</li>
            <li> I bought one 5 years ago at a mall kiosk and now after going through hell(literally I&#x27;ve dragged this thing through the ringer) it bit the dust after a hard fall. Will be buying this one and I am very excited! Having naturally straightish hair it doesn&#x27;t take much to straighten but a friend who has crazy curly hair (no straighteners ever seem to work) the royale straightened her hair perfectly and it actually stayed!&lt;br /&gt;10/10.</li>
            <li> I love how straight this makes my hair, it is great quality as well. Heats up quickly and only have to go over the hair once or twice to straighten.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product at the Mall Kiosk and accidently dropped it on the bathroom floor and it broke. Had to have another one and found this one online for much cheaper through Amazon. It came in all the same packaging as my original one, but carefully inspected it and it is definitely a knock off of the real thing. Does not heat like my original and I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got this straightener for myself at the mall and I love it. So I decided to get one for my best friends birthday. I didn&#x27;t have time to go to the mall so decided to look online. Since it was a lot cheaper then what I paid for mine I made sure it was not a used product. When I saw the box not only did the box look a little banged up but the sticker on it (to keep the box closed) looked like it was removed and placed back on. So I opened the box &amp; you can tell this was a used product.  I would not use a used hair product myself nor would I buy one for someone else.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Royale Flat Iron (not this exact model but similar) from a mall kiosk over 7 years ago! I still have it and it still works wonders! Good long term investment for only $150.00 at the time!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these for my twin granddaughters.  They love them.  I also purchased one for myself.  It does a nice job.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The royal pro straightener is sleek and easy to use. The cord swivels which makes the iron much easier to handle especially when using to curl hair. The heating element works very well and is at 450 degrees with in 3 minutes. Works well on dry hair but is also an amazing straighter on damp hair also without burning or frying hair. It has a larger base from the ceramic plates to prevent burns to the scalp and face in like some other ceramic straightening irons. I&#x27;ve seen some negative reviews with people complaining that the iron pulls at the hair and causes breakage. This is untrue if used correctly. Straighten in small sections and use a heat protectant spray in hair as with any and all straight irons. Someone also posted that the iron doesn&#x27;t work like it did when new: I&#x27;ve had my iron for 8 weeks and it still works the same as when it was new.  I have owned it for 8 weeks and I use my iron every day. I also bought the protector carrying case for it the cleaning cloth and the DVD instructional video also. I highly recommend this iron over any other straightening iron. My stylist loved it so much she bought them for her shop of 10 stylists. All because when I went to get my hair trimmed with wash and dry I took my straightening iron with me for her to use on my hair. I love it and now that&#x27;s all I will ever use</li>
            <li> Keeps my grand babies hair manageable.  Doesn&#x27;t damage the hair</li>
            <li> I saw at the Mall and my hair stylist used in my hair and I love it. I decided buy one and I found at a great price in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product causing me to lose hair. More than 2 weeks of calling and No refund yet Product defective, flat iron (Tourmaline Pro-Deep Purple T003) it has NO heat adjustment burn my hair. Paid US $220.43  . Product caused me to lose hair repeatdly. Royale customer Service giving me the runaround the past two weeks and no refund yet. repeated promises to call back and none calling. Product is dangerously defective.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these but they usually don&#x27;t last more than a year. At least I didn&#x27;t buy them for the crazy price at the Mall Kiosks.</li>
            <li> I love the Royale Flat iron it makes my hair feel silky and soft. My hair looks like I&#x27;be come straight out of the hair salon. The Royale Flat iron also curls and straightens your hair. I love this hair flat iron product and recommend to any woman who wants to keep their hair healthy.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons I ever purchased. Went to the mall found out that they are selling the exact same one for over $100.00! It works great on natural hair and weaves!!</li>
            <li> Duplicate brand... not works good at all!!!! it is not work good at all!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just trying to return!!! let see if i am getting free return label or not............</li>
            <li> I bought one of these forever ago at opry mills mall. The straightener itself is awesome, but when I went back to purchase one for my mom the service at both kiosks turned me away. The workers were more interested in hanging out with friends, talking in the phone, and kept leaving the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I really liked this straightener at the kiosk. It worked amazing curled and straightened my hair at ease. So i thought it was a fair price of 50$ lady informed me of all the awesome stuff i could do with the demo straightener how easy it was, and how the one i got was of the exact same. When i got home it was anything from the same straightener. I tried it out with high hopes, despite the fact the one i received was significantly smaller then the one the lady used on my hair. It had a tough time straightening out my wavy hair, In fact i never did straighten it because i got to frustrated with it. Then i attempted to curl my hair, just as the lady showed me... That didn&#x27;t work either. I can honestly say i am not happy how, i was promised a good straightener just as good as the demo, and i received something of a lot less quality.. So i went online to do my research turns out not only did i get the WRONG straightener. But the one i received should have only costed 30$...when i paid 50$. So im returning it and possibly raising hell.</li>
            <li> It does what its suppose to do but not like the 1 I purchased at the mall kiosk.  The one at the mall I need to only pass it once....this one I have to do it 2-4 times.  I don&#x27;t recommend. would rather pay the the extra money at the mall.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, appears used in good condition. Box and warranty card are faded and item just looks used - also manufacturer website states they will not honor warranty for items purchased from unauthorized sites. Was billed as \\&quot;New\\&quot;. However, I would have paid this for a used product in good condition, and this item is still working well after a few weeks. My step-daughter came home from the mall with one she paid $200 for. I choked at the price but LOVED the straightener when I borrowed it. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that and found this identical item here for $39. I have thick, coarse, curly hair. This straightener is like a miracle. It leaves my hair soft and silky, and now I that I have learned the technique for making waves and spiral curls with a straightener, I don&#x27;t need any other products.I let it dry naturaly and then straighten. No more packing blow dryer, straightener, and curling iron.  I don&#x27;t use hair spray or gel with it, and the style holds up better than with any other product I&#x27;ve used. Well worth the price, but again, I am skeptical that mine was new, and I would prefer the seller be honest. One last point, the ability to set the temperature up to over 400 F is probably the biggest difference between this and the Chi I have. My Chi does not have a temperature control and cannot compare to this product despite it&#x27;s $150 price tag.</li>
            <li> This item was rated to be just like the flat irons that were sold in the malls, for me this product was a major disappointment and nothing like the ones sold in the malls.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  I first bought it for 90 bucks at a mall and it broke  after I it fell hard on my bathroom floor.  Then I found it here for 60 bucks cheaper, I just had to order it.  It heats up fast and I love how i can curl and straighten my hair at the same time! Great product over all, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price! Works great! Happy happy!</li>
            <li> Perfect exactly as shown!</li>
            <li> This is the best..easy to use especially with one hand..heats quickly.would buy again. Cant say enough about this product.A plus</li>
            <li> Love it and very great film for the misshap being fixed</li>
            <li> It work wonders in my hair. Really like that I could also do nice bouncy curls. Great product so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this cuz my sister had one and i tried it and i loved it however mine looked used and now just after a year it stopped getting hot :/ very disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this thing wouldn&#x27;t buy another straightener for awhile!!! Anddddd I got it for an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Real authentic product, very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I paid over $100 for the same straightener in a mall in Texas! This is the same product and it came super fast!!! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift ~ she was thrilled!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. Glad I found it at a much more reasonable price than what I was pitched at my local mall.</li>
            <li> not working properly :((</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the damn thing for a year yet and I dropped it today and it completely fell apart DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, great quality, but works better with natural hair</li>
            <li> Last night out shopping in Florida a kiosk pulled me over to try these, I have GHD&#x27;s and would never even contemplate using anything different. She did one curl in my hair and straightened half my head. Assured me it would stay for days. I got home an hour later, the curl was straight and the straight bits were wavy, yet the part I did with my GHD&#x27;s hours earlier still looked the same!&lt;br /&gt;She tried telling me this product she claimed cost $300 and was livid when I said I only had $40 and refused to hand over a card..&lt;br /&gt;Just another cheap copy that slate other companies to try and sell products.</li>
            <li> Amazing! The same as the $300 one I saw at the mall. It works great and is the exact same as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron for my mother-in-law for christmas. She loves it! She has naturally curly hair and this flat iron seems to work really great for her. Gets hot very fast do not have to wait for it to heat up. Can&#x27;t really say anything negative about this product at this time.</li>
            <li> Love these flat irons, I have been using them for a few months now and they have been great. The color is perfect I love pink!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve seen this in the mall for $150 and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here, this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love it! So much cheaper than buying it at the mall!</li>
            <li> MY daughter says this is the BEST straightener she has ever had!  I think I am going to have to order another for myself!  Her hair looks great!!</li>
            <li> Great ceramics for the price. I don&#x27;t notice any shedding from long term use the one thing I don&#x27;t like is if you forget to leave them on there is no automatic shut off????? Still a great product by far!</li>
            <li> You can usually count on mall Kiosks to be the worst place to buy a product and in the case of this Royale product that was definitely the case.  My wife and I first saw this in the mall with the \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot; salesman using it on our daughters hair - much to her chagrin.  The curls were awesome and with his skilled hand it took only a few minutes to curl her hair.  Awesome... but how much?  Well, the first price was full list price, which caused me about to fall out of my shoes.  After saying, thanks, no, the price dropped to half that before becoming less than 100 with the second one for 20.  At that price, with my beautiful begging daughter I said I&#x27;m interested what does it come with.  Well, seeing the boxes I thought I&#x27;d try out Amazons shopping tool and just scan the bar-code.  Imagine my surprise to find the EXACT same product here for 10 percent of the price.  Mall man wouldn&#x27;t come closer and told me I had wasted his time.  In fairness, I did, but I still bought one all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now for the product itself.  Not bad.  Not easy, but with practice and time you can get really good results.  My hair is about a half inch long, so it was mostly my daughters that got to enjoy this, but the results staid well in their locks and they&#x27;re happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems decent; packaging is good.  I would buy another if I have to, but it would appear that this is going to last a while.  My recommendation to everyone, though, is watch the training video that comes with it.  Definitely worthwhile and a time saver.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order another one. Does not straight my hair as well as a CHI straightener...we&#x27;ll be going back to one of those. this was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I was nervous to order it at first because I had bought my first Royale Straightener at a kiosk at the mall for about $120.  When it broke I was devastated because I didn&#x27;t want to spend that money again.  So I went on line and hoped for the best.  Well, the one I got seemed to be the exact same one I got from the mall.  goes up to 400 degrees.  This straightener is amazing.  You run it through one time and it does the job.  ( I have kind of frizzy hair after I blow it dry, and this straightens it perfectly)  I don&#x27;t recommend doing it on wet hair even though the manufacturer says  you can.  It seems to dry out my hair when I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter. She absolutely loves is and so do I. I&#x27;m actually going to buy another one for myself.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says that this is not the real one, but I wouldn&#x27;t know much about flat irons because I am a guy. :)</li>
            <li> I bought one and had it for a year, still looks brand new, only used it 5 times, so one day I picked it up from the box it came in, where I stored it in, a piece of the ceramic fell off. I took it back to the kiosk in the mall where I bought it from, and wanted to exchange it for new one due to the warranty saying it&#x27;s good for 5 years from date of purchase, and I had my receipt. But, they told me it would cost me $30 bucks and I paid $80 for it already why should I pay another $30 sheesh. So needless to say I will never buy anything else from them again. They do not honor their warranty.They told me it would be $10 cheaper to mail it to company for but longer wait(was told 2-3 weeks) to receive a new one. so nahhhh either way I have to pay for money and it&#x27;s not worth it nor are there any guarantees that the ceramic won&#x27;t fall off again and I will have to pay more money again.  Not worth it. Not as fabulous as it claims!!&lt;br /&gt;****** I forewarn any military graduated recruits or any military forces to buy from there as well!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get suckered in to buying anything from there....like I did &#x3D;o(  Lesson Learned</li>
            <li> This is the same flat iron they sell at the mall for $100. What a deal!</li>
            <li> I saw it at the mall for 130 dollars and I almost bought it . then I bought this one and it it thw best 31 dollars I spent .it really locks.in the moisture in my hair and it protects it from humid..&lt;br /&gt;the iron is amazing buy it and it shipped fast. so fast . you wont regret it.trust me .</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever!! I have indian and malaysian hair and it usually frizzes up within a day of washing when I wash and dry and use CHI flat irons. When I washed, dried, and flat ironed with royale flat irons my hair stayed straight and frizz free for over two weeks. I will upload a video soon!! I &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 these flat irons and the price was so cheap!!!!!!!!! SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOUTUBE PAGE AT [...] INSTAGRAM: minahnaturalhair TUMBLR: minao18</li>
            <li> Works great, bought this after a trip to the mall and one of those guys stopped me to straighten my hair. Well that one costs $99 this one is not as good as I was told but its does work great. I wpuld purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive brand that I was impressed with but after reading reviews on this one I bought it to keep in our camper when we travel.  I like this one so much I traded them out.  Now the more expensive one is for occasional use when traveling.</li>
            <li> Great iron. Nicely packaged. The only reason this isn&#x27;t a five star is because I prefer titanium over ceramic. But it straightens pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, and I got one for $30 on here. Seriously a miracle. I have wavy, coarse, and a bit thick hair. Usually when straightening it becomes frizzy and puffy very quickly. Not with this straightener. It stays straight the entire day. Also, no burning smell and fried hair like with other straighteners. Like others, I was shown this product at the mall, and was fairly impressed. They were trying to sell it for something ridiculous like $300. Gotta love amazon. Friends and family keep asking how I got my hair so straight. I recommend picking up Herstyler Hair serum as well [[ASIN:B000TW2JQC Herstyler Hair Serum Vitamin E and Aloe Vera(2.0 oz 60ml)]] It&#x27;s the same serum as the royale line, but the old name, and way cheaper than the mall prices. It&#x27;s also the best serum I&#x27;ve used. So happy!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and excellent price. Girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> The straightener felt sticky when I got it. Cheaply made and died within a month.</li>
            <li> Item was purchased for my daughter.  She used it several times and said it is the best straightener she has ever used.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be a real Royale.  This is the most terrible flat iron I have ever used.  Performs like a cheap beauty supply flat iron. The last Royale I bought from the Royale stand was amazing.  Such a let down and waste of money and because I rarely put heat on my hair by the time I used it I could no longer return it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Cheap quality and electrical problems. Definitely not a Chi.</li>
            <li> Excellent does all it says</li>
            <li> Just like the one I bought at the mall for $200.00</li>
            <li> I too bought the very expensive straightener at the mall kiosk for almost $200!  I didn&#x27;t even thing about dickering with them and when they offered to sell me another for &amp;#34;only $99&amp;#34; I nearly bought one.  When I got home, I loved it so much I wished I had bought another but upon visiting Amazon, I realized my mistake and I should have ordered 2 from Amazon in the first place.  What was I thinking?  I am such a loyal Amazon customer, I regret not checking here in the first place.  I did order a second one for my daughter on this site.  Thank goodness!!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a royale straightener from this same vender but it fell and broke...bummer! So that same day I put for a new order and it was in my door step like 3 days later seriously I couldn&#x27;t have been happier the shipping was so fast love it! And of course my royale!!!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> love it better than  a GHD</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as if it gets hot as my previous royale but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this flatiron it get my hair real straight</li>
            <li> This is the SAME unit they try to sell you for $200-$250 in the shopping malls.&lt;br /&gt;When my daughter saw one in the mall and had to have it, I decided to Google it .. found it here on Amazon for $39 :)&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful unit (or so they say - I&#x27;ve personally got next to no hair.)&lt;br /&gt;Actually I just bought my second one as my wife is heading back to China and my daughter can&#x27;t be without her&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase the first one back in 2011 and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
            <li> This was very good.  They break easily so you have to be careful.  The price is ridiculous but better than the store so.....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and cheap stuff..!!!</li>
            <li> Saw this iron at my local mall for $150.  Love the savings through Amazon and as far as I can see, it&#x27;s the real thing, with the same effect as in the mall.  So much healthier to use solid ceramic for your hair.  Heats up in about a minute and does a great job on my hair.  So glad I saw it here for so much less!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A ROYALE STRAIGHTENER. I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I WASTED MY MONEY. IT&#x27;S PLASTIC AND I CAN&#x27;T USE IT BECAUSE IT RIPS MY HAIR OUT. THIS IS ALL A LIE... DON&#x27;T BUY IT. I WROTE THE SELLER AND OF COURSE I GOT NOTHING BACK.</li>
