            <li>It goes on easily over most any color and brings a beautiful shimmer to the under-color!  </li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>
            <li>However, I LOVE IBD gel polish colors!  </li>

            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>I have been painting my own nails with an LED lamp and gel polish for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li>The glitter flakes are very fine and they sparkle nicely.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color but wish it didn&#x27;t turn out so light.</li>
            <li>and it was really easy to use, too!</li>
            <li>used it once, pretty happy</li>
            <li>i love this champagne color.</li>
            <li>It looks more like just sparkles than a champage color.</li>
            <li>but the color looks more gold than champagne.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love all the gelish products...</li>
            <li>but I am very excited about be able to do my gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>Love it, and happy to have it in a .5cc bottle not the .25 which is all I can get at the store near my home.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>Although, it goes on completely sheer (unlike the picture), it really is beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty color on its own or over another.  </li>
            <li>Such a beautiful light gold color.</li>
            <li>This would be a great color to use over a flat color, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself.</li>
            <li>This color is amazing, the perfect casual yet fancy sparkle for any occasion.</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty!</li>
            <li>it makes your nails look super pretty.</li>
            <li>Gelish is by far the best gel nail polish, however this particular color I had expected more solid coverage, which didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I gave this polish a five star because it is just so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Best friend is getting married and her color scheme is champagne, black and pink.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this polish for your gel collection.  </li>
            <li>thought it would be a prettier champagne color but tis pretty yellow.</li>
            <li>I thought this glitter would be silver but was surprised to find it was gold</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful champagne silver glitter, in a clear base.  </li>
            <li>This product is a little thinner and does like to pool in the side wall, but nothing a little touching up cant fix.</li>
            <li>It is a clear, elegant and very small heavily packed sparkle coat.</li>

            <li> It is a clear, elegant and very small heavily packed sparkle coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle yet pretty</li>
            <li> It lookers like you have spent a million dollars on your nails.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in Silver Sands, because there was practically no glitter in it, but Champagne was exactly what I was looking for - very glittery and shimmery, with glitter that covers the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Such a subtle glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a random occurrence, but the bottle leaks all over, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the Gelish brand, just this particular color.</li>
            <li> Stays on way past 14 days.</li>
            <li> They preform just as well, if not better, than the Gelish polishes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not glaring glittery, but a subtle glitter.  </li>
            <li> Takes some practice always remember thin coats!</li>
            <li> I use it as an accent color to offset a plain base to add some sparkle.</li>
            <li> I use the Gelish base and topcoat (IBD is not as durable).  </li>

            <li> Great sparkle. Stays on way past 14 days. Gelish products are the best way to go.  Actually the only way to go!!!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful light gold color. Recommended! !!!!</li>
            <li> Takes six coats to be the color it says it is</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best gel on the market for us professionals. Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> I thought this glitter would be silver but was surprised to find it was gold/yellow when i opened it. The plus it that it goes over any color looking just sparkly which is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> i love this champagne color. it works good. i recommend this to buyers who want it. it makes your nails look super pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! Although, it goes on completely sheer (unlike the picture), it really is beautiful. It&#x27;s very subtle yet pretty and it was really easy to use, too!</li>
            <li> This gelish color was everything I was hoping for!  It goes on easily over most any color and brings a beautiful shimmer to the under-color!  Very highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> I really like this but the color looks more gold than champagne. I have yet to actually use this but I am very excited about be able to do my gel nails at home. Will save me time and money</li>
            <li> I gave this polish a five star because it is just so pretty.  Just enough sparkle.  You can wear this over another color or wear it alone.  Goes on very nicely.  I would highly recommend this polish for your gel collection.  A must have!!!!</li>
            <li> I love that Gelish is now making gel polish, the colors are awesome and compliment the colors of CND.  This color is great for layering.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish.  It lookers like you have spent a million dollars on your nails.  I always get a lot of comments when I wear any of the Gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li> Elegant and incredible!!! I use it as an accent color to offset a plain base to add some sparkle. It is a clear, elegant and very small heavily packed sparkle coat. Love it, and happy to have it in a .5cc bottle not the .25 which is all I can get at the store near my home.</li>
            <li> used it once, pretty happy</li>
            <li> I love all the gelish products...I have been getting gel manicures for a while and figured I might want to go ahead and take the plunge and buy some stuff to do it myself. Easy to use...Takes some practice always remember thin coats! This product is a little thinner and does like to pool in the side wall, but nothing a little touching up cant fix. If you are unsure about any of these gelish products, don&#x27;t be! A great way to save money! I got the USPICEY 36watt UV lamp works perfectly cured for 120 seconds for each coat and worked perfect!</li>
            <li> Gelish is by far the best gel nail polish, however this particular color I had expected more solid coverage, which didn&#x27;t happen. This would be a great color to use over a flat color, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself.</li>

            <li> I like the gelish polishes.  they work great</li>
            <li> I love this color!  In my opinion Gelish is the best brand out there and this color did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> probably wont be wearing this. thought it would be a prettier champagne color but tis pretty yellow. wouldnt buy.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing, the perfect casual yet fancy sparkle for any occasion. I don&#x27;t know if this is a random occurrence, but the bottle leaks all over, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the Gelish brand, just this particular color. Also, it looks really yellow in the bottle, don&#x27;t worry, it dries silver-white.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Best friend is getting married and her color scheme is champagne, black and pink. Color will go great with outfit</li>
            <li> Such a subtle glitter polish.  Absolutely beautiful.  I use it as an overcoat on a darker color.  It&#x27;s not glaring glittery, but a subtle glitter.  I adore this polish.</li>
            <li> Closer to silver glitter, beautiful color!</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
