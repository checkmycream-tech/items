            <li>The customer service  is probably the BEST  service  </li>

            <li>I feel like i look good in it</li>
            <li>As others have stated, there is a surprising amount of hair (fullness) on this wig.</li>
            <li>The wig arrived as estimated; it was good, high-quality construction.  </li>
            <li>I love this wig!</li>
            <li>I love this wig!</li>
            <li>I put it on and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>My cosplay will be top notch with this!</li>
            <li>This wig is not at all what the pictures look like, the packaging is great however the wig tangles easily</li>
            <li>Came out of the bag looking great, not frizzy, just nice smooth curls.  </li>
            <li>I was provided a sample product for my unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and it arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, it got knoted up very easily.</li>
            <li>ok This wig is amazing .</li>
            <li>Just in time for Con :)</li>
            <li>Much  better quality than wigs at chain costume stores</li>
            <li>Wish me luck :-)</li>
            <li>Overall, awesome, and</li>
            <li>Better quality than most at this price-point.</li>
            <li>However if you plan on going to Cosplay weekly you should probably spend more for better quality.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>It looked very nice, and she was able to wear it comfortably on her six year old head.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easy, and while its nice, and I really like it...</li>
            <li>Photo is an accurate representation.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>The wig that I received was true to color, and fit me well.</li>
            <li>A word to the wise, though: This may just be my wig, but the waves on the wig aren&#x27;t the same as what are pictured.</li>
            <li>But overall it did good.</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t ask for more at this price point.</li>
            <li>It also frizzes up easily, but it was pretty.</li>
            <li>but it all fit pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a cute wig!</li>
            <li>The weight of this wig is light, which is certainly a bonus considering the length.</li>
            <li>I like this wig because it&#x27;s not shiny and a good deal, however the fibers feel very dry and the ends were frayed when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>Fun wig for the price.</li>
            <li>It is not super full, but it is beautiful, great waves, long bangs and a size adjuster on the back</li>
            <li>Over all, this is a very nice wig for the price, just be prepared to give it a little TLC if you find it needs it.</li>
            <li>super long and thick and easy to style (also the perfect shade of light blonde i was looking for!)</li>
            <li>I also found the color and waves to be rather pretty.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the rest of the hair was a bit thicker, although the wig is pretty full.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(For costumers - in order to keep the wig on the actress&#x27;s head, I pinned the first cap onto the shoulder of her dress.)</li>
            <li>Not completely fake looking .</li>
            <li>it was so pretty until I touched it.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this wig, but after a few &amp;#34;brushings&amp;#34;, it turned into a rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>cosplaying events, this wig is absolutely perfect for characters with long blonde hair, such as Elsa.</li>
            <li>Its pretty much just like its shown in the picture here.</li>
            <li>But like most long wigs it tangles pretty quickly so be ready with a wig brush at all times.</li>
            <li>Not enough hair in this wig and the bangs fall out of place easily to reveal the cap underneath.</li>
            <li>I have yet to style it (my wig brush hasn&#x27;t arrived yet), but just running my fingers through it gently has pulled out some hairs.</li>
            <li>The wefts are also very visible on the bangs for me, but I&#x27;m adding wefts from another wig to it so that problem should resolve itself.</li>
            <li>They go outta their way to make sure your purchase  was expected.  </li>
            <li>wig looks very realistic and is high quality for considering the price range it is in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle that much when handled with care.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and resembles real hair.</li>
            <li>If the wig had the long bangs as shown and had been more blonde than platinum, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>However, I can see how this product might prove useful for someone with a smaller head than mine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price but thought that it would be at least good enough for a Halloween costume.  </li>
            <li>Soooo long I love it fast shipping pretty thick</li>
            <li>im light skinned black.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the quality--it far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than the last wig we bought at a Halloween store and at half the price.  </li>
            <li>I give it the four stars because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me as far as wigs are concerned.</li>
            <li>It is completely as presented in pictures.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very adjustable, I tried it on different head sizes</li>
            <li>Super Long , curls hold for a life time and the color is really blonde.</li>
            <li>I really like the wig except that the color is platinum (nearly white)--not a yellow blonde as pictured.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a little long, but it was easy to style.</li>
            <li>first time I put a comb thru it on the other hand</li>
            <li>Looks natural, especially if worn under a hat.</li>
            <li>I really like the back of this wig, its curly, and very long.</li>

            <li> I really like the back of this wig, its curly, and very long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to have fun at a few shows this will not let you down.</li>
            <li> It does seem a bit thin on the top of the wig, but the lace cap is (thankfully) nude, and it&#x27;s not super visible.</li>
            <li> I see that the bangs are not quite as thick as the blonde wig that I purchased from a different seller for a sleeping beauty cosplay last year, but I personally consider that a plus.</li>
            <li> This hair is thick enough that I could put ties along the length and keep the overall effect of very long hair.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;, and when loosely braided, the wig fell to the small of my back.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be with the elastic straps hooked, the wig was a bit too tight, but that could just be that I have a big head.  </li>
            <li> So I was not able to wear it because it kept popping off (even with several bobby pins securing it to my head).</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the thin side as far as the amount of hair goes, but I could tell that it would be from the photo, so that is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The bangs are much shorter and rather difficult to deal with.</li>
            <li> I do feel a bit concerned about what the wig will look like when I wear it, because I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig came in a small box.</li>
            <li> Ill write another review once i have some outside reaction to it.</li>
            <li> And was kinda small.</li>
            <li> instead it came out to be a very pale</li>
            <li> It really is a shame that it didn&#x27;t work it :(</li>
            <li> I cut all my hair off and was missing it terribly, but now I can do hair and I have tons of potential for costumes.</li>
            <li> The wig is too thin and the hair falls out.</li>
            <li> The reasons being, that the bangs are shorter than what I&#x27;m needing, as well as it being too thin, and shows the wig cap.</li>
            <li> So thin.</li>
            <li> Also very thin.</li>
            <li> The quality of the construction was very poor.</li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> Worst wig.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The wig is too thin and the hair falls out.</li>
            <li> This wig is not at all what the pictures look like, the packaging is great however the wig tangles easily I thought I purchased a sandy blonde wig instead it came out to be a very pale (almost white) blonde...</li>
            <li> Turned it into a Frozen Elsa braid for my niece&#x27;s Halloween costume. It looked very nice, and she was able to wear it comfortably on her six year old head.</li>
            <li> I really like the wig except that the color is platinum (nearly white)--not a yellow blonde as pictured. The bangs are not as shown. The bangs are much shorter and rather difficult to deal with. If the wig had the long bangs as shown and had been more blonde than platinum, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars. Comfortable to wear. Looks natural, especially if worn under a hat.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and it arrived fairly quickly. Just in time for Con :)</li>
            <li> This was my 1st and last time ordering a wig offline. The adjustable net cap was a joke imho - You can make it smaller, but not larger. So I was not able to wear it because it kept popping off (even with several bobby pins securing it to my head). Also, it got knoted up very easily. However, I can see how this product might prove useful for someone with a smaller head than mine. The weight of this wig is light, which is certainly a bonus considering the length. I also found the color and waves to be rather pretty. It really is a shame that it didn&#x27;t work it :(</li>
            <li> I bought the blonde wig for a Cinderella cosplay. The wig that I received was true to color, and fit me well. I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;, and when loosely braided, the wig fell to the small of my back. It does seem a bit thin on the top of the wig, but the lace cap is (thankfully) nude, and it&#x27;s not super visible. I do feel a bit concerned about what the wig will look like when I wear it, because I have dark brown hair. I wish that this would have come with a [nude] wig cap. I see that the bangs are not quite as thick as the blonde wig that I purchased from a different seller for a sleeping beauty cosplay last year, but I personally consider that a plus. I just wish that the rest of the hair was a bit thicker, although the wig is pretty full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig came in a small box. It came out of the package tangle-free, and looks beautiful. I have yet to style it (my wig brush hasn&#x27;t arrived yet), but just running my fingers through it gently has pulled out some hairs. A word to the wise, though: This may just be my wig, but the waves on the wig aren&#x27;t the same as what are pictured. This doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the waves on my wig are a bit larger than pictured, and the wig itself seems to taper to a point. So, all in all, good wig. I give it the four stars because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me as far as wigs are concerned.</li>
            <li> I really like the back of this wig, its curly, and very long. HOWEVER! It does tangle easy, and while its nice, and I really like it...I can&#x27;t use it for the cosplay I bought it for. The reasons being, that the bangs are shorter than what I&#x27;m needing, as well as it being too thin, and shows the wig cap.</li>
            <li> Its pretty much just like its shown in the picture here. But like most long wigs it tangles pretty quickly so be ready with a wig brush at all times.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for my niece. She wanted me to color it and made her a mermaid wig for cosplay. The color is absolutely amazing! And the wave pattern is on point. The downside to this wig it that it sheds ALOT! Even before I colored it using acrylic inks and isopropyl alcohol it shed everywhere. But overall it did good. And the mermaid wig turned out beautifully</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price. Much  better quality than wigs at chain costume stores</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price but thought that it would be at least good enough for a Halloween costume.  I was so surprised at the quality--it far exceeded my expectations!  It is so much better than the last wig we bought at a Halloween store and at half the price.  Photo is an accurate representation.  Came out of the bag looking great, not frizzy, just nice smooth curls.  It is a bit on the thin side as far as the amount of hair goes, but I could tell that it would be from the photo, so that is what I expected.  Really can&#x27;t ask for more at this price point.</li>
            <li> Worst wig. So thin. Sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this wig, but after a few &amp;#34;brushings&amp;#34;, it turned into a rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> I like this wig because it&#x27;s not shiny and a good deal, however the fibers feel very dry and the ends were frayed when I took it out of the box. I soaked it in a water and fabric softener solution for about 3-4 hours, which made detangling easier, though I still had to trim the edges a bit. The wefts are also very visible on the bangs for me, but I&#x27;m adding wefts from another wig to it so that problem should resolve itself. Over all, this is a very nice wig for the price, just be prepared to give it a little TLC if you find it needs it.</li>
            <li> excellent wig! super long and thick and easy to style (also the perfect shade of light blonde i was looking for!)</li>
            <li> This wig is great. It is completely as presented in pictures. The bangs are a little long, but it was easy to style. The hair is soft and resembles real hair. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Had ordered another wig for Halloween three weeks ago only to realize it takes 4 weeks to ship!?!?! Ordered this one so I would have it for my daughter&#x27;s Elsa costume. Came in on time. It is not super full, but it is beautiful, great waves, long bangs and a size adjuster on the back</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample product for my unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig looks very realistic and is high quality for considering the price range it is in.&lt;br /&gt;It is very adjustable, I tried it on different head sizes but it all fit pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cosplaying events, this wig is absolutely perfect for characters with long blonde hair, such as Elsa.</li>
            <li> Well. I guess this is the wig i orderd. I thought it would be darker. Im kinda back n forth on it. I feel like i look good in it but im nervous to wear it out n about. Ill write another review once i have some outside reaction to it. P.s im light skinned black. Wish me luck :-)</li>
            <li> UPDATE: ok This wig is amazing . Super Long , curls hold for a life time and the color is really blonde. The customer service  is probably the BEST  service  I&#x27;ve  EVER received.  They go outta their way to make sure your purchase  was expected.  I will be buying again .</li>
            <li> As others have stated, there is a surprising amount of hair (fullness) on this wig. I bought 2 of these to use in conjunction with another wig to make Rapunzel&#x27;s hair for a stage production of Into the Woods. I sewed pieces of netting to the cap of each wig, with Velcro on one so the hair could be separated as in the script. It worked well! This hair is thick enough that I could put ties along the length and keep the overall effect of very long hair. (For costumers - in order to keep the wig on the actress&#x27;s head, I pinned the first cap onto the shoulder of her dress.)</li>
            <li> I used this wig for my Luna Lovegood costume.  The wig arrived as estimated; it was good, high-quality construction.  My only complaint would be with the elastic straps hooked, the wig was a bit too tight, but that could just be that I have a big head.  Overall, awesome, and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Such a cute wig! Very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle that much when handled with care.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! I cut all my hair off and was missing it terribly, but now I can do hair and I have tons of potential for costumes.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing! As soon as I opened it I put it on and fell in love with it! My cosplay will be top notch with this!</li>
            <li> Fun wig for the price. Better quality than most at this price-point. If you&#x27;re looking to have fun at a few shows this will not let you down. However if you plan on going to Cosplay weekly you should probably spend more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Great color and feel. Not completely fake looking . Didn&#x27;t like how the tracks were on the wig and the placement.</li>
            <li> The wig was falling apart. And was kinda small. Also very thin. The quality of the construction was very poor.</li>
            <li> Soooo long I love it fast shipping pretty thick but so white compared to the picture but I love it</li>
            <li> Not enough hair in this wig and the bangs fall out of place easily to reveal the cap underneath. It also frizzes up easily, but it was pretty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to take care of a wig especially the wavy curled ones the get so knotted sp  first time I put a comb thru it on the other hand it was so pretty until I touched it. And wore it</li>
