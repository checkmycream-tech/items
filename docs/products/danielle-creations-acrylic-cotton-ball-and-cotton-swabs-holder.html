            <li>Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be a perfect gift</li>
            <li>Perfect for our guest bath as guests can see what is nside of it.</li>
            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it!!!</li>
            <li>and it otherwise would have been ideal.</li>
            <li>attractive item, fits in with any décor.  </li>
            <li>I added this to my make up acrylic dresser top set and its perfect size.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>It holds a good supply of cotton swabs and cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>Fits a good amount of cotton pads and qtips.</li>
            <li>My sister saw it and loved it</li>
            <li>Good organizational tool.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality, and they won&#x27;t even let me return it....</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and looks great.</li>
            <li>The acrylic composition is a nice touch, so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap and plasticy, and it&#x27;s not flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Looks lovely on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Very economically sized!</li>
            <li>The acrylic is much thicker than I thought, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much I had to find a make-up organizer to pair with it as I leave it out on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I put allot of thought and shopping on line for something that held both items - and - with a lid you could easily grab and lift.  </li>
            <li>Perfect little item.. not as sanitary as the dispenser.. but the combination of balls and sticks .. saves space and time</li>
            <li>Nothing cheap looking about this.  </li>
            <li>What really bothers me is that I would have liked to return it and have a replacement sent, but that wasn&#x27;t even offered as an option--only a refund.</li>
            <li>This one seem to fit our needs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to fit my cotton swabs and cotton balls, and I&#x27;m not afraid of it breaking in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>the clean look &amp;  clean lines</li>
            <li>Has a very clean and classic look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>She liked it for her dresser because it held just enough cotton balls and Q-tips for a time instead of the large store packaging.  </li>
            <li>Elegant, but simple.</li>
            <li>This comes exactly as it is advertised.</li>
            <li>but otherwise I enjoy the shape and clear material for bathroom organization.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>Not overly pretty, and does not take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>Instead of going into our cabinets and digging through the box or bag, we now have it accessible on our counter top in a neat little package.</li>
            <li>This is a very practical purchase.</li>
            <li>Very durable;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>The lid does not fit securely but it doe not need to be a fight to get to your products quickly.</li>
            <li>The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that I would have like to have had a container/containers that held more, but again we are space limited now and we have to conform...</li>
            <li>Have had it for almost a year and looks brand new.</li>
            <li>We live in a cottage size house with one bathroom...</li>
            <li>This holds \\&quot;just enough\\&quot; and looks fairly classy on the guest bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Super if you don&#x27;t want your counter crowded or have little space.</li>
            <li>Check the dimensions, this is a nice size but not right if you&#x27;re looking for something really small.</li>
            <li>The lid is super heavy duty.</li>
            <li>Although its acrylic (which is safer, especially in a guest bathroom), is high quality enough that it looks like glass!</li>

            <li> Although its acrylic (which is safer, especially in a guest bathroom), is high quality enough that it looks like glass!</li>
            <li> It is a clear thick acrylic with no rough edges or imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Fits enough q-tips to last at least 2-3 weeks amongst 3 people in the home who use them daily.</li>
            <li> On the small side, but like that there is a middle space for swabs</li>
            <li> we are seniors and continue to scale down.  </li>
            <li> This arrived missing a lid handle (knob).</li>
            <li> Heavy transparent plastic in graceful rounded shape.</li>
            <li> I feel like if there were three size options this would be a small</li>
            <li> It replaced a cheesy, faceted plastic version that I&#x27;d bought locally.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how that could have happened, but things arrive broken sometimes.</li>
            <li> Some have just a very small knob and some you have to twist...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m disappointed about getting a broken item, but even more disappointed about the customer service failure.</li>
            <li> Makes me sad because it is just what I needed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> attractive item, fits in with any décor.  Would definitely recommend this product.  I also like having unbreakable items in the bathroom setting.</li>
            <li> This is a very practical purchase. Glad I bought it!!!</li>
            <li> The acrylic is much thicker than I thought, which is a good thing. It is very sturdy and looks great. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an upgrade from what we had before, which was nothing.  Instead of going into our cabinets and digging through the box or bag, we now have it accessible on our counter top in a neat little package.</li>
            <li> The pic makes it look bigger.  I feel like if there were three size options this would be a small and I would prefer a medium.  But, all in all, a nice-looking and functional piece for the bathroom.  The acrylic composition is a nice touch, so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap and plasticy, and it&#x27;s not flimsy.  Fits enough q-tips to last at least 2-3 weeks amongst 3 people in the home who use them daily. It&#x27;s a space saver so you don&#x27;t need two separate containers for cotton balls and q-tips.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Very economically sized! Super if you don&#x27;t want your counter crowded or have little space. Although its acrylic (which is safer, especially in a guest bathroom), is high quality enough that it looks like glass! The lid is super heavy duty. Nothing cheap looking about this.  Has a very clean and classic look. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I added this to my make up acrylic dresser top set and its perfect size. The lid does not fit securely but it doe not need to be a fight to get to your products quickly.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much I had to find a make-up organizer to pair with it as I leave it out on the bathroom counter.  It is a clear thick acrylic with no rough edges or imperfections.  It holds a good supply of cotton swabs and cotton balls.  Check the dimensions, this is a nice size but not right if you&#x27;re looking for something really small.</li>
            <li> I had a glass jar similar to this that I knocked over and it smashed to pieces.  I have already knocked this on the floor without issue.  It is think plastic and durable.</li>
            <li> This arrived missing a lid handle (knob). Not sure how that could have happened, but things arrive broken sometimes. Makes me sad because it is just what I needed and it otherwise would have been ideal. What really bothers me is that I would have liked to return it and have a replacement sent, but that wasn&#x27;t even offered as an option--only a refund. So I&#x27;m disappointed about getting a broken item, but even more disappointed about the customer service failure.</li>
            <li> The cap broke as soon as I opened the box. Very cheap quality, and they won&#x27;t even let me return it....</li>
            <li> Very durable;&lt;br /&gt;Love the clean look &amp;  clean lines&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for vanity&lt;br /&gt;Very chic. Very happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;Would be a perfect gift</li>
            <li> Elegant, but simple. As advertised. Well made. Perfect for our guest bath as guests can see what is nside of it.</li>
            <li> Fits a good amount of cotton pads and qtips. Looks lovely on the bathroom counter. Since it&#x27;s plastic, it does not leave a ring on the counter. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect little item.. not as sanitary as the dispenser.. but the combination of balls and sticks .. saves space and time</li>
            <li> This is a very-nice-looking container for cotton swabs and cotton balls. Heavy transparent plastic in graceful rounded shape. Have had it for almost a year and looks brand new. Great price!</li>
            <li> This comes exactly as it is advertised. I&#x27;m able to fit my cotton swabs and cotton balls, and I&#x27;m not afraid of it breaking in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I use this without the lid to hold hair brushes and combs. It has an interior cylinder which I didn&#x27;t realize but otherwise I enjoy the shape and clear material for bathroom organization.</li>
            <li> On the small side, but like that there is a middle space for swabs</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  Very simple but tasteful design will work in any décor or bathroom.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last year one for myself and one for my mother.  She liked it for her dresser because it held just enough cotton balls and Q-tips for a time instead of the large store packaging.  My sister saw it and loved it so I purchased one for a gift for her.  She loves it because it makes her dresser look neat and feminine, and does not break like glass.</li>
            <li> Good organizational tool.</li>
            <li> We live in a cottage size house with one bathroom...we are seniors and continue to scale down.  This container held both the cotton balls and swabs.  I put allot of thought and shopping on line for something that held both items - and - with a lid you could easily grab and lift.  I wanted this type lid.  Some have just a very small knob and some you have to twist...This one seem to fit our needs.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that I would have like to have had a container/containers that held more, but again we are space limited now and we have to conform...so this one works for us.</li>
            <li> Not overly pretty, and does not take up a lot of space. But this is definatly functional and compact enough for the space it is in.</li>
            <li> This is nice-quality acrylic.  It replaced a cheesy, faceted plastic version that I&#x27;d bought locally.  This holds \\&quot;just enough\\&quot; and looks fairly classy on the guest bathroom counter.  It&#x27;s worth the price and I definitely recommend it!</li>
