    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with the nails.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great pricing!</li>
            <li>The fits is excellent and the wearable meets what is advertised and then some.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the looks of these nails and they gave me great looking nails on two occasions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these for months in the vain hope I could have great looking nails without dropping $80 a month at the salon.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>the nails look great 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li>Love them!!</li>
            <li>Amazing Amazing Amazing !!  </li>
            <li>They are great:)  </li>
            <li>they stick on and look amazing.</li>
            <li>That being said, these held up fairly well despite their length and the fit was good.</li>
            <li>So far these seem to be perfect.... will be ordering him some more of different lengths to see what works best.</li>
            <li>it lasts to more than one week :) without damage the nails , and i will repeat the experience ..</li>
            <li>and I love the color of them.</li>
            <li>My husband took the time to find the correct size for each nail but after a couple of coats of OPI and clearcoat to finish he looks just so cute.</li>
            <li>and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect them to stay on for more than 12 hours...</li>
            <li>and she thought they where cute.</li>
            <li>I JUST WISH YOU COULD SHOW MORE COLORS...</li>
            <li>I love this brand of nails.  </li>
            <li>Oh yes an done more thing</li>
            <li>have received so many compliments on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Then like magic they can be applied.  </li>
            <li>OK, they do fluoresce quite well, so if you did put them with neon colors, they would look fine, too.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;media darling&amp;#34; color is a Very bright almost fluorescent pink, but still a bit more elegant than a &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying this brand for the first time, DO use the alcohol wipe thoroughly on each nail before application, and pick the sizes in the set that best fit the curve of your natural nail.</li>
            <li>These nails worked great for me for a night out on the town and there were enough nails in the package that I was able to make two sets so I could wear them twice.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and remove with no nail polish remover required.</li>
            <li>I was think that these were going to be cheap and bulky.</li>
            <li>These nails actually fit my nail bed and they are just the right length</li>
            <li>They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick.</li>
            <li>I used my friend&#x27;s super salon strength nail glue to reinforce the nails and help them stay on.</li>
            <li>To remove, use one nail as a sort of wedge to push between another nail and your own nail, starting at one side and working your way across right through the adhesive.</li>
            <li>VERY MUCH...</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these nails for future use.</li>
            <li>And of course, the index and pinky nails in my experience have been the ones to fall off first.</li>
            <li>I can easily wear a set for 7-10 days and then usually only have to replace one at a time.  </li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m spending so much time on this review.</li>
            <li>Take what you would have spent on three packs of these (because you&#x27;ll want to keep trying them to make sure it wasn&#x27;t operator error) and get a manicure from a pro.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I love the ways these look, but for some reason after like a few days my index finger nail will pop off on both hands.</li>
            <li>I was wrong, they were really cute and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you are going out somewhere for the night, they last a little longer if you don&#x27;t wet your hands much</li>
            <li>The other sizes are just huge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried recleaning the nail and putting a new one on there</li>
            <li>I have a hard time keeping my nails long and looking good.</li>
            <li>Easy to change color to match an outfit or to remove for a day of yard or heavy housework.  </li>
            <li>So if you want long, plastic claws and you never do dishes or clean or type on a computer, they might last longer than a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In order for them to look natural</li>
            <li>hot pink.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy these again and try new colors out as well.</li>
            <li>Fibers of the cotton pad will just stick to your formerly awesome looking nails, and your hands won&#x27;t look normal until a couple of days after the nails are but a distant, annoying</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;re just press on nails, but at $5-9 a pop and constantly buying them to see if \\&quot;maybe this time they&#x27;ll work\\&quot; I could have gotten professional manicures.</li>
            <li>With that, these will absolutely stay on as advertised, even if you&#x27;re a bit rough on them.</li>
            <li>The next morning in the shower, they already started to lift off and by the time I was halfway through work they were barely hanging on by a thread.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are SO MANY replacement thumb sizes in the pack, and only a few small index/pinky finger ones - yes, even the petite pack.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical when first trying the Impress Nails, but it&#x27;s been over a week and they are still staying strong.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thicker, shinier, cooler designs/colors than other</li>
            <li> but I would say medium length isn&#x27;t for me as I am active and do a lot of hand washing.</li>
            <li> you have to clip/file them down.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would stay put for a few days but still be removable when he is again a boy.</li>
            <li> No more sessions at the salon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are no better than the cheaper press on nails at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> This product line rarely fails to impress in color or quality.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed</li>

            <li> Amazing Amazing Amazing !!  i really like it it lasts to more than one week :) without damage the nails , and i will repeat the experience ..</li>

            <li> These stay on for almost 3 weeks if you use nail glue.  Love them!!</li>
            <li> I like it and it fits me</li>
            <li> These nails actually fit my nail bed and they are just the right length and I love the color of them. Will definitely buy these again and try new colors out as well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the nails. I would like the option for natural colors as it did take a couple of coats to cover the very pink ones.

            <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
            <li> I wore these for a week and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling. They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick. imPress nails damage your nails. I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend to ANYONE. Rather, I am warning everyone what they do to their nails after wearing for just 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> This product line rarely fails to impress in color or quality. Just be prepared to file off some end tabs.</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist, I cannot keep nail polish on because of shampooing hair all day, so I wanted to try something else. I was very skeptical when first trying the Impress Nails, but it&#x27;s been over a week and they are still staying strong.</li>
            <li> I was think that these were going to be cheap and bulky. I was wrong, they were really cute and easy to apply. Also I only bought one but I revived 3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for months in the vain hope I could have great looking nails without dropping $80 a month at the salon. Unfortunately, they are no better than the cheaper press on nails at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thicker, shinier, cooler designs/colors than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in a mad rush and need your nails to look good for a few hours (job interview, night out, costume party) they&#x27;re great. Don&#x27;t expect them to stay on for more than 12 hours...even if you use nail glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are SO MANY replacement thumb sizes in the pack, and only a few small index/pinky finger ones - yes, even the petite pack. And of course, the index and pinky nails in my experience have been the ones to fall off first. If you have small nails like me, you&#x27;ll only get one decent set out of these and there won&#x27;t be any replacements for when one nail falls off three hours after you put them on. The other sizes are just huge. I don&#x27;t know anyone who has six thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order for them to look natural you have to clip/file them down. Yes, even the ones that call themselves \\&quot;short.\\&quot; This compromises the adhesive on the nail itself. So if you want long, plastic claws and you never do dishes or clean or type on a computer, they might last longer than a day. If you&#x27;re not the type to lie around all day staring at your nails, they&#x27;re too long and impractical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using nail glue makes no difference. I used my friend&#x27;s super salon strength nail glue to reinforce the nails and help them stay on. The next morning in the shower, they already started to lift off and by the time I was halfway through work they were barely hanging on by a thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you take them off you have gummy residue all over your nails. And nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t work. Fibers of the cotton pad will just stick to your formerly awesome looking nails, and your hands won&#x27;t look normal until a couple of days after the nails are but a distant, annoying memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m spending so much time on this review. I know they&#x27;re just press on nails, but at $5-9 a pop and constantly buying them to see if \\&quot;maybe this time they&#x27;ll work\\&quot; I could have gotten professional manicures. I guess I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid. Take what you would have spent on three packs of these (because you&#x27;ll want to keep trying them to make sure it wasn&#x27;t operator error) and get a manicure from a pro.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you are going out somewhere for the night, they last a little longer if you don&#x27;t wet your hands much</li>
            <li> they stick on and look amazing. i got them for my daughter and she thought they where cute.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE NAILS VERY MUCH...I JUST WISH YOU COULD SHOW MORE COLORS...I LIKE  THE RED,BUT NOT REAL BRIGHT.I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE FRENCH NAILS OFFERED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK U&lt;br /&gt;LORRAINE JOHNSON</li>
            <li> I love this brand of nails.  My experience is if you follow the directions 100% the nails look great 5-7 days.  My nails are growing underneath.  I wash dishes and take care of my 3 Labs.  I do have to replace my thumbs on about day 4, however I replace them and move on.  They are great:)  Follow directions. Oh yes an done more thing, I type all of the time at work and I have no problem there.  Larke</li>
            <li> I love the ways these look, but for some reason after like a few days my index finger nail will pop off on both hands. I&#x27;ve tried recleaning the nail and putting a new one on there but it pops off 30 min later..</li>
            <li> outsatnding for a night out!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;media darling&amp;#34; color is a Very bright almost fluorescent pink, but still a bit more elegant than a &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; hot pink. OK, they do fluoresce quite well, so if you did put them with neon colors, they would look fine, too. If you&#x27;re trying this brand for the first time, DO use the alcohol wipe thoroughly on each nail before application, and pick the sizes in the set that best fit the curve of your natural nail. With that, these will absolutely stay on as advertised, even if you&#x27;re a bit rough on them. I&#x27;ve done three days and still had to work to remove them. To remove, use one nail as a sort of wedge to push between another nail and your own nail, starting at one side and working your way across right through the adhesive. These are for a single use.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Kiss nails for almost two years and I tell everyone about this product&lt;br /&gt;I have received so many compliments on my nails.  The colors are vibrant.  The fits is excellent and the wearable meets what is advertised and then some.  The nails come with adhesive but I do use extra glue.  Buy the bottle that bushes on like nail polish.  I can easily wear a set for 7-10 days and then usually only have to replace one at a time.  I often tire of them before I have to replace a set.  Easy to change color to match an outfit or to remove for a day of yard or heavy housework.  Then like magic they can be applied.  No more sessions at the salon these nails are on in minutes.  Try them ..you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I really like this brand but I would say medium length isn&#x27;t for me as I am active and do a lot of hand washing. That being said, these held up fairly well despite their length and the fit was good.</li>
