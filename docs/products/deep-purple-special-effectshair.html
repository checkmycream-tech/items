            <li>Great color for winter.</li>
            <li>Tl;dr, Great dye, but it will stain the s</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been as happy with the color as I used to be.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy with the color and the product.</li>
            <li>was not that great.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced staining to some extent</li>
            <li>It looks great though and its been a month</li>
            <li>It gives my hair this amazing glowing quality that is so beautiful!</li>

            <li>:P</li>
            <li>(Everything else which came into contact with it and was stained has been cleaned successfully)</li>
            <li>Even though I loved the color, I probably will not use this product ever again.</li>
            <li>good color</li>
            <li>If one is to judge a dye by how good it looks when it fades, SE is 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A lot of people suggest petroleum jelly around your hairline and on your ears, which is a good idea.</li>
            <li>hair looks gorgeous though.</li>
            <li>loved the color of this dye.</li>
            <li>I loved this puprle alot and get complaments on it all the time even after it is fading.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist loved it.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Best purple hair dye available.</li>
            <li>and bam youre good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is the price I can pay for good looking purple hair.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous plum purple color</li>
            <li>Ion Brights is a good one that I&#x27;ve used, and I had no staining at all with it, so try that if you don&#x27;t want stains.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!!  </li>
            <li>I have read many great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>It works best if you bleach your hair first and leave it on a lil bit longer than the directions say.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>However, spray some mold and mildew remover spray on the color and it disappears like magic!    </li>
            <li>This is some potent stuff!</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with the seller!</li>
            <li>I really love this dye!</li>
            <li>I get the best results when I bleach my hair first, though.</li>

            <li>I want to give you 5 stars, I really really do you magnificent purple dye.  </li>
            <li>My bathtub is still kind of pinkish-purple, and the bath mat has been dyed purple.</li>

            <li>Stayed super bright for a good 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>For many years now I have bleached my hair and dyed it wonderful, bright colors and frequently.</li>
            <li>to the wise: This dye is STRONG.</li>
            <li>thru it FREQUENTLY - I find these tips provide the BEST application and</li>

            <li>My hair came out a gorgeous shade of dark purple, but the best part?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this shade as well.</li>
            <li>That all being said, I am extremely pleased with the color and resilience of this dye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been many weeks now since I dyed it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy a bottle of bleach for your shower</li>
            <li>I took a liking to swimming two days after I dye and it takes most of the &amp;#34;bleeding everywhere&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and still my nails are dyed from touching my hair.</li>
            <li>still* comes out in the shower, and I don&#x27;t even want to know what would happen if I slept with light pillow covers!</li>
            <li>shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to wrap your hair in plastic wrap, a plastic bag or a shower cap after you dye, to help hold in heat and help the color penetrate more.</li>
            <li>in all, this is an amazing dye with fantastic staying power.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is an amazing dye with fantastic staying power.</li>
            <li>Just prepare your hair properly and you will have wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I did just my tips more like an ombre effect.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of haircolor</li>
            <li>Still love the color while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It probably has to do with my complexion but it has been my favorite</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use LOTS of petroleum jelly along your hair line, and gloves.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>WILL buy again! :)</li>
            <li>I squeezed about 1/3 of the bottle into a quart sized freezer zip lock bag, separated my hair into the appropriate sections.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments from every age group.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived timely and safely but they dye</li>
            <li>I love this hair color</li>
            <li>Make sure to line the tops of your ears and hair line with Vaseline or else be prepared to have the color get all over your face.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I still love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fatal Impact shipped it for free, and it arrived in just 3 days!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did, because who would have known that you&#x27;d never be able to buy SFX dye from anywhere, because they keep not getting it out.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>ring around the collar will be purple :)</li>
            <li>so I like it better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used this dye, I was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I can get them to look good for about 2 months by using sulfate free shampoo (it&#x27;s the key for keeping bright colors)  </li>
            <li>Amazing dye, this is the stuff to use if you want colorful hair.</li>
            <li>As a plus, it looks great with my natural brown hair which is growing in - another thing I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Make sure that whatever workspace you&#x27;re doing this in.. cover everything in plastic.. like a cheap plastic tablecloth or some trashbags... and remember...</li>
            <li>It still stained my skin in the shower a good 2 weeks after dying my hair, and it REALLY stained my clothes for awhile also</li>
            <li>A good clarifying shampoo or anti-dandruff shampoo works really well for this purpose.</li>
            <li>After one week, the color has significantly faded (which is fine by me!)</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The resulting color was very bold, and lasted for over a month before I noticed any color fade.</li>
            <li>Rinse it AWAY from your face, because it stains very quickly.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t stain so easily.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t fade away easily.</li>
            <li>It will stain EVERYTHING and ANYTHING that it touches, it seems, which is a side-effect of how strong the dye is.</li>
            <li>The pigment in this stuff is strong and will dye your hands and nails.     </li>
            <li>but this is how I fell in love with Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, *then* use the Special Effects on top.     </li>
            <li>Special Effects is one of my favorite brands of hair dye.</li>
            <li>but the purple color was dark and gorgeous while it lasted!!!!</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair, after it was bleached and this dye was used, the color was awesome.</li>
            <li>SE deep purple is so beautiful that I&#x27;ll deal with staining.</li>
            <li>Deep Purple into conditioner results in beautiful lighter tones.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fine now.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fine now.</li>
            <li>Also wear gloves, even for those that think they will be fine without gloves.</li>
            <li>Just prepare your hair properly and you will have wonderful results.had to use a dye first</li>
            <li>My hands were fine since I wore gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky, you may be able to lift the stain(s) somewhat with a product containing bleach.</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t faded very much at all! :-)</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very dark and looks awesome.</li>
            <li>For me, it was absolutely worth it as we have cleaning products that were able to remove it from the sink, walls, etc.</li>
            <li>Easy clean</li>
            <li>but it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I will admit my hair looks great with the deep purple.</li>
            <li>and yes it surely was more intense..</li>
            <li>you love Special Effects as much as I do!!</li>
            <li>Hope you love Special Effects as much as I do!!</li>
            <li>Deep Purple Special Effects - the color was great - but the color was EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li>After a long bath and a good scrubbing I got most of it off but my hands and shower are still coloured.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a hot pink color which is awesome!</li>
            <li>But its worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>This one is very much purple and fades to a kind of really hot magenta.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rush to clean it up</li>
            <li>Note that this is extremely important: if your hair hasn&#x27;t had any kind of processing - no previous dyeing or bleaching - your hair will not hold onto this color well.</li>
            <li>I have special \\&quot;coloring shirts\\&quot; just for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>*then* use the Special Effects on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also some color got on my neck and ears the day after I dyed it, which I needed to use a special product made for removing hair dye to get it off of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never straying away from Special Effects again, all their colors are on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the &#x27;special effects&#x27; part of it,</li>
            <li>Mixing a miniscule amount of Special Effects</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to bleach your hair to use Special Effects</li>
            <li>it fades to a very bright hot pink.</li>
            <li>really, really, should of payed more attention to the comments about the stains.</li>
            <li>You MUST use a really good amount of Vaseline on your hair line, face, neck, ears, anywhere that hair will likely touch and everywhere else</li>
            <li>Good holding after several washes.</li>
            <li>This is the best edgy hair color line I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I loved the color of this dye on my hair, and I think it will last a while.</li>
            <li>and it still looks cool with the fading at week 5.</li>
            <li>Well, what use is a good product if no one can actually buy it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t stain as much, it&#x27;d be 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t keeps its bright color for more then 2 weeks and it turns EVERYTHING purple so be prepared for it to look like you killed a purple dinosar</li>
            <li>However, once I became pregnant, I was determined to abstain from all unnatural chemicals - including hair dye - while pregnant and into breast feeding and so on in order to minimize exposure for my child.</li>
            <li>The atrocities you have committed against my tub are of a sort most foul and likely to lose most people their security deposits.  </li>
            <li>It fades to a nice pink magenta color after many washes.</li>
            <li>Deffinitely the most vibrant and</li>
            <li>It has had great staying power, and really the only problem I&#x27;ve had is the staining.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>i really loved the color, it lasted forever, but if you don&#x27;t want it for a long time/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very confident that it will not be fading to any kind of undesirable color anytime in the near future which is exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>I figured I could remove any purple I got on my skin easily with rubbing alcohol just like MP, but I was very wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is in my top 2 favorite (the other being Wildflower which goes Bright Blue &amp;#62; Purple &amp;#62; Lavender &amp;#62; Silver as it washes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apart from that, the color was exactly how it said it would be!</li>
            <li>the colors it&#x27;s fading to are still really really pretty!</li>
            <li>so* little of the pigment is required to achieve an awesome lighter shade, that I could conceivably sustain this process for over a year.</li>
            <li>The color is great and it is very dark, like i wanted</li>
            <li>They LAST and the color is amazing.     </li>
            <li>Nice deep purple.</li>
            <li>I had used Manic Panic for the blue and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with its fadibility, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident that I can use one of those natural hair lighteners that I purchased at Wal-greens to take it out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>5 seconds out of your day to squirt the tub is a small price to pay for beautifully colored hair that lasts</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite shade of purple.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It sets right on top of my natural hair color without having to bleach it.  </li>
            <li>I love the rich purple color, but it does not last longer than a week</li>
            <li>:) No other cons here!</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY of Special Effects brand&#x27;s various shades of hair dye</li>
            <li>Be ready to clean the tub after every rinse -- it bleeds like hell.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about veggie dyes is that they actually improve your hair&#x27;s condition, and the longer you leave it in, not only the deeper does the color get, but also the better it will condition your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get numerous compliments on my hair (the roots are also bright pink), and so many compliments on this shade of purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color was super vibrant but when it fades which happened pretty quickly for me(I workout a lot</li>
            <li>Beautiful rich color in a dark red purple and</li>
            <li>Our cleaning products are natural, BTW, nothing insanely strong or anything.</li>
            <li>When it finally did began to fade, it turned into a pretty pastel purple that was honestly just as nice as the deep, vivid purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very, very purple.</li>
            <li>On bleached hair the color is amazing and stays longer than any of the other fun colored dyes.</li>
            <li>The *best* results are probably found with bleaching your hair first, but I had just dyed my hair normally (with a reddish brown dye, I think) previous to using this, and the results were gorgeous - a very deep, almost black purple.</li>
            <li>Most of them fade very quickly, but not Special Effects.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair turned out exactly how she wanted it.</li>
            <li>their colour selection is stellar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing to be aware of: this color will STAIN.</li>
            <li>I think it started fading maybe 5 months after I first used it.</li>
            <li>I had to use a dye first,</li>
            <li>my FAVORITE combination is Deep Purple with Wildflower!!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve stained your clothes or most likely...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve stained your clothes or most likely...</li>
            <li>The exact color of purple I was looking for.</li>
            <li>In my small bathroom I magically get dye on the porcelain sink (under the towel), the laminate tile (around the towels), and, magically, on the wall (no towel there).</li>
            <li>I then but a hair band around the top of the bag and left it for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I left the rest of my hair on top of my head in a clip.</li>
            <li>the first five or so times you wash your hair after dying.</li>
            <li>First of all, I did not bleach my hair.</li>
            <li>I did bleach my hair first and the parts that were the whitest were the darkest and some of the yellowy parts stayed brighter.  </li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>Most of it has come out easily enough in the wash, but if you don&#x27;t want any staining at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Being my first time using it, I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to leave it on, so I figured half an hour would be good.</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;ll have to redye my hair more often, but at least I&#x27;ll be able to ACTUALLY GET THE DYE TO DO SO.</li>
            <li>It comes with way more dye than you need, even if your hair is pretty long.</li>
            <li>I wish Special Effects offered turquoise but as far as I know, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>At most, if you overkill like I do and have really long hair, will use 3/4 of a bottle.</li>
            <li>Yes, I didn&#x27;t get the color as far up my hair as my colorist does but looks cool.</li>
            <li>dark brown hair bleached once) came out a really nice darkish shade of purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did it for 45 minutes the second time, and it was much more vibrant.</li>
            <li>i would say the life span is at least a month or more, and when it fades, it just gets more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly hope they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic, it produces a deep purple color using very little, and fades to a gorgeous lilac color.  </li>
            <li>The new batch or most recent bottles</li>
            <li>I thank the lord that I had the foresight to purchase black sheets before applying this most powerful concoction to my head.  </li>
            <li>If you take the proper precautions you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I love how long special effects colors last.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re over having to dye your hair every few weeks to maintain amazing color, GET.  </li>
            <li>My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple.</li>
            <li>Haha.  </li>
            <li>My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple.</li>
            <li>but it faded fast (three weeks)</li>
            <li>if you run your fingers through your hair to much your fingers will turn purple.</li>
            <li>absolutely worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the drippings from my hair were enough to stain my (light gray)</li>
            <li>If you *really* don&#x27;t want to risk staining, line everything with newspapers and/or plastic bags, and wear clothes you don&#x27;t mind getting stained.</li>
            <li>One reason I really like diluting it with conditioner is because I like the way it looks when it&#x27;s washed out a week or so.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve dyed your hair with the dye straight and didn&#x27;t dilute it, you can strip the color with Head and Shoulders or another dandruff brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, yesterday I took the plunge with this product after much consternation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For staying power, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Also was very well packed, with the lid taped shut, the whole thing wrapped in newspaper, and sealed in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li>so I kind of have to wash my hair almost everyday)</li>
            <li>really* see the purple, but even in normal indoor lighting it was pretty obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, other than your roots, You really don&#x27;t have to dye it very often.</li>
            <li>I have an underlayer of Special Effects Wild Flower and Deep Purple, with the top layer of hair turquoise shading to cobalt blue.</li>
            <li>Most other products I would have to touch up the color every week to two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Color is vibrant and lasts and it didn&#x27;t bleed like most other colors.</li>
            <li>Special effects seems to NOT be in production currently...</li>
            <li>Special effects seems to NOT be in production currently...</li>
            <li>if you are only dying certain parts of your hair, make sure you separate your regular hair and the hair</li>
            <li>Also, this seller was extremely fast with shipping, and I will definitely buy more from them in the future!</li>
            <li>I love the color and it last pretty long.  </li>
            <li>I love this color, it came out dark</li>
            <li>The underside of my hair is still that darkish purple color with the slightly lighter faded stuff on top</li>
            <li>All the washings necessary to get rid of the greasy feeling (of course) caused the color to fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li>decent color.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have the nightmare mess as other people have experienced.</li>
            <li>Keep it damp by putting your gloved hands under the sink for a quick second and pat on and into your hair, even cover with a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;Comb</li>
            <li>It fades to a really nice bubblegum pink after about 3 months of constant washing, but it keeps the purple color fairly vibrantly for about 2-3 months depending upon the frequency of your hair washing.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed my hair in the kitchen sink using the sprayer and then used the hair dryer on high.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first.</li>
            <li>After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first.</li>
            <li>This brand works far better than any other semi permanent pigment out there.  </li>
            <li>If you want a hair dye that lasts for an EXTREMELY long time and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical death, than I HIGHLY recommend using Special Effects.</li>
            <li>this is the BEST hair color out there, Splat isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li>I have tried a few hair dyes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even worse that they figure they can get away with it because they make a good product.</li>
            <li>I never expected a semi-permanent hair dye to last half a year and still look so gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage is that this products STAINS EVERYTHING, and not just right after you color, but for a couple of weeks afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much echoing other reviewers here, but Special Effects is the ONLY brand of \\&quot;non-natural\\&quot; hair colors you should ever buy.</li>
            <li>it looked like a brand new dye job until about april, when it started to fade.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s vibrant and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Other colors just aren&#x27;t as bright or long lasting.</li>
            <li>it does lighten to a Virgin Rose colored pink... but never truly goes back to blonde on</li>
            <li>with that being said, it actually looks really pretty.</li>
            <li>My hair color was light brown with dark roots.    </li>
            <li>:) No other cons here!ep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first.</li>
            <li>As it fades, the black disappears and gives way to a true purple, which is vibrant for weeks.</li>
            <li>Rinsing it out made a huge mess and stained my body purple.</li>
            <li>The products in my hair right now are Special Effects Deep Purple and Fishbowl as well as Punky Colour Apple Green.</li>
            <li>I used a little bit of sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>is purple, my cell phone is died, all my shirts had purple on them, i would wake up and parts of my  face where my hair was touching was purple, my hands still turn purple every time i style my hair and even my white cat was a little purple from snuggling me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, and the product arrived as expected!</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;d have to say that this one is by far the strongest.</li>
            <li>I used this dye over my natural medium-brown hair, unbleached.</li>
            <li>After swimming (and washing) 3 times a week, it is beginning to show undertones of my natural brown color, but retains the purple.</li>
            <li>I already get the bottom layer of my hair done professionally in a purple anyway</li>
            <li>have naturally light blonde hair that comes to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>This stuff literally can touch something for just a split second and stain it that fast.</li>
            <li>so it looks &#x27;natural&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>I have an old enamel tub</li>
            <li>This dye is really stubborn which is why I only have to touch it up every two months or so,  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, and required very little processing time.</li>
            <li>and a little goes a long way for sure.</li>
            <li>but this was excessive and more trouble than it was worth.   </li>
            <li>it will even stain your hands when you are styling your hair, I can&#x27;t even blow dry without purplely stained hands...be prepared for the mess :)</li>
            <li>When you wash with shampoo you might want to wear gloves the first few times because it rinses out quite a bit (but doesn&#x27;t fade the color really).</li>
            <li>I will try other colors, but in the end I adore the quality of Special Effects and plan on buying my next bottle from Fatal Impact, no doubt!</li>
            <li>It made a huge mess in my shower, &amp; I came out with a purple face, ears, back, legs &amp; feet.</li>
            <li>- Part of my face was stained purple the next day but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap removed most of it immediately and the rest, which was hardly noticeable, disappeared within a day or two.</li>
            <li>Cons - Part of my face was stained purple the next day but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap removed most of it immediately and the rest, which was hardly noticeable, disappeared within a day or two.</li>
            <li>(I will shower and wet it down, letting the build of oil disperse to my roots for natural conditioning) to keep the color strong.</li>
            <li>; I would not reccommend wearing any white or light colors when using this product, as I ruined quite a few shirts.</li>
            <li>I mixed 1/4 of the bottle with three times as much conditioner, then applied and left in hair for an hour before rinsing.</li>
            <li>MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;It stayed a vivid deep purple for a whopping 6 months.</li>
            <li>Color fades with each shampoo, but only the blue washes out, leaving your hair a true pink after about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>It has been a month since I put it on my hair, and it has barely faded at all.  </li>
            <li>(I do have a white pillow case and Wildflower completely came out).</li>
            <li>(I do have a white pillow case and Wildflower completely came out).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a product like this before be forewarned that you definitely need to wear gloves and old clothes when dying since the color will stain hands and clothing.</li>
            <li>My salon has been ordering a purple that has too much of the red tones and not enough of the blue tones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only washed it twice so far</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this color to anyone who wants a dark, truly deep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first.</li>
            <li>One part Deep Purple with One or less parts of Wildflower with 5-6 parts conditioner makes more blue tones in the Deep Purple while still leaving the pink highlights in the sun.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>you, its grown out and now faded to pink, really light pink on some spots, but that goes to show how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Unprocessed hair will have a closed hair shaft, which means the color may coat the hair, but won&#x27;t last as long because the color will be easily washed</li>
            <li>This comes out as a very dark purple, almost black when you first apply it to platinum hair and gradually washes out to a rich purple with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>Lasts seemingly forever on previously chemically treated hair, will cover any color, although will most likely only tint actual black hair, and initially shows up just as well on hair which is not previously chemically treated.</li>

            <li>/tub because it stains in there pretty heavily too.</li>
            <li>cover everything in plastic and use gloves the first few times you do anything.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not available in any store I&#x27;m aware of around here, I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear white for the first few days, especially if you&#x27;re going to be working out or in the yard, working up a sweat..</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this and will not go back to using any other brand for color.</li>
            <li>My sheets are black, so I don&#x27;t care there, and I found a product to get it off my skin with barely any effort, so that&#x27;s cool, but my clothes do get a little stained.</li>
            <li>However, I cannot promise that it will last quite as long on hair which is not chemically treated in any way prior to using it as my natural roots have faded back to brown by now.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The bleach I use is 7th Stage by clairol which seems to be the only bleach that will lift my Japanese Black hair without damaging it too much.</li>
            <li>but after a few washes you can hardly tell and i was able to get it off my closes (it says it it permanent on fabrics) with soak in Oxiclean, but it got every where.</li>

            <li> Even though I loved the color, I probably will not use this product ever again.</li>
            <li> good color</li>
            <li> If one is to judge a dye by how good it looks when it fades, SE is 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A lot of people suggest petroleum jelly around your hairline and on your ears, which is a good idea.</li>

            <li> loved the color of this dye.</li>

            <li> Ion Brights is a good one that I&#x27;ve used, and I had no staining at all with it, so try that if you don&#x27;t want stains.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have read many great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> Love this color!</li>
            <li> It works best if you bleach your hair first and leave it on a lil bit longer than the directions say.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> However, spray some mold and mildew remover spray on the color and it disappears like magic!    </li>
            <li> This is some potent stuff!</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with the seller!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Fatal Impact shipped it for free, and it arrived in just 3 days!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did, because who would have known that you&#x27;d never be able to buy SFX dye from anywhere, because they keep not getting it out.</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> ring around the collar will be purple :)</li>
            <li> so I like it better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time I used this dye, I was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I can get them to look good for about 2 months by using sulfate free shampoo (it&#x27;s the key for keeping bright colors)  </li>
            <li> Amazing dye, this is the stuff to use if you want colorful hair.</li>
            <li> As a plus, it looks great with my natural brown hair which is growing in - another thing I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Make sure that whatever workspace you&#x27;re doing this in.. cover everything in plastic.. like a cheap plastic tablecloth or some trashbags... and remember...</li>
            <li> It still stained my skin in the shower a good 2 weeks after dying my hair, and it REALLY stained my clothes for awhile also</li>
            <li> A good clarifying shampoo or anti-dandruff shampoo works really well for this purpose.</li>
            <li> After one week, the color has significantly faded (which is fine by me!)</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The resulting color was very bold, and lasted for over a month before I noticed any color fade.</li>
            <li> Rinse it AWAY from your face, because it stains very quickly.</li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t stain so easily.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t fade away easily.</li>
            <li> It will stain EVERYTHING and ANYTHING that it touches, it seems, which is a side-effect of how strong the dye is.</li>
            <li> The pigment in this stuff is strong and will dye your hands and nails.     </li>
            <li> but this is how I fell in love with Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , *then* use the Special Effects on top.     </li>
            <li> Special Effects is one of my favorite brands of hair dye.</li>
            <li> but the purple color was dark and gorgeous while it lasted!!!!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, after it was bleached and this dye was used, the color was awesome.</li>
            <li> SE deep purple is so beautiful that I&#x27;ll deal with staining.</li>
            <li> Deep Purple into conditioner results in beautiful lighter tones.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fine now.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fine now.</li>
            <li> Also wear gloves, even for those that think they will be fine without gloves.</li>
            <li> Just prepare your hair properly and you will have wonderful results.had to use a dye first</li>
            <li> My hands were fine since I wore gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky, you may be able to lift the stain(s) somewhat with a product containing bleach.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t faded very much at all! :-)</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very dark and looks awesome.</li>
            <li> For me, it was absolutely worth it as we have cleaning products that were able to remove it from the sink, walls, etc.</li>
            <li> Easy clean</li>
            <li> but it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I will admit my hair looks great with the deep purple.</li>
            <li> and yes it surely was more intense..</li>
            <li> you love Special Effects as much as I do!!</li>
            <li> Hope you love Special Effects as much as I do!!</li>
            <li> Deep Purple Special Effects - the color was great - but the color was EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li> After a long bath and a good scrubbing I got most of it off but my hands and shower are still coloured.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a hot pink color which is awesome!</li>
            <li> But its worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> This one is very much purple and fades to a kind of really hot magenta.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rush to clean it up</li>
            <li> Note that this is extremely important: if your hair hasn&#x27;t had any kind of processing - no previous dyeing or bleaching - your hair will not hold onto this color well.</li>
            <li> I have special \\&quot;coloring shirts\\&quot; just for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> *then* use the Special Effects on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also some color got on my neck and ears the day after I dyed it, which I needed to use a special product made for removing hair dye to get it off of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never straying away from Special Effects again, all their colors are on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the &#x27;special effects&#x27; part of it,</li>
            <li> Mixing a miniscule amount of Special Effects</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to bleach your hair to use Special Effects</li>
            <li> it fades to a very bright hot pink.</li>
            <li> really, really, should of payed more attention to the comments about the stains.</li>
            <li> You MUST use a really good amount of Vaseline on your hair line, face, neck, ears, anywhere that hair will likely touch and everywhere else</li>
            <li> Good holding after several washes.</li>
            <li> This is the best edgy hair color line I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I loved the color of this dye on my hair, and I think it will last a while.</li>
            <li> and it still looks cool with the fading at week 5.</li>
            <li> Well, what use is a good product if no one can actually buy it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t stain as much, it&#x27;d be 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t keeps its bright color for more then 2 weeks and it turns EVERYTHING purple so be prepared for it to look like you killed a purple dinosar</li>
            <li> However, once I became pregnant, I was determined to abstain from all unnatural chemicals - including hair dye - while pregnant and into breast feeding and so on in order to minimize exposure for my child.</li>
            <li> The atrocities you have committed against my tub are of a sort most foul and likely to lose most people their security deposits.  </li>
            <li> It fades to a nice pink magenta color after many washes.</li>
            <li> Deffinitely the most vibrant and</li>
            <li> It has had great staying power, and really the only problem I&#x27;ve had is the staining.</li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> i really loved the color, it lasted forever, but if you don&#x27;t want it for a long time/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confident that it will not be fading to any kind of undesirable color anytime in the near future which is exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I figured I could remove any purple I got on my skin easily with rubbing alcohol just like MP, but I was very wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is in my top 2 favorite (the other being Wildflower which goes Bright Blue &amp;#62; Purple &amp;#62; Lavender &amp;#62; Silver as it washes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apart from that, the color was exactly how it said it would be!</li>
            <li> the colors it&#x27;s fading to are still really really pretty!</li>
            <li> so* little of the pigment is required to achieve an awesome lighter shade, that I could conceivably sustain this process for over a year.</li>
            <li> The color is great and it is very dark, like i wanted</li>
            <li> They LAST and the color is amazing.     </li>
            <li> Nice deep purple.</li>
            <li> I had used Manic Panic for the blue and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with its fadibility, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident that I can use one of those natural hair lighteners that I purchased at Wal-greens to take it out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> 5 seconds out of your day to squirt the tub is a small price to pay for beautifully colored hair that lasts</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite shade of purple.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It sets right on top of my natural hair color without having to bleach it.  </li>
            <li> I love the rich purple color, but it does not last longer than a week</li>
            <li> :) No other cons here!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY of Special Effects brand&#x27;s various shades of hair dye</li>
            <li> Be ready to clean the tub after every rinse -- it bleeds like hell.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about veggie dyes is that they actually improve your hair&#x27;s condition, and the longer you leave it in, not only the deeper does the color get, but also the better it will condition your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get numerous compliments on my hair (the roots are also bright pink), and so many compliments on this shade of purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color was super vibrant but when it fades which happened pretty quickly for me(I workout a lot</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich color in a dark red purple and</li>
            <li> Our cleaning products are natural, BTW, nothing insanely strong or anything.</li>
            <li> When it finally did began to fade, it turned into a pretty pastel purple that was honestly just as nice as the deep, vivid purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very, very purple.</li>
            <li> On bleached hair the color is amazing and stays longer than any of the other fun colored dyes.</li>
            <li> The *best* results are probably found with bleaching your hair first, but I had just dyed my hair normally (with a reddish brown dye, I think) previous to using this, and the results were gorgeous - a very deep, almost black purple.</li>
            <li> Most of them fade very quickly, but not Special Effects.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair turned out exactly how she wanted it.</li>
            <li> their colour selection is stellar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing to be aware of: this color will STAIN.</li>
            <li> I think it started fading maybe 5 months after I first used it.</li>
            <li> I had to use a dye first,</li>
            <li> my FAVORITE combination is Deep Purple with Wildflower!!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve stained your clothes or most likely...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve stained your clothes or most likely...</li>
            <li> The exact color of purple I was looking for.</li>
            <li> In my small bathroom I magically get dye on the porcelain sink (under the towel), the laminate tile (around the towels), and, magically, on the wall (no towel there).</li>
            <li> I then but a hair band around the top of the bag and left it for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I left the rest of my hair on top of my head in a clip.</li>
            <li> the first five or so times you wash your hair after dying.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not bleach my hair.</li>
            <li> I did bleach my hair first and the parts that were the whitest were the darkest and some of the yellowy parts stayed brighter.  </li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> Most of it has come out easily enough in the wash, but if you don&#x27;t want any staining at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Being my first time using it, I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to leave it on, so I figured half an hour would be good.</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;ll have to redye my hair more often, but at least I&#x27;ll be able to ACTUALLY GET THE DYE TO DO SO.</li>
            <li> It comes with way more dye than you need, even if your hair is pretty long.</li>
            <li> I wish Special Effects offered turquoise but as far as I know, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> At most, if you overkill like I do and have really long hair, will use 3/4 of a bottle.</li>
            <li> Yes, I didn&#x27;t get the color as far up my hair as my colorist does but looks cool.</li>
            <li> dark brown hair bleached once) came out a really nice darkish shade of purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did it for 45 minutes the second time, and it was much more vibrant.</li>
            <li> i would say the life span is at least a month or more, and when it fades, it just gets more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> but I certainly hope they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, it produces a deep purple color using very little, and fades to a gorgeous lilac color.  </li>
            <li> The new batch or most recent bottles</li>
            <li> I thank the lord that I had the foresight to purchase black sheets before applying this most powerful concoction to my head.  </li>
            <li> If you take the proper precautions you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I love how long special effects colors last.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re over having to dye your hair every few weeks to maintain amazing color, GET.  </li>
            <li> My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple.</li>
            <li> Haha.  </li>
            <li> My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple.</li>
            <li> but it faded fast (three weeks)</li>
            <li> if you run your fingers through your hair to much your fingers will turn purple.</li>
            <li> absolutely worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the drippings from my hair were enough to stain my (light gray)</li>
            <li> If you *really* don&#x27;t want to risk staining, line everything with newspapers and/or plastic bags, and wear clothes you don&#x27;t mind getting stained.</li>
            <li> One reason I really like diluting it with conditioner is because I like the way it looks when it&#x27;s washed out a week or so.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve dyed your hair with the dye straight and didn&#x27;t dilute it, you can strip the color with Head and Shoulders or another dandruff brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , yesterday I took the plunge with this product after much consternation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For staying power, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Also was very well packed, with the lid taped shut, the whole thing wrapped in newspaper, and sealed in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> so I kind of have to wash my hair almost everyday)</li>
            <li> really* see the purple, but even in normal indoor lighting it was pretty obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, other than your roots, You really don&#x27;t have to dye it very often.</li>
            <li> I have an underlayer of Special Effects Wild Flower and Deep Purple, with the top layer of hair turquoise shading to cobalt blue.</li>
            <li> Most other products I would have to touch up the color every week to two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Color is vibrant and lasts and it didn&#x27;t bleed like most other colors.</li>
            <li> Special effects seems to NOT be in production currently...</li>
            <li> Special effects seems to NOT be in production currently...</li>
            <li> if you are only dying certain parts of your hair, make sure you separate your regular hair and the hair</li>
            <li> Also, this seller was extremely fast with shipping, and I will definitely buy more from them in the future!</li>
            <li> I love the color and it last pretty long.  </li>
            <li> I love this color, it came out dark</li>
            <li> The underside of my hair is still that darkish purple color with the slightly lighter faded stuff on top</li>
            <li> All the washings necessary to get rid of the greasy feeling (of course) caused the color to fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li> decent color.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have the nightmare mess as other people have experienced.</li>
            <li> Keep it damp by putting your gloved hands under the sink for a quick second and pat on and into your hair, even cover with a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;Comb</li>
            <li> It fades to a really nice bubblegum pink after about 3 months of constant washing, but it keeps the purple color fairly vibrantly for about 2-3 months depending upon the frequency of your hair washing.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed my hair in the kitchen sink using the sprayer and then used the hair dryer on high.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first.</li>
            <li> After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first.</li>
            <li> This brand works far better than any other semi permanent pigment out there.  </li>
            <li> If you want a hair dye that lasts for an EXTREMELY long time and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical death, than I HIGHLY recommend using Special Effects.</li>
            <li> this is the BEST hair color out there, Splat isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I have tried a few hair dyes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse that they figure they can get away with it because they make a good product.</li>
            <li> I never expected a semi-permanent hair dye to last half a year and still look so gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that this products STAINS EVERYTHING, and not just right after you color, but for a couple of weeks afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much echoing other reviewers here, but Special Effects is the ONLY brand of \\&quot;non-natural\\&quot; hair colors you should ever buy.</li>
            <li> it looked like a brand new dye job until about april, when it started to fade.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s vibrant and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Other colors just aren&#x27;t as bright or long lasting.</li>
            <li> it does lighten to a Virgin Rose colored pink... but never truly goes back to blonde on</li>
            <li> with that being said, it actually looks really pretty.</li>
            <li> My hair color was light brown with dark roots.    </li>
            <li> :) No other cons here!ep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first.</li>
            <li> As it fades, the black disappears and gives way to a true purple, which is vibrant for weeks.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it out made a huge mess and stained my body purple.</li>
            <li> The products in my hair right now are Special Effects Deep Purple and Fishbowl as well as Punky Colour Apple Green.</li>
            <li> I used a little bit of sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> is purple, my cell phone is died, all my shirts had purple on them, i would wake up and parts of my  face where my hair was touching was purple, my hands still turn purple every time i style my hair and even my white cat was a little purple from snuggling me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, and the product arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;d have to say that this one is by far the strongest.</li>
            <li> I used this dye over my natural medium-brown hair, unbleached.</li>
            <li> After swimming (and washing) 3 times a week, it is beginning to show undertones of my natural brown color, but retains the purple.</li>
            <li> I already get the bottom layer of my hair done professionally in a purple anyway</li>
            <li> have naturally light blonde hair that comes to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> This stuff literally can touch something for just a split second and stain it that fast.</li>
            <li> so it looks &#x27;natural&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> I have an old enamel tub</li>
            <li> This dye is really stubborn which is why I only have to touch it up every two months or so,  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, and required very little processing time.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way for sure.</li>
            <li> but this was excessive and more trouble than it was worth.   </li>
            <li> it will even stain your hands when you are styling your hair, I can&#x27;t even blow dry without purplely stained hands...be prepared for the mess :)</li>
            <li> When you wash with shampoo you might want to wear gloves the first few times because it rinses out quite a bit (but doesn&#x27;t fade the color really).</li>
            <li> I will try other colors, but in the end I adore the quality of Special Effects and plan on buying my next bottle from Fatal Impact, no doubt!</li>
            <li> It made a huge mess in my shower, &amp; I came out with a purple face, ears, back, legs &amp; feet.</li>
            <li> - Part of my face was stained purple the next day but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap removed most of it immediately and the rest, which was hardly noticeable, disappeared within a day or two.</li>

            <li> (I will shower and wet it down, letting the build of oil disperse to my roots for natural conditioning) to keep the color strong.</li>
            <li> ; I would not reccommend wearing any white or light colors when using this product, as I ruined quite a few shirts.</li>
            <li> I mixed 1/4 of the bottle with three times as much conditioner, then applied and left in hair for an hour before rinsing.</li>
            <li> MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;It stayed a vivid deep purple for a whopping 6 months.</li>
            <li> Color fades with each shampoo, but only the blue washes out, leaving your hair a true pink after about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> It has been a month since I put it on my hair, and it has barely faded at all.  </li>
            <li> (I do have a white pillow case and Wildflower completely came out).</li>
            <li> (I do have a white pillow case and Wildflower completely came out).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a product like this before be forewarned that you definitely need to wear gloves and old clothes when dying since the color will stain hands and clothing.</li>
            <li> My salon has been ordering a purple that has too much of the red tones and not enough of the blue tones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only washed it twice so far</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this color to anyone who wants a dark, truly deep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first.</li>
            <li> One part Deep Purple with One or less parts of Wildflower with 5-6 parts conditioner makes more blue tones in the Deep Purple while still leaving the pink highlights in the sun.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> you, its grown out and now faded to pink, really light pink on some spots, but that goes to show how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Unprocessed hair will have a closed hair shaft, which means the color may coat the hair, but won&#x27;t last as long because the color will be easily washed</li>
            <li> This comes out as a very dark purple, almost black when you first apply it to platinum hair and gradually washes out to a rich purple with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> Lasts seemingly forever on previously chemically treated hair, will cover any color, although will most likely only tint actual black hair, and initially shows up just as well on hair which is not previously chemically treated.</li>

            <li> /tub because it stains in there pretty heavily too.</li>
            <li> cover everything in plastic and use gloves the first few times you do anything.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not available in any store I&#x27;m aware of around here, I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear white for the first few days, especially if you&#x27;re going to be working out or in the yard, working up a sweat..</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this and will not go back to using any other brand for color.</li>
            <li> My sheets are black, so I don&#x27;t care there, and I found a product to get it off my skin with barely any effort, so that&#x27;s cool, but my clothes do get a little stained.</li>
            <li> However, I cannot promise that it will last quite as long on hair which is not chemically treated in any way prior to using it as my natural roots have faded back to brown by now.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The bleach I use is 7th Stage by clairol which seems to be the only bleach that will lift my Japanese Black hair without damaging it too much.</li>
            <li> but after a few washes you can hardly tell and i was able to get it off my closes (it says it it permanent on fabrics) with soak in Oxiclean, but it got every where.</li>
            <li> Deep purple goes hot pink in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love Special Effects and have used them for a while, but none of them have stained as bad as this one!</li>
            <li> only four stars because of the packaging and because the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair had been dyed a natural shade of reddish-brown and that portion of my hair is still entirely a quite dark shade of purple.</li>

            <li> The deep purple doesn&#x27;t last long, but I sitll recomend the dye if you don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> use hot water unless you want to see your luscious color rinse down your body and down the drain.</li>
            <li> and s half on dark brown hair (that wasn&#x27;t bleached first).</li>
            <li> My natural color is a fairly dark brown.</li>
            <li> My natural color is a fairly dark brown.</li>
            <li> On a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I left it in &amp;#34;as long as possible,&amp;#34; about three hours.</li>
            <li> The color last a long time</li>
            <li> Vaseline is your friend and put it EVERYWHERE especially if you have long hair that can flip around, leaving</li>
            <li> , I recommend keeping the color in as long as possible.</li>
            <li> When rinsing it stays on your scalp really well so scrub extra hard in your scalp(you won&#x27;t get it all)  </li>
            <li> Using a blow-dryer to dry your hair after shampoo will, again, help to open up the hair</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t faded near as much as previous products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but it surprised me to see the slightly faded spots just after dying.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> Attached is a picture of the purple shortly after dying (with the braid and plaid shirt) and one taken yesterday (picture with pink hair clip, taken over three weeks after dying with regular shampooing).</li>
            <li> I could under stand the first few days especially if my hair was wet for it to spread to other things but even dry</li>
            <li> And the only brand that lasts for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I also recommend using old towels to dry your hair with, at least for the first few shampoos, because it will continue to bleed when it&#x27;s washed.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair feeling dull and not it&#x27;s normal softness.</li>
            <li> i would only use this dye if you are prepared to have it in for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> while it may not last as long, at least I have normal colored nails now.</li>
            <li> Color lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time, even from shampooing every day.  </li>
            <li> Leave the dye in as long as you like - 15 to 30 minutes like the package says, or longer if you desire.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll want to stay purple, but for now I&#x27;m having a blast with it.</li>
            <li> Everyone thought that I actually re-dyed my hair pink, but that&#x27;s just how this dye looks when it fades.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair purple for a long, long time, this is the dye for you!</li>
            <li> If you want your hair purple for a long, long time, this is the dye for you!</li>
            <li> Naturally black hair will attain a very dark purple sheen to it but any other shade of hair color ought to come out full on dark eggplant purple.</li>

            <li> How long it lasts depends on method of dying your hair, your water hardness, water temperature, your shampoo/condition, how you dry your hair, and how often you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, so that&#x27;s not necessary for me.</li>
            <li> Lasts so long!</li>
            <li> i rinsed it countless times, shampood it, and even shampooed with dawn soap which sort of helped to stop the bleeding to the other parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> My purple lasted a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;To avoid staining your pillow case, try to go to bed with your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> cause it doesnt dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Blow Dry.</li>
            <li> I diluted it with conditioner since I didn&#x27;t want it extremely dark and only ended up using about 3/4 of one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In the shade, the purple can look blue purple, but in the sun there is streaks of pink!!</li>
            <li> Another reason is that it made my hair dry from the ends!</li>
            <li> Previous processing makes your hair porous, ie opens up the hair shaft to allow the color to sink deeply into the hair.</li>
            <li> Color will come out every time you get your head wet so avoid rain and use a trashy towel to dry your head after bathing.</li>
            <li> I put on the dye and then placed a shower cap over my head and left the dye on for half an hour.</li>
            <li> word of warning: if you are not absolutely certain you want purple hair - and will want it for a LONG time - do NOT use this dye!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with colors and adding Atomic Pink 1 part with Deep Purple 1 part/or less and 5-6 parts conditioner, looks a lot like Virgin Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair, bleached to blonde, and even with such a small amount of dye in ratio to conditioner, it came out a really dark purple.</li>
            <li> All of the other places I highlighted ate back to dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> &quot; it was (though, on my blonde hair, it wasn&#x27;t quite as dark as I was hoping!)</li>
            <li> this color has stained your bathroom, you can use 1 part dawn dish soap with 3 parts white vinegar and a little scrubbing should take out the stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of the other reviews mentioned how everything your hair wet or dry touches turns purple; all my pillows and covers have purple, the phones i use at work are purple, the head rest in my car</li>
            <li> i had it over pink hair and the color came out well</li>
            <li> Be warned--it&#x27;s a tad messy, and will turn your shower/shower curtain Barney-purple (use lots of bleach to remove; I simply bought another $2 shower curtain).</li>
            <li> The blue tended to fade to green, which wasn&#x27;t my desire, so I decided to switch to purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fades out pink.</li>
            <li> Overall I gave it three stars because of all the trouble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and my hair is pastel pink.</li>
            <li> Anyway, It&#x27;s also not very damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> i was hoping that it would fade to lighter and lighter purple but it faded to pink which i kind of hate.....</li>
            <li> A bit of this mixed into your conditioner will produce the same results, just remember that a very small amount goes a very long way!  </li>
            <li> Definitely wear gloves while applying the color of course and one other thing to note is that even after washing my hair a few times, if I&#x27;d run my hands through my hair, my fingers would turn purple.</li>
            <li> The colors are always good and usually fade slow, washing your hair with cold water will help the color stay longer.</li>
            <li> The main reason I gave it up was because Igot tired of the work required to touch up my roots.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a little while before writing this review so that I could evaluate how long the color lasts.</li>
            <li> dont care if your hair fades to pink, then i don&#x27;t reccommend it!</li>
            <li> I had tried some other brands, like Manic Panic, and they do not even come close to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I did read some of the other comments before buying and they mentioned that is was a little messy (which is a big understatement) and did stain a lot.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on it, and I was honestly shocked because people have never really said anything to me about my hair before, being just a plain brown.    </li>
            <li> I recommend being very careful with it, however, and bearing in mind that it takes some time to stop rubbing off onto things.</li>
            <li> Anyway... my point is, be very careful.</li>
            <li> there was a little bleeding onto my other hair when wet</li>
            <li> I had tried at least 4 other hair color brands before ordering this one, and this is the ONLY one that has worked.</li>
            <li> I have really dark brown hair, so dark that it looks black when wet.</li>
            <li> It might be a little bit rough on your hair, depending on your hair type and how damaged it is to begin with, but the texture improves over time while the color remains.</li>

            <li> The color is impossible to clean off of surfaces or out of towels if you accidentally splash or splatter (which I knew going in, so that doesn&#x27;t play into this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Generally when I use hair dye it has a nasty chemical smell and I&#x27;m holding my breath most of the time, but this stuff?</li>
            <li> Sadly mine has faded fast</li>
            <li> I get at least one compliment every day on my hair, from when it was deep purple to it</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so I usually mix it with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I dyed the bottom half of my bleached hair with this dye at the end of january, it is now august</li>
            <li> so the dye typically sits on whatever 1-2 hours</li>
            <li> I would imagine that if you did not dilute it, it will come out almost black.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the mess etc etc.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles since I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> your pillowcase, you can use 1 part dawn and 3 parts hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and soak the item (or scrub with a nail brush or other small brush) and it will drastically LIGHTEN the stain...</li>

            <li> the dye is washed out or diluted, there are PINK highlights!!!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review approximately three weeks after dyeing my hair in the Deep Purple SFX shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extreemly messy.</li>
            <li> So staining of the bathroom was not a huge issue for me, as I&#x27;d worried it might be.</li>
            <li> Other purple dyes I have tried faded out to dull pinkish burgundy.</li>
            <li> Tried other common brands and nothing even comes close.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 because when you wash your hair, it leaves a mess!</li>
            <li> it will bleed and color other hair purple that you didn&#x27;t mean to dye.</li>
            <li> It does stain the tub pretty bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a runny liquid, its very thick.  </li>
            <li> I have tried manic panic (waste of money!).  </li>
            <li> I would say that the color is identical in my hair to the circle in this small photo provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that the color is identical in my hair to the circle in this small photo provided.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why, but if you find the color you like STOCK UP</li>
            <li> I usually use Manic Panic but wanted to try this brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten wash out really fast :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately (but not unexpectedly)</li>
            <li> and it has hardly begun to fade at all.</li>
            <li> my hair can still shine like it&#x27;s metallic (doesn&#x27;t dull your hair).</li>
            <li> My hair, unfortunately, was already chemically treated and I knew that it would only look worse over time</li>
            <li> and it had not faded in the least.</li>
            <li> It does slowly fade but it fades evenly so the color still looks intentional and not spotty.  </li>
            <li> Put something on your skin to protect it from being dyed because it WILL HEAVILY STAIN YOUR SKIN!!</li>
            <li> and i mean everywhere.</li>
            <li> a month later it is just as bad.  </li>
            <li> Oh and buy a few bottles because this color is sometimes difficult to find.</li>
            <li> hair gradually turns pink, but not an ugly shade.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> But alas, it is not just my hair that is purple.  </li>
            <li> Alas, I must take away one star for finding random purple stains on all I hold dear.    </li>
            <li> It washed off easily enough, but it made me extremely fearful to be caught in the rain without an umbrella (which I thankfully never was).</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but if you find the color you like STOCK UP NOW!!!</li>
            <li> My shower curtain liner still has a faint purple tinge to it that will probably never be removed.</li>
            <li> Rinsing the color afterward is difficult.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about using it</li>
            <li> also, like all the other reviews say, THE DYE GETS EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> my hair has been color treated a lot before this so that also might be why its almost impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> Never in my years of semi-permanent shenanigans have I used a dye that stained this badly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed:((</li>
            <li> My daughter was so disappointed in this dye.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love how long special effects colors last.  I can get them to look good for about 2 months by using sulfate free shampoo (it&#x27;s the key for keeping bright colors)  Other colors just aren&#x27;t as bright or long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love this color! I have tried manic panic (waste of money!).  This is fantastic, it produces a deep purple color using very little, and fades to a gorgeous lilac color.  And if you are an ash blond using those purple shampoos and conditioners, quit wasting your money.  A bit of this mixed into your conditioner will produce the same results, just remember that a very small amount goes a very long way!  It&#x27;s not really a runny liquid, its very thick.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair turned out exactly how she wanted it. Color lasts a long time. It fades to an awesome electric purple. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The only color of this type I will even use. My hairstylist orders it in for me as well. Lasts 3-6 week. Excellent product. Love this shade as well. Great color for winter.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY of Special Effects brand&#x27;s various shades of hair dye and I think I&#x27;d have to say that this one is by far the strongest. I recommend being very careful with it, however, and bearing in mind that it takes some time to stop rubbing off onto things. That&#x27;s the only con I would apply to it. It will stain EVERYTHING and ANYTHING that it touches, it seems, which is a side-effect of how strong the dye is. For me, it was absolutely worth it as we have cleaning products that were able to remove it from the sink, walls, etc. where I may have accidentally splashed purple water or what have you. Our cleaning products are natural, BTW, nothing insanely strong or anything. That all being said, I am extremely pleased with the color and resilience of this dye. For many years now I have bleached my hair and dyed it wonderful, bright colors and frequently. However, once I became pregnant, I was determined to abstain from all unnatural chemicals - including hair dye - while pregnant and into breast feeding and so on in order to minimize exposure for my child. My hair, unfortunately, was already chemically treated and I knew that it would only look worse over time so I decided to try and use this dye to color it in the hopes that it would last throughout pregnancy - perhaps even somewhat permanently...? Well, my wish was granted! Oh boy, was it ever. I only had to use it one time and even after rinsing and shampooing it THREE TIMES in a row immediately after rinsing, the water was still rinsing purple and it had not faded in the least. It&#x27;s been many weeks now since I dyed it and it has hardly begun to fade at all. It&#x27;s still very dark and looks awesome. I&#x27;m very confident that it will not be fading to any kind of undesirable color anytime in the near future which is exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for. :) As a plus, it looks great with my natural brown hair which is growing in - another thing I was hoping for. I highly recommend this color to anyone who wants a dark, truly deep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first. After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first. Naturally black hair will attain a very dark purple sheen to it but any other shade of hair color ought to come out full on dark eggplant purple. My natural color is a fairly dark brown. However, I cannot promise that it will last quite as long on hair which is not chemically treated in any way prior to using it as my natural roots have faded back to brown by now. The rest of my hair had been dyed a natural shade of reddish-brown and that portion of my hair is still entirely a quite dark shade of purple. I would say that the color is identical in my hair to the circle in this small photo provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To re-cap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Works like a dream! Lasts seemingly forever on previously chemically treated hair, will cover any color, although will most likely only tint actual black hair, and initially shows up just as well on hair which is not previously chemically treated. I believe that it will NOT fade to any undesirable shades! Possibly ever. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Part of my face was stained purple the next day but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap removed most of it immediately and the rest, which was hardly noticeable, disappeared within a day or two. My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple. :P (Everything else which came into contact with it and was stained has been cleaned successfully) It might be a little bit rough on your hair, depending on your hair type and how damaged it is to begin with, but the texture improves over time while the color remains. My hair feels fine now. :) No other cons here!ep purple that will last a very long time and especially if you do not want to lighten or otherwise chemically treat your hair first. After many years of experience dying hair with various products as well as various shades of this particular brand, I can say with confidence that this color will come out loud and clear on hair that is not chemically treated first. Naturally black hair will attain a very dark purple sheen to it but any other shade of hair color ought to come out full on dark eggplant purple. My natural color is a fairly dark brown. However, I cannot promise that it will last quite as long on hair which is not chemically treated in any way prior to using it as my natural roots have faded back to brown by now. The rest of my hair had been dyed a natural shade of reddish-brown and that portion of my hair is still entirely a quite dark shade of purple. I would say that the color is identical in my hair to the circle in this small photo provided.  To re-cap:  Pros - Works like a dream! Lasts seemingly forever on previously chemically treated hair, will cover any color, although will most likely only tint actual black hair, and initially shows up just as well on hair which is not previously chemically treated. I believe that it will NOT fade to any undesirable shades! Possibly ever. Haha.  Cons - Part of my face was stained purple the next day but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap removed most of it immediately and the rest, which was hardly noticeable, disappeared within a day or two. My pillow case, which began as white, and my towel, which began as light purple, are still tinted purple. :P (Everything else which came into contact with it and was stained has been cleaned successfully) It might be a little bit rough on your hair, depending on your hair type and how damaged it is to begin with, but the texture improves over time while the color remains.

            <li> I have read many great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out for myself. Unforunately, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results. I followed the directions included, and it made my hair feel greasy, even after several washings. All the washings necessary to get rid of the greasy feeling (of course) caused the color to fade rather quickly. Despite all of that, the color is really pretty, and it looks very good on brown hair.   My biggest problem with this product was all of the things it dyed in addition to my hair. It&#x27;s VERY messy.  Even though I loved the color, I probably will not use this product ever again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of semi permanent color, but this is by FAR the best.  It has been a month since I put it on my hair, and it has barely faded at all.  Also, this seller was extremely fast with shipping, and I will definitely buy more from them in the future!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:38620481]]This is a video I made explaining my likes and dislikes about Deep Purple.  The products in my hair right now are Special Effects Deep Purple and Fishbowl as well as Punky Colour Apple Green.</li>
            <li> I had tried at least 4 other hair color brands before ordering this one, and this is the ONLY one that has worked. Even after weeks of shampooing, the color still looks as though I&#x27;ve just dyed it. The only disadvantage is that this products STAINS EVERYTHING, and not just right after you color, but for a couple of weeks afterwards. It still stained my skin in the shower a good 2 weeks after dying my hair, and it REALLY stained my clothes for awhile also; I would not reccommend wearing any white or light colors when using this product, as I ruined quite a few shirts.</li>
            <li> good color but it stains EVERYTHING.. i had it over pink hair and the color came out well but it faded fast (three weeks) after that i bleached my hair and apply it and the color came out well.. its been 3 weeks and its not faded yet.</li>
            <li> After losing a bet, I had to dye my hair purple. I found this dye and liked how \\&quot;dark\\&quot; it was (though, on my blonde hair, it wasn&#x27;t quite as dark as I was hoping!) so decided to purchase it. Be warned--it&#x27;s a tad messy, and will turn your shower/shower curtain Barney-purple (use lots of bleach to remove; I simply bought another $2 shower curtain). After one week, the color has significantly faded (which is fine by me!) but is still obviously present. I shampoo every morning and use hair gel to get a darker look. Overall, very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have really dark brown hair, so dark that it looks black when wet. My hair stylist cleansed my hair to lighten it twice and then bleached it and then applied this color. Let me also tell you guys that we tried multiple purple colors from the beauty stores and my hair wouldn&#x27;t take any of them, it was like we hadn&#x27;t put any dye on at all so I searched for products and I found this. Put something on your skin to protect it from being dyed because it WILL HEAVILY STAIN YOUR SKIN!! Also wear gloves, even for those that think they will be fine without gloves. When rinsing it stays on your scalp really well so scrub extra hard in your scalp(you won&#x27;t get it all)  if you run your fingers through your hair to much your fingers will turn purple. Make sure you buy a bottle of bleach for your shower/tub because it stains in there pretty heavily too. Color was super vibrant but when it fades which happened pretty quickly for me(I workout a lot so I kind of have to wash my hair almost everyday) it fades to a very bright hot pink. If you have the time to maintain this color then it&#x27;s very very beautiful and didn&#x27;t do much damage to my hair. Oh and buy a few bottles because this color is sometimes difficult to find.</li>
            <li> This is the best purple dye on the planet. On bleached hair the color is amazing and stays longer than any of the other fun colored dyes. My only warning is that the purple does stain everything it touches so wear gloves and cover the counter with plastic. When you wash with shampoo you might want to wear gloves the first few times because it rinses out quite a bit (but doesn&#x27;t fade the color really). Amazing dye, this is the stuff to use if you want colorful hair.</li>
            <li> I used this dye over my natural medium-brown hair, unbleached. On a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I left it in &amp;#34;as long as possible,&amp;#34; about three hours. It turned my hair an almost-black eggplant color. As it fades, the black disappears and gives way to a true purple, which is vibrant for weeks. After swimming (and washing) 3 times a week, it is beginning to show undertones of my natural brown color, but retains the purple. It looks like I have &amp;#34;naturally purple&amp;#34; hair. Other purple dyes I have tried faded out to dull pinkish burgundy. If one is to judge a dye by how good it looks when it fades, SE is 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once mixed the dye with some conditioner in a 1:4 ratio to &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; the color and cover my roots -- it absolutely worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise: This dye is STRONG. cover everything in plastic and use gloves the first few times you do anything. purple hands all day every day. Be ready to clean the tub after every rinse -- it bleeds like hell. I took a liking to swimming two days after I dye and it takes most of the &amp;#34;bleeding everywhere&amp;#34; edge off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached photo is after a week of rinsing daily and washing twice.</li>
            <li> decent color.  lasts a long time, even from shampooing every day.  i would say the life span is at least a month or more, and when it fades, it just gets more vibrant.  only four stars because of the packaging and because the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> Nice deep purple. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had purple hair for around 5 years now and I&#x27;ve used almost every popular shade from every popular brand. Never in my years of semi-permanent shenanigans have I used a dye that stained this badly. It&#x27;s been over three weeks and still my nails are dyed from touching my hair. Yesterday I got a haircut and it stained my stylist&#x27;s hands purple. It *still* comes out in the shower, and I don&#x27;t even want to know what would happen if I slept with light pillow covers! Just the drippings from my hair were enough to stain my (light gray) bathmat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Effects is always the best for longevity and their colour selection is stellar. Attached is a picture of the purple shortly after dying (with the braid and plaid shirt) and one taken yesterday (picture with pink hair clip, taken over three weeks after dying with regular shampooing). This purple STICKS. It&#x27;s a beautiful shade, too. The only issue is that I don&#x27;t want to dye all my friends, family, and possessions purple.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you about this amazing hair dye. I did not order it from Amazon and I used it years ago, but this is how I fell in love with Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number one, it smells like grapes. Generally when I use hair dye it has a nasty chemical smell and I&#x27;m holding my breath most of the time, but this stuff? Nope. It was a heavenly grape smell and I actually didn&#x27;t want to stop smelling it. My hair came out a gorgeous shade of dark purple, but the best part?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT LASTED 6 MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;It stayed a vivid deep purple for a whopping 6 months. I never expected a semi-permanent hair dye to last half a year and still look so gorgeous. When it finally did began to fade, it turned into a pretty pastel purple that was honestly just as nice as the deep, vivid purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was also...probably 6 or 7 years ago. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed the formula or not - but I certainly hope they didn&#x27;t. If you want a hair dye that lasts for an EXTREMELY long time and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical death, than I HIGHLY recommend using Special Effects.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few hair dyes and this is my favorite. It works best if you bleach your hair first and leave it on a lil bit longer than the directions say. You definitely have to wear clothes you don care about an cover up as much as possible cuz it will stain almost instantly. The colors are always good and usually fade slow, washing your hair with cold water will help the color stay longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product towards the end of 2009, after a short stint of dyeing my hair blue. The blue tended to fade to green, which wasn&#x27;t my desire, so I decided to switch to purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read many good things about the staying power of Special Effects. I had used Manic Panic for the blue and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with its fadibility, so I decided to give it a shot. Since it&#x27;s not available in any store I&#x27;m aware of around here, I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had already been processed by the time I used the dye. Note that this is extremely important: if your hair hasn&#x27;t had any kind of processing - no previous dyeing or bleaching - your hair will not hold onto this color well. That&#x27;s the nature of vegetable dyes like this. They are color-depositing, basically like a stain. Previous processing makes your hair porous, ie opens up the hair shaft to allow the color to sink deeply into the hair. Unprocessed hair will have a closed hair shaft, which means the color may coat the hair, but won&#x27;t last as long because the color will be easily washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to be aware of: this color will STAIN. Everything. It&#x27;ll stain anything it touches, including clothes, the sink, the shower, the tub, the floor - you get the picture. If you&#x27;re lucky, you may be able to lift the stain(s) somewhat with a product containing bleach. My shower curtain liner still has a faint purple tinge to it that will probably never be removed. There goes my chances of hosting a presidential sleepover. Anyway... my point is, be very careful. If you *really* don&#x27;t want to risk staining, line everything with newspapers and/or plastic bags, and wear clothes you don&#x27;t mind getting stained. I have special \\&quot;coloring shirts\\&quot; just for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: WEAR GLOVES. Remember the staining bit? That goes for your skin as well. Your hands will turn purple if you try to use this without gloves, and it&#x27;ll last for a while. You may also want to put some nail polish on your fingernails too - it&#x27;ll save your nails from developing purple streaks. A lot of people suggest petroleum jelly around your hairline and on your ears, which is a good idea. I have extremely oily skin, so that&#x27;s not necessary for me. I do sometimes use petroleum jelly on my ears, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you apply the dye, you&#x27;ll want to wash your hair and *not* apply conditioner. This, again, helps make your hair as porous as possible. A good clarifying shampoo or anti-dandruff shampoo works really well for this purpose. Using a blow-dryer to dry your hair after shampoo will, again, help to open up the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to wrap your hair in plastic wrap, a plastic bag or a shower cap after you dye, to help hold in heat and help the color penetrate more. Leave the dye in as long as you like - 15 to 30 minutes like the package says, or longer if you desire. The nice thing about veggie dyes is that they actually improve your hair&#x27;s condition, and the longer you leave it in, not only the deeper does the color get, but also the better it will condition your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used this dye, I was thrilled with the results. The *best* results are probably found with bleaching your hair first, but I had just dyed my hair normally (with a reddish brown dye, I think) previous to using this, and the results were gorgeous - a very deep, almost black purple. In the sunlight you could *really* see the purple, but even in normal indoor lighting it was pretty obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning: if you are not absolutely certain you want purple hair - and will want it for a LONG time - do NOT use this dye! My purple lasted a very, very long time. We&#x27;re talking months! I think it started fading maybe 5 months after I first used it. I didn&#x27;t baby my hair in any way - I washed it daily, didn&#x27;t always use conditioner, etc. Fortunately I loved my purple and was very happy it lasted so long. The main reason I gave it up was because Igot tired of the work required to touch up my roots. I had to use a dye first, *then* use the Special Effects on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an amazing dye with fantastic staying power. If you want your hair purple for a long, long time, this is the dye for you! Just prepare your hair properly and you will have wonderful results.had to use a dye first, *then* use the Special Effects on top.     All in all, this is an amazing dye with fantastic staying power.

            <li> I did just my tips more like an ombre effect. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because when you wash your hair, it leaves a mess! It stained my shower permanently somea areas. I suggest you wash your hair some place else such as outside. Another reason is that it made my hair dry from the ends! I only left the dye on for 25 mins on unbleached hair. Apart from that, the color was exactly how it said it would be! The color is so beautiful &amp; lasts!</li>
            <li> I want to give you 5 stars, I really really do you magnificent purple dye.  I have searched far and wide for your ilk, a purple that would not fade after just two washes.  And stay you did.  My hair is a glorious violet hue that has survived the abrasions of shampoo through multiple assaults.  Were there nothing else to say, we could leave it here.  But alas, it is not just my hair that is purple.  It is my ears, my fingers (before I started wearing gloves to shampoo) and my neck.  The atrocities you have committed against my tub are of a sort most foul and likely to lose most people their security deposits.  I thank the lord that I had the foresight to purchase black sheets before applying this most powerful concoction to my head.  Alas, I must take away one star for finding random purple stains on all I hold dear.    Tl;dr, Great dye, but it will stain the s*** out of everything else too.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of haircolor and i use it instead of manic panic all the time. Its wonderful and the color is bright and lasts for weeks instead of days like the other brands</li>
            <li> **Update: 3/4/2015 The new batch or most recent bottles I&#x27;ve gotten wash out really fast :( Deep purple goes hot pink in less than 2 weeks. Hoping they fix the formula. Docked a star for now. Still love the color while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so I usually mix it with conditioner. One part hair dye to 3-4 parts conditioner. One reason I really like diluting it with conditioner is because I like the way it looks when it&#x27;s washed out a week or so. By diluting it, I don&#x27;t need to try to strip the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts seemingly FOREVER... it does lighten to a Virgin Rose colored pink... but never truly goes back to blonde on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach I use is 7th Stage by clairol which seems to be the only bleach that will lift my Japanese Black hair without damaging it too much. I use Aphogee 2 minute conditioner to dilute and repair my hair between colorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dye is washed out or diluted, there are PINK highlights!!! In the shade, the purple can look blue purple, but in the sun there is streaks of pink!! Because of the shade range in this color it is in my top 2 favorite (the other being Wildflower which goes Bright Blue &amp;#62; Purple &amp;#62; Lavender &amp;#62; Silver as it washes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with colors and adding Atomic Pink 1 part with Deep Purple 1 part/or less and 5-6 parts conditioner, looks a lot like Virgin Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my FAVORITE combination is Deep Purple with Wildflower!! One part Deep Purple with One or less parts of Wildflower with 5-6 parts conditioner makes more blue tones in the Deep Purple while still leaving the pink highlights in the sun. It probably has to do with my complexion but it has been my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve dyed your hair with the dye straight and didn&#x27;t dilute it, you can strip the color with Head and Shoulders or another dandruff brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this color has stained your bathroom, you can use 1 part dawn dish soap with 3 parts white vinegar and a little scrubbing should take out the stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve stained your clothes or most likely... your pillowcase, you can use 1 part dawn and 3 parts hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and soak the item (or scrub with a nail brush or other small brush) and it will drastically LIGHTEN the stain... I cannot guarantee it will get rid of the stain but it&#x27;s helped save a lot of clothes I accidentally gotten the dye on. (I do have a white pillow case and Wildflower completely came out). &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;To avoid staining your pillow case, try to go to bed with your hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you love Special Effects as much as I do!! Best &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; hair dye in the market!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Special effects seems to NOT be in production currently...

            <li> I get many compliments on my hair. I have an underlayer of Special Effects Wild Flower and Deep Purple, with the top layer of hair turquoise shading to cobalt blue. I wish Special Effects offered turquoise but as far as I know, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of hair dye on the American market. Most of them fade very quickly, but not Special Effects. It was easy to apply, and required very little processing time. Just put it on and let it sit for 10 minutes! The resulting color was very bold, and lasted for over a month before I noticed any color fade. Make sure you use LOTS of petroleum jelly along your hair line, and gloves. Rinse it AWAY from your face, because it stains very quickly. I also recommend using old towels to dry your hair with, at least for the first few shampoos, because it will continue to bleed when it&#x27;s washed.</li>
            <li> Lasts so long! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I usually use Manic Panic but wanted to try this brand. I really, really, should of payed more attention to the comments about the stains. I figured I could remove any purple I got on my skin easily with rubbing alcohol just like MP, but I was very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will stain your skin the moment it touches it. It made a huge mess in my shower, &amp; I came out with a purple face, ears, back, legs &amp; feet. My hands were fine since I wore gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to get must of it off...except my ears. Next time I use this, I will be CAKING myself with petroleum jelly!! MP did not stain skin &amp; the shower like this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks gorgeous though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re over having to dye your hair every few weeks to maintain amazing color, GET.  THIS.  DYE.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to wash out.  Word of warning:  This makes anything that isn&#x27;t gloved, covered, or coated in petroleum jelly purple.  Very, very purple.</li>
            <li> ..but the color rubs off on everything. hair gradually turns pink, but not an ugly shade.&lt;br /&gt;great color. and a little goes a long way for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The exact color of purple I was looking for. If you&#x27;ve never used a product like this before be forewarned that you definitely need to wear gloves and old clothes when dying since the color will stain hands and clothing. If you take the proper precautions you&#x27;ll be fine. I&#x27;ve had it in for about a week and it hasn&#x27;t faded near as much as previous products I&#x27;ve used. I will definitely use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I dyed the bottom half of my bleached hair with this dye at the end of january, it is now august and i still have dye in it!!! mind you, its grown out and now faded to pink, really light pink on some spots, but that goes to show how long it lasts. it looked like a brand new dye job until about april, when it started to fade. i was hoping that it would fade to lighter and lighter purple but it faded to pink which i kind of hate.....but the purple color was dark and gorgeous while it lasted!!!! i would only use this dye if you are prepared to have it in for a long time!!! my hair has been color treated a lot before this so that also might be why its almost impossible to get out. loved the color of this dye. also, like all the other reviews say, THE DYE GETS EVERYWHERE!!!!!!! and i mean everywhere. it will stain everything it touches. if you are only dying certain parts of your hair, make sure you separate your regular hair and the hair w/ dye on it before and during rinsing it. it will bleed and color other hair purple that you didn&#x27;t mean to dye. i rinsed it countless times, shampood it, and even shampooed with dawn soap which sort of helped to stop the bleeding to the other parts of my hair. hope this review helps! i really loved the color, it lasted forever, but if you don&#x27;t want it for a long time/dont care if your hair fades to pink, then i don&#x27;t reccommend it!</li>
            <li> I loved this puprle alot and get complaments on it all the time even after it is fading. The color last a long time and i still have alot of the product left in the bottle after i dyed my hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever! Color is vibrant and lasts and it didn&#x27;t bleed like most other colors. My hairstylist loved it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich color in a dark red purple and my hair can still shine like it&#x27;s metallic (doesn&#x27;t dull your hair). Fades out pink. How long it lasts depends on method of dying your hair, your water hardness, water temperature, your shampoo/condition, how you dry your hair, and how often you wash your hair. Color will come out every time you get your head wet so avoid rain and use a trashy towel to dry your head after bathing. Easy clean up- the only thing it doesn&#x27;t come out of is fabric. In my small bathroom I magically get dye on the porcelain sink (under the towel), the laminate tile (around the towels), and, magically, on the wall (no towel there). It cleans up with acetone like an infomercial, even on the wall (yes, the acetone also removes the wall paint but it counts). I don&#x27;t rush to clean it up so the dye typically sits on whatever 1-2 hours and I still have no issues.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, and the product arrived as expected! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the product itself. I love Special Effects and have used them for a while, but none of them have stained as bad as this one! Purple skin, fingernails, and shower. But its worth it! Gorgeous color. WILL buy again! :)</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the mess etc etc.  I already get the bottom layer of my hair done professionally in a purple anyway but I haven&#x27;t been as happy with the color as I used to be. My salon has been ordering a purple that has too much of the red tones and not enough of the blue tones plus I figured this might save me some money by stretching my color out longer.&lt;br /&gt;Well, yesterday I took the plunge with this product after much consternation.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally light blonde hair that comes to the middle of my back. I squeezed about 1/3 of the bottle into a quart sized freezer zip lock bag, separated my hair into the appropriate sections. I put the bottom layer into the bag with the color in it and squished it all around the hair inside. I then but a hair band around the top of the bag and left it for 30 minutes. I left the rest of my hair on top of my head in a clip. When I rinsed my hair in the kitchen sink using the sprayer and then used the hair dryer on high.....it&#x27;s perfect!!!  Yes, I didn&#x27;t get the color as far up my hair as my colorist does but looks cool. When I washed my hair in the shower it did get everywhere but a spray bottle with bleach water was a simple fix.&lt;br /&gt;I also got a couple of spots of purple where I don&#x27;t want it and there was a little bleeding onto my other hair when wet but I&#x27;m confident that I can use one of those natural hair lighteners that I purchased at Wal-greens to take it out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.....that was the method that I used since I do not want the purple all over my hair,, just on a specific area and I didn&#x27;t have the nightmare mess as other people have experienced.</li>
            <li> I just dyed my hair with this stuff. When people say it stains... they are not joking around. This stuff literally can touch something for just a split second and stain it that fast. You MUST use a really good amount of Vaseline on your hair line, face, neck, ears, anywhere that hair will likely touch and everywhere else that it could touch.&lt;br /&gt;Anywho... I bought 2 bottles since I have long thick hair. I diluted it with conditioner since I didn&#x27;t want it extremely dark and only ended up using about 3/4 of one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The color on bleached hair (it was an auburn color... dark brown hair bleached once) came out a really nice darkish shade of purple.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is where the 4 star instead of 5 star comes in... after rinsing my hair after JUST dying it... there are areas where it looks like it has already faded. I used a little bit of sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. Maybe I didn&#x27;t get enough dye in those areas.. I don&#x27;t know, but it surprised me to see the slightly faded spots just after dying.&lt;br /&gt;BUT with that being said, it actually looks really pretty. The underside of my hair is still that darkish purple color with the slightly lighter faded stuff on top so it looks &#x27;natural&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with the color and the product. I just wish it didn&#x27;t stain so easily. Make sure that whatever workspace you&#x27;re doing this in.. cover everything in plastic.. like a cheap plastic tablecloth or some trashbags... and remember... Vaseline is your friend and put it EVERYWHERE especially if you have long hair that can flip around, leaving a big purple stain smack dab in the middle of your face.</li>
            <li> And why should a granny have white, brown, or blond hair?  Go PURPLE.  It&#x27;s fun and when you look into the mirror first thing in the morning, you have excellent color!!  I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments from every age group.  It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color! It fades to a nice pink magenta color after many washes.</li>
            <li> Best purple hair dye available. Tried other common brands and nothing even comes close. It will stain a bathtub or shower and grout. But it lasts forever and fades beautifully.</li>
            <li> The product arrived timely and safely but they dye it&#x27;s self was not that great. It has left my hair feeling dull and not it&#x27;s normal softness. Rinsing it out made a huge mess and stained my body purple. After a long bath and a good scrubbing I got most of it off but my hands and shower are still coloured. I understand that there is a warning on the bottle but all hair dye products have that and I have experienced staining to some extent but this was excessive and more trouble than it was worth.   Disappointed:((</li>
            <li> I love this hair color it&#x27;s vibrant and makes my hair soft and shiny. The only thing is it got all over my bathroom but it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it last pretty long.  It sets right on top of my natural hair color without having to bleach it.  Tints my hair.  Excellent!  I just bought another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much echoing other reviewers here, but Special Effects is the ONLY brand of \\&quot;non-natural\\&quot; hair colors you should ever buy. They LAST and the color is amazing.     This one is very much purple and fades to a kind of really hot magenta.     I can&#x27;t go out without getting compliments, from all ages and types of people, on my hair.     I try to only wash my hair one-two times a week (I will shower and wet it down, letting the build of oil disperse to my roots for natural conditioning) to keep the color strong. You WILL want gloves the first five or so times you wash your hair after dying. The pigment in this stuff is strong and will dye your hands and nails.     Love this product!</li>
            <li> Deep Purple Special Effects - the color was great - but the color was EVERYWHERE.  for weeks after I colored my purple streak my hair bled purple.  My fingernails were purple, my comb was purple, the back of my ear was purple.  I&#x27;d absentmindedly run my hand back through my hair and come away with purple fingernails.  The color is impossible to clean off of surfaces or out of towels if you accidentally splash or splatter (which I knew going in, so that doesn&#x27;t play into this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Manic Panic after using the SE...while it may not last as long, at least I have normal colored nails now.</li>
            <li> The only brand I trust! And the only brand that lasts for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. I am writing this review approximately three weeks after dyeing my hair in the Deep Purple SFX shade. I wanted to wait a little while before writing this review so that I could evaluate how long the color lasts. First of all, I did not bleach my hair. My hair color was light brown with dark roots.    I put on the dye and then placed a shower cap over my head and left the dye on for half an hour. Being my first time using it, I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to leave it on, so I figured half an hour would be good. Make sure to line the tops of your ears and hair line with Vaseline or else be prepared to have the color get all over your face. Rinsing the color afterward is difficult. It will probably stain your bathtub. I have an old enamel tub and I leaned over the edge and used a handheld sprayer to rinse it, and it left my entire tub looking like I&#x27;d been stomping grapes to make wine. However, spray some mold and mildew remover spray on the color and it disappears like magic!    I had purple bits of hair that would land on the sink later on while I was brushing it and spraying the mold and mildew remover spray on it always removed the color immediately. So staining of the bathroom was not a huge issue for me, as I&#x27;d worried it might be. Definitely wear gloves while applying the color of course and one other thing to note is that even after washing my hair a few times, if I&#x27;d run my hands through my hair, my fingers would turn purple. It washed off easily enough, but it made me extremely fearful to be caught in the rain without an umbrella (which I thankfully never was). Also some color got on my neck and ears the day after I dyed it, which I needed to use a special product made for removing hair dye to get it off of my skin. This was despite having used Vaseline when I dyed it--it was just from my hair lying on my neck and ears and depositing the dye there.    For staying power, this stuff is the real deal. I&#x27;m three weeks in and my hair is still a beautiful purple color. I have gotten so many compliments on it, and I was honestly shocked because people have never really said anything to me about my hair before, being just a plain brown.    I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll want to stay purple, but for now I&#x27;m having a blast with it. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Good holding after several washes.</li>
            <li> This is the best edgy hair color line I have ever used. Deffinitely the most vibrant and and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about using it cause it doesnt dry out my hair. Ive always used clorox spray bleach to get the stain out I don&#x27;t even wipe the tib I just soak it with xlrox and let it sit til it dries do this two or three times and bam youre good. 5 seconds out of your day to squirt the tub is a small price to pay for beautifully colored hair that lasts</li>
            <li> I love this color, it came out dark but I think it&#x27;s because dyed it over my faded purple dye. It looks great though and its been a month and it hasn&#x27;t faded very much at all! :-)</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have \\&quot;tried\\&quot; to dye my hair purple and this is the one that finally stuck....to everything! It&#x27;s extreemly messy. I will admit my hair looks great with the deep purple. BUT oh my god did it make my hair greasy!! I don&#x27;t know if that is the price I can pay for good looking purple hair. I&#x27;ve only washed it twice so far so hopefully the greasy feel will go away. fyi...it will even stain your hands when you are styling your hair, I can&#x27;t even blow dry without purplely stained hands...be prepared for the mess :) Overall I gave it three stars because of all the trouble.</li>
            <li> The color is great and it is very dark, like i wanted, i have also had it for almost a month and it is barley starting to fade.  I did bleach my hair first and the parts that were the whitest were the darkest and some of the yellowy parts stayed brighter.  I did read some of the other comments before buying and they mentioned that is was a little messy (which is a big understatement) and did stain a lot. It does stain the tub pretty bad but after a few washes you can hardly tell and i was able to get it off my closes (it says it it permanent on fabrics) with soak in Oxiclean, but it got every where. None of the other reviews mentioned how everything your hair wet or dry touches turns purple; all my pillows and covers have purple, the phones i use at work are purple, the head rest in my car is purple, my cell phone is died, all my shirts had purple on them, i would wake up and parts of my  face where my hair was touching was purple, my hands still turn purple every time i style my hair and even my white cat was a little purple from snuggling me. I could under stand the first few days especially if my hair was wet for it to spread to other things but even dry a month later it is just as bad.  It would have had five stars if it didnt get EVERYWHERE!!!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t keeps its bright color for more then 2 weeks and it turns EVERYTHING purple so be prepared for it to look like you killed a purple dinosar</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!  Sadly mine has faded fast but I still love it n the colors it&#x27;s fading to are still really really pretty!</li>
            <li> This is the best shade of purple I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair! I&#x27;m never straying away from Special Effects again, all their colors are on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star because it runs FOREVER. Weeks after dying it the water was still purple when I wash it</li>
            <li> This is some potent stuff! Shampoo your hair before dying, but do not condition or color won&#x27;t stuck! I mixed 1/4 of the bottle with three times as much conditioner, then applied and left in hair for an hour before rinsing. I have long, curly hair, bleached to blonde, and even with such a small amount of dye in ratio to conditioner, it came out a really dark purple. I would imagine that if you did not dilute it, it will come out almost black. Color fades with each shampoo, but only the blue washes out, leaving your hair a true pink after about 5 weeks. Everyone thought that I actually re-dyed my hair pink, but that&#x27;s just how this dye looks when it fades. It&#x27;s been a month and my hair is pastel pink. The deep purple doesn&#x27;t last long, but I sitll recomend the dye if you don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s color changing qualities. I get at least one compliment every day on my hair, from when it was deep purple to it now being pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatal Impact shipped it for free, and it arrived in just 3 days! Also was very well packed, with the lid taped shut, the whole thing wrapped in newspaper, and sealed in a zip lock bag. Obviously took a lot of time and care in packing the product. Totally pleased with the seller! I will try other colors, but in the end I adore the quality of Special Effects and plan on buying my next bottle from Fatal Impact, no doubt!</li>
            <li> I loved the color of this dye on my hair, and I think it will last a while. However, be forewarned, it will literally get all over everything. My bathtub is still kind of pinkish-purple, and the bath mat has been dyed purple. Also, some of the purple may come off on pillows and/or sheets.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous plum purple color</li>
            <li> Turned out AWESOME! Stayed super bright for a good 2-3 weeks and it still looks cool with the fading at week 5.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly! I have dark brown hair, after it was bleached and this dye was used, the color was awesome. I had tried some other brands, like Manic Panic, and they do not even come close to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for over a year now and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I haven&#x27;t re-dyed my hair for well over a month and it&#x27;s a hot pink color which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really love this dye! It comes with way more dye than you need, even if your hair is pretty long. At most, if you overkill like I do and have really long hair, will use 3/4 of a bottle. On top of that, other than your roots, You really don&#x27;t have to dye it very often. Once the dye is in, the stays in until you decide you want it out.  I get the best results when I bleach my hair first, though. It gives my hair this amazing glowing quality that is so beautiful! I guess that&#x27;s the &#x27;special effects&#x27; part of it, haha! Anyway, It&#x27;s also not very damaging to your hair. I know there are some dyes that just fry your head. This isn&#x27;t one of them! I am now a faithful user of this dye and won&#x27;t be looking for another!</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich color that lasts and lasts</li>
            <li> Now they keep everything on manufacturer&#x27;s back order. I bought this ages ago and I&#x27;m glad I did, because who would have known that you&#x27;d never be able to buy SFX dye from anywhere, because they keep not getting it out. It&#x27;s extremely unprofessional. It&#x27;s even worse that they figure they can get away with it because they make a good product. Well, what use is a good product if no one can actually buy it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to Manic Panic. Sure, I&#x27;ll have to redye my hair more often, but at least I&#x27;ll be able to ACTUALLY GET THE DYE TO DO SO.</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is by far my favorite shade of purple. It has had great staying power, and really the only problem I&#x27;ve had is the staining. It WILL stain everything. My sheets are black, so I don&#x27;t care there, and I found a product to get it off my skin with barely any effort, so that&#x27;s cool, but my clothes do get a little stained. Most of it has come out easily enough in the wash, but if you don&#x27;t want any staining at all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Ion Brights is a good one that I&#x27;ve used, and I had no staining at all with it, so try that if you don&#x27;t want stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SE deep purple is so beautiful that I&#x27;ll deal with staining. I get numerous compliments on my hair (the roots are also bright pink), and so many compliments on this shade of purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product four stars because of the staining. If it didn&#x27;t stain as much, it&#x27;d be 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so disappointed in this dye. We did her hair and after following the specific directions..it washed out and bled all over my bathroom tub each time she took a shower.  Yes, it stains!  So it lasted aprox. a week...so the only part that stayed purple where the highlights in her hair.  So if you don&#x27;t have blonde hair this product does not work!</li>
            <li> I wanted a mid-to-light purple for my hair, which is bleached. Mixing a miniscule amount of Special Effects Deep Purple into conditioner results in beautiful lighter tones. Unfortunately (but not unexpectedly) this causes the pigment to wash out of my hair faster, requiring re-dyeing once every week or two. I&#x27;ve experimented with different processing times, from 2 hours to overnight, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference in color or permanence.  However, this isn&#x27;t a problem, as *so* little of the pigment is required to achieve an awesome lighter shade, that I could conceivably sustain this process for over a year.</li>
            <li> I love the rich purple color, but it does not last longer than a week and s half on dark brown hair (that wasn&#x27;t bleached first). I put some onto my lighter brown hair, and that has lasted 3 1/2 weeks, so far, but it&#x27;s lightened to a reddish pink. All of the other places I highlighted ate back to dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend keeping the color in as long as possible. I did it for 45 minutes the second time, and it was much more vibrant.</li>
            <li> This dye is really stubborn which is why I only have to touch it up every two months or so,  which is great. As for the &amp;#34;beware it stains like a mo-fo&amp;#34;, i don&#x27;t think so it actually didn&#x27;t stain a bit! It&#x27;s a beautiful color really &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This brand works far better than any other semi permanent pigment out there.  Colors are vibrant and long lasting.  Most other products I would have to touch up the color every week to two weeks.  I can go six weeks without having to do touch ups.  It does slowly fade but it fades evenly so the color still looks intentional and not spotty.  I highly reccomend this and will not go back to using any other brand for color.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;Tips: cleanse your hair with regular shampoo and no conditioner. Blow Dry. Use a baster brush and paint it on. Keep it damp by putting your gloved hands under the sink for a quick second and pat on and into your hair, even cover with a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;Comb thru it FREQUENTLY - I find these tips provide the BEST application and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use hot water unless you want to see your luscious color rinse down your body and down the drain. Don&#x27;t wear white for the first few days, especially if you&#x27;re going to be working out or in the yard, working up a sweat.. ring around the collar will be purple :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the BEST hair color out there, Splat isn&#x27;t bad but you don&#x27;t need to bleach your hair to use Special Effects so I like it better. I did try it using the hair bleach and yes it surely was more intense.. but as it faded it got pinky.</li>
            <li> Special Effects is one of my favorite brands of hair dye. Quality product but price kinda sucked.</li>
            <li> This comes out as a very dark purple, almost black when you first apply it to platinum hair and gradually washes out to a rich purple with pink undertones. It fades to a really nice bubblegum pink after about 3 months of constant washing, but it keeps the purple color fairly vibrantly for about 2-3 months depending upon the frequency of your hair washing.</li>
            <li> It stains. But it doesn&#x27;t fade away easily. I have it on my hair for a month and it&#x27;s still purple! I love it. Worth the money.</li>
