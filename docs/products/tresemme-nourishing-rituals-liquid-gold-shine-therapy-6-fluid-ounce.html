            <li>Best product for getting out tangles.  </li>
            <li>It leaves even the damaged hair silky &amp; gorgeous!</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t make anymore but was happy to find on Amazon</li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>But still a good product.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this hair treatment!</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it smells nice.</li>
            <li>dispenser is very easy to use and control the amount of product used.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and adds a nice shine .  </li>
            <li>Love the way this stuff makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my hair color look better.</li>
            <li>This is working ok for me.  </li>
            <li>Not the most moisturizing</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>More a conditioner that washes out than a spray on treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft, and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li>My hair is mostly white now, and it shines beautifully with no heavy feel, great condition, very touchable and youthful looking! :-)</li>
            <li>It was effective as a light conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t exactly make my hair shimmer and glow.</li>
            <li>Good product overall....</li>
            <li>Why get it with the fun gold flakes if you just wash it out.  </li>
            <li>Roux gold color refresh mask is my first choice.</li>
            <li>Seems only a bit better than using Pantene Shine shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any kind of gold shimmer to me, but how it makes my hair feel alone is worth any price.</li>
            <li>So If your hair really needs conditioning, you will probably have to use a leave in conditioner after this product.</li>
            <li>this product really does what it says.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that much of a shine on my hair.</li>
            <li>With this product, my hair picks up the light and simply shines!</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m blonde, it just makes my hair shimmer &amp; shine in the light &amp; the sun.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the later one, i liked it because i was trying to switch from gel to other product that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much....</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft and silky after using this.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have ever used that leaves my not-quite-straight hair really silky.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really see the blonde even in my highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair (like me) use only a small amount to keep hair from becoming flat and limp.</li>
            <li>but there it&#x27;s no extreme shine in your hair</li>
            <li>I have allowed my hair to grow out, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is white, not gray.</li>

            <li> Dried my hair out</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but very little is needed at one time so it all works</li>
            <li> Would not recommend also very heavy and greasy after using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really saw a lot of shine in my normally dull hair after using this product. I like this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best product for getting out tangles.  I have curly hair that starts knotting  itself as soon as it&#x27;s combed out.  This product is a miracle.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff makes my hair feel. Ashame they don&#x27;t make anymore but was happy to find on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever used that leaves my not-quite-straight hair really silky.  Not too fragrant, which is a plus for me. My hair is mostly white now, and it shines beautifully with no heavy feel, great condition, very touchable and youthful looking! :-)</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but very little is needed at one time so it all works out.&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is very easy to use and control the amount of product used.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and adds a nice shine .  My hair feels very soft and silky after using this.  If you have fine hair (like me) use only a small amount to keep hair from becoming flat and limp.</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap, subtle and works! If my blonde gets too purple or ashy, I use this to get gold back in it- Roux gold color refresh mask is my first choice. This product is second</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out and I did not see a noticeable difference in shine at all. I cannot recommend thus product. I gave it 2 stars because it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have bought. It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores. It seems to make my hair color look better. Its not as thick as normal conditioner. So If your hair really needs conditioning, you will probably have to use a leave in conditioner after this product. I use a leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and I don&#x27;t notice any difference on my hair. I was hoping for a gold shimmering effect but it doesn&#x27;t even do that!</li>
            <li> this product really does what it says. I have no idea why Tres Semme no longer makes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that much of a shine on my hair. Seems only a bit better than using Pantene Shine shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is working ok for me.  Not the most moisturizing and I have to use a lot of it to coat my hair. But still a good product.</li>
            <li> It was ok. But not what i ordered. I ordered the serum.</li>
            <li> I have allowed my hair to grow out, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is white, not gray. With this product, my hair picks up the light and simply shines! I do mix it with another conditioner, doesn&#x27;t matter which one, as I switch them up, and it just gives me that extra sparkle and glow.</li>
            <li> Good product overall....but there it&#x27;s no extreme shine in your hair if that&#x27;s what you are expecting, you can use it as gel but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as the later one, i liked it because i was trying to switch from gel to other product that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much....</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was going to be.  More a conditioner that washes out than a spray on treatment.  Why get it with the fun gold flakes if you just wash it out.  Would not recommend also very heavy and greasy after using.  Not for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> It was effective as a light conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t exactly make my hair shimmer and glow. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this hair treatment! Because I&#x27;m blonde, it just makes my hair shimmer &amp; shine in the light &amp; the sun. It smells great too. I&#x27;m definitely buying this again. It leaves even the damaged hair silky &amp; gorgeous! Worth the money for sure! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Thought it was a little sticky and I couldn&#x27;t really see the blonde even in my highlighted hair.  Ended up giving it away after 1/4 of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff! It leaves my hair so soft, and it smells so good! Amazon is the only place I can find this anymore, so I have to stock up. I&#x27;m so glad I found this. I have dark brown hair, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any kind of gold shimmer to me, but how it makes my hair feel alone is worth any price.</li>
