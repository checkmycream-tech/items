            <li>Think I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
            <li>Love the price as well.</li>
            <li>its better then the ones that i got with my order</li>
            <li>Shipping took forever, but the strips seem to be working ok.</li>
            <li>i would like to recommended.. :)</li>
            <li>Not large strip, but great quality!</li>
            <li>Wax doesn&#x27;t seep thru, no fuzz like the cloth strips, easy to grip and even use up to 3 times when piggy backing face to face on a used strip.</li>
            <li>The price is unbeatable and they don&#x27;t tear easily</li>
            <li>Works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly,product description accurate.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cheap they tore apart as I pulled the strips up-leaving nothing for me to grab on to</li>
            <li>Nice quality and worked very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>In the past when I used from the store....not so much good experience because the wax strips are made differently, but from this seller, they are cotton and perfectly grips onto the hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing Quality Professional Quality</li>
            <li>Long shipping time but good product. .</li>
            <li>These might be useful with a thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try waxing with these strips for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used i feel is not super quality but work good for price...</li>
            <li>They worked well, was even able to use the same strip twice for areas with lighter hair growth</li>
            <li>These kind of strips are good for smaller areas with not so thick hair folicoils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li>These strips work very well.</li>
            <li>the wife can really pull hair out with these</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The wax will stick to these very well and make at home waxing a breeze.</li>
            <li>I really prefer these strips to the traditional muslin, they are thicker and more sturdy, they are easy to trim if you need a different size, and because they are thicker there is less stinging when I remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s why so many people have had some trouble or have no idea what their doing when it comes to waxing.</li>
            <li>I dont have a lot of money to go to professional salon anymore, so I do the affordable way of purchasing the wax at the store (Walgreens or Walmart)</li>
            <li>The seller (Topmei) also turned out to ship direct from China</li>
            <li>just put on a thin layer of wax and you will have clean skin, its super durable, and plays no games</li>
            <li>I mean SOME would, but more not than did.</li>
            <li>yikes, nearly ripped a ball of butt at least its as smooth as a babys butt now</li>
            <li>then I remove once cool and place it on the hard wax but not on skin and then pull wax off.</li>
            <li>I did not like how the hard wax would not adhere adequately.</li>
            <li>The strips are not very long</li>
            <li>The package I got was much thinner than the one I bought previously.</li>

            <li> well I think it is too thick, I like the other strips, but  the price was right.  </li>
            <li> They do a poor job of waxing large areas such as legs or arms.</li>
            <li> Smaller than typical wax pellon.</li>
            <li> Although the label looked the same, the content was much less than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Makes it go a little further for the money.</li>
            <li> It also came sooner than expected and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Money well spent in my opinion</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> It all depends on  the seller, so be careful who you order from.</li>
            <li> I have used other strips before that get all damp and sticky just by one pull off.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the material thickness or my wax</li>
            <li> It took almost a month to arrive, but then again, it came from the other side of the world.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get why people are saying they are weak or strip, unless you guys got a bad batch (or just trying to make sure no one else buys so it has enough stock for you to re-order).</li>
            <li> Moreover, they are so resistant that you can save a lot by using one strip to remove half of your leg.</li>
            <li> This makes me very sad because I think this is a very promising product.</li>
            <li> They are actually a little bit on the thick side and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Yet it would not stick to the wax no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li> It comes with a container of Brazilian body hard wax.  </li>
            <li> and i was having a hard time.  </li>
            <li> And for people using them with hard wax that is not recommended to use strips with hard waxes.</li>
            <li> Hard wax dries hard and then what I do is</li>
            <li> Hard wax dries hard for a reason it is not recommended for strips because it will not stick.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow.</li>
            <li> The wax and the strip paper does not like each other :(.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and flimsey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> bad product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its the worst product ever.............</li>

            <li> Excellent quality!!! 100% recommended and I will buy again. The strips are not very long but anyways they do good for their purpose. Moreover, they are so resistant that you can save a lot by using one strip to remove half of your leg. I have used other strips before that get all damp and sticky just by one pull off.</li>
            <li> just put on a thin layer of wax and you will have clean skin, its super durable, and plays no games</li>
            <li> I love it.love it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend  for everyone.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Shipping takes forever so order 5x what you need!  It will not be wasrted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine and it works wonderful I can use it twice a piece and no problem what so ever I love it.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me. Does the job as needed every time. It also came sooner than expected and had no issues. I even reused the same strip couple of times and still worked. Think I&#x27;ll get more. Love the price as well. Money well spent in my opinion</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. The strips fall apart when used.</li>
            <li> I always order from this agent and strips work great! I dont have a lot of money to go to professional salon anymore, so I do the affordable way of purchasing the wax at the store (Walgreens or Walmart) and then I use these strips. They grip onto my hair which for some reason my hair by hereditary from my father! so embarrassing as a female. So I wax those pits and legs, sometimes my arms and the bikini area. The hair pulls off and there&#x27;s no pain. In the past when I used from the store....not so much good experience because the wax strips are made differently, but from this seller, they are cotton and perfectly grips onto the hair.</li>
            <li> pro-grade paper designed to not irritate skin at the highest level.</li>
            <li> The material is thicker than I&#x27;m used to. Shipping was slow. Occasionally, these won&#x27;t pull all the wax off and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the material thickness or my wax</li>
            <li> I was great and I&#x27;ll definately buy this product again.</li>
            <li> These strips just did not want to stick to the wax! I tried everything I possibly could.Yet it would not stick to the wax no matter how hard i tried. I feel like it was my fault as to why these weren&#x27;t working for me.I mean SOME would, but more not than did. This makes me very sad because I think this is a very promising product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Wax doesn&#x27;t seep thru, no fuzz like the cloth strips, easy to grip and even use up to 3 times when piggy backing face to face on a used strip. Makes it go a little further for the money.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try waxing with these strips for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an absolute disaster. They&#x27;re so cheap they tore apart as I pulled the strips up-leaving nothing for me to grab on to so I had to soak the area and scrape the strips and wax off my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER recommend these strips to anyone.</li>
            <li> Work great for the price. Everything I could ask for in wax strips. The price is unbeatable and they don&#x27;t tear easily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know because of the wax or because of the strip paper.  I bought a GiGi Brazilian Waxing Kit.  It comes with a container of Brazilian body hard wax.  So I tried it and i was having a hard time.  The wax and the strip paper does not like each other :(.</li>
            <li> These kind of strips are good for smaller areas with not so thick hair folicoils. And for people using them with hard wax that is not recommended to use strips with hard waxes. Hard wax dries hard and then what I do is I wear gloves put a dab of wax on gloves for a tab then I remove once cool and place it on the hard wax but not on skin and then pull wax off. Hard wax dries hard for a reason it is not recommended for strips because it will not stick. I think that&#x27;s why so many people have had some trouble or have no idea what their doing when it comes to waxing. I am a cosmetologist student and I plan just to do esthetics so I have done my research on waxing and skin care.</li>
            <li> Strips tear the momemt you try to pull them. its the worst product ever.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really bad product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will never suggest</li>
            <li> They are good but now I don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> took over a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> Worked well for different types of wax.</li>
            <li> Soooo.. Finally used them today and I don&#x27;t get why people are saying they are weak or strip, unless you guys got a bad batch (or just trying to make sure no one else buys so it has enough stock for you to re-order). They worked well, was even able to use the same strip twice for areas with lighter hair growth (yeah, I&#x27;m a bit frugal). They are actually a little bit on the thick side and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Good for the price :)</li>
            <li> its better then the ones that i got with my order</li>
            <li> Item quality is unreliable and inconsistent. It all depends on  the seller, so be careful who you order from. The package I got was much thinner than the one I bought previously. Although the label looked the same, the content was much less than what I expected. Instead of 100 sheets, I got 74. The seller (Topmei) also turned out to ship direct from China so my order took almost a month. This should have been stated upfront as I would have picked another source had I known!</li>
            <li> I wanted to learn to wax my own body.  These strips work very well.</li>
            <li> Great exactly as the description described it</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly,product description accurate.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It took almost a month to arrive, but then again, it came from the other side of the world.  It works well, and I&#x27;m gad I can dispose of it when I&#x27;m done, rather than cleaning muslim pieces.</li>
            <li> You CAN use these for replacement Sally Hansen paper wax strips. Nice quality and worked very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Good to remove the waxing.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Works great with the sally Hansen all over Brazilian hair remover.</li>
            <li> Long shipping time but good product. .</li>
            <li> These are very thin and flimsey. They do a poor job of waxing large areas such as legs or arms. Unlike the sturdy ones provided by nair roll on wax products, these were a miss I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> Smaller than typical wax pellon. Shipping took forever, but the strips seem to be working ok.</li>
            <li> yikes, nearly ripped a ball of butt at least its as smooth as a babys butt now</li>
            <li> I did not like how the hard wax would not adhere adequately.</li>
            <li> Not large strip, but great quality!</li>
            <li> well I think it is too thick, I like the other strips, but  the price was right.  I think since I have been waxing for a while the thininner strips are best.  These might be useful with a thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing Quality Professional Quality</li>
            <li> I really prefer these strips to the traditional muslin, they are thicker and more sturdy, they are easy to trim if you need a different size, and because they are thicker there is less stinging when I remove the hair.</li>
            <li> the wife can really pull hair out with these</li>
            <li> Thanks. Everything is ok!</li>
            <li> I save a lot of money by waxing at home. These strips are perfect. The wax will stick to these very well and make at home waxing a breeze. I have been using this product for over ten years and I am thankful that Amazon sells this product.</li>
            <li> I received my leg hair removal. I used i feel is not super quality but work good for price...i would like to recommended.. :)</li>
