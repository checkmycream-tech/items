            <li> Like the smell was inspecting little more out of the smell coming from mary but i do recommen buying again.</li>
            <li> Mary J, you did it.  This smell is invigorating and make you have full of life.</li>
            <li> My mom originally brought this perfume as a gift set for Christmas. At first I wasn&#x27;t really into the scent, then I decide to wear it one night at the movies, and it instantly became a new staple of mine.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present for my mother. She recently sampled this scent at a Dept store and fell in love with it. I have yet to smell it because of the wrapping and it being a gift but I will come back and give a full review since I&#x27;m always hesitant ordering frangrances online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great value for money,  with a mature, slightly musky scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling perfume.  The bottle is so sweet and pretty I just love the bottl4e and the perfume.  Great</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance. It smells really good.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mother on her birthday.  She  had heard how good it was supposed to be and has been hinting around for it since Christmas! My first reaction to it was it was just OK! I always make sure that I do the two spray sniff test LOL! I sprayed it in the air first, and then sniffed.  Next, I sprayed it on my hand and let it settle in.  After a couple of seconds, I smelled my hand and found a very delightful scent, the longer it sits the better it smells.  I will purchase this again for my mother! The scent is very fresh, strong  but light and not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> I love my Mary J Blige set because it is a great representation of me!</li>
            <li> I luv this fragrance.  This is actually my third bottle.  The price was right on Amazon.  When I wear it people always ask what am I wearing.</li>
            <li> all enjoy this spray hope they keep it around it is very hard to find&lt;br /&gt;Have gave it as a gift and they love it also Last with you all day</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t but fragrance online.  It&#x27;s nothing personal just not the right scent for me.  It smelled old lady(ish) on me.  My neighbor loved it so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li> It works well with my body chemistry.  Sometimes fragrances will not stay with me, but this one does.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find.  I can&#x27;t find the body cream anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere.  I was glad to find it here.  Smells wonderful and I get lots of compliments when wearing it!</li>
            <li> I had a knock off but ran out and decided to buy the real thing.  I absolutely love this fragrance.  Thanks Mary!!</li>
            <li> It was ok but it wasn&#x27;t for me it was a gift .My friend loves it .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time now and love it.  I try to get enough a Xmas time to last through the year.</li>
            <li> great gift for my mom she loved it the shipping was super the price was awesome will reorder again in the future makes a great gift</li>
            <li> It was nice I use it everyday</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, so I had to order her two bottles.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how good this stuff smells. Unbelievable.  I purchased 3 bottles. The price is unreal. I just paid 80 for versace bright crystals and it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> TWO THUMBS WAY UP! SHIPMENT WAS QUICK AND MY DAUGHTER WAS VERY HAPPY!  THANK YOU! !</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful. Light, sexy and fresh. Its not overwhelming. I plan on purchasing it again.  This is a keeper. I love it.</li>
            <li> I like because it has a gentle smell .</li>
            <li> I love the product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. This is a calm smell not too much fragrance. Fresh like you just showered but not shower fresh. The bottle is bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance w/o ever smelling it. I am such a Mary J. fan that I said I had to have it. The scent isn&#x27;t all that. I have brought, tried, and worn better. It has a mature, soft, flowery scent. It isn&#x27;t an everyday scent more like going out to dinner with the girls or coworkers. It isn&#x27;t sexy,  you dont get lost in it, it is what it is.</li>
            <li> Love my perfume , took a little longer to get here but I got it finally</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had bought my last bottle of &amp;#34;My Life&amp;#34; from Amazon. It came in a heavy, classy bottle, just like the one I had before. This time, however, the bottle was smaller, and the cover/lid(?) was plastic and the the spay mechanism was cheap. It was just not as nice...but, the perfume was the same, if not a bit stronger. Seemed to stay longer, without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> Thank you. I love this spray especially during the fall season. And it&#x27;s hard to find. So, I&#x27;m very happy to know I can get it from your site.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell smell of My Life!. The price was reasonable and I plan to buy a bigger bottle next time.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance I love Mary J Blige always been a fan this is a nice perfume the smell last for all time very  smell.</li>
            <li> Awsome job with the product and shipping</li>
