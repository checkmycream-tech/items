            <li>This scent is a pillowy, sweet, fragrant cloud of sweet, sugary goodness that will leave your heart light and without a care in the world.  </li>
            <li>For such a simple formula, this smells really good and has lasted a good 6 hours on me.  </li>

            <li>very girlie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently the sweet scents agree with me, and this one is inexpensive, to boot.</li>
            <li>This smells nice but it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>You will find yourself respraying if only to gaze upon the  tender pink elixir that will spritz upon your skin pure love.  </li>
            <li>Normally I am bothered by musk but not in this case - I don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that when you first start wearing it you might get a hankering for real cotton candy.</li>
            <li>pretty much the same as the body fantasies</li>

            <li> This scent is a pillowy, sweet, fragrant cloud of sweet, sugary goodness that will leave your heart light and without a care in the world.  You will be teleported to a time once spent only dreaming of what you will become and when your next meal will be served.  Santa Claus would be scented like this.  It is the scent dreams travel upon.  Billowy and light, yet lasts for hours.  Opens with fresh berries and vanilla and then on into sugared powdered candy fluff - sweet but not too sweet...there is mention of musk but only a whisper.  Normally I am bothered by musk but not in this case - I don&#x27;t even notice it.  I You will find yourself respraying if only to gaze upon the  tender pink elixir that will spritz upon your skin pure love.  Ok, I realize I am not probably making any sense but I really enjoy this cologne and I do hope they plan on keeping it a part of the line.  I am a forty-something female and this scent refreshes me in a \\&quot;I&#x27;m still a little girl at heart\\&quot; way ...without screaming TODDLER.  Please give it a try.  You might surprise yourself!  If you do not care for it...send it to me!  It is an inexpensive adventure either way!  ENJOY!  P.S.  if you find yourself wanting to love Pink Sugar but something about it puts you off - the musk perhaps...burnt note maybe?  Give this a try....perfection!</li>
            <li> Its a lovely cotton candy scent with a hint of vanilla.  I never thought Id like it but I find its absolutely delicious scent!  The only drawback is that when you first start wearing it you might get a hankering for real cotton candy.</li>

            <li> definitly buying more, the smell is amazing, smells just like a real cotton candy yummm, guys go crazy smelling me even trying to bite me hehe</li>
            <li> This is great, the smell actually lasts all day. I noticed with some other candy smells it disappears rather quickly, but not this one. I&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing another reviewer one star better and calling this perfume &#x27;great&#x27;.  For such a simple formula, this smells really good and has lasted a good 6 hours on me.  Apparently the sweet scents agree with me, and this one is inexpensive, to boot. Cotton candy and fruit,very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little while ago and im in LOVE! It smells so good! Whenever i hug people they always tell me how good i smell (: i have had many many perfumes and this is my absolute favorite. It doesnt give me headaches , doesn&#x27;t get tiring , doesn&#x27;t ware off quickly , and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cotton candy mist so I figured this would smell the same and last longer. Unfortunately this perfume smells weird... It smells sweet yet it has that overwhelming cheap perfume smell...</li>
            <li> Cotton candy is my favorite scent to wear, and i have tried many many different perfumes including Can Can; Pink Sugar and Delicious Cotton Candy which all are much more expensive alternatives and none of them smell as good as this one. Granted, It isn&#x27;t very strong so it does go faster but it&#x27;s worth it. It will always be my favorite!</li>
            <li> This product was fast to receive from when I ordered online. I had never bought a perfume that on the internet before because I was scared that I wouldn&#x27;t like the scent, BUT buying this perfume was absolutely the best choice I&#x27;ve made in a long time. It smells amazing, and is in a adorable bottle. I&#x27;m buying more already. :)</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I have had many compliments from both men and women that they like this too.  Some people said they want to just eat me up because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent and I love it more than words can say.  If you are a fan of Candy sweet gourmand scents then you will love this.  My girl loves this scent on me and I&#x27;ll always have a bottle in my possession.</li>
            <li> My wife called one day and said what smell do you like? I said cotton candy she said no for a perfume. I said bet I can find one, I did and it smells wonderful!! So much better then 95% of the crap they sell at department stores. That&#x27;s a guys opinion, girls you want to catch your guy off guard get it spray it see if he notices.</li>
            <li> pretty much the same as the body fantasies cotton candy body spray...ok exactly the same.  Oh well, I like the scent anyway...</li>
            <li> it was cute but the scent was not quite there (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;I wanted it to smell like actual cotton candy and not some idea of it.</li>
            <li> I wear cotton candy spray because it smells delicious and because people are just nicer to you when you smell like it. I actually wrote a paper for my psych class on how people let you check out first, daycare workers are more hands on with a toddler who smells like cotton candy, etc and on how it engages people. It started out as an experiment and is now my preferred perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering, sugar cookie scent and apple pie were the #2 &amp; #3 scent that had similar, though not as pronounced results in my 45 day experiment. French vanilla and lavender had the worst results, with people grumbling about &amp;#34;strong smells&amp;#34; and being standoffish.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars and would have given it 5 if only the scent would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful. I just loe the look of the bottle..very girlie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is definately cotton candy but it does seem to wear of rather quickly.</li>
            <li> When you spray the cologne it smells great. Just like Cotton Candy! But almost immediately the scent vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;Literally 2 minutes later, there is no trace of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume! It goes so nice with body spray &amp; the lotion!!! I love the scent! Get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Cotton Candy&lt;br /&gt;speedy shipping, smell is great, wear it all the time now, everyone has given wonderful compliments on this scent, can wear it day or night</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good cotton candy smelling perfume and thought this would be it after a long time of research. Disappointed. It has a nasty musky smell and I hate that musky part. Without the musky smell it would be awesome though.</li>
            <li> This smells nice but it does not last long at all. Once you put it on the scent disappears within minutes.</li>
