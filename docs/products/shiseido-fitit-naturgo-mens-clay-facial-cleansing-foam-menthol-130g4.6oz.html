            <li> Very concentrated, you need very little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for all the feminine face cleaner stuff that tries to not dry out your face.</li>
            <li> found it weired that sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look for the whole line of a specific Shiseido product from one single seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This leaves my forehead a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Does leave face feeling a bit dry, but putting lotion on afterward helps.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this from a visit to japan and it actually cleared his face in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> but I will be looking at other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews suggests, you should use this every other day or so as it is an exfoliate wash.  </li>
            <li> You should use it like once every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying, so you&#x27;ll want to take a &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; at least once or twice a week if your skin is naturally dry.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well, i usually lather my face and let it sit on for about 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li> There was a cooling sensation after I took a towel and dried it off with small dabs.</li>
            <li> you hardly need to use any.</li>
            <li> It will Dry out your lips and hands, almost painfully.</li>

            <li> I love this, works great and lathers up really well. The smell is less appealing than other face wash but I would recommend this to others. I use with an exfoliant but I will be looking at other products from this company.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I prefer the Acure argan oil face wash. This leaves my forehead a bit dry. If you have greasier skin you may like this.</li>

            <li> the product is nice, and it is first time i bought it. I need to use it for a while and check out the outcome.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well, i usually lather my face and let it sit on for about 10-15 mins. wash off and head to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep away from lips though and use hand lotion when your done. It will Dry out your lips and hands, almost painfully.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this from a visit to japan and it actually cleared his face in just a few uses. I have very oily skin so it works really well for me too. Only issue is that i had to wait for it for a month.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the best face wash that I&#x27;ve ever got. .good for people who has oily face.  Recommended to buy.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It does a great job of absorbing oil from the skin while cleaning very effectively. Highly recommend it and have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. I can feel that it took away the oil and dirt. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Great mask for men or women... my wife uses it as well. She likes the smell but bottling it does work. I took it out of the packaging it was in and put it in a jar which worked much better for shaking it up.</li>
            <li> fantastic product, deeply cleans.</li>
            <li> This facewash is great for oily skin! Makes your skin feel really clean without dry.</li>
            <li> Lathers up very well, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, thought it would leave a cleaner feeling</li>
            <li> Mild and gently on the face, has a cooling effect on the skin.  Leaves a face with a clean, clear glow</li>
            <li> This facewash works very well in removing oils from my skin without having the harsh scrubs like apricot scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a cool effect after wash leaving your face refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been loyal to it and will never use any other face wash again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks naturgo.</li>
            <li> I like this product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff vs what I typically bought at the store (nivea, suace, etc). Leave it on long enough and you can feel it &#x27;working&#x27; deep down, which always leaves my face feeling fresh. It doesn&#x27;t fry out my skin either, but I use an aftershave lotion anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for the ladies**My girlfriend used it recently and loved it! It took off all of her makeup which she is always using different products.</li>
            <li> Im hooked! Leaves my face so clean and dirt free. I used with my claraSonic</li>
            <li> The face wash is definitely refreshing and I have seen a big difference even after using it daily for just one week. It is not expensive like many other brands, and most importantly, it works! I love it!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Was excited to find it on Amazon. Excellent product, leaves face feeling clean, cool, and fresh.  Smells great. It doesn&#x27;t take much of it to lather up to cover face (maybe dime size).  Would suggest wetting face, working product in hands to lather up a bit then apply to face.  Like other reviews suggests, you should use this every other day or so as it is an exfoliate wash.  Does leave face feeling a bit dry, but putting lotion on afterward helps.  Overall it is one of the best face wash I have used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial cleansers, from high end to low end, from Clinique to neutrogena, and this is by far the best product for me. I have a mildly oily skin and this products has worked so well on my skin. It leaves you feeling cleansed and refreshed. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If you are not sure about your skin type or what kind of products can change your skin a little bit, choose Shiseido is always a good idea. I am a big fan of Shiseido product, from shampoo to facial masks, from pore minimizing cream to moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it weired that sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look for the whole line of a specific Shiseido product from one single seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash mud is quite nice to men. I feel very much clean after wash and it feels all the oily stuff is gone from skin. I am using it repeatedly, although you should aware that it has exfoliating scrub. You should use it like once every other day. I would suggest to have another milky face wash on the side and use them interchangeably.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for years and rarely ever have a break-out. It&#x27;s a bit drying, so you&#x27;ll want to take a &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; at least once or twice a week if your skin is naturally dry. It removes dead skin and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Next to using African Black Soap, I enjoy using the Naturgo Clay Wash because after washing my face with it (wetting face, applying face wash, letting it sit for a bit and then rinsing) made my face feel cool and as if it were &amp;#34;breathing&amp;#34;! There was a cooling sensation after I took a towel and dried it off with small dabs. I felt as if this face wash opened up my pores to let it breath. It has a nice fragrance and unique look, sort of feels like a scrub, but it feels really good! Will be buying more often!</li>
            <li> Like othet reviews, this product works great. I use this twice a day and feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> loving the texture of this face wash! will buy again/</li>
