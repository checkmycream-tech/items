            <li>I love Dove!</li>
            <li>I bought this off a YouTube review, and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and you get a really amazing lather from it.  </li>
            <li>for the lather...it lathers nicely on a sponge...</li>
            <li>This is a nicely scented body wash by Dove.</li>
            <li>You can even get by without using lotion after using this which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other people, people without a Y chromosome, have review this body wash as follows: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s nice &amp;#60;smile&amp;#62;&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and has a good moisturizing effect, like many Dove products of this type.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes skin nicely,</li>
            <li>A great product at a great value and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger too much, good for most members of the family, although probably more of a woman&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite dove soap is the pistacio scent and this complements it nicely (even when using body wash I still like to use soap on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap dispenses in a good stream and lathers up richly.  </li>
            <li>The body wash smells good and works well when I clean my body during a shower.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin moisturized and with a very light orange scent.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of waking you up in the morning and fills your whole bathroom with the luxorious scent.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>
            <li>I wish it actually smelled like that--what an awesome body wash scent that would be.</li>
            <li>I love this scent...sort of citrus, flowery garden and tropical vacation all in one.</li>
            <li>I am a Philosophy girl, but also LOVE the scent of oranges and bought this.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to purchase, along with my favorite Philosophy shower gels of course.</li>
            <li>I love dove products.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love all of the Dove body wash products.  </li>
            <li>I love the citrus aroma it leaves both on my body and in the bathroom after I shower.</li>
            <li>A refreshing body wash that moisturizes the skin a bit.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it softens and cleans.</li>
            <li>Appropriate for a man as it&#x27;s not perfumy.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing scent that sweeps you up in mild citrusy, warm cloud of comfort as you shower away your troubles.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and leaves my skin nice and smooth and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>This is a really good, reasonably priced body wash that is appropriate for either gender...  </li>
            <li>The color is a light orange, and the scent is also very light orange.  </li>
            <li>I love the Dove Body Wash great for shaving and make skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I used other products that I truly realized how awesome it is!</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent!</li>
            <li>The whole bathroom smells fresh and happy after using this body wash in the shower.</li>
            <li>is that it lathers well, but it rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>product is strong for a Dove product.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend...</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, citrus scent, lathers up well, and leaves my body clean and my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The Dove body wash products are a huge hit in out house.</li>
            <li>Dove has a great product here so long as you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an orange flower when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Lathers richly and rises thoroughly with an invigorating fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger after your shower.  </li>
            <li>Although I love the fragrance of the Soft Soap more, it&#x27;s just way too slippery.  </li>
            <li>The lather is nice while showering and should be ok for a regular bath but watch out when it comes to running the jets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that not too many men would care to use this product because of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light scented and the most important thing is my feet don&#x27;t slip in the shower like I do with the Soft Soap brand.  </li>
            <li>is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>The Dove go fresh body wash is smooth, and the orange scent is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It really does leave my skin more moisturized.</li>
            <li>This Dove body wash smells so good, it definitely perks me up in the morning!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too strong and left a nice scent on your skins after a shower/bath.</li>
            <li>The lather is rich and creamy, the smell is super refreshing (not too strong), and it left my skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean smelling, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate how gentle it is on the skin, and how effective its moisturizers penetrate the skin for hours before lotion is needed.</li>
            <li>So fresh, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>In the morning it wakes up your senses, and before bed it feels fresh.  </li>
            <li>The Dove go fresh Body Wash Revitalize</li>
            <li>Dove go fresh Body Wash</li>
            <li>did just that and left me smelling nice afterword.  </li>
            <li>for the body wash itself, it lathered up nicely, rinsed off, and definitely moisturized.</li>
            <li>So maybe not all of your troubles, but your skin will feel lovely, soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>We normally purchase the Dove sensitive skin bars of soap from Costco, but this was a nice change.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it was a bit more on the citrus side, but it had more of a watery floral and slightly spicy floral scent.</li>
            <li>The entire bathroom was filled with a strong &amp;#34;mandarin and tiare flower&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, lathers well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>The wash claims to leave the skin softer after the first use</li>
            <li>I have used many different body washes.  </li>
            <li>I tend to mostly use Dove bar soap, but I did notice this body wash left my skin even softer than the bars do.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>Most definitely.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this as a change from my regular soap.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Dove because it is gentle on the skin and not strongly scented...but lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells amazing very moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s Nutrium Moisture and its&#x27; unique blend of moisturizers keeps my skin tender and soft.</li>
            <li>This body wash leaves your skin feeling soft, hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>this fruit scent is a little too strong, pleasing, but strong.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t speak to that, the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t give it much thought</li>
            <li>I think the scent largely washed off because no one commented on it</li>
            <li>While the Dove Cool Moisture (Cucumber and Green Tea scent) remains my favorite, I do like this Revitalize mandarin and tiare flower version almost as much.</li>
            <li>And this particular scent is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>Thanks you Dove.</li>
            <li>Dove makes fantastic body washes and this one is no different!</li>
            <li>If you like food scents in personal care products you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t mind it for showers I&#x27;d like to add that this gets really bubbly in the tub.</li>
            <li>At about 25 cents an ounce based on Amazons current price of this review, the Dove go fresh Body Wash is very well priced and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but I had to use a larger amount to get a good lather, unlike the other Dove products.&lt;br /&gt;So for me...</li>
            <li>Five stars because -other- people love it.</li>
            <li>This body wash makes the same rich lather that the other Dove body washes do, and has a lovely floral/citrus scent as well.</li>
            <li>of the other things that I love about Dove body wash</li>
            <li>Would it hold up to and get rid of the sweat and grime and stink from mowing the lawn in the middle of summer on a very hot and very humid day?  </li>
            <li>As a long time dove soap and deodorant user I was excited to try their body wash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I personally still love the deep moisture body wash over this and others, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I like the scent of this body wash.</li>
            <li>It lathers on thickly which is something I really liked and preferred.</li>
            <li>The Dove brand has a light fragrance and your skin feels soft after you towel dry.</li>
            <li>bottle is easy to open and reclose and the 22 oz size will keep you in shower gel for quite a while til the next purchase.</li>
            <li>This new Revitalize mandarin and tiare flower version does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My family already loves Dove products so we thought we&#x27;d try this new scented body wash.</li>
            <li>I have use Dove body washes in the past and I&#x27;ve always been pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think Dove has really good products for those who don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t afford high end (expensive) body products.</li>
            <li>If you like Bath and Body Works body washes...then you will love this especially since you get a bottle that is twice the size at half the Bath and Body Works price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It lathers up lushly on a bath pouf thingy</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel my skin was as soft with this body wash over my Dove deepMoisture body wash.</li>
            <li>This citrus scent is spot on and non-offensive for those who are sensitive to overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>Additionally, for consumers with sensitive skin like myself, I can attest that no irritations have occurred.</li>
            <li>The wash itself goes on with a nice, thick lather and washes off smooth without leaving behind pesky residue.  </li>
            <li>This Dove is mild and does not dry out my skin-very typical of  Dove soaps.</li>
            <li>I am not entirely sure what a tiare flower is, but this body wash smells like a sweet orangesicle made with mandarin.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t live a really dry area, then you might like this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I live in a very dry area so for me that is something I look for in my body wash.</li>
            <li>This is a giant bottle and will last a long time primarily because a little goes a long way here.</li>

            <li> Most definitely.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this as a change from my regular soap.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Dove because it is gentle on the skin and not strongly scented...but lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smells amazing very moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s Nutrium Moisture and its&#x27; unique blend of moisturizers keeps my skin tender and soft.</li>
            <li> This body wash leaves your skin feeling soft, hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li> this fruit scent is a little too strong, pleasing, but strong.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t speak to that, the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t give it much thought</li>
            <li> I think the scent largely washed off because no one commented on it</li>
            <li> While the Dove Cool Moisture (Cucumber and Green Tea scent) remains my favorite, I do like this Revitalize mandarin and tiare flower version almost as much.</li>
            <li> And this particular scent is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Thanks you Dove.</li>
            <li> Dove makes fantastic body washes and this one is no different!</li>
            <li> If you like food scents in personal care products you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t mind it for showers I&#x27;d like to add that this gets really bubbly in the tub.</li>
            <li> At about 25 cents an ounce based on Amazons current price of this review, the Dove go fresh Body Wash is very well priced and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but I had to use a larger amount to get a good lather, unlike the other Dove products.&lt;br /&gt;So for me...</li>
            <li> Five stars because -other- people love it.</li>
            <li> This body wash makes the same rich lather that the other Dove body washes do, and has a lovely floral/citrus scent as well.</li>
            <li> of the other things that I love about Dove body wash</li>
            <li> Would it hold up to and get rid of the sweat and grime and stink from mowing the lawn in the middle of summer on a very hot and very humid day?  </li>
            <li> As a long time dove soap and deodorant user I was excited to try their body wash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I personally still love the deep moisture body wash over this and others, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I like the scent of this body wash.</li>
            <li> It lathers on thickly which is something I really liked and preferred.</li>
            <li> The Dove brand has a light fragrance and your skin feels soft after you towel dry.</li>
            <li> bottle is easy to open and reclose and the 22 oz size will keep you in shower gel for quite a while til the next purchase.</li>
            <li> This new Revitalize mandarin and tiare flower version does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My family already loves Dove products so we thought we&#x27;d try this new scented body wash.</li>
            <li> I have use Dove body washes in the past and I&#x27;ve always been pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think Dove has really good products for those who don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t afford high end (expensive) body products.</li>
            <li> If you like Bath and Body Works body washes...then you will love this especially since you get a bottle that is twice the size at half the Bath and Body Works price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It lathers up lushly on a bath pouf thingy</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel my skin was as soft with this body wash over my Dove deepMoisture body wash.</li>
            <li> This citrus scent is spot on and non-offensive for those who are sensitive to overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> Additionally, for consumers with sensitive skin like myself, I can attest that no irritations have occurred.</li>
            <li> The wash itself goes on with a nice, thick lather and washes off smooth without leaving behind pesky residue.  </li>
            <li> This Dove is mild and does not dry out my skin-very typical of  Dove soaps.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure what a tiare flower is, but this body wash smells like a sweet orangesicle made with mandarin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t live a really dry area, then you might like this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I live in a very dry area so for me that is something I look for in my body wash.</li>
            <li> This is a giant bottle and will last a long time primarily because a little goes a long way here.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not very moisturizing, but all in all I like it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint would be about the container - the top cover is thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t mistreat it, it is already broken, and it&#x27;s only the first day.</li>
            <li> Summer in Texas means dry skin, so Dove products are always helpful in keeping a balance of moisture and comfort.</li>
            <li> but I do dry out during the winter.</li>
            <li> I am not new to Dove products.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all, and not too overpowering, but lacking in the citrus scent, which sadly is what I was hoping for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I also receive a few different beauty subscription boxes, so I am someone that receives a lot of body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a body wash person</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t overdue it</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and your family and wallet will thank you for it..</li>
            <li> I like it, and like other dove products keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> In other words, it smells amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is a sort of odd combination of floral and orange that seems to shift moment to moment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see if dove has a less scented body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So one less problem with keeping your skin supple and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> not so heavy</li>
            <li> My showers haven&#x27;t had a soap scum in over five years since I switched to body washes.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not too thick, but not watery either.  </li>
            <li> But the scent of this Dove product is so subtle that it is almost unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> I personally was shocked at how aromatic this body wash is.</li>
            <li> This is very thick body wash</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells amazing very moisturizing for dry skin</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, lathers well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. So fresh, not overpowering.  In the morning it wakes up your senses, and before bed it feels fresh.  This is very thick body wash and you get a really amazing lather from it.  The wash claims to leave the skin softer after the first use, I can&#x27;t speak to that, the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t give it much thought and then I was out the door and by the time I thought of it i was sweaty and gritty from the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent can be for either a man or a woman.</li>
            <li> I am not new to Dove products.  I have used many different body washes.  I&#x27;ve always liked Dove because it is gentle on the skin and not strongly scented...but lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is strong for a Dove product.  If you like Bath and Body Works body washes...then you will love this especially since you get a bottle that is twice the size at half the Bath and Body Works price.  For me...this fruit scent is a little too strong, pleasing, but strong.  I&#x27;m certain that not too many men would care to use this product because of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lather...it lathers nicely on a sponge...but I had to use a larger amount to get a good lather, unlike the other Dove products.&lt;br /&gt;So for me...this was just four stars...I like it...but I don&#x27;t LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is a nicely scented body wash by Dove. I do wish it was a bit more on the citrus side, but it had more of a watery floral and slightly spicy floral scent. Not bad at all, and not too overpowering, but lacking in the citrus scent, which sadly is what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my skin feeling soft. I tend to mostly use Dove bar soap, but I did notice this body wash left my skin even softer than the bars do.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my Walmart Beauty Box and I am in love! The lather is incredible and the smell lingers on your skin throughout the day. It does a great job of waking you up in the morning and fills your whole bathroom with the luxorious scent. Def. reccomend this.</li>
            <li> This is a really good, reasonably priced body wash that is appropriate for either gender...  or maybe I should say all genders.  It has a pleasant, citrus scent, lathers up well, and leaves my body clean and my skin soft and moisturized.  A great product at a great value and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. We normally purchase the Dove sensitive skin bars of soap from Costco, but this was a nice change. It&#x27;s easier to use if you use a loofa and the smell is great. It leaves skin moisturized and with a very light orange scent. You can even get by without using lotion after using this which is nice.</li>
            <li> Looks like a melted creamsicle. I wish it actually smelled like that--what an awesome body wash scent that would be. In any case, this does the job as a guest bathroom shower soap. I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily myself.</li>
            <li> The Dove go fresh Body Wash Revitalize is a refreshing body wash! It smells citrusy. It lathers on thickly which is something I really liked and preferred. The scent of the body wash lingered on my skin after I showered. The scent made me feel so revived. My skin was soft and smooth afterward. There was no filmy residue left over on my skin after washing off this body wash. It&#x27;s an excellent, inexpensive body wash.</li>
            <li> I love this scent...sort of citrus, flowery garden and tropical vacation all in one. The whole bathroom smells fresh and happy after using this body wash in the shower. This is a giant bottle and will last a long time primarily because a little goes a long way here. It lathers up lushly on a bath pouf thingy and I had no skin irritation using this. Summer in Texas means dry skin, so Dove products are always helpful in keeping a balance of moisture and comfort.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this product, it got the ultimate test in my house.  Would it hold up to and get rid of the sweat and grime and stink from mowing the lawn in the middle of summer on a very hot and very humid day?  Dove go fresh Body Wash did just that and left me smelling nice afterword.  The scent is a sort of odd combination of floral and orange that seems to shift moment to moment.  The wash itself goes on with a nice, thick lather and washes off smooth without leaving behind pesky residue.  Will I continue to use this?  Yep.  Would I recommend it to others?  Most definitely.  Dove has a great product here so long as you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an orange flower when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: product received via Amazon Vine in exchange for review.</li>
            <li> Five stars because -other- people love it. I personally was shocked at how aromatic this body wash is. The entire bathroom was filled with a strong &amp;#34;mandarin and tiare flower&amp;#34; scent. It is not a manly scent and I was concerned that I would be carrying that scent for the rest of the day. I think the scent largely washed off because no one commented on it and I even asked a couple trusted advisers if I smelled perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people, people without a Y chromosome, have review this body wash as follows: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s nice &amp;#60;smile&amp;#62;&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the body wash itself, it lathered up nicely, rinsed off, and definitely moisturized. It&#x27;s not that big a deal for me in the summer (as I write this) but I do dry out during the winter. I&#x27;ll see if dove has a less scented body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on body washes - I use them exclusively at home and keep the bathrooms stocked with them because bar soap builds up on the shower walls. My showers haven&#x27;t had a soap scum in over five years since I switched to body washes.</li>
            <li> Light scented and the most important thing is my feet don&#x27;t slip in the shower like I do with the Soft Soap brand.  Although I love the fragrance of the Soft Soap more, it&#x27;s just way too slippery.  The Dove brand has a light fragrance and your skin feels soft after you towel dry.</li>
            <li> I love Dove! I think they are the best skin care line I have tried.  The soap dispenses in a good stream and lathers up richly.  My skin feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is absolutely wonderful.  It is a vivacious mandarin. It us perfect for a morning wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a great buy for the price as well. I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I love the Dove Body Wash great for shaving and make skin very soft and smooth. The smell reminds me of orange grove in Florida. The Dove body wash products are a huge hit in out house.</li>
            <li> This Dove cleansing soap Is a good product like almost all of the dove products I have tried.  It lathers well, cleanses well, but still leaves some moisturizer on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent - I&#x27;ve never been a fan of citrus scented products.  But the scent of this Dove product is so subtle that it is almost unnoticeable.  I would call this a five-star product if you like citrus scents, and a four-star product otherwise.</li>
            <li> I like it, and like other dove products keeps my skin from drying out. Smells good too.. makes me think of Florida for some reason.</li>
            <li> This body wash makes the same rich lather that the other Dove body washes do, and has a lovely floral/citrus scent as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The body wash smells good and works well when I clean my body during a shower.</li>
            <li> I am a Philosophy girl, but also LOVE the scent of oranges and bought this.  I love it and will continue to purchase, along with my favorite Philosophy shower gels of course.</li>
            <li> I write a lot of reviews and I also receive a few different beauty subscription boxes, so I am someone that receives a lot of body wash. I have tested body washes of all price ranges and brands and Dove is my absolute favorite. This new Revitalize mandarin and tiare flower version does not disappoint. I am not entirely sure what a tiare flower is, but this body wash smells like a sweet orangesicle made with mandarin. In other words, it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other things that I love about Dove body wash is that it lathers well, but it rinses off easily. This body wash leaves your skin feeling soft, hydrated and clean. I do prefer the larger bottles because they have pumps on them. In a pinch, I will buy this 22 ounce bottle. While the Dove Cool Moisture (Cucumber and Green Tea scent) remains my favorite, I do like this Revitalize mandarin and tiare flower version almost as much. I am going to start alternating between the two versions. My skin Thanks you Dove.</li>
            <li> I love dove products.  This wash is very nice to use.  The color is a light orange, and the scent is also very light orange.  The consistency is not too thick, but not watery either.  It lathers very well and rinses clean.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not very moisturizing, but all in all I like it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and has a good moisturizing effect, like many Dove products of this type. The only complaint would be about the container - the top cover is thin and flimsy. Although I didn&#x27;t mistreat it, it is already broken, and it&#x27;s only the first day.</li>
            <li> The Dove go fresh body wash is smooth, and the orange scent is not overpowering.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t overdue it-otherwise you&#x27;ll have lots of residue to rinse off.  This Dove is mild and does not dry out my skin-very typical of  Dove soaps. Dove&#x27;s Nutrium Moisture and its&#x27; unique blend of moisturizers keeps my skin tender and soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all of the Dove body wash products.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used other products that I truly realized how awesome it is! It really does leave my skin more moisturized. And this particular scent is one of my favorites! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Dove makes fantastic body washes and this one is no different! I love the citrus aroma it leaves both on my body and in the bathroom after I shower. Strongly recommend...</li>
            <li> I love the fresh scent!</li>
            <li> My family already loves Dove products so we thought we&#x27;d try this new scented body wash. I personally still love the deep moisture body wash over this and others, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I like the scent of this body wash. It wasn&#x27;t too strong and left a nice scent on your skins after a shower/bath. My girls like to use it as a bubble bath product, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel my skin was as soft with this body wash over my Dove deepMoisture body wash. However, I live in a very dry area so for me that is something I look for in my body wash. If you don&#x27;t live a really dry area, then you might like this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Dove has really good products for those who don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t afford high end (expensive) body products.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent that sweeps you up in mild citrusy, warm cloud of comfort as you shower away your troubles.  So maybe not all of your troubles, but your skin will feel lovely, soft and moisturized.  So one less problem with keeping your skin supple and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is easy to open and reclose and the 22 oz size will keep you in shower gel for quite a while til the next purchase.</li>
            <li> This product smells too flowery for me. I prefer a fresher scent- not so heavy</li>
            <li> As a long time dove soap and deodorant user I was excited to try their body wash. It doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I&#x27;m not really a body wash person but I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this as a change from my regular soap. It cleans well, just like dove soap does. The best part is the scent. It&#x27;s yummy smelling, like an orange creamsicle. If you like food scents in personal care products you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this body wash. My favorite dove soap is the pistacio scent and this complements it nicely (even when using body wash I still like to use soap on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t mind it for showers I&#x27;d like to add that this gets really bubbly in the tub. We have a jetted tub and I can&#x27;t use this body wash when the jets are running because the bubbles will overflow the tub. The lather is nice while showering and should be ok for a regular bath but watch out when it comes to running the jets.</li>
            <li> A refreshing body wash that moisturizes the skin a bit. The fragrance is pleasant, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger too much, good for most members of the family, although probably more of a woman&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this off a YouTube review, and absolutely love it! The lather is rich and creamy, the smell is super refreshing (not too strong), and it left my skin feeling really smooth. I will definitely buy again. :-)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it softens and cleans.</li>
            <li> Body wash is wonderful. It reminds me of being on the islands</li>
            <li> At about 25 cents an ounce based on Amazons current price of this review, the Dove go fresh Body Wash is very well priced and worth every penny. I really appreciate how gentle it is on the skin, and how effective its moisturizers penetrate the skin for hours before lotion is needed. This citrus scent is spot on and non-offensive for those who are sensitive to overpowering scents. Additionally, for consumers with sensitive skin like myself, I can attest that no irritations have occurred. A little bit goes a long way, and your family and wallet will thank you for it..&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean smelling, but not overpowering.  Appropriate for a man as it&#x27;s not perfumy.  Lathers richly and rises thoroughly with an invigorating fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger after your shower.  Moisturizes skin nicely, a good body wash that I&#x27;d consider to be unisex.</li>
            <li> This Dove body wash smells so good, it definitely perks me up in the morning! I have use Dove body washes in the past and I&#x27;ve always been pleased. It lathers up nicely and leaves my skin nice and smooth and smelling fresh.</li>
