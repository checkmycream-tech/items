            <li>but well worth the search.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything I liked when I finally found this one.  </li>
            <li>Right now.</li>
            <li>I almost bought this exact purfume at my work for $55.00.</li>
            <li>all of my guy friends who give me hugs never fail to compliment how I smell.</li>
            <li>and it was exact size it showed when ordering.</li>
            <li>This first time I wore it</li>
            <li>Exactly how I wanted it good size last long</li>
            <li>This was a gift for someone, so I hope she likes it as much as we do.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a real citrusy smell, but it&#x27;s not.</li>

            <li>Much much cheaper than what the department stores sell this for</li>
            <li>and this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like the potency.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>This size is perfect for this purpose as I find the actual smallest/travel size doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it plus the Price Is unbeleivable  </li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s okay, but it really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was completely SOLD!</li>
            <li>but, couldn&#x27;t help myself and gave it to my daughter early!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time purchasing this fragrance because I like it so much!</li>
            <li>As far as the scent it is a but young and spunky...</li>
            <li>I bought the bottle and the lotion, and even if the scent is subtle, (I recommend spraying your hair mostly</li>
            <li>I really like the smell though I don&#x27;t think it lingers as long as my husband&#x27;s(he loves it and gets lots of compliments</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This parfum smells really good, however the scent fades very quickly. .</li>
            <li> Omg I can&#x27;t believe it was in its package still. I almost bought this exact purfume at my work for $55.00. $30.00 bucks off that&#x27;s awesome &lt;3</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME!!! :) SMELLS GREAT!!! I actually had a lady smell my perfume around the store till she found me just to ask what is was that i was wearing.. lol</li>
            <li> I was passing by a woman who was handing this scent out as a sampler, and with zero intention of buying perfume that day, after getting my initial whiff of it I was completely SOLD! This perfume bottle is my MOST FAVORITE scent to wear when it comes to impressing the guys! I bought the bottle and the lotion, and even if the scent is subtle, (I recommend spraying your hair mostly so the scent sticks!) all of my guy friends who give me hugs never fail to compliment how I smell. And the guys that get even closer become enthralled with it!! This scent is the scent to wear when you&#x27;re trying to become desirable by the opposite sex! Guys go crazy over it and it&#x27;s not overpowering at all!</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  But it only last about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a christmas present but, couldn&#x27;t help myself and gave it to my daughter early! She absolutely loves this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent,shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Super juicy and fruity. I like to layer this with Katy Perrys Meow perfume..,.omg smells amazing together!</li>
            <li> Opened my mail box and the perfume was gone, with torn package. But ive had this perfume before and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this smaller size bottle so I can carry it in my purse to freshen it up throughout the day if needed. This size is perfect for this purpose as I find the actual smallest/travel size doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me. This is my 3rd time purchasing this fragrance because I like it so much! It smells great, light and fresh but also lasts quite a while once applied.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I just love this perfume. You have to try it. This was a gift for someone, so I hope she likes it as much as we do.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly! Smells great! My mom is very happy with her gift.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find item but well worth the search.  A mix of berries and flowers, great for budding perfumenistas.  Packaging is teriffic, great graphics!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and the men&#x27;s version for my husband.I really like the smell though I don&#x27;t think it lingers as long as my husband&#x27;s(he loves it and gets lots of compliments and I love the smell on him too).&lt;br /&gt;That said,I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend it and intend buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything I liked when I finally found this one.  It smells great.  Even hours after applying it, I can still smell it.  I get compliments all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not over powering and does fade slowly through the day.  I like to spray it in my hair and in the inside of my elbow.  This helps the scent linger longer.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a real citrusy smell, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s more flowery. I mean it&#x27;s okay, but it really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not so Good after a while it fades away. No good</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price and smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> No matter what you think of the Tom Hardy brand, this perfume is delicious! Very fruity with a bit of floral. Not too sweet smelling, which I hate. I get compliments on this a lot! Great perfume for spring and summer. The bottle is well made and sturdy. I keep it in my purse and it gets knocked around a LOT and not a crack in it. Much much cheaper than what the department stores sell this for and this is the real thing. When I run out I&#x27;ll for sure get another bottle. I hope amazon does not stop selling this or the other Tom Hardy perfumes.</li>
            <li> Every one should try this give as gift there wife or girl friend. Thanks for the great perfume  happy holidays</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Ed Hardy perfume, and this particular fragrance, smells so good, nice size bottle and it was exact size it showed when ordering. I think Amazon has the best prices for their perfume compared to any store. I will def buy my perfume online again!</li>
            <li> Way less than in the store and my girlfriend loves it. I will never get perfume in the mall again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but  my girlfriend and I are not sure if it last as long as store bought. Although she still wears it often..</li>
            <li> I have to say this is my favorite from the Ed Hardy collection. I had heard this was a good fragrance, but bought it when my sister sprayed it at the store.</li>
            <li> I love this product the price and quick delivery in tact. I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> The perfume came after only two days!!!! It was wrapped very securely, with packing peanuts and bubble wrap, and hadn&#x27;t been opened until I opened it. I love the smell so much. Flowery perfumes annoy me, but this one is the perfect amount of sweet. You should buy this. Right now. Do it. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Ed Hardy.......</li>
            <li> Every time I wear Hearts n Daggers .... I get compliments. This is one of my favs to wear and it last all day!!!</li>
