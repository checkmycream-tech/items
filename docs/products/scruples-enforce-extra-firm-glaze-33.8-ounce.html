            <li>I was just looking for a better way to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li>That is actually better than the pump because you have more control over the amount you get out each time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Scruples is one of my favorite hair products.  </li>
            <li>I love it for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have always purchased this product through my beauty salon in the light colored bottle.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 5 years and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, Thanks for not changing!!</li>
            <li>Really helps my fine hair hold its shape.</li>
            <li>Love this glaze, it holds my fine hair in place as well as giving it extra shine.</li>
            <li>worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I saved the old pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and hope it will continue to be available for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the product was shown as a pump bottle on Amazon and a large squeeze bottle was delivered instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the large size and thought it had a pump like the picture</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and really like it</li>
            <li>thanks</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>This time it came on a large black bottle with a flip open top not a pump.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd large bottle I have bought.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find the old scruples again.</li>
            <li>but this black bottle smells different and is not as thick or effective.</li>
            <li>Less expensive than from a salon and more convient to order as much as you need and have it all at once.</li>

            <li> I have natural curly hair and this is th only thing I have found that will tame it controls the frizzy</li>
            <li> I tried to find it locally myself and couldn&#x27;t, so I tried other hair gels but they all dried flaky on my naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li> Others are less expensive, but this is worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place and does not make it sticky as some other products do.</li>
            <li> It weighs my hair down</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> This one holds well without being stiff.</li>
            <li> I have ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> Just hard to find.</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair.  </li>

            <li> Excellent...used as a refill</li>
            <li> Great product! Really helps my fine hair hold its shape. Others are less expensive, but this is worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> This is the best glaze to manage hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 15 years... Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product. It holds my hair in place and does not make it sticky as some other products do.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair.  This is the one product I use to keep the frizz away when I wear it curly.  Nothing compares</li>
            <li> I already use this product. I was just looking for a better way to purchase it. Glad I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased this product through my beauty salon in the light colored bottle. I took the chance online but this black bottle smells different and is not as thick or effective. I believe this might be an after market item?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years.  This is the 2nd large bottle I have bought.  Good value ... I just refill my smaller pump dispenser as needed.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and this is th only thing I have found that will tame it controls the frizzy</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and really like it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He has used it for years and loves it. This time it came on a large black bottle with a flip open top not a pump. That is actually better than the pump because you have more control over the amount you get out each time. It holds his hair in place no matter what the weather. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, Thanks for not changing!!</li>
            <li> great that i can get it in a volume so don&#x27;t have to run to the store often !!  thanks</li>
            <li> Less expensive than from a salon and more convient to order as much as you need and have it all at once.</li>
            <li> An excellent value for an excellent  product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and hope it will continue to be available for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Scruples Enforce Glaze for 18 years and was purchasing it thru my hairdresser until she informed me that her local contact had moved out of state. I tried to find it locally myself and couldn&#x27;t, so I tried other hair gels but they all dried flaky on my naturally curly hair!  So needless to say, I was thrilled to see that I could purchase it thru Amazon!  I highly recommend this product for naturally curly hair! It uniforms my curls better and gets rid of the frizzies!</li>
            <li> my hair-cutter gave me a sample of this product and it was the best hair product I had ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the product was shown as a pump bottle on Amazon and a large squeeze bottle was delivered instead.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to transfer to another smaller pump bottle myself....</li>
            <li> Have used for along while. Only product that will keep my hair right. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Just hard to find. Not sticky or heavy. I got the large size and thought it had a pump like the picture showed but no pump just regular cap. Glad I saved the old pump.</li>
            <li> Scruples is one of my favorite hair products.  Always works as I expect it too.  This one holds well without being stiff.</li>
            <li> I would give this no stars if I could. I have been using scruples for years. I don&#x27;t know why they changed their formula. Now I don&#x27;t have another option. This gel is like glue. It weighs my hair down and I have to wash my hair very soon for a feeling of heavy and smelly product. I wish I could find the old scruples again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product - I will use it again. I like using Amazon.com and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Love this glaze, it holds my fine hair in place as well as giving it extra shine. I have used this product for more than 5 years and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot. I have ordered in the past.I love it for my hair.</li>
