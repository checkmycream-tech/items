            <li>Kenra Volume Spray holds great and washes out of your hair easy.  </li>
            <li>A great product for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Effective product</li>
            <li>I love the hairspray, but the packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li>You have to loosen it with a warm water soak, but eventually even that doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>Bought this hairspray after reading many good reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>and I find Kenra holds my style really nicely and still allows some movement too</li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>I like the spray because it does not bother my allergies to scents and it holds my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, not too strong or too chemical of a smell, it holds well</li>
            <li>Love Kenra, love the price!</li>
            <li>A good fine mist hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, hold is strong, love it!</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent...tried so many products....</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent to it and holds ALL day :)</li>
            <li>I chose a five star rating for this harispray cause it is by far the best products on the market.  </li>
            <li>I had tried L&#x27;Oreal, Tresemme, Suave, Vidal Sassoon, Wella hair sprays but by far this is the best in terms of hold and flexibility.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, my hair is so soft but still has the hold I need to keep my curls perfectly curled.</li>
            <li>and I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very, very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this hairspray!</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Kenra for many years, and I can tell you, this is not Kenra 25.  </li>
            <li>The Kenra gave me incredible volume and still a soft hold.   </li>
            <li>I love this product BUT, the spray nozzle keeps falling off</li>
            <li>I have used this hairspray for years now and have reordered many times.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite hair spray.  </li>

            <li>I knew this was great hairspray as I&#x27;ve bought it before but refrained from using it too much</li>
            <li>Love the 2 pack . . .</li>
            <li>I love Kenra and it is all I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and after I curl my hair to get more body and control.  </li>

            <li>Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for quite a well and have not found one better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s infinitely better than what you can find at Target.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.....</li>
            <li>and I bought some from her because I was so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It is not horribly sticky and one can lasts for months.</li>
            <li>I love using this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>My favorite for 20 years.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love Kenra products.  </li>
            <li>love this product...</li>
            <li>It even give the hair a shine and healthy look.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love all Kendra products, but the hairspray is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Try all Kendra products, you will love them,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>boy I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine ever finding anything better.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Hair Spray.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and  I think it is the best.</li>
            <li>I originally get this from my hairdresser, but the price for 2 was cheaper!</li>
            <li>Most hair sprays set up like cement, but Kenra hair spray is light and holds, but still lets your hair move some</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of hairspray, but this one is hands down the best out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this one is just the right hold for flexibility but with good consistent hold all day.  </li>
            <li>Easily brushes out.</li>
            <li>Strong hold without the build up.</li>
            <li>Strong hold, no stiffness.</li>
            <li>Fine, although a surprise.</li>
            <li>As I just noted on a previous reviewer&#x27;s comments, I found Kenra to be THE best hairspray on the planet!</li>
            <li>Fulfilled order quickly and I am so glad I can order this in packs of two.</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold with a light feel.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray, hands down!</li>
            <li>I trusted the reviews that this hairspray is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I use cheap hairspray when I&#x27;ll be at home all day but use this if I want my hair to hold</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>cuz it really offered nice volume, yet it didn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in a travel size</li>
            <li>I promise if you are after strong hold times, and a clean after feeling, this is what you want to pick up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best hairspray for a firm spray.</li>
            <li>price is great with Amazon compared to purchasing at a local retail store.  </li>
            <li>This spray is both light and holds well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth paying more than the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>It is good hair spray and I revceived it at my door in just a few days and the price was good for 2.</li>
            <li>I frequently receive compliments about how \\&quot;good I smell\\&quot; and \\&quot;what is it that you&#x27;re wearing?\\</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and straight.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and Kenra Volume Spray hold very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is a very good spray.</li>
            <li>There is a reason that it is popular with professional stylists.  </li>
            <li>So......wish some of you ladies who love it so much had these two cans that will probably go in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 2 pack, and neither can is true Kenra 25.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt require as much to get a better hold.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray and it came so fast.</li>
            <li>So I was glad to find it so reasonably priced on Amazon and have been ordering it ever since and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>On a final note -- one of the things I liked a lot about Kenra was how easily it washed out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The best hairspray I&#x27;ve used for my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The product is perfect for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>When I order it, it comes quickly which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>I did have an issue with packaging that was quickly resolved</li>
            <li>She normally gets it from her hairdresser but bought it here since it was notably cheaper.</li>
            <li>It has great hold without weighing my hair down or making it sticky.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this particular hairspray, you will love it!  </li>
            <li>I love how strong this holds, but at the same time keeps my hair flexible.  </li>
            <li>Btw... Check out the \\&quot;Enzo Milano\\&quot; curling rod if you want AMAZING curls or waves that last for days!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but really holds hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Pricey, worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My orders of this product are always good, although these two came in breast cancer pink bottles.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason it wins awards from hair stylists...</li>
            <li>IS WORTH ITS PRICE.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, holds naturally all day, combs out and doesn&#x27;t require a washing every day - what more can I say?  </li>
            <li>Always use this hair spray and never a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Works best on my thin, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li>but I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so powerful.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair spray - holds naturally.</li>
            <li>This product has great holding power without making hair stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li>I learned quickly to use very sparingly!</li>
            <li>Needed a hairspray that was strong enough to hold, yet without a strong &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray - it has a firm hold, but washes out very easily, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Received hair spray right away.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and love this product!</li>
            <li>Great for fine, thin hair.....don&#x27;t overspray.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave my very fine hair sticky or geasey the next day.</li>
            <li>All products are very effective on my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lightweight and still holds, which is very important in the deep south.</li>
            <li>Very fast service.</li>
            <li>It holds without being too stiff, has a decent scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, and the price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li>Many times I don&#x27;t need to reapply the next day</li>
            <li>I am a first time user and this was recommended to me</li>
            <li>I love Kenra Hairspray, I will never go back to another hairspray.</li>
            <li>I had used a different product for years but was introduced to the Kenra product and like it even better.  </li>
            <li>I really love that it has next to no scent</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others, and this is my regular go to every time.</li>
            <li>I really like Kenra products!</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with the second one</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It will really hold your hairstyle in place!</li>
            <li>The spray keeps your looking good and holds with out that heavy spray that coats the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other name brands but this is by far the best hold for my hair.</li>
            <li>I had been using Sebastian shaper for a long time and glad I switched.</li>
            <li>this is the first hair spray I have used that really delivers...</li>
            <li>It dries fast making styling simpler, and pairs up well with hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have gotten this at a salon in the past and this came well packaged and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in both dry climates and in more humid areas and it works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, yet it&#x27;s strong enough to make time stand still.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li>is very high...</li>
            <li>Gives good hold but doesn&#x27;t make hair hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I really does hold and last and resists humidity which is important in my part of the South.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, but my curls still last all day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping was also a plus.</li>
            <li>It holds without adding weight and really helps lock in styles, even in humidity.</li>
            <li>I use often and really like this spray.</li>
            <li>I have tried others and haven&#x27;t found another that I like as much.</li>
            <li>If you really hit a spot, it will stay put all day with no worries.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this product of Amazon!</li>
            <li>it do much</li>
            <li>This hair spray does the trick - holds the style without feeling like you have too much on your hair.</li>
            <li>but I really cannot stand the smell... imagine the hair styling product smell in the 80&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>wasted many dollars to find the right one.</li>
            <li>Same as the mouse - my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas where it&#x27;s really humid - not a problem with this spray.</li>
            <li>Super sticky even when I used next to nothing.</li>
            <li>For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried Kenra Classic Volume hairspray you need to try it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>As I browse through the brands and feedback, I&#x27;m back to Kenra because the reviews are still stellar after all these years!</li>
            <li>I often find this in all spay type products but for the price, I&#x27;d expect a better design since basically, you&#x27;re not able to use the whole can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge discount over the salon, but love the convenience of amazon.</li>
            <li>No hard stiffness, just shiny hold.</li>
            <li>I live in the South and humidity</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have used this hairspray for years and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Also nice subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>buy the two smaller bottles, because that black nozzle clogs very easily and often.  </li>
            <li>The hold is great without being stiff and it doesn&#x27;t give you hair that dried out feeling.  </li>
            <li>it feels soft like I don&#x27;t even use hairspray!</li>
            <li>Your hair will stay fixed all day!</li>
            <li>I even bought a bottle for each of my friends this past Christmas because I wanted to share the love.</li>
            <li>Arrives quickly, neatly wrapped, and the large quantity lasts me for a few months.  </li>
            <li>Like most women I use hair spray daily and without it my hair would be a mess within ah hour.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl for very long.</li>
            <li>I like this size because it fits in my travel case (checked luggage) and is much easier to hold than the larger size.</li>
            <li>This is delivered directly to my door.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and moves without losing style.</li>
            <li>I am working with many products to help my limp hair and this is only one.</li>
            <li>One can goes a long way, less it more when using this.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is a little sticky and hard to get out of your hair, but worth it for my perfect wedding day look!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light but has tremondous holding power and has little or no smell!  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, or crisp or look wet.</li>
            <li>Last year while visiting my sister in Pennsylvania, she gave me her Kenra Volume Spray that she had purchased from her hairdresser because she didn&#x27;t like such a large can.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>everyone asks me how I get my hair to stay in place without looking like I used a whole bottle of hairspray, it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>get a crooked and uneven light spray.  </li>
            <li>The major plus is the fact that it is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>The hairspray is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out the hair either.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I sprayed of this, it only weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li>I use it to style my thin, fine hair - works</li>
            <li>Strong hold without being stiff, sticky, or flaky !!!</li>

            <li> I love this hair spray!</li>
            <li> Kenra Volume Spray holds great and washes out of your hair easy.  </li>
            <li> A great product for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Effective product</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray, but the packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
            <li> You have to loosen it with a warm water soak, but eventually even that doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> Bought this hairspray after reading many good reviews on it.  </li>
            <li> and I find Kenra holds my style really nicely and still allows some movement too</li>
            <li> Nice scent</li>
            <li> I like the spray because it does not bother my allergies to scents and it holds my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, not too strong or too chemical of a smell, it holds well</li>
            <li> Love Kenra, love the price!</li>
            <li> A good fine mist hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, hold is strong, love it!</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent...tried so many products....</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent to it and holds ALL day :)</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating for this harispray cause it is by far the best products on the market.  </li>
            <li> I had tried L&#x27;Oreal, Tresemme, Suave, Vidal Sassoon, Wella hair sprays but by far this is the best in terms of hold and flexibility.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, my hair is so soft but still has the hold I need to keep my curls perfectly curled.</li>
            <li> and I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very, very fine hair</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this hairspray!</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kenra for many years, and I can tell you, this is not Kenra 25.  </li>
            <li> The Kenra gave me incredible volume and still a soft hold.   </li>
            <li> I love this product BUT, the spray nozzle keeps falling off</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years now and have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>

            <li> I love this product and have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> Best overall hairspray on the market!</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products, however this hairspray holds in all types of weather...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell too.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li> love, love and did I saw I love this product</li>
            <li> I knew this was great hairspray as I&#x27;ve bought it before but refrained from using it too much</li>
            <li> Love the 2 pack . . .</li>
            <li> I love Kenra and it is all I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and after I curl my hair to get more body and control.  </li>
            <li> Kenra Volume Spray 25 is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Kenra Volume Spray 25 for many years.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you will love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite a well and have not found one better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s infinitely better than what you can find at Target.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.....</li>
            <li> and I bought some from her because I was so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It is not horribly sticky and one can lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I love using this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> My favorite for 20 years.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love Kenra products.  </li>
            <li> love this product...</li>
            <li> It even give the hair a shine and healthy look.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love all Kendra products, but the hairspray is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Try all Kendra products, you will love them,</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> boy I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever finding anything better.</li>
            <li> I love this spray.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Hair Spray.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and  I think it is the best.</li>
            <li> I originally get this from my hairdresser, but the price for 2 was cheaper!</li>
            <li> Most hair sprays set up like cement, but Kenra hair spray is light and holds, but still lets your hair move some</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of hairspray, but this one is hands down the best out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this one is just the right hold for flexibility but with good consistent hold all day.  </li>
            <li> Easily brushes out.</li>
            <li> Strong hold without the build up.</li>
            <li> Strong hold, no stiffness.</li>
            <li> Fine, although a surprise.</li>
            <li> As I just noted on a previous reviewer&#x27;s comments, I found Kenra to be THE best hairspray on the planet!</li>
            <li> Fulfilled order quickly and I am so glad I can order this in packs of two.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold with a light feel.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray, hands down!</li>
            <li> I trusted the reviews that this hairspray is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I use cheap hairspray when I&#x27;ll be at home all day but use this if I want my hair to hold</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> cuz it really offered nice volume, yet it didn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available in a travel size</li>
            <li> I promise if you are after strong hold times, and a clean after feeling, this is what you want to pick up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hairspray for a firm spray.</li>
            <li> price is great with Amazon compared to purchasing at a local retail store.  </li>
            <li> This spray is both light and holds well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth paying more than the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> It is good hair spray and I revceived it at my door in just a few days and the price was good for 2.</li>
            <li> I frequently receive compliments about how \\&quot;good I smell\\&quot; and \\&quot;what is it that you&#x27;re wearing?\\</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and straight.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and Kenra Volume Spray hold very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is a very good spray.</li>
            <li> There is a reason that it is popular with professional stylists.  </li>
            <li> So......wish some of you ladies who love it so much had these two cans that will probably go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 2 pack, and neither can is true Kenra 25.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt require as much to get a better hold.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray and it came so fast.</li>
            <li> So I was glad to find it so reasonably priced on Amazon and have been ordering it ever since and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> On a final note -- one of the things I liked a lot about Kenra was how easily it washed out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray I&#x27;ve used for my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> When I order it, it comes quickly which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I did have an issue with packaging that was quickly resolved</li>
            <li> She normally gets it from her hairdresser but bought it here since it was notably cheaper.</li>
            <li> It has great hold without weighing my hair down or making it sticky.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this particular hairspray, you will love it!  </li>
            <li> I love how strong this holds, but at the same time keeps my hair flexible.  </li>
            <li> Btw... Check out the \\&quot;Enzo Milano\\&quot; curling rod if you want AMAZING curls or waves that last for days!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but really holds hair in place.  </li>
            <li> Pricey, worth every penny</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My orders of this product are always good, although these two came in breast cancer pink bottles.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it wins awards from hair stylists...</li>
            <li> IS WORTH ITS PRICE.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, holds naturally all day, combs out and doesn&#x27;t require a washing every day - what more can I say?  </li>
            <li> Always use this hair spray and never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Works best on my thin, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li> but I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so powerful.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray - holds naturally.</li>
            <li> This product has great holding power without making hair stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I learned quickly to use very sparingly!</li>
            <li> Needed a hairspray that was strong enough to hold, yet without a strong &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray - it has a firm hold, but washes out very easily, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Received hair spray right away.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and love this product!</li>
            <li> Great for fine, thin hair.....don&#x27;t overspray.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave my very fine hair sticky or geasey the next day.</li>
            <li> All products are very effective on my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lightweight and still holds, which is very important in the deep south.</li>
            <li> Very fast service.</li>
            <li> It holds without being too stiff, has a decent scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, and the price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> Many times I don&#x27;t need to reapply the next day</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and this was recommended to me</li>
            <li> I love Kenra Hairspray, I will never go back to another hairspray.</li>
            <li> I had used a different product for years but was introduced to the Kenra product and like it even better.  </li>
            <li> I really love that it has next to no scent</li>
            <li> I have tried so many others, and this is my regular go to every time.</li>
            <li> I really like Kenra products!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with the second one</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It will really hold your hairstyle in place!</li>
            <li> The spray keeps your looking good and holds with out that heavy spray that coats the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other name brands but this is by far the best hold for my hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using Sebastian shaper for a long time and glad I switched.</li>
            <li> this is the first hair spray I have used that really delivers...</li>
            <li> It dries fast making styling simpler, and pairs up well with hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have gotten this at a salon in the past and this came well packaged and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in both dry climates and in more humid areas and it works well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, yet it&#x27;s strong enough to make time stand still.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> is very high...</li>
            <li> Gives good hold but doesn&#x27;t make hair hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li> I really does hold and last and resists humidity which is important in my part of the South.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, but my curls still last all day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was also a plus.</li>
            <li> It holds without adding weight and really helps lock in styles, even in humidity.</li>
            <li> I use often and really like this spray.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and haven&#x27;t found another that I like as much.</li>
            <li> If you really hit a spot, it will stay put all day with no worries.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this product of Amazon!</li>
            <li> it do much</li>
            <li> This hair spray does the trick - holds the style without feeling like you have too much on your hair.</li>
            <li> but I really cannot stand the smell... imagine the hair styling product smell in the 80&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> wasted many dollars to find the right one.</li>
            <li> Same as the mouse - my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas where it&#x27;s really humid - not a problem with this spray.</li>
            <li> Super sticky even when I used next to nothing.</li>
            <li> For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried Kenra Classic Volume hairspray you need to try it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> As I browse through the brands and feedback, I&#x27;m back to Kenra because the reviews are still stellar after all these years!</li>
            <li> I often find this in all spay type products but for the price, I&#x27;d expect a better design since basically, you&#x27;re not able to use the whole can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge discount over the salon, but love the convenience of amazon.</li>
            <li> No hard stiffness, just shiny hold.</li>
            <li> I live in the South and humidity</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Also nice subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> buy the two smaller bottles, because that black nozzle clogs very easily and often.  </li>
            <li> The hold is great without being stiff and it doesn&#x27;t give you hair that dried out feeling.  </li>
            <li> it feels soft like I don&#x27;t even use hairspray!</li>
            <li> Your hair will stay fixed all day!</li>
            <li> I even bought a bottle for each of my friends this past Christmas because I wanted to share the love.</li>
            <li> Arrives quickly, neatly wrapped, and the large quantity lasts me for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Like most women I use hair spray daily and without it my hair would be a mess within ah hour.</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl for very long.</li>
            <li> I like this size because it fits in my travel case (checked luggage) and is much easier to hold than the larger size.</li>
            <li> This is delivered directly to my door.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and moves without losing style.</li>
            <li> I am working with many products to help my limp hair and this is only one.</li>
            <li> One can goes a long way, less it more when using this.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little sticky and hard to get out of your hair, but worth it for my perfect wedding day look!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light but has tremondous holding power and has little or no smell!  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, or crisp or look wet.</li>
            <li> Last year while visiting my sister in Pennsylvania, she gave me her Kenra Volume Spray that she had purchased from her hairdresser because she didn&#x27;t like such a large can.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> everyone asks me how I get my hair to stay in place without looking like I used a whole bottle of hairspray, it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> get a crooked and uneven light spray.  </li>
            <li> The major plus is the fact that it is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> The hairspray is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out the hair either.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I sprayed of this, it only weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use it to style my thin, fine hair - works</li>
            <li> Strong hold without being stiff, sticky, or flaky !!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but just not pleasant one.</li>
            <li> For me, it takes the place of several products and doesn&#x27;t leave me with flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered in the past and ended up with broken caps or dents, which doesn&#x27;t affect the product, but it was kind of trashy...</li>
            <li> I love it - and you&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap, nasty junk once you try it.  </li>
            <li> my hair is not fly away, frizzy or flat just full of volume.  </li>
            <li> Voted #1 for a few years now for product you cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of hairsprays and never loved one as much as this!  </li>
            <li> Long time user of this product.  </li>
            <li> lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Normally you&#x27;d have to be careful not to over spray, as it would make your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> It smells bad (like a really strong old type hairspray smell),  </li>
            <li> It reduces the frizzies and holds well for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hairsprays and this one has worked really well with my thin hair - giving it lots of volume that lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has fine hard to hold hair!!!</li>
            <li> and this is the only hairspray that does not mat down my hair - or absorb the moisture from the air but holds my hair in place</li>
            <li> Some other sprays I have used can leave your hair feeling gross a few hours in or even the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair cut very short for the past 15 years or so and have used American Crew styling products for texture and control.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to get all day hold.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair and this not only holds it in place, without being stiff, it also keeps it from frizzing in humid weather.</li>
            <li> It does not give the hold I need for my hair, and also the smell is overwhelmingly strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Ships quickly and less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li> It holds the hair in place and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> when I use this hairspray it does not flake if I use an iron after, it does not leave a film on your hair like other hairsprays.</li>
            <li> , you can brush out at the end of the day (unlike other hair sprays</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this product from Walmart local salon, but I found it cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> Would not use any other hair spray.</li>
            <li> There are not many hairsprays that can boast that - I only found one and they changed the formula to where I can not use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> it down at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hairspray and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t sticky and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> Every day I straighten my hair with a straightener, I like to spray a little bit of hairspray underneath at the roots to give it volume that holds,</li>
            <li> Just need to use a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy but holds well.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It holds firmly, while letting you still run your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Isnt heavy on the hair &amp; doesnt leave any residue or stickyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s not available anywhere nearby</li>
            <li> After using a few times the nozzle broke...</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair stiff looking.</li>
            <li> Does well holding hair in place without having that stiff feel.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave the product three stars is that I was unable to finish the can because the sprayer stopped working on both cans.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the can as my hands are small and the larger size containers are uncomfortable for me to hold.</li>
            <li> I try to use it small amount, yet the smell just takes over me.</li>
            <li> I keep on going back to it even though its expensive.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place without being to stiff!</li>
            <li> and it seems to dull</li>
            <li> And too late I see that hairspray is non returnable.  </li>
            <li> I buy at least two at a time</li>
            <li> Not worth the price and leaves a weird residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and limp hair and it is hard to  hold.</li>
            <li> , I get so sick of having to open a window everytime I use hairspray.</li>
            <li> Kenra hairspray does have a faint, but not strong, perfume odor.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, but holds and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> I hate the fact that after using about 2/3&#x27;s of the can, the nozzle stops working properly.</li>
            <li> If you just spray a thin coat it keeps hair in control.  </li>
            <li> and I hate spending my off time shopping for products that I use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea!</li>
            <li> When I bought the largest size bottle, eventually the nozzle wouldn&#x27;t be fix-able, and some of this (extremely expensive) hair spray went to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a firm hold spray I use for keeping an upswept hairdo in place or keeping the hair that frames my face from falling forward and being annoying.</li>
            <li> The travel size is way too expensive per ounce.</li>
            <li> Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Very poor design.</li>
            <li> I believe this to be a fake!</li>
            <li> They too are obsessed!</li>
            <li> VERY expensive in the salon, so I buy it in bulk.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.....</li>
            <li> It was horrible, and I will be throwing away both cans.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible and you can not run away from it once it is in your hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There is a reason that it is popular with professional stylists.  No crunchy residue but holds my styles.</li>
            <li> Received hair spray right away.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before.  Good stuff and I didn&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;chase&amp;#34; it down at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me one time and I was hooked.  It has incredible holding power and the best part is not sticky film left on your hair . Many times I don&#x27;t need to reapply the next day it&#x27;s still holding .LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not &amp;#34;dull your hair&amp;#34;. It smells wonderful and also makes your hair very shiny! A must have! Try it, you will love it</li>
            <li> I trusted the reviews that this hairspray is fabulous.  Ugh.  It does nothing for my hair.  It&#x27;s like I haven&#x27;t even used hairspray.  And too late I see that hairspray is non returnable.  So......wish some of you ladies who love it so much had these two cans that will probably go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Great product..I am a first time user and this was recommended to me and I love it!</li>
            <li> I received this item in 2 days! I love Kenra Hairspray, I will never go back to another hairspray. It&#x27;s light weight, but my curls still last all day.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is awesome! It smells good, not too strong or too chemical of a smell, it holds well and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, or crisp or look wet. Every day I straighten my hair with a straightener, I like to spray a little bit of hairspray underneath at the roots to give it volume that holds, when I use this hairspray it does not flake if I use an iron after, it does not leave a film on your hair like other hairsprays. I spray my hair /bangs after straightening and it leaves my hair shiny everyone asks me how I get my hair to stay in place without looking like I used a whole bottle of hairspray, it lasts all day long! even in humidity this hairspray does wonders! I love it! my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any hairspray or residue in it it feels soft like I don&#x27;t even use hairspray!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful hair spray</li>
            <li> Best hairspray on earth. Lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kenra for many years, and I can tell you, this is not Kenra 25.  I ordered the 2 pack, and neither can is true Kenra 25.  It has a different scent and there&#x27;s no hold whatsoever. Normally you&#x27;d have to be careful not to over spray, as it would make your hair stiff. No matter how much I sprayed of this, it only weighed my hair down. It was horrible, and I will be throwing away both cans.</li>
            <li> Same as the mouse - my hair did not feel clean. For this price these are not the results I was looking for</li>
            <li> I had been using Sebastian shaper for a long time and glad I switched. The Kenra gave me incredible volume and still a soft hold.   I will reorder this and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray of all time! So happy to find it on Amazon. Fulfilled order quickly and I am so glad I can order this in packs of two.</li>
            <li> I love this product BUT, the spray nozzle keeps falling off</li>
            <li> A great product for fine hair.  Keeps style in place all day regardless of weather conditions.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years now and have reordered many times. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hairspray and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray I&#x27;ve used for my thin, fine hair. My hairdresser introduced me to this product. It keeps my hair \\&quot;up\\&quot; and in place all day without giving it the lacquered look. I use cheap hairspray when I&#x27;ll be at home all day but use this if I want my hair to hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone recently (Nov 2013) asked for an opinion on the perfume content of the Kenra spray, but I cannot find the email asking for my input. Here it is in case that person finds this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Kenra hairspray does have a faint, but not strong, perfume odor. My critical husband does not object, and the perfume dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;  I shampoo with Thermafuse (volume), use Unite Boosta Spray before styling, and then spray with Kenra Volume Spray 25. All products are very effective on my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite hair spray.  Lightweight yet holds well...even on thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Kenra for years, great staying power, love this hairspray.  I would highly recommend this product.  Does not dry out the hair either.</li>
            <li> Great price. Effective product</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray, but the packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  The nozzles had fallen off of both cans during shipping and would not stay on properly when I replaced them.  The hairspray is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s not too heavy but holds well.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!  Have been using this for a few years.  I like how it brushes out and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling tacky!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product. Doesnt require as much to get a better hold. Fast shipping was also a plus.</li>
            <li> This product has great holding power without making hair stiff and sticky.  The only reason I gave the product three stars is that I was unable to finish the can because the sprayer stopped working on both cans.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.....both the spray caps came off and now even when we try to set them back  get a crooked and uneven light spray.  Would not suggest you purchase these from  this vendor.  I have used Kendra for a several years without problem....but purchased from a beauty suppy house that was where I lived.  I had moved,  so looked  for them online and thought I&#x27;d get them here!  Not a good idea!</li>
            <li> It was great for my hair. I have long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl for very long. This did the trick and kept my wedding day hairdo in place. My only complaint is that it is a little sticky and hard to get out of your hair, but worth it for my perfect wedding day look!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray and it came so fast. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells good, great for ultra hold</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place without being to stiff! Great even on humid sticky days! I live in the South and humidity is very high...this is the first hair spray I have used that really delivers...my hair is not fly away, frizzy or flat just full of volume.  Love it</li>
            <li> I had used a different product for years but was introduced to the Kenra product and like it even better.  My hair is very fine and it works extremely well.  When I order it, it comes quickly which I appreciate.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair spray.  It holds firmly, while letting you still run your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the two smaller bottles, because that black nozzle clogs very easily and often.  You have to loosen it with a warm water soak, but eventually even that doesn&#x27;t help.  When I bought the largest size bottle, eventually the nozzle wouldn&#x27;t be fix-able, and some of this (extremely expensive) hair spray went to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never found anything to compare to Kenra.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, hold is strong, love it! I highly reccomend this particular hairspray, you will love it!  Pricey, worth every penny</li>
            <li> great hairspray, smells good, not too strong of a smell.  has great hold.  dries out hair like all hairspray.  I only use it on date night so that my hair does not get damaged from hairspray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kenra hairspray for 20 years.  I love it - and you&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap, nasty junk once you try it.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I started using Kenra on a fluke when my mom gave me some to try.  I love it.  It has great hold without weighing my hair down or making it sticky.  I especially love that this product is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray EVER!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray out there for fine hair. It holds without adding weight and really helps lock in styles, even in humidity. It only takes a little bit to get all day hold. I really love that it has next to no scent, I get so sick of having to open a window everytime I use hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for many years.  My hair is very fine and straight. Spraying on my hair after I have used curling irons or rollers before comb out gives me body and hold.  After styling my hair, I use spray again to keep my style.  For me, it takes the place of several products and doesn&#x27;t leave me with flat hair.  I see see the results the next day.  It is my go to product.</li>
            <li> Love Kenra, love the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for years.  It is the best I have found.  Does not leave hair stiff looking.</li>
            <li> Will be re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> Best overall hairspray on the market! Strong hold without the build up.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair dresser.  I found the best price for this good product here on this web site.</li>
            <li> Best ever!  My hairdresser recommended it to me and have been using it ever since!  Holds my hair with no order or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I am working with many products to help my limp hair and this is only one. It is helping somewhat but it remains to be seen if it is the answer to my problem.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used. I have tried many many products, however this hairspray holds in all types of weather... humidity of Atlanta, Jamaica, and Mexico.. as well as Florida.. I used it for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and my hair was perfect all day!!!!  I recommend this to anyone who has fine hard to hold hair!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this hairspray after reading many good reviews on it.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.  It smells bad (like a really strong old type hairspray smell),  it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair well and I have very fine hair and it seems to dull it.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used only this product for several years, for a very simple reason - it works !! Strong hold without being stiff, sticky, or flaky !!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now  I think its great. I have recommend it to my sister.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It reduces the frizzies and holds well for a very long time. Do not miss out.</li>
            <li> My orders of this product are always good, although these two came in breast cancer pink bottles.  Fine, although a surprise.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it all the time. I originally get this from my hairdresser, but the price for 2 was cheaper! I will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray.  I have tried so many others, and this is my regular go to every time.</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome!  It is not too heavy, but holds and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or dirty. Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> The best hair spray ever.</li>
            <li> I love this spray it&#x27;s light but has tremondous holding power and has little or no smell!  I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> The wife won&#x27;t use anything else.  This is the only place I can get two for the price of one.  In fact I need to order more today.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it wins awards from hair stylists...it&#x27;s lightweight and still holds, which is very important in the deep south. Thank you, Kenra!</li>
            <li> holds your hair perfectly and washes out easily.  I live in Texas where it&#x27;s really humid - not a problem with this spray.</li>
            <li> Love it ..holds hair in place but your can still comb through it!</li>
            <li> ★★★★★★★★★★thank you ★★★★★★★★★★</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and Kenra Volume Spray hold very well.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair spray that works and this is the best I have been able to find. I like the size of the can as my hands are small and the larger size containers are uncomfortable for me to hold.</li>
            <li> Kenra is the best hair spray I have ever used, it does flake when combed through hair.  Great try it!</li>
            <li> No buildup and good hold.  Best hairspray I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is good hair spray and I revceived it at my door in just a few days and the price was good for 2.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work wonderfully, it smells delicious!  I frequently receive compliments about how \\&quot;good I smell\\&quot; and \\&quot;what is it that you&#x27;re wearing?\\&quot;  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried so many others.  Some smell better, but this stuff works the best.</li>
            <li> BEST HAIRSPRAY IN THE UNIVERSE!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE HAIRSPRAY! IS WORTH ITS PRICE.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this hairspray even at any price.  I&#x27;ve tried many and this one is just the right hold for flexibility but with good consistent hold all day.  I did have an issue with packaging that was quickly resolved so I would recommend this product from this vendor.</li>
            <li> This is a great finishing spray. Isnt heavy on the hair &amp; doesnt leave any residue or stickyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you can brush out at the end of the day (unlike other hair sprays/finishing sprays).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this &amp; great value for money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it to style my thin, fine hair - works well. I hate the fact that after using about 2/3&#x27;s of the can, the nozzle stops working properly. Very poor design. I often find this in all spay type products but for the price, I&#x27;d expect a better design since basically, you&#x27;re not able to use the whole can. Just sayin...</li>
            <li> love this stuff! Strong hold, no stiffness.</li>
            <li> love this hair spray but cost too mufh</li>
            <li> Like most women I use hair spray daily and without it my hair would be a mess within ah hour. Last year while visiting my sister in Pennsylvania, she gave me her Kenra Volume Spray that she had purchased from her hairdresser because she didn&#x27;t like such a large can. So, I brought it home and thought, oh well, I&#x27;ll give it a try. I absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, holds naturally all day, combs out and doesn&#x27;t require a washing every day - what more can I say?  BUT it&#x27;s not available anywhere nearby and I&#x27;ve checked believe me. So I was glad to find it so reasonably priced on Amazon and have been ordering it ever since and will continue to do so. I definitely recommend this. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried every hair spray on the market. I am so glad I found this one. I have very thin and limp hair and it is hard to  hold. Most hair sprays set up like cement, but Kenra hair spray is light and holds, but still lets your hair move some so you don&#x27;t have helmet hair. Great product. I buy at least two at a time so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  Gives good hold but doesn&#x27;t make hair hard or sticky.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it. It is cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Long time user of this product.  Everything shipped perfect and timely.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS BUY THE KENRA 25 FORMULA.  IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li> Always use this hair spray and never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> love, love and did I saw I love this product</li>
            <li> The best hair spray at a good price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I knew this was great hairspray as I&#x27;ve bought it before but refrained from using it too much cause it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  This is a fantastic deal. If they keep the cost as is this will be my &#x27;go to&#x27; place.</li>
            <li> My order was incorrect. Only got 1 bottle. I ordered 4!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray!  No hard stiffness, just shiny hold.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this stuff regularly for years and swears by it. She normally gets it from her hairdresser but bought it here since it was notably cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used Kenra Volume Spray 25 for years.  It has a strong hold with a light feel.  The major plus is the fact that it is fragrance-free. I cannot wear scented hairspray.  This is the best.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is a very good spray.</li>
            <li> I used this for couple days and I am hating it already. It does not give the hold I need for my hair, and also the smell is overwhelmingly strong and unpleasant. I try to use it small amount, yet the smell just takes over me. yucky. I think I am going back to Sebastian Fierce cuz it really offered nice volume, yet it didn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> Kenra Volume Spray holds great and washes out of your hair easy.  Doesn&#x27;t build-up on your hair.  Love the 2 pack . . . lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> GREAT hairspray!  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.  I really like Kenra products!</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!  I have used it for 30+ years!</li>
            <li> After using a few times the nozzle broke... Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with the second one</li>
            <li> I will never use another hair spray. Great hold but feels weightless. Also nice subtle fragrance. It&#x27;s not a huge discount over the salon, but love the convenience of amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray! I have been using it for 3 years now and have not found anything that compares to it!</li>
            <li> I love Kenra and it is all I use on my hair.  I have very, very fine hair and I find Kenra holds my style really nicely and still allows some movement too so I dont have helmet hair.  I use this hair spray before and after I curl my hair to get more body and control.  I have used Kenra for about 4 years and I am a lover of this hairspray.</li>
            <li> this hairspray is the only one I buy.  Does not leave a film and holds and holds</li>
            <li> Best hairspray on market...have used for years! More affordable on Amazon than beauty supply places! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> the best hairspray on the market!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and love this product! It holds without being too stiff, has a decent scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, and the price on Amazon is great. Your hair will stay fixed all day! Btw... Check out the \\&quot;Enzo Milano\\&quot; curling rod if you want AMAZING curls or waves that last for days!![[ASIN:B00111K55C Enzo Milano Cilindrico Professional Clipless Curling Iron, Pink, 19mm]]</li>
            <li> This is my brand. Works best on my thin, baby-fine hair. Ships quickly and less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li> Super sticky even when I used next to nothing. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for fine, thin hair.....don&#x27;t overspray.  Has a nice scent...tried so many products....wasted many dollars to find the right one.</li>
            <li> As I just noted on a previous reviewer&#x27;s comments, I found Kenra to be THE best hairspray on the planet! It&#x27;s very lightweight, yet it&#x27;s strong enough to make time stand still. I&#x27;ve had my hair cut very short for the past 15 years or so and have used American Crew styling products for texture and control. But now that I&#x27;ve let my hair start to grow out again, I need hairspray. As I browse through the brands and feedback, I&#x27;m back to Kenra because the reviews are still stellar after all these years! On a final note -- one of the things I liked a lot about Kenra was how easily it washed out of my hair. It&#x27;s remarkable to think how well it holds in humidity, yet it washes off of hands and hair effortlessly. It&#x27;s PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this hairspray!</li>
            <li> Kenra Volume Spray 25 is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve tried others but always go back to Kenra. Hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I use often and really like this spray.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray, hands down! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Have been using for 10+ yrs....love it!  Keep making it Kenra the same way and Don&#x27;t change a thing.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product and never disappoints with its quality. I&#x27;ve tried several other name brands but this is by far the best hold for my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not want aerosol spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  It holds throughout everything while NOT looking like your hair is glued in place!  Doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair either!</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and can&#x27;t live without it.  I have tried others and haven&#x27;t found another that I like as much.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available in a travel size so I could take it in my carry on. This is the only spray that works in&lt;br /&gt;the coastal humidity of our climate. Spray in the morning and it works all day.</li>
            <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve known about this hairspray sooner.  I love how strong this holds, but at the same time keeps my hair flexible.  Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray that I ever want to use again.  If you just spray a thin coat it keeps hair in control.  If you really hit a spot, it will stay put all day with no worries.  Fast shipping... good packing</li>
            <li> this hairspray does the job !!!!!  all day hold works wonderful in humid weather wash out if your hair with no problem</li>
            <li> I have been using Kenra Volume Spray 25 for many years. This has a different scent to it and does not work as well as the Kenra I have been using. I believe this to be a fake! Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair.  This spray will hold my bangs for hours and hours.  I defiantly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried Kenra Classic Volume hairspray you need to try it. I guarantee you will love it.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray out there.  Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It smells good.  The hold is great without being stiff and it doesn&#x27;t give you hair that dried out feeling.  I have been using it for quite a well and have not found one better.</li>
            <li> This hair spray really is as great as the reviews say. It&#x27;s infinitely better than what you can find at Target. You do, in this case, get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> A good fine mist hairspray.  Does well holding hair in place without having that stiff feel.  Not the best for humid weather.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.....I&#x27;m a big fan of aerosol hairspray but can never find one that hits all the marks.  I follow a blog and this brand was recommended and I definitely see why!!! It has a nice scent to it and holds ALL day :)</li>
            <li> I like this product .  It keeps my hair in place even in humid weather.  I would recommend kenra volume spray 25.</li>
            <li> I watched a Youtube video and the lady mentioned how good Kenra Volume 25 is and I tried it. LOVE IT! This is my third order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating for this harispray cause it is by far the best products on the market.  I usually purchase this product from Walmart local salon, but I found it cheaper on Amazon plus I have an Amazon prime account so it was prime elegible and I received the product within two days. I highly recommend getting this product of Amazon!</li>
            <li> I learned quickly to use very sparingly! Nice scent but I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so powerful. Easily brushes out.</li>
            <li> Kristy uses this and I bought some from her because I was so pleased with it. I really does hold and last and resists humidity which is important in my part of the South. My daughter likes it too, and I bought an extra can for her. It is not horribly sticky and one can lasts for months. You will like this product, no doubt.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser started using this spray and I loved the results and have been&lt;br /&gt;using it for 2 months now...love it.</li>
            <li> Amazon almost always has this cheaper than any salon of specialty store I have seen. I promise if you are after strong hold times, and a clean after feeling, this is what you want to pick up. Some other sprays I have used can leave your hair feeling gross a few hours in or even the next day. This has been good to me. One can goes a long way, less it more when using this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray - holds naturally.</li>
            <li> Good smell . I like it do much</li>
            <li> I have gotten this at a salon in the past and this came well packaged and in good shape.  I like the spray because it does not bother my allergies to scents and it holds my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> This hair spray does the trick - holds the style without feeling like you have too much on your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray - it has a firm hold, but washes out very easily, and lasts forever. It dries fast making styling simpler, and pairs up well with hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;This seller was great - I got my order 3 days earlier than promised, and the cans were packaged well. I&#x27;ve ordered in the past and ended up with broken caps or dents, which doesn&#x27;t affect the product, but it was kind of trashy... this seller packaged the cans and taped on the caps so that they arrived perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love using this hairspray.  My favorite for 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have finally discovered how simple it is to order online in bulk.  This twopack arrived within two days --surprising me-- so I was very pleased with service.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hairsprays and this one has worked really well with my thin hair - giving it lots of volume that lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I have being using Kenra products for years.  The spray keeps your looking good and holds with out that heavy spray that coats the hair.</li>
            <li> Would not use any other hair spray. Will hold in any weather!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best.  Combable and can restyle  and spray the next day.  Adds incredible volume and shine. Great fragrance with no chemical smell. Voted #1 for a few years now for product you cannot live without. I know I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.  Just need to use a little. Try it and you&#x27;ll feel the same. 😊</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s perfect for my out of control curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of hairspray, but this one is hands down the best out there. It is a little pricey, but worth it! I have fine-thin hair.</li>
            <li> I use this hairspray all the time  It  does a great job.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best hair spray EVER, this is it!  VERY expensive in the salon, so I buy it in bulk.  Arrives quickly, neatly wrapped, and the large quantity lasts me for a few months.  LOVE this spray!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love Kenra products.  I use this spray to hold everything in place.  It smells great too.  I will continue to buy Kenra products.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price and leaves a weird residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> love this product...isn&#x27;t sticky and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> I had tried L&#x27;Oreal, Tresemme, Suave, Vidal Sassoon, Wella hair sprays but by far this is the best in terms of hold and flexibility. It even give the hair a shine and healthy look. but I really cannot stand the smell... imagine the hair styling product smell in the 80&#x27;s... that&#x27;s the smell of this hair spray. it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but just not pleasant one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hairspray for a firm spray.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have tried every hairspray out there. I have been on the hunt for years, until I was introduced to Kenra. And I am forever grateful! This hairspray holds perfectly and smells so good. Even though the hold is great, it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feelings like glue for the rest of the day. Once it dries, my hair is so soft but still has the hold I need to keep my curls perfectly curled. I even bought a bottle for each of my friends this past Christmas because I wanted to share the love. They too are obsessed!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. I keep on going back to it even though its expensive. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair and this is the only hairspray that does not mat down my hair - or absorb the moisture from the air but holds my hair in place but I can also brush it out. There are not many hairsprays that can boast that - I only found one and they changed the formula to where I can not use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Love all Kendra products, but the hairspray is my favorite. price is great with Amazon compared to purchasing at a local retail store.  Try all Kendra products, you will love them,</li>
            <li> This is a firm hold spray I use for keeping an upswept hairdo in place or keeping the hair that frames my face from falling forward and being annoying. If you want a &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34; hold, try something else. I like this size because it fits in my travel case (checked luggage) and is much easier to hold than the larger size. The travel size is way too expensive per ounce.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the good reviews but will never spray it again.  The smell is terrible and you can not run away from it once it is in your hair. I will wash it away as soon as I return home.</li>
            <li> The only hair spray that works for me.  I have frizzy curly hair and this not only holds it in place, without being stiff, it also keeps it from frizzing in humid weather. Love it.</li>
            <li> Big hair girl here, and boy I love this hairspray.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever finding anything better.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect for my fine thin hair.  However, one bottom would not spray..</li>
            <li> Needed a hairspray that was strong enough to hold, yet without a strong &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and order it. The best hair spray ever!!!!! I can comb thru my hair after spraying and no build up.  I have never had that.  It holds the hair in place and a little goes a long way.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This spray is both light and holds well.  It also has a(subtle) great fragrance which reminds me of tuberose or tropical flowers.  I&#x27;ve used it in both dry climates and in more humid areas and it works well.  It&#x27;s worth paying more than the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I love this spray.  It&#x27;s light but really holds hair in place.  Nozzle tends to clog up after a bit.</li>
            <li> Very fast service. Will use again</li>
            <li> An excellent way to purchase my hairspray.  I work 11 to 12 hours a day - 5 days a week and I hate spending my off time shopping for products that I use on a daily basis.  This is delivered directly to my door.  Will continue to purchase online.</li>
            <li> Holds without giving you helmet head hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray! I don&#x27;t use any other brand. It will really hold your hairstyle in place!</li>
            <li> My favorite Hair Spray.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Does not leave my very fine hair sticky or geasey the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray! It gives lots of volume and lift, especially if you spray it at the roots.</li>
            <li> Best Hair Spray ever...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of hairsprays and never loved one as much as this!  I use it before I curl my hair to give texture and help hold, then after to set. Holds so well and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up. My hair stays soft and moves without losing style.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and  I think it is the best.</li>
