            <li>, i keep getting questions on what color this is - definitely worth ur money!</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants fantastic looking nails will love OPI polishes.</li>

            <li>Painted my nails right away.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to tell from this picture, but it&#x27;s a beautiful shade of purple.  </li>
            <li>the color is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a striking blue-toned violet color with a bit of shimmer and every time I wear it, I get complimented on it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blue nail polish.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Russian Navy.</li>

            <li>was fast!</li>
            <li>I get the MOST compliments on this purple, and I think it is because it is a beautiful deep purple with slight blue undertones (</li>
            <li>I received a lot of positive comments.</li>
            <li>Not enough to make it sparkle or come across as glittery but enough to make this polish really catch the light in a unique way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad color, but not the blue I was wanting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a royal, deep, saturated purple with--as I said in the title--a genuine &amp;#34;ultraviolet&amp;#34; feel, especially when you&#x27;re outside or under a light source.</li>
            <li>It is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip quickly like some other brands out there.  </li>

            <li> Tomorrow Never Dies is a lush dark color with shine to catch the eye.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and it is very hard - I am very tough on my manicures, but wth this polich</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely dark, though it&#x27;s clearly not black (even from a distance).</li>
            <li> And being OPI is lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The formula itself is thick and covers very well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pedicure color to go with a dark blue teal dress plus a persimmon colored dress.</li>
            <li> I too bought this (without reading through the reviews, unfortunately), thinking it was a cobalt blue nail polish, but it&#x27;s definitely purple in color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too difficult to remove, which is always a plus for such a dark color.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI, in my opinion, so that is yet another selling point.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO  sad</li>

            <li> This color is amazing and the quality of the product is excellent.  Very happy with the price and the color.</li>
            <li> I Love this color ttoooooo expensive but since I wear it often I made the purchase!!! Opi bring it back</li>
            <li> All I can say is that &amp;#34;I LOVE IT!!!&amp;#34;...the color is so pretty.  I have received many compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I had a manicure in this color in January of 2013 and have been searching all over for it. I am so glad to have found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s such a striking blue-toned violet color with a bit of shimmer and every time I wear it, I get complimented on it. The formula itself is thick and covers very well. It&#x27;s not too difficult to remove, which is always a plus for such a dark color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful OPI color!  Painted my nails right away.....it&#x27;s hard to tell from this picture, but it&#x27;s a beautiful shade of purple.  :).</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish it&#x27;s the best polish out there.  Really lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip quickly like some other brands out there.  The polish arrived on time and well packaged.  I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I tried this color at the nail salon. I get so many compliments on this color.  I had to find it.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely colour and looks like it shows in the photo. It is discontinued so I had to search for it.</li>
            <li> The color is purple and this isn&#x27;t the picture that was posted when i purchased the product.  I learned my lesson.  I need to do research before ordering nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great color, easy application.</li>
            <li> Last fall my daughter and I had a salon manicures, and she picked out this color for me. It looked good in the bottle, but absolutely fabulous on my nails. My daughter then went online to get me a bottle of this nail polish. You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI, in my opinion, so that is yet another selling point. But mostly, the blue-purple color is the reason to buy this polish. I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the color...not much more to say!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blue nail polish. It&#x27;s a nice royal blue color.  I like it better than Russian Navy.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I get the MOST compliments on this purple, and I think it is because it is a beautiful deep purple with slight blue undertones (when you look closely in the sunlight, there are blue sparkles in the polish).&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE! SOOOOO  sad they are not making this anymore.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color.  OPI rarely disappoints and this is not an exception.  But it is an exceptional color.  It is a gorgeous sapphire but has a hue of purple.  Very fun color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. My purchase was easy and sent immediately. I had a great experience with this buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it!</li>
            <li> Love this color!! And its discontinued now so get it while you can on here! Really pretty iridescent purple/blue</li>
            <li> very eye catching color, it looks like i&#x27;ve attached pieces of purple metal onto my nails, i keep getting questions on what color this is - definitely worth ur money!</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love the color.  Its a cross between purple and blue. So glad I was able to find this bc Ulta does not have it anymore</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go young and old,women and men love my Tomorrow never Dies deep lavender/blue nails. Sensational OPI long wearing and amazing color.</li>
            <li> Great color and long lasting finish.  Anyone who wants fantastic looking nails will love OPI polishes. Tomorrow Never Dies is a lush dark color with shine to catch the eye.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and it is very hard - I am very tough on my manicures, but wth this polich my nails stay chip free for days.</li>
            <li> I tried this color at a salon, when a friend treated me to a mani and pedi. It is the most PERFECT purple. It makes me happy. :D</li>
            <li> I too bought this (without reading through the reviews, unfortunately), thinking it was a cobalt blue nail polish, but it&#x27;s definitely purple in color.  The picture is deceiving.  It&#x27;s not a bad color, but not the blue I was wanting.</li>
            <li> If you like purple, this is definitely the polish to have.  It is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; color.  It isn&#x27;t going to matter to me that it is now spring.  And being OPI is lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with purple polisha and really love this color. It&#x27;s a great purple color that really stands out on my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it looks blue in the picture but it&#x27;s more of a purple.  Just ok but wearable.</li>
            <li> This color was sold out locally in my area. Thank goodness for you!  I have this great color and service was fast!</li>
            <li> Love this color! I fell in love with it when I got a pedicure at my local nail salon and just had to own it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pedicure color to go with a dark blue teal dress plus a persimmon colored dress. This interesting shiny purple color fit with both. I received a lot of positive comments.</li>
            <li> The bottle--even when you&#x27;re holding it--doesn&#x27;t do this polish justice. I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments from friends and strangers alike on my nails after using this color. OPI itself is a great brand, but specifically this color is just so PURPLE. It&#x27;s definitely dark, though it&#x27;s clearly not black (even from a distance). It&#x27;s a royal, deep, saturated purple with--as I said in the title--a genuine &amp;#34;ultraviolet&amp;#34; feel, especially when you&#x27;re outside or under a light source. There are also VERY tiny fuscia sparkles inside the lacquer. Not enough to make it sparkle or come across as glittery but enough to make this polish really catch the light in a unique way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it looks blue - sometimes it looks purple!&lt;br /&gt;I looked locally for this but couldn&#x27;t find it - so I turned to Amazon.</li>
