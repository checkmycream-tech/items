    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to try this product, but it had wonderful reviews</li>
            <li>Then I ran out of it and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but was so happy to find it online on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It has been very effective in reducing pores and evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got an awesome price, and the results were wonderful and a bit unexpected.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a good microderm scrub</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, so I was happy</li>
            <li>but I eally love this product!</li>
            <li>VERY EXFOLIATING :D</li>
            <li>This product provides me with a nice dewey glow that I have not seen in years....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cleaner but just didn&#x27;t do what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>I tried so many kind of products but didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin</li>
            <li>I had used this product before and really liked how fine the scrub is and how it smells - like watermelon.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love Biore Products.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who says this doesnt work must not be using is correctly :)</li>
            <li>It makes my face so smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased to have found something that I feel helps with the resurfacing I was seeking.</li>
            <li>is the better choice, for the money &amp; for the function.</li>
            <li>from first use didn&#x27;t  eliminate but a good reduction is noticeable.</li>
            <li>I will rub softer ;) Great product, leaves skin feeling clean, exfoliated and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Biore products, although some seem to work better than others.  </li>
            <li>Well, it was too good to be true because what I did receive did not smell right -</li>
            <li>The difference in using this product aside from the $75.00 price tag with the other product is that the results have been INCREDIBLE!!!  </li>
            <li>It smells very mild as well.</li>
            <li>My skin feel smooth immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use a sunscreen with this, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>However it does do a good exfoliating job if you are looking for noticeable/temporary results and as long as you keep at it your face will always feel smooth for the most part.</li>
            <li>I was definitely not disappointed.    </li>
            <li>you have a pore problem and/or sensitive skin and really want to get a great treatment that won&#x27;t irritate, this is for you</li>
            <li>I was really nervous to use it, so I waited for a weekend :)</li>
            <li>So this can&#x27;t be your go-to cleaner, but it&#x27;s a good thing to throw in your arsenal of facial cleaners.</li>
            <li>I found that it was best to use in the shower at least 3x per week.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great price, especially considering you don&#x27;t need to use much each cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just recieved the package in the mail quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I need!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe 10+ years and the reason is because the fine (and plentiful) crystals in this product really work as a microdermabrasion substitute for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>They are still very large.</li>
            <li>This definitely made a difference within the first try, but I would say use this only sparingly and with some kind of pore refining lotion for a more noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>However, The first time I used it I noticed the difference as soon as I rinsed it off.</li>
            <li>I know most of us have to \\&quot;shop around\\&quot; when it comes to facial products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot, and the only brand I had come to love was Olay.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I noticed immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the feel of the mechanical procedure and have had various skin requirements (from acne to skin lightening) that were better treated with chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>St. Ives facial scrubs work a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>if you like it as much as I do, you should too!).</li>
            <li>My face does feel pretty smooth/soft after I used this product (2x/week).</li>
            <li>Most dermatologists will express skepticism about the new skin-brush trends, especially for acne-sufferers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as much difference in my pores, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have really oily skin, but I do get a bit moist in my T-Zone sometimes.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much brighter and healthier.  </li>
            <li>and it effects the whole reason to use the product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>I do notice if I don&#x27;t really scrub/exfoliate my face</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates better than any other product on the market and now they have discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works very well as a facial scrub, it&#x27;s full of granulated ingredients.</li>
            <li>If anyone finds a comparable alternative in a current product, please do reply as I&#x27;d be very interested.</li>
            <li>far as my pores, they have always been large.</li>
            <li>I can only conclude that this product has been discontinued and am now trying Clean and Clear&#x27;s Morning Burst in -shower scrub.</li>
            <li>However, when I do opt for the more mechanical approach to getting rid of dead skin layers, this product does the trick.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean, but I noticed no difference at all in my pores - if anything, they&#x27;re larger or at least more</li>
            <li>Biore is still a professional brand and the quality shows,and no im not getting paid to write this im a buyer just like you,and its worth 4xs what the actual price is.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks using this particular item, I was really surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>Feels like lotion with a little bit of fine grit in it when I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all like alot of products do.  </li>
            <li>(I have acne-prone, highly sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>so be careful not to exfoliate too much of your skin in one washing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great microbeads that make your skin baby soft with only one use.. non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin, but after using this my skin seemed to be hot and some what irritated, I think it is from being my first time using it, I was expecting the need to rub it in &#x27;firmly&#x27; but you don&#x27;t really need to..</li>
            <li>I use Rx Retin-A [tretinoin 0.05% cream] for my acne, which causes a LOT of flaky dry skin when initially adjusting, or in winter; using this a few times a week in the shower reduced that scaly &#x27;lizard look&#x27; significantly.</li>
            <li>my pores definitely look bigger but in general I do have bigger pores.</li>

            <li> my pores definitely look bigger but in general I do have bigger pores.</li>
            <li> This product completely erased that, even after I put a little facial lotion on.      </li>
            <li> Seems like small beads at first feels like any other scrub,but after washing it off,it actually reduces pore size.</li>
            <li> to&#x27;ve found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The new gimmicky skin buffers and brushes</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s manual, you can vary how long or how vigorously you apply the product which will change the impact it has on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It really exfoliates, &amp; leaves that fresh baby skin vulnerable to harsh UVA/B rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other place I can get an exfoliating like this is at a skin care place</li>
            <li> Likely due to age/some chemical breakdown occurring.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes - wanting to find a way to help make my pores smaller or at least less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It definitely worked and did what was expected, but the sandpaper feeling is a little too rough for me to use twice daily.</li>
            <li> The package says to use only a few times a week, so I&#x27;m still overdoing it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most harsh exfoliators and things like this give me awful rashes or swell up my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much to minimize the pores on my nose at all.</li>
            <li> but this one was a bit of a let down for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I would seriously, seriously advise anyone who is seeking a pore facial product to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> There used to be a lot of exfoliation beads in the product, but now there are so  much less</li>
            <li> You can still order it from Amazon, but note that it might have a slightly &#x27;off&#x27; smell, compared to what it&#x27;s smelled like, before.</li>
            <li> And once I use this, it does diminish just because I scrubbed off all that excess dead skin so again, not</li>
            <li> I was in the middle of an awful break-out at the time and my skin was completely clear the next day!</li>
            <li> That being said, you can also go overboard</li>
            <li> like it was stale from sitting around too long.  </li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve used this tube regardless &amp; not had any negative skin reactions even if the product is on its way out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that it is no longer being produced.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was reluctant to review it because I don&#x27;t want everyone else to go buy it on me.  :(</li>

            <li> I was using a product by Lamer that is similar to this one.  The difference in using this product aside from the $75.00 price tag with the other product is that the results have been INCREDIBLE!!!  Not only have I made the switch I&#x27;m also saving money!  Woo Hoo...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most harsh exfoliators and things like this give me awful rashes or swell up my face. I was really nervous to use it, so I waited for a weekend :) However, The first time I used it I noticed the difference as soon as I rinsed it off. Not as much difference in my pores, but my skin was a lot smoother/clearer. I was in the middle of an awful break-out at the time and my skin was completely clear the next day! It also didn&#x27;t cause any additional breakouts as some deep cleaning treatments can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my pores, they have always been large. This definitely made a difference within the first try, but I would say use this only sparingly and with some kind of pore refining lotion for a more noticeable difference. It&#x27;s also a great price, especially considering you don&#x27;t need to use much each cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a pore problem and/or sensitive skin and really want to get a great treatment that won&#x27;t irritate, this is for you ++++++</li>
            <li> Love it. VERY EXFOLIATING :D! The only thing is, I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin, but after using this my skin seemed to be hot and some what irritated, I think it is from being my first time using it, I was expecting the need to rub it in &#x27;firmly&#x27; but you don&#x27;t really need to.. next time I do it I will rub softer ;) Great product, leaves skin feeling clean, exfoliated and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love Biore Products.  I have sensitive skin but I can use their products daily without any problems and my skin just glows.</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho este exfoliador.  Lo deje unos minutos mas de lo que dice el empaque y me dejo la piel bien suave. Un dia use primero el Biore Pore Minimizing Refining Exfoliator, luego Biore Self Heating Mask y los resultados fueron mejores todavia. A esa combinacion le doy 5 estrellas!!! Pasaron varios dias y mi piel seguia tersa. Estoy aplicando estos productos semanal y el aspecto de mi piel ha mejorado bastante. Los seguire comprando!</li>
            <li> It definitely worked and did what was expected, but the sandpaper feeling is a little too rough for me to use twice daily. The package says to use only a few times a week, so I&#x27;m still overdoing it. So this can&#x27;t be your go-to cleaner, but it&#x27;s a good thing to throw in your arsenal of facial cleaners. Approve.</li>
            <li> Just recieved the package in the mail quick shipping.Washed face and followed instructions.Seems like small beads at first feels like any other scrub,but after washing it off,it actually reduces pore size. from first use didn&#x27;t  eliminate but a good reduction is noticeable.I would recommend this product,Compared to more expensive brands Biore is still a professional brand and the quality shows,and no im not getting paid to write this im a buyer just like you,and its worth 4xs what the actual price is.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before and really liked how fine the scrub is and how it smells - like watermelon.  It&#x27;s also very affordable.  Then I ran out of it and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but was so happy to find it online on Amazon.  Well, it was too good to be true because what I did receive did not smell right - like it was stale from sitting around too long.  I can only conclude that this product has been discontinued and am now trying Clean and Clear&#x27;s Morning Burst in -shower scrub.</li>
            <li> I know most of us have to \\&quot;shop around\\&quot; when it comes to facial products.  I&#x27;ve tried alot, and the only brand I had come to love was Olay.  Now though, I do believe I&#x27;ll have to be adding Biore to that list.  I was a bit hesitant to try this product, but it had wonderful reviews so I decided to give it a try.  I was definitely not disappointed.    This product is GREAT, and I absolutely love it.  The first time I tried it, I noticed immediate results.  My skin felt so soft, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all like alot of products do.  It actually helped with oil control.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I have really oily skin, but I do get a bit moist in my T-Zone sometimes.  This product completely erased that, even after I put a little facial lotion on.      I would seriously, seriously advise anyone who is seeking a pore facial product to give this a try.  It&#x27;s got an awesome price, and the results were wonderful and a bit unexpected.  5 stars from me.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Biore products, although some seem to work better than others.  After a couple weeks using this particular item, I was really surprised by the results.  I found that it was best to use in the shower at least 3x per week.  It has been very effective in reducing pores and evening out my skin tone. My skin looks so much brighter and healthier.  This product provides me with a nice dewey glow that I have not seen in years....amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this doesnt work must not be using is correctly :) It makes my face so smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe 10+ years and the reason is because the fine (and plentiful) crystals in this product really work as a microdermabrasion substitute for my skin.  I&#x27;ve had the actual procedure done in an office before as well as chemical peels.  I don&#x27;t like the feel of the mechanical procedure and have had various skin requirements (from acne to skin lightening) that were better treated with chemical peels.  However, when I do opt for the more mechanical approach to getting rid of dead skin layers, this product does the trick.  Since it&#x27;s manual, you can vary how long or how vigorously you apply the product which will change the impact it has on your skin.  It is exactly what I need!  That being said, you can also go overboard so be careful not to exfoliate too much of your skin in one washing.  It&#x27;s too bad that it is no longer being produced.  If anyone finds a comparable alternative in a current product, please do reply as I&#x27;d be very interested.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li> St. Ives facial scrubs work a lot better for me. This one just isn&#x27;t coarse enough. Feels like lotion with a little bit of fine grit in it when I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> There used to be a lot of exfoliation beads in the product, but now there are so  much less and it effects the whole reason to use the product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The crystals in it feel like &amp;#34;pixie dust&amp;#34; on my skin.  It really exfoliates better than any other product on the market and now they have discontinued it.  The only other place I can get an exfoliating like this is at a skin care place and I just can&#x27;t afford that but I can afford Biore Pore Minimizing Refining Exfoliator!</li>
            <li> I tried so many kind of products but didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin but I eally love this product! My skin feel smooth immediately. I will keep use this.</li>
            <li> Having tried a lot of exfoliators looking for results beyond a red face, I have to say none compare to this product.  I am so pleased to have found something that I feel helps with the resurfacing I was seeking.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes - wanting to find a way to help make my pores smaller or at least less noticeable.  I used the pore minimizing moisturiser and biore strips once a week as well.  My face feels clean, but I noticed no difference at all in my pores - if anything, they&#x27;re larger or at least more visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I did not have a problem with breakouts, blackheads, or whiteheads before, I was just looking for reduction of pore size.  It&#x27;s a nice cleaner but just didn&#x27;t do what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Biore&#x27;s discontinued this exfoliator- which is a tragedy- I love this stuff, so I was happy to&#x27;ve found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The new gimmicky skin buffers and brushes have left me unimpressed, and overall don&#x27;t seem hygienic. I feel like a good microderm scrub is the better choice, for the money &amp; for the function. Most dermatologists will express skepticism about the new skin-brush trends, especially for acne-sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great microbeads that make your skin baby soft with only one use.. non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t break me out. (I have acne-prone, highly sensitive skin). I use Rx Retin-A [tretinoin 0.05% cream] for my acne, which causes a LOT of flaky dry skin when initially adjusting, or in winter; using this a few times a week in the shower reduced that scaly &#x27;lizard look&#x27; significantly. It&#x27;s important to use a sunscreen with this, so keep that in mind. It really exfoliates, &amp; leaves that fresh baby skin vulnerable to harsh UVA/B rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t been discontinued (I actually contacted Biore to suggest bringing it back- if you like it as much as I do, you should too!). You can still order it from Amazon, but note that it might have a slightly &#x27;off&#x27; smell, compared to what it&#x27;s smelled like, before. Likely due to age/some chemical breakdown occurring. That said, I&#x27;ve used this tube regardless &amp; not had any negative skin reactions even if the product is on its way out. It&#x27;s still worth it. Absolutely. In fact, I was reluctant to review it because I don&#x27;t want everyone else to go buy it on me.  :(</li>
            <li> My face does feel pretty smooth/soft after I used this product (2x/week). But I don&#x27;t think it permanently changes/fixes the pores on my face. However it does do a good exfoliating job if you are looking for noticeable/temporary results and as long as you keep at it your face will always feel smooth for the most part. I do notice if I don&#x27;t really scrub/exfoliate my face my pores definitely look bigger but in general I do have bigger pores. And once I use this, it does diminish just because I scrubbed off all that excess dead skin so again, not like it will permanently make my pores smaller but it helps!</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well as a facial scrub, it&#x27;s full of granulated ingredients. It smells very mild as well. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much to minimize the pores on my nose at all. They are still very large. I&#x27;ll continue to use Biore products but this one was a bit of a let down for the price I paid. After this tube is done I wont be using it again.</li>
