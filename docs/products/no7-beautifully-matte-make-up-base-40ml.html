    <ol>
            <li>EXCELLENT product!  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this one of the best no colour skin mattifiers on the market.</li>
            <li>The products are comparatively inexpensive and work beautifully........</li>
            <li>Very nice with liquid foundation but not cream.  </li>
            <li>Saw some reviews of this product and decided to try it, its very good for those who have got oily skin, helps keep the shine away most part of the day.</li>
            <li>good product for the price.</li>
            <li>and I read many reviews suggesting that this primer would be great for me.</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use a moisturizer first then apply it.</li>
            <li>This is the very first primer I&#x27;ve ever tried,  and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>this controls the oil build up for most of  the day.</li>
            <li>what more could anyone ask for?  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>(On the top eyelid it stays put without smudging or fading.)</li>
            <li>Works better than everything else and way better than nothing.. for the price</li>
            <li>and I was so in love</li>
            <li>love matter makeup</li>
            <li>and it sure does the job.</li>
            <li>Great to use on top of your normal primer</li>
            <li>I have a darker skin tone would work better on light skin tone.</li>
            <li>However, I was advised by another reviewer to try the Boots #7 products to easily keep the &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34; under control.  </li>
            <li>Overall, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This primer goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Although it it cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Definitely has become my favorite primer easily</li>
            <li>I found the price has gone up through the years, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>then right,  so as to prevent drying before rubbing it in all the way.</li>
            <li>It goes on and right away turns into crumb size pieces all over your face.</li>
            <li>My face is almost completely oil free all day.  </li>
            <li>I also use their Perfect and Protect face serum, followed by their Perfect and Protect facial moisturizer, then I use their matte make up base, and finally my liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>But, It is very effective in keeping a matte- dry face , especially in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it dries out fast when applying it which i think i love.</li>
            <li>The price is a little more than I&#x27;d  like to spend, but it works!  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>My have very oily skin &amp;</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>photo ready etc</li>
            <li>I have tried other more expensive ones and this one by far works better!!!!</li>
            <li>my normal oil retention product(which is not a beauty product at all)....</li>
            <li>Meaning, if your swiping left to right, do not swipe over the area right to left or even lift your fingers to go left to right again.</li>
            <li>I get about 8 hours of matte perfection which is something that I can live with.</li>
            <li>For ten dollars, I expected a much better product.</li>
            <li>I may due to drying up the pimple and healing it so quickly that it flakes off.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eye area at all.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way to managing my oily skin (mostly t-zone).</li>
            <li>African american, medium tone, very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>(bottom lid only) instead of trying to completely fade away.</li>
            <li>I used bare minerals faithfully for over a decade, and this line is what I decided to try now that I&#x27;m 30 and my skin has different needs.</li>

            <li> Very dry, leaves white chalky smear on face</li>
            <li> I use this with boots no7 matte foundation and by the end of the day I&#x27;m not nearly as oily as without it.</li>
            <li> Apply moisturizer beforehand because the product makes your skin look a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the texture or applying it to my skin, and it did make my skin stay less oily for a very short amount of time- maybe an hour or two longer than it would without the primer.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner/eyeshadow now lasts about 6 hours, and even then it only smudges a little bit</li>
            <li> I wish I would have just spent the $18 on buying Lorac&#x27;s Porefection Matte Primer.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white streaking if applied too slowly.</li>
            <li> I have semi oily skin, and hate always having to use those oil blotting papers constantly to keep my foundation looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> half way durin my work day</li>
            <li> use it alone or with a little pressed powder, blush and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> BOOTS is hard to find, and this product is even harder to find!</li>
            <li> Not only did it last a very short time, but it made my foundation look absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> this is quite small</li>
            <li> Now I put a VERY small amount of this on my lids, let it soak in for a few minutes, and then apply eye makeup.</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick and chalky in texture so when you apply it to your face it feels like sandpaper, this makes it difficult for overall application.</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes for me!</li>
            <li> , milk of magnesia makes me break out badly</li>

            <li> I have really oily skin and I tried this instead of my normal oil retention product(which is not a beauty product at all)....but this did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product!  I have tried other more expensive ones and this one by far works better!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says! My have very oily skin &amp; this controls the oil build up for most of  the day. It does leave a white streaking if applied too slowly. I recommend applying to left side of face, then right,  so as to prevent drying before rubbing it in all the way. The price is a little more than I&#x27;d  like to spend, but it works!  Overall, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have semi oily skin, and hate always having to use those oil blotting papers constantly to keep my foundation looking fresh.  However, I was advised by another reviewer to try the Boots #7 products to easily keep the &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34; under control.  I also use their Perfect and Protect face serum, followed by their Perfect and Protect facial moisturizer, then I use their matte make up base, and finally my liquid foundation.  My face is almost completely oil free all day.  (I realize that it sounds counterintuitive to use a moisturizer on oily skin, but after trying it for several months, I haven&#x27;t had any break outs and my skin looks ten years younger). The products are comparatively inexpensive and work beautifully........what more could anyone ask for?  I am a faithful believer in their beauty products and will be using them for the rest of my life.  (By the way, wait five minutes between applications to ensure the products work as intended). I should also mention that I religiously wash my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great to use on top of your normal primer</li>
            <li> I have a raging oily T-zone and this definitely helps me combat it. I get about 8 hours of matte perfection which is something that I can live with. It is way healthier for your skin than Milk of Magnesia too and you won&#x27;t get that weid back flash when using this Boots No7 product.</li>
            <li> good product for the price. doesnt keep me as matte as i wld like, but it helps. half way durin my work day i wld hav to blot the oils coming through my skin. however before i started using this product blotting my face wldnt help. also it doesnt make me break out at all, milk of magnesia makes me break out badly</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and I read many reviews suggesting that this primer would be great for me. I had no problems with the texture or applying it to my skin, and it did make my skin stay less oily for a very short amount of time- maybe an hour or two longer than it would without the primer. Not only did it last a very short time, but it made my foundation look absolutely horrible. Don&#x27;t use this if you use any liquid products on your face. It&#x27;ll just make them look streaky and your skin will look like it&#x27;s flaky underneath. With just powder, though. this didn&#x27;t happen. For ten dollars, I expected a much better product. I will use the rest of my bottle, but I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is the very first primer I&#x27;ve ever tried,  and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I use this with boots no7 matte foundation and by the end of the day I&#x27;m not nearly as oily as without it. I used bare minerals faithfully for over a decade, and this line is what I decided to try now that I&#x27;m 30 and my skin has different needs. This primer goes on smoothly and I&#x27;ve never had issues with flakiness.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about buying this product I would not recommend you order it. It is extremely thick and chalky in texture so when you apply it to your face it feels like sandpaper, this makes it difficult for overall application. Also, It made my skin break out if it wore it daily. But, It is very effective in keeping a matte- dry face , especially in the T-zone area. Although it it cheap, you get what you pay for. I wish I would have just spent the $18 on buying Lorac&#x27;s Porefection Matte Primer. I love it.</li>
            <li> Had to get used to seeing my face &amp;#34;Less&amp;#34; the oil (not over drying though). LOL&lt;br /&gt;I use it alone or with a little pressed powder, blush and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a review someplace, that said it cleared up blemishes.......I may due to drying up the pimple and healing it so quickly that it flakes off.</li>
            <li> Application is a bit finicky. If you out some on your fingers to swipe onto your cheeks, only swipe in ONE direction ONE time. Meaning, if your swiping left to right, do not swipe over the area right to left or even lift your fingers to go left to right again. The product does not blend that way and you will roll it off of your skin. Apply moisturizer beforehand because the product makes your skin look a bit dry. I use it for my enlarged pores and when I forget to put lotion before it actually makes them look worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20yo female, acne prone mixture skin</li>
            <li> I love this primer! A little goes a long way to managing my oily skin (mostly t-zone). I also have oily lids, which was making the eye makeup fade away (especially on my bottom eyelid). Now I put a VERY small amount of this on my lids, let it soak in for a few minutes, and then apply eye makeup. Eyeliner/eyeshadow now lasts about 6 hours, and even then it only smudges a little bit (bottom lid only) instead of trying to completely fade away. (On the top eyelid it stays put without smudging or fading.) No more raccoon eyes for me! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eye area at all. (Obviously, I put this on the eyelids only! Not on the waterline, but close enough.) Also, my foundation lasts all day with no blotting or touch ups needed. Whenever I run out of this, I definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice with liquid foundation but not cream.  It has a chalky film when apply. It&#x27;s best to use a moisturizer first then apply it. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work well with all sunscreen.  I have a darker skin tone would work better on light skin tone.</li>
            <li> African american, medium tone, very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This worked well but maybe my skin adjusted to it, it doesn&#x27;t work as well. Works better than everything else and way better than nothing.. for the price this is quite small</li>
            <li> It goes on and right away turns into crumb size pieces all over your face. Will never buy again. Threw it away</li>
            <li> My mom had recently brought this and I was so in love I had to buy it also.&lt;br /&gt;I love matter makeup and it sure does the job. The application is glue like but I don&#x27;t mind at all because it seems that&#x27;s what gives it, its matte texture. Definitely has become my favorite primer easily and I have used a lot from age rewind, Mary Kay, photo ready etc</li>
            <li> Very dry, leaves white chalky smear on face eventhough moistureized face well before using</li>
            <li> Saw some reviews of this product and decided to try it, its very good for those who have got oily skin, helps keep the shine away most part of the day. The only thing is that it dries out fast when applying it which i think i love.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this one of the best no colour skin mattifiers on the market. BOOTS is hard to find, and this product is even harder to find! I found the price has gone up through the years, but it is worth the money. Cheaper products just do not have the staying power that this product has. I would buy and buy again.</li>
