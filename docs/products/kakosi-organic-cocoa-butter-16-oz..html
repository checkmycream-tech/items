            <li>Great smell to the finished product, more cocoa than anything</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great price as well:))</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this vendor and product.</li>
            <li>Great value, I will be ordering more of this product, made my life easier.</li>
            <li>For her skin, cocoa butter has been a great relief, and Kakosi&#x27;s comes in convenient chunks to break as neededâ€”in contrast, jarred cocoa butter can be much more of a pain to dislodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a bit to soak in, works best right after a shower when all the pores are opened up and skin is primed for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Great for curly, natural hair, and keeps wrinkles and stretch marks away, especially good to use during weight loss.</li>
            <li>I love using it in my homemade beauty products!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I was able to make my holiday chocolates!</li>

            <li>the smell was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smells absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>otherwise, nice stuff.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged with resealable edges.</li>
            <li>i buy organic butters and oils to make my own skin care bars.</li>
            <li>the aroma was so intense and delicious, i was tempted to nibble on it.  </li>
            <li>It is a good source of healthy fats and oils.</li>
            <li>I use it for making lotions and have really liked it the texture and feeling</li>
            <li>I use it for eating and making my own body products.</li>
            <li>I use this cocoa butter to make my own vegan chocolate.</li>
            <li>Used to make my own chocolate and cannot complain.</li>
            <li>Melts in your hand so nice.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was nice but the product did not have the chocolate aroma that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I had to review this immediately since I just received product and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the cocoa butter because I wanted to make my own salt scrubs.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect for home-made chocolate, very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I made a rose scented body butter with this using plenty of rose oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t smell the rose over the cocoa smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a sealed, zip-top bag and is absolutely the best smelling cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>Bought this for making home-made body butter for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came in nice packaging, unlike others found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The product came in many size pieces, which is great for me because use it for many things.  </li>
            <li>Came in good chunks, nice smell, smooth and tasted good as well.</li>
            <li>It melted down beautifully and smelled amazing (let&#x27;s be honest, I could sit by the bag and smell it all day, delicious).</li>
            <li>Smells good, easy to use, nice texture for lotion bar making...</li>
            <li>The smell is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff was pretty good!</li>
            <li>Great packaging, fast shipping, and great quality, which is probably why I wasn&#x27;t prepared for just how strong the smell was.</li>
            <li>Great fresh item.</li>
            <li>The body butter turned out great, but I learned that it&#x27;s probably going to be best to just leave it cocoa scented, as even after adding quite a bit of lavender essential oil, I still couldn&#x27;t smell the lavender, and it was doTerra EO, so it&#x27;s not like I was using cheap diluted EO&#x27;</li>
            <li>Unrefined CB is the best, as it retains all of its natural antioxidant properties.</li>
            <li>For best results whip with natural oils to cream, do not heat.</li>
            <li>We had found a recipe for making our own chocolate, since most you find in the stores have milk in them.</li>
            <li>So good and super easy!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to taste particularly good by itself, but not bad like that - bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth and melts well with coconut oil to make lotions etc.  </li>
            <li>You can eat it right out of the package, honestly!</li>
            <li>and it worked out fine, just need to tweak my own recipe to make them taste better.</li>
            <li>Plus it is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to keep these at room temp and they don&#x27;t melt in my pantry although I&#x27;m considering refrigerating for shelf life.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and feels.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>You can use this as a substitute for many things that need butter.</li>
            <li>I made an amazing truffle recipe with this Cocoa better and they were fabulous.</li>
            <li>and it came out more like Tootsie</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with the cocoa butter and use it to make chocolates.</li>
            <li>And better yet, it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>Love the organic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I get so many comments of how i smell like chocolate.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I like to eat my chocolate, not wear it. :)</li>
            <li>and I will be making more and ordering more of this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>so I could make some 100% dairy free chocolate!</li>
            <li>I will be getting this for a staple at my home :)))</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am using cocoa butter for more then 15 years for cooking.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The cocoa butter makes the chocolate better for melting and then coating things like pretzels, or fruit or macadamia nuts or whatever, those are just some things I have done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will love you for it.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresher or purer than many I have used.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the pouch you are instantly presented with a perfect chocolatey smell.</li>
            <li>Even just using it in the larger chunks that it comes in by rubbing it on your hands and lips is great!</li>
            <li>it only took two days to arrive&amp; when I opened the package I was greeted with a wonderful chocolate aroma.</li>
            <li>This item came exactly as described, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really appreciate that is is organic and gluten free too!</li>
            <li>and it came out great, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to make my own lotions and other body care products, and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>but this smells LIKE AMAZING RICH CHOCOLATE.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and is high quality.</li>
            <li>Remarkable substance, really.</li>
            <li>Excited to use!</li>
            <li>If this is OK with you, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, one could really enjoy eating it on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The result so far has been great.</li>
            <li>The flavor is excellent, though has an alcoholic aftertaste, crisps cookies up nicely.</li>
            <li>Fortunately chocolate smelling body butter is okay with me.</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency and melts really well.</li>
            <li>The chocolate we made was super simple and awesome.</li>
            <li>like that it&#x27;s organic, didn&#x27;t smell quite as wonderful as other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, is pure in every form and serves its purpose in our home!</li>
            <li>easy to melt and whip for cocoa butter presents</li>
            <li>It melts easily and works well in lotions and body butters though.</li>
            <li>We already made some chocolate bars with almonds, something we can&#x27;t get easily with peanut allergies in the house.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been easy, but the cocoa butter isn&#x27;t the issue.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own lotion and chapstick, and the superior quality is reflected in the final product.</li>
            <li>While this recipe might not be for everyone as it is strong with no sugar...</li>
            <li>I first opened the bag it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to experiment with making my own 85%+ chocolate bars with organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Butter melted nicely and re-solidified exactly as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect dark chocolate.</li>
            <li>I looks absolutely dreamy with rich color and near perfect texture.</li>
            <li>Great for making my own dark chocolate bars</li>
            <li>This is great if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after, and I imagine would be a nice variety for making dark chocolate, but that is not why I bought</li>
            <li>First let me say that this smells awesome, chocolatey goodness as soon as you open the bag.</li>
            <li>This item came exactly as described, and smells amazing, it has a light coffee scent.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that did not come in one large chunk, the nice size pieces are easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The texture and pieces are easy to use, the butter is very fresh.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and the taste of the cocoa butter definitely came through as well, and the texture was fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It would be great if it came in smaller pieces</li>
            <li>Bought 3 bags for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Brownies turn out light and fluffier</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for the skin.</li>
            <li>These cocoa butter chunks smell and taste fantastic.</li>
            <li>It melts well and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Melts quickly and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package the aroma of dark chocolate was SO wonderful!</li>
            <li>but since I bought this to make body butter with I was not so excited about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>, you can still use the original package to store the unused cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>I used it to make a body butter mixed with coconut and almond oil, smells so good and super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Clean cocoa butter, which I use in homemade chocolates.</li>
            <li>Product is clean, chunks in assorted sizes as per the photo.</li>
            <li>I found this product to have a pleasant chocolate odor (similar to cocoa powder).  </li>
            <li>WOW - they are even healthy!</li>
            <li>Easily warmed for cooking with and as an additive for a natural lotion for smooth and healthy look.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to cut to size if ever one or more pieces are too big.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, packaging keeps it fresh for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>Love that it is organically grown and produced by an ethically minded company.</li>
            <li>The finished chocolate tasted good enough to eat alone</li>
            <li>Fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>Good product just wish it were smaller chunks.</li>
            <li>Once it liquifies, I let it cool in the ramekins, then refrigerate.</li>
            <li>This smells good to me, like unsweetened white chocolate.</li>
            <li>I always loved cocoa butter for my skin&amp; used to use &#x27;queen helene cocoa butter solid&#x27; but they have taken it off the market.</li>
            <li>decided to see if one could use a 1/3 cocoa butter + 2/3 canola oil (which is very heart healthy)</li>
            <li>, frosting is delicious, I feel that the price is borderline high and will try other products depending on price.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>This is all my preference on smell and nothing to do with the actual product, I love the benefits and the consistency of the cocoa butter-but the smell is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I used this to replace some of the butter or add additional nutritional fats into my recipes with tremendous results.</li>
            <li>love the high quality of this product and the fact that I can use it in both beauty products AND food products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before my shower I fill the sink with a couple inches of hot water and place a bottle filled with cocoa butter inside.</li>
            <li>This is the second time that I have ordered this product and I find that the quality is just as good as the first time around.  </li>
            <li>I melted some of this with organic olive oil and organic coconut oil in a pan of warm water, mixed it together and let it cool and set up.</li>
            <li>This was super fresh.</li>
            <li>We will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Have purchased multiple times now and have been satisfied everytime!</li>
            <li>It smells soooo good, and I find myself reapplying it often, to dry spots on my hands and my lips!</li>
            <li>Smells a little as if it has been burnt, but I&#x27;m still happy</li>
            <li>Great for skin &amp; hair moisture without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>Was really fresh when I received it.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I used some this weekend to make a chocolate sauce that was so delectable that I ate most of it directly from the bowl instead of putting it in my ice cream maker.  </li>
            <li>Lovely natural cocoa aroma.</li>
            <li>I used it to make a body butter, mixed with coconut oil and liked the feel and smell a lot.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, and it was exactly what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li>Really \\&quot;chocolaty\\&quot; and rich.</li>
            <li>The item was fulfilled by Amazon, so the shipping was spot on, and right on time.  </li>
            <li>This product is Great for making my organic raw chocolate.</li>
            <li>This product has a very large amount of sold cocoa in it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to apply it in the shower, and it&#x27;s very important to start with just a little.</li>
            <li>The package was professionally done, appeared to be &amp;#34;factory sealed.&amp;#34;  I had to get scissors to cut the top open, but it does have a re-sealable zip top, in event that (you) don&#x27;t use all of it at once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of cocoa butter and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>We got our shipment super fast.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s properties or benefits as an individual product, but when mixed with a good Shea butter and Sweet Almond Oil, it made a Body Butter</li>
            <li>It came very fast, in a food grade package(just as in picture).</li>
            <li>butter has a very gentle chocolate smell.</li>
            <li>Nice large and small solid chunks, smells so good.</li>
            <li>I am back to order two more bags now</li>
            <li>because in order to melt it I have to cut it up first.</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter smells absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this sellers item.  </li>
            <li>and you risk the butter getting too hot.</li>
            <li>I used my go to recipe that I love, and added and extra 1/3 again of sugar to try and balance out the bitterness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most likely use the rest of this batch just for that.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I place the rough chunks in ramekins and put them in a warm oven for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I like it better because it is in smaller chucks</li>
            <li>my wife has been raving about since the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>this is my first experience with</li>
            <li>&amp;I&#x27;ve used soooo many products like shea butter&amp; different lotions &amp;THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Plus, cocoa butter melts at a much higher temperature than butter, so...</li>
            <li>It works fabulously and it smells fresh (not strange like some others I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li>This is the kind of thing that you melt and mix with other things like coconut oil and shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It mixes well with other oils and butters, and whips up nicely.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work with it very often and never need very much</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t quite been successful in texture (who knew making real chocolate was so hard, e.g. conching, tempering, etc.)</li>
            <li>Melts easily for food or topical salve purposes.</li>
            <li>it has a strong chocolate flavor to it, i used it to make body butter mixed with shea butter</li>
            <li>was not successful in making home chocolate (reason, why I bought it), but I am happy to use this butter as a cream for my hands and as a massage butter for my face.</li>
            <li>In fact, I did eat a very small piece, to see how it tasted, and it was very pleasant, only lacking sweetness.  </li>
            <li>This is very high quality.</li>
            <li>With the recipe I found, the consistency was a little off, but the flavor is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>reasonably priced, too.  </li>
            <li>SMELLS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Used it in a whipped body butter and it is very luxiourious.</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter doesn&#x27;t really smell like the cocoa butter</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really taste like cocoa butter,</li>
            <li>just oil really.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just very overpowering</li>
            <li>My partner has a coconut allergy which prevents her from using the vast majority of skin and hair care products available today.</li>
            <li>(if your hands are warm enough) or gently move the solid pieces around your skin and allow the added friction to melt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally purchased to use mixed with almond oil for massages, but actually found that it is fantastic when used for baking.</li>
            <li>Once completely cooled, the disks pop right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smaller bite-size pieces are GREAT, but there are too many large chunks that are very hard to cut, as they simply &amp;#34;shred&amp;#34; into shavings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does melt quite well on your skin, better than other cocoa butters I have bought for the purpose of skin care.</li>
            <li>ok product, it did not melt like other organic cocoa butter I had bought.</li>
            <li>One other thing, I was also a bit hesitant to order this brand/ from this seller - since there weren&#x27;t very many reviews, and only the stock photo.  </li>
            <li>Nicely package into small chucks and a delightful&lt;br /&gt;smell.</li>
            <li>Most cosmetics only mix a small percent of cocoa butter as an ingredient not enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has smaller chunks of butter, makes it easier to use for smaller batches of stuff.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more when I run low in the future.  </li>
            <li>I tasted a tiny bit and it felt like wax in my mouth but melted fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this melts at high temps</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, the quality of this cocoa butter is really high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Since CB melts at body temperature, you don&#x27;t need high temperatures.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t find cocoa butter in your area, I would highly suggest ordering this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and some African shea butter to mix with other ingredients to make my own killer moisturizer for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>(it seems that allowing this to melt &amp;re-solidify helps it to melt better in my hands when I&#x27;m ready to use it) when I woke up in the morning every dry patch of skin that I&#x27;ve been battling with for the last 2yrs</li>
            <li>I use a little of this in baked items, just to experiment, and I think it makes the kitchen smell better.</li>
            <li>Wish they just came in more consistently sized pieces instead of chucks because it can be hard to measure for recipes.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and comes in different size chunks which suits my purpose well.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm smalls so good, and since it is made of only cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil, and a little beeswax, it is all edible so good for lips AND almost as a small lotion bar; I also use it to moisten the ends of my fingers when too dry.</li>
            <li>The final product is edible, but has definite strong notes of coffee and a hint of caramel.</li>
            <li>Chunks makes it easy to melt down to to use as-is</li>
            <li>First, I was surprised with the smell (I was expecting to get deep chocolate smell), but then I get used to it and really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only way to get soy free white chocolate though Is to make it yourself!</li>
            <li>I bought this to make a sugar free low carb white chocolate.</li>
            <li>A dime-sized chip is enough for me to massage her back for a good half an hour.</li>
            <li>I have had some pretty bad experiences with the cocoa butter smelling bad, or being in not so great packaging, so I try to shop around to find the best option.</li>
            <li>I am glad I spent the (nearly dollar extra) for this one.  </li>
            <li>or so was as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I had to clean bits of cocoa butter off of the other items in the box.  </li>
            <li>Like rich dark chocolate.</li>
            <li>The top of the cocoa butter package arrived unsealed, so about half of the package was scattered throughout the entire box.  </li>
            <li>only cocoa butter I can easily melt without filling bitter or soapy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>certainly be buying this product again in the future</li>
            <li>anyone knows what type of oil I can add when melted just to make it a little more pliable without causing me to break out (no coconut oil definitely)</li>
            <li>I tried to melt in my hot cocoa, but it took a long time.</li>
            <li>(I just keep a chunk in my medicine cabinet to put directly on my face).</li>
            <li>Works very well for an assortment of different uses.  </li>
            <li>Low price and high quality !</li>
            <li>I use it as part of my skin care regimen and apply it directly to my skin.</li>
            <li>100% natural cocoa butter&amp;this product has exceeded my wildest expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few different brands of cocoa butter from amazon, so far this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the intention of making an all natural face cream as well as lip balm.</li>
            <li>The individual chunks were separated in the package, but I did order this in the fall and keep it in a cool, dry cabinet.  </li>
            <li>- otherwise the large chunks take too long to heat</li>
            <li>It was very easy to work with since it comes already in broken pieces.</li>
            <li>(until my mixer whisk made indentations into it) and whipped it on high for several minutes until it looked like cake frosting.  </li>
            <li>Commercial products which include cocoa butter are highly processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent was negligible, and easily covered with a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to make homemade dark chocolate that the minute I got this I tore it open and got to work.</li>
            <li>I take basic melting chocolate discs in milk or dark chocolate and warm them up to 110 degrees in the microwave, then let it cool down to 90 degrees and add in a small amount of chopped cocoa butter and stir it around until it melts and is incorporated.</li>
            <li>Much more tasty than the cocoa wafers I have ordered in the past (but a bit more expensive).</li>
            <li>I was curious to see if the cocoa butter was 16 oz/ 1#, or a little less, so I broke out the handy-dandy kitchen scale, and was glad to see EXACTLY 1 pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried different brands, and so far this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>so you need to melt it before adding to other things you might not want heated up that much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand of cocoa butter, but this worked really well in some homemade chocolate I made.</li>
            <li>Compared to the only other butter I bought, this one seems to have a better taste (not hugely better, but I think I can taste it).  </li>
            <li>those unaware, cocoa butter is solid and surprisingly hard at room temperature but melts readily from your body heat, much like chocolate, so you can either hold it in your palm as it melts</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used a little bit but it seems like high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this for body lotion, I mix with a little organic pure coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a little bit of a learning curve to using straight cocoa butter as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Too much on the skin can feel a little tacky or \\&quot;oily.\\&quot;</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this specifically for making my own &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34;--a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Came in a good packaging you can open/close for storage.</li>
            <li> It just smells soooooo good.</li>
            <li> It looks, smells and tastes good - which I take as a good indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels good rubbed into my skin as is, though.</li>
            <li> Good quality butter.</li>
            <li> It smells like good quality chocolate.  </li>
            <li> Good consistancy though.</li>
            <li> Loved how it turned out too.</li>
            <li> To be fair</li>
            <li> It smelled so good</li>

            <li> Quick Shipping And Great Product!</li>
            <li> I used it for my pregnant belly and no stretch marks !!!</li>
            <li> Great smell to the finished product, more cocoa than anything</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great price as well:))</li>

            <li> Great value, I will be ordering more of this product, made my life easier.</li>
            <li> For her skin, cocoa butter has been a great relief, and Kakosi&#x27;s comes in convenient chunks to break as neededâ€”in contrast, jarred cocoa butter can be much more of a pain to dislodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a bit to soak in, works best right after a shower when all the pores are opened up and skin is primed for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Great for curly, natural hair, and keeps wrinkles and stretch marks away, especially good to use during weight loss.</li>
            <li> I love using it in my homemade beauty products!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>

            <li> Love this cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy and rich, perfect for making soap. :)</li>

            <li> glad I have found it!</li>

            <li> Love the smell and texture!</li>
            <li> The product however is amazing.</li>
            <li> the smell was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> otherwise, nice stuff.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged with resealable edges.</li>
            <li> i buy organic butters and oils to make my own skin care bars.</li>
            <li> the aroma was so intense and delicious, i was tempted to nibble on it.  </li>
            <li> It is a good source of healthy fats and oils.</li>
            <li> I use it for making lotions and have really liked it the texture and feeling</li>
            <li> I use it for eating and making my own body products.</li>
            <li> I use this cocoa butter to make my own vegan chocolate.</li>
            <li> Used to make my own chocolate and cannot complain.</li>
            <li> Melts in your hand so nice.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was nice but the product did not have the chocolate aroma that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had to review this immediately since I just received product and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the cocoa butter because I wanted to make my own salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect for home-made chocolate, very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I made a rose scented body butter with this using plenty of rose oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell the rose over the cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a sealed, zip-top bag and is absolutely the best smelling cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Bought this for making home-made body butter for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came in nice packaging, unlike others found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product came in many size pieces, which is great for me because use it for many things.  </li>
            <li> Came in good chunks, nice smell, smooth and tasted good as well.</li>
            <li> It melted down beautifully and smelled amazing (let&#x27;s be honest, I could sit by the bag and smell it all day, delicious).</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy to use, nice texture for lotion bar making...</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff was pretty good!</li>
            <li> Great packaging, fast shipping, and great quality, which is probably why I wasn&#x27;t prepared for just how strong the smell was.</li>
            <li> Great fresh item.</li>
            <li> The body butter turned out great, but I learned that it&#x27;s probably going to be best to just leave it cocoa scented, as even after adding quite a bit of lavender essential oil, I still couldn&#x27;t smell the lavender, and it was doTerra EO, so it&#x27;s not like I was using cheap diluted EO&#x27;</li>
            <li> Unrefined CB is the best, as it retains all of its natural antioxidant properties.</li>
            <li> For best results whip with natural oils to cream, do not heat.</li>
            <li> We had found a recipe for making our own chocolate, since most you find in the stores have milk in them.</li>
            <li> So good and super easy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to taste particularly good by itself, but not bad like that - bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very smooth and melts well with coconut oil to make lotions etc.  </li>
            <li> You can eat it right out of the package, honestly!</li>
            <li> and it worked out fine, just need to tweak my own recipe to make them taste better.</li>
            <li> Plus it is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to keep these at room temp and they don&#x27;t melt in my pantry although I&#x27;m considering refrigerating for shelf life.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and feels.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> You can use this as a substitute for many things that need butter.</li>
            <li> I made an amazing truffle recipe with this Cocoa better and they were fabulous.</li>
            <li> and it came out more like Tootsie</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the cocoa butter and use it to make chocolates.</li>
            <li> And better yet, it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Love the organic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I get so many comments of how i smell like chocolate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I like to eat my chocolate, not wear it. :)</li>
            <li> and I will be making more and ordering more of this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> so I could make some 100% dairy free chocolate!</li>
            <li> I will be getting this for a staple at my home :)))</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I am using cocoa butter for more then 15 years for cooking.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The cocoa butter makes the chocolate better for melting and then coating things like pretzels, or fruit or macadamia nuts or whatever, those are just some things I have done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will love you for it.  </li>
            <li> Smells fresher or purer than many I have used.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the pouch you are instantly presented with a perfect chocolatey smell.</li>
            <li> Even just using it in the larger chunks that it comes in by rubbing it on your hands and lips is great!</li>
            <li> it only took two days to arrive&amp; when I opened the package I was greeted with a wonderful chocolate aroma.</li>
            <li> This item came exactly as described, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really appreciate that is is organic and gluten free too!</li>
            <li> and it came out great, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make my own lotions and other body care products, and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> but this smells LIKE AMAZING RICH CHOCOLATE.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Remarkable substance, really.</li>
            <li> Excited to use!</li>
            <li> If this is OK with you, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, one could really enjoy eating it on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The result so far has been great.</li>
            <li> The flavor is excellent, though has an alcoholic aftertaste, crisps cookies up nicely.</li>
            <li> Fortunately chocolate smelling body butter is okay with me.</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency and melts really well.</li>
            <li> The chocolate we made was super simple and awesome.</li>
            <li> like that it&#x27;s organic, didn&#x27;t smell quite as wonderful as other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, is pure in every form and serves its purpose in our home!</li>
            <li> easy to melt and whip for cocoa butter presents</li>
            <li> It melts easily and works well in lotions and body butters though.</li>
            <li> We already made some chocolate bars with almonds, something we can&#x27;t get easily with peanut allergies in the house.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been easy, but the cocoa butter isn&#x27;t the issue.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own lotion and chapstick, and the superior quality is reflected in the final product.</li>
            <li> While this recipe might not be for everyone as it is strong with no sugar...</li>
            <li> I first opened the bag it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to experiment with making my own 85%+ chocolate bars with organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Butter melted nicely and re-solidified exactly as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> I looks absolutely dreamy with rich color and near perfect texture.</li>
            <li> Great for making my own dark chocolate bars</li>
            <li> This is great if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after, and I imagine would be a nice variety for making dark chocolate, but that is not why I bought</li>
            <li> First let me say that this smells awesome, chocolatey goodness as soon as you open the bag.</li>
            <li> This item came exactly as described, and smells amazing, it has a light coffee scent.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that did not come in one large chunk, the nice size pieces are easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The texture and pieces are easy to use, the butter is very fresh.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and the taste of the cocoa butter definitely came through as well, and the texture was fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It would be great if it came in smaller pieces</li>
            <li> Bought 3 bags for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Brownies turn out light and fluffier</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for the skin.</li>
            <li> These cocoa butter chunks smell and taste fantastic.</li>
            <li> It melts well and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Melts quickly and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package the aroma of dark chocolate was SO wonderful!</li>
            <li> but since I bought this to make body butter with I was not so excited about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> , you can still use the original package to store the unused cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> I used it to make a body butter mixed with coconut and almond oil, smells so good and super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Clean cocoa butter, which I use in homemade chocolates.</li>
            <li> Product is clean, chunks in assorted sizes as per the photo.</li>
            <li> I found this product to have a pleasant chocolate odor (similar to cocoa powder).  </li>
            <li> WOW - they are even healthy!</li>
            <li> Easily warmed for cooking with and as an additive for a natural lotion for smooth and healthy look.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to cut to size if ever one or more pieces are too big.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, packaging keeps it fresh for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Love that it is organically grown and produced by an ethically minded company.</li>
            <li> The finished chocolate tasted good enough to eat alone</li>
            <li> Fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Good product just wish it were smaller chunks.</li>
            <li> Once it liquifies, I let it cool in the ramekins, then refrigerate.</li>
            <li> This smells good to me, like unsweetened white chocolate.</li>
            <li> I always loved cocoa butter for my skin&amp; used to use &#x27;queen helene cocoa butter solid&#x27; but they have taken it off the market.</li>
            <li> decided to see if one could use a 1/3 cocoa butter + 2/3 canola oil (which is very heart healthy)</li>
            <li> , frosting is delicious, I feel that the price is borderline high and will try other products depending on price.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is all my preference on smell and nothing to do with the actual product, I love the benefits and the consistency of the cocoa butter-but the smell is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I used this to replace some of the butter or add additional nutritional fats into my recipes with tremendous results.</li>
            <li> love the high quality of this product and the fact that I can use it in both beauty products AND food products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before my shower I fill the sink with a couple inches of hot water and place a bottle filled with cocoa butter inside.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have ordered this product and I find that the quality is just as good as the first time around.  </li>
            <li> I melted some of this with organic olive oil and organic coconut oil in a pan of warm water, mixed it together and let it cool and set up.</li>
            <li> This was super fresh.</li>
            <li> We will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Have purchased multiple times now and have been satisfied everytime!</li>
            <li> It smells soooo good, and I find myself reapplying it often, to dry spots on my hands and my lips!</li>
            <li> Smells a little as if it has been burnt, but I&#x27;m still happy</li>
            <li> Great for skin &amp; hair moisture without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Was really fresh when I received it.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I used some this weekend to make a chocolate sauce that was so delectable that I ate most of it directly from the bowl instead of putting it in my ice cream maker.  </li>
            <li> Lovely natural cocoa aroma.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a body butter, mixed with coconut oil and liked the feel and smell a lot.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, and it was exactly what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> Really \\&quot;chocolaty\\&quot; and rich.</li>
            <li> The item was fulfilled by Amazon, so the shipping was spot on, and right on time.  </li>
            <li> This product is Great for making my organic raw chocolate.</li>
            <li> This product has a very large amount of sold cocoa in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to apply it in the shower, and it&#x27;s very important to start with just a little.</li>
            <li> The package was professionally done, appeared to be &amp;#34;factory sealed.&amp;#34;  I had to get scissors to cut the top open, but it does have a re-sealable zip top, in event that (you) don&#x27;t use all of it at once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of cocoa butter and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> We got our shipment super fast.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s properties or benefits as an individual product, but when mixed with a good Shea butter and Sweet Almond Oil, it made a Body Butter</li>
            <li> It came very fast, in a food grade package(just as in picture).</li>
            <li> butter has a very gentle chocolate smell.</li>
            <li> Nice large and small solid chunks, smells so good.</li>
            <li> I am back to order two more bags now</li>
            <li> because in order to melt it I have to cut it up first.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this sellers item.  </li>
            <li> and you risk the butter getting too hot.</li>
            <li> I used my go to recipe that I love, and added and extra 1/3 again of sugar to try and balance out the bitterness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will most likely use the rest of this batch just for that.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I place the rough chunks in ramekins and put them in a warm oven for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like it better because it is in smaller chucks</li>
            <li> my wife has been raving about since the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> this is my first experience with</li>
            <li> &amp;I&#x27;ve used soooo many products like shea butter&amp; different lotions &amp;THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Plus, cocoa butter melts at a much higher temperature than butter, so...</li>
            <li> It works fabulously and it smells fresh (not strange like some others I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li> This is the kind of thing that you melt and mix with other things like coconut oil and shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It mixes well with other oils and butters, and whips up nicely.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work with it very often and never need very much</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t quite been successful in texture (who knew making real chocolate was so hard, e.g. conching, tempering, etc.)</li>
            <li> Melts easily for food or topical salve purposes.</li>
            <li> it has a strong chocolate flavor to it, i used it to make body butter mixed with shea butter</li>
            <li> was not successful in making home chocolate (reason, why I bought it), but I am happy to use this butter as a cream for my hands and as a massage butter for my face.</li>
            <li> In fact, I did eat a very small piece, to see how it tasted, and it was very pleasant, only lacking sweetness.  </li>
            <li> This is very high quality.</li>
            <li> With the recipe I found, the consistency was a little off, but the flavor is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> reasonably priced, too.  </li>
            <li> SMELLS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Used it in a whipped body butter and it is very luxiourious.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter doesn&#x27;t really smell like the cocoa butter</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really taste like cocoa butter,</li>
            <li> just oil really.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just very overpowering</li>
            <li> My partner has a coconut allergy which prevents her from using the vast majority of skin and hair care products available today.</li>
            <li> (if your hands are warm enough) or gently move the solid pieces around your skin and allow the added friction to melt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Originally purchased to use mixed with almond oil for massages, but actually found that it is fantastic when used for baking.</li>
            <li> Once completely cooled, the disks pop right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smaller bite-size pieces are GREAT, but there are too many large chunks that are very hard to cut, as they simply &amp;#34;shred&amp;#34; into shavings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does melt quite well on your skin, better than other cocoa butters I have bought for the purpose of skin care.</li>
            <li> ok product, it did not melt like other organic cocoa butter I had bought.</li>
            <li> One other thing, I was also a bit hesitant to order this brand/ from this seller - since there weren&#x27;t very many reviews, and only the stock photo.  </li>
            <li> Nicely package into small chucks and a delightful&lt;br /&gt;smell.</li>
            <li> Most cosmetics only mix a small percent of cocoa butter as an ingredient not enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it has smaller chunks of butter, makes it easier to use for smaller batches of stuff.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more when I run low in the future.  </li>
            <li> I tasted a tiny bit and it felt like wax in my mouth but melted fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this melts at high temps</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the quality of this cocoa butter is really high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Since CB melts at body temperature, you don&#x27;t need high temperatures.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find cocoa butter in your area, I would highly suggest ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and some African shea butter to mix with other ingredients to make my own killer moisturizer for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> (it seems that allowing this to melt &amp;re-solidify helps it to melt better in my hands when I&#x27;m ready to use it) when I woke up in the morning every dry patch of skin that I&#x27;ve been battling with for the last 2yrs</li>
            <li> I use a little of this in baked items, just to experiment, and I think it makes the kitchen smell better.</li>
            <li> Wish they just came in more consistently sized pieces instead of chucks because it can be hard to measure for recipes.</li>
            <li> It is fresh and comes in different size chunks which suits my purpose well.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm smalls so good, and since it is made of only cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil, and a little beeswax, it is all edible so good for lips AND almost as a small lotion bar; I also use it to moisten the ends of my fingers when too dry.</li>
            <li> The final product is edible, but has definite strong notes of coffee and a hint of caramel.</li>
            <li> Chunks makes it easy to melt down to to use as-is</li>
            <li> First, I was surprised with the smell (I was expecting to get deep chocolate smell), but then I get used to it and really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only way to get soy free white chocolate though Is to make it yourself!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a sugar free low carb white chocolate.</li>
            <li> A dime-sized chip is enough for me to massage her back for a good half an hour.</li>
            <li> I have had some pretty bad experiences with the cocoa butter smelling bad, or being in not so great packaging, so I try to shop around to find the best option.</li>
            <li> I am glad I spent the (nearly dollar extra) for this one.  </li>
            <li> or so was as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I had to clean bits of cocoa butter off of the other items in the box.  </li>
            <li> Like rich dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> The top of the cocoa butter package arrived unsealed, so about half of the package was scattered throughout the entire box.  </li>
            <li> only cocoa butter I can easily melt without filling bitter or soapy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> certainly be buying this product again in the future</li>
            <li> anyone knows what type of oil I can add when melted just to make it a little more pliable without causing me to break out (no coconut oil definitely)</li>
            <li> I tried to melt in my hot cocoa, but it took a long time.</li>
            <li> (I just keep a chunk in my medicine cabinet to put directly on my face).</li>
            <li> Works very well for an assortment of different uses.  </li>
            <li> Low price and high quality !</li>
            <li> I use it as part of my skin care regimen and apply it directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> 100% natural cocoa butter&amp;this product has exceeded my wildest expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different brands of cocoa butter from amazon, so far this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention of making an all natural face cream as well as lip balm.</li>
            <li> The individual chunks were separated in the package, but I did order this in the fall and keep it in a cool, dry cabinet.  </li>
            <li> - otherwise the large chunks take too long to heat</li>
            <li> It was very easy to work with since it comes already in broken pieces.</li>
            <li> (until my mixer whisk made indentations into it) and whipped it on high for several minutes until it looked like cake frosting.  </li>
            <li> Commercial products which include cocoa butter are highly processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent was negligible, and easily covered with a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to make homemade dark chocolate that the minute I got this I tore it open and got to work.</li>
            <li> I take basic melting chocolate discs in milk or dark chocolate and warm them up to 110 degrees in the microwave, then let it cool down to 90 degrees and add in a small amount of chopped cocoa butter and stir it around until it melts and is incorporated.</li>
            <li> Much more tasty than the cocoa wafers I have ordered in the past (but a bit more expensive).</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if the cocoa butter was 16 oz/ 1#, or a little less, so I broke out the handy-dandy kitchen scale, and was glad to see EXACTLY 1 pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands, and so far this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> so you need to melt it before adding to other things you might not want heated up that much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand of cocoa butter, but this worked really well in some homemade chocolate I made.</li>
            <li> Compared to the only other butter I bought, this one seems to have a better taste (not hugely better, but I think I can taste it).  </li>
            <li> those unaware, cocoa butter is solid and surprisingly hard at room temperature but melts readily from your body heat, much like chocolate, so you can either hold it in your palm as it melts</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used a little bit but it seems like high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this for body lotion, I mix with a little organic pure coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a little bit of a learning curve to using straight cocoa butter as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Too much on the skin can feel a little tacky or \\&quot;oily.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I did a little googling &amp;figured out how to melt it down, (I used the microwave&amp; didn&#x27;t add any extra oil because i have very very acne prone skin) when it solidified again</li>
            <li> I am using it as an ingredient in a solid lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Having tasted a previous cocoa butter, I was very unpleasantly surprised -</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter for making soap and other body products (lotions, lip balms, etc) and have tried lots of different ones from different companies and sellers.</li>
            <li> and I will be using this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I closed up the package and put it in the back of my fridge, where it&#x27;s supposed to keep for a long time (1-2 years).</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter I received did not look EXACTLY like the stock image, but since it&#x27;s going to be broken up into smaller pieces to be used, this is not a deal</li>
            <li> I made regular chocolate out of this and it tasted bland, the same taste that chocolate with coconut oil tasted like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of all the saturated fat that is in butter from cow&#x27;s milk, and whereas cocoa butter contains about the same amount of saturated fat, the mix of fatty acids is considerably healthier.</li>
            <li> The package of cocoa butter was in a larger box with other items I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I was unsure what to expect from raw cocoa butter, but was pleasantly surprised by the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> just grab a chunk and rub it on-great for lips, dry patches..everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both in homemade chocolate and in a salve for my daughter&#x27;s severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> When her hands get dry and chapped I slather this on before bed</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> In this usage the smell lingers for a little while though it is just barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter for both homemade essential oil salves and for making dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> (yet it needs to reach 118 degrees for starting the tempering process), so in order to help it melt sooner with less heat</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face, stretch marks, scars and any other dry areas on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this and other products that are all solids at less than 72 degrees, in the winter (or if you keep your AC really low)</li>
            <li> Just as expected and pictured.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I make a body butter with this and shea butter and other oils</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to play with this in other kitchen applications where a chocolatey taste would be appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer, after melting it down (carefully) into disks that are easier to handle.</li>
            <li> mix in baking as a substitute for cow&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for making dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> Make dark chocolates with this, organic cocoa and no sugar or sugar substitute.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use some of it to make some homemade dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> When I tried it I was let down.</li>
            <li> $40 down the drain.</li>
            <li> It is organic and unrefined so the smell will not go away, however it is a little hard to get essential oils to over power the cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li> but I made peppermint bark from half of it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little easier to blend, as I had to put it in my vitamix to blend it and break it down.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever ordered cocoa butter, as I am getting started in making home made lip balm, body butters and cold process soaps.  </li>
            <li> After reading on other reviews that some of the cacao butter has glass chips in it I decided to go with this to make raw chocolate.</li>
            <li> A little pricy</li>
            <li> I have used it to make lotion with as well as eating it a little piece here and there.</li>
            <li> I just scraped off a little at a time&amp; massaged over my skin.</li>
            <li> Check out the raw chef and lean how to make it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased raw cocoa butter before.</li>
            <li> Melting cocoa butter is very tricky since the taste will turn very bad if it gets above 120 degrees</li>
            <li> For people wanting to use this product for cooking it probably doesn&#x27;t matter that there may be really tiny broken pieces but for me it was a little irritating.  </li>
            <li> I had to list something on the negative side, it would be (it&#x27;s minor) that there was a lot of very small bits (like very small crumbled pieces).  </li>
            <li> Not that it was bad, but it didn&#x27;t live up to what everyone else was saying.</li>
            <li> It smelled stale and the product itself was dry.</li>
            <li> I mean it doesn&#x27;t even have the aroma I would expect out of a 100% non-food grade cocoa butter from Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> It does have a faint coffee smell like some other people said.</li>
            <li> I started getting worried when I tasted a little nibble raw by itself, and it tasted BAD.</li>
            <li> - it reminded me of some very expensive (dark) chocolate you can purchase in the store.  </li>
            <li> Draw thin lines with the disk, then spread it into a thin layer on your skin.</li>
            <li> I just need to figure out the conversion from tbsp of butter to grams as it is difficult to measure the varying chunks consistantly.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> It smells yummy, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was quite unhappy to have lost half the package of cocoa butter and was disappointed with the product packaging.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the bag I was nervous because of the other reviews saying it smelled and tasted disgusting.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a bad taste or any taste for that matter.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thanks a lot it&#x27;s the best cocoa butter ever</li>
            <li> I love this butter!!! It smells so amazing! It is almost like smelling a melted chocolate bar. Plus it is so smooth! I love using it to make homemade body butter!!</li>
            <li> Quality cocoa butter! I love using it in my homemade beauty products!</li>
            <li> melts well, I use it for lotion bars, it also makes them smell good. It works well when making lip balm also.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I looks absolutely dreamy with rich color and near perfect texture. The aroma is so wonderful that you can not help but want to share it with everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my skin to cooking and it has worked perfectly for everything!&lt;br /&gt;It came in a wonderful package that keeps it easy to store and&lt;br /&gt;I weighed perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who is experimenting with making chocolate bars.&lt;br /&gt;The result so far has been great.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this melts at high temps so you need to melt it before adding to other things you might not want heated up that much. I tried to melt in my hot cocoa, but it took a long time. otherwise, nice stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate!  Very smooth and melts well with coconut oil to make lotions etc.  Nicely packaged with resealable edges.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have ordered this product and I find that the quality is just as good as the first time around.  It is fresh and comes in different size chunks which suits my purpose well.  I use the smaller chips to make a lotion for my face and body and use the larger chunks for consumption.  It is also very easy to cut to size if ever one or more pieces are too big.  All in all, it is great value for the price and I will be using this brand for a long time.</li>
            <li> Compared to the only other butter I bought, this one seems to have a better taste (not hugely better, but I think I can taste it).  I like to use it with coconut oil and cacoa powder for home made chocolate.</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived promptly and I was able to make my holiday chocolates!</li>
            <li> Just as expected and pictured.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter! I use it for lotions for my baby. It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> like that it&#x27;s organic, didn&#x27;t smell quite as wonderful as other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great tasting product. I made the best chocolates ever. WOW - they are even healthy!</li>
            <li> i buy organic butters and oils to make my own skin care bars. i always add cocoa butter for it&#x27;s velvety feel and aroma.  the kokosi is the best i&#x27;ve ever purchased.  the aroma was so intense and delicious, i was tempted to nibble on it.  just grab a chunk and rub it on-great for lips, dry patches..everywhere.  reasonably priced, too.  i&#x27;ve found my brand!</li>
            <li> This product is Great for making my organic raw chocolate. It is a good source of healthy fats and oils. Love that it is organically grown and produced by an ethically minded company.</li>
            <li> Delicious, makes incredible lotion, gives it an amazing chocolate aroma. The only problem is not eating it all before I get to lotion crafting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the product. I would cook with it if I needed to.</li>
            <li> Great quality and great taste! Was really fresh when I received it. Used it to make some homemade chocolate and it worked out fine, just need to tweak my own recipe to make them taste better. I&#x27;m able to keep these at room temp and they don&#x27;t melt in my pantry although I&#x27;m considering refrigerating for shelf life. Wish they just came in more consistently sized pieces instead of chucks because it can be hard to measure for recipes.</li>
            <li> The package came melted (one solid block), but I understand this is a shipping issue. The product however is amazing. I use it to make my own lotion and chapstick, and the superior quality is reflected in the final product. I love the way it smells and feels. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this cocoa butter.  A little pricy but I&#x27;ve used it both for homemade chocolate and homemade lotion/cream products.  Smells like chocolate!</li>
            <li> SMELLS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the high quality of this product and the fact that I can use it in both beauty products AND food products. Excited to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for making my own &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34;--a great moisturizer.  I found a recipe on Pinterest and this Cocoa Butter worked great in that recipe.  It was very easy to work with since it comes already in broken pieces.</li>
            <li> You can use this as a substitute for many things that need butter. Tastes great!</li>
            <li> Clean cocoa butter, which I use in homemade chocolates. It works fabulously and it smells fresh (not strange like some others I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li> I made an amazing truffle recipe with this Cocoa better and they were fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great for making my own dark chocolate bars</li>
            <li> easy to melt and whip for cocoa butter presents</li>
            <li> this has a great smell and feel. I use it for making lotions and have really liked it the texture and feeling</li>
            <li> The package of cocoa butter was in a larger box with other items I ordered.  The top of the cocoa butter package arrived unsealed, so about half of the package was scattered throughout the entire box.  I had to clean bits of cocoa butter off of the other items in the box.  Needless to say, I was quite unhappy to have lost half the package of cocoa butter and was disappointed with the product packaging.  The Kakosi company needs to work on improving the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product. I use it as my face moisturizer and to make lip/body products. Smells great, packaging keeps it fresh for a LONG time. Chunks makes it easy to melt down to to use as-is (I just keep a chunk in my medicine cabinet to put directly on my face). Definitely my go-to for cocoa butter purchases!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I&#x27;ve used it both in homemade chocolate and in a salve for my daughter&#x27;s severe dry skin. I melted some of this with organic olive oil and organic coconut oil in a pan of warm water, mixed it together and let it cool and set up. When her hands get dry and chapped I slather this on before bed and she sleeps in mittens. It makes a big difference by the next morning. Nice! Will definitely reorder when this is gone. I also love that it has smaller chunks of butter, makes it easier to use for smaller batches of stuff.</li>
            <li> Works very well for an assortment of different uses.  Easily warmed for cooking with and as an additive for a natural lotion for smooth and healthy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in a lip balm recipe and it came out very nice.  This is the kind of thing that you melt and mix with other things like coconut oil and shea butter.  I like this brand and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> After reading on other reviews that some of the cacao butter has glass chips in it I decided to go with this to make raw chocolate. Check out the raw chef and lean how to make it too. So good and super easy!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was well packaged. I used it to made homemade body butter and it worked very well. It smells great and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Great fresh item. Smells just like chocolate. Great for soap making and for body butter. My kids licked my hands cause it smelled so good!</li>
            <li> I use is to make coco butter cream and to make chocolate chips with and both ways it is great. It came very fast, in a food grade package(just as in picture). You can eat it right out of the package, honestly! And it smells just heavenly! I am back to order two more bags now</li>
            <li> Used this during pregnancy for preventing stretch marks. Used morning and night, had the baby and no stretch marks!!! Thrilled!!</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter for both homemade essential oil salves and for making dark chocolate. It has a great flavor and aroma.</li>
            <li> As an allergy family, we had not had any peppermint bark in over 4 years since our children&#x27;s diagnosis. This year I was determined to change that. the only way to get soy free white chocolate though Is to make it yourself! I ordered this, and oh my! Right out of the package the aroma of dark chocolate was SO wonderful! The finished chocolate tasted good enough to eat alone but I made peppermint bark from half of it. My kids were so very happy and it turned out so good I&#x27;m making more today! We will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This is all my preference on smell and nothing to do with the actual product, I love the benefits and the consistency of the cocoa butter-but the smell is not my favorite. It is organic and unrefined so the smell will not go away, however it is a little hard to get essential oils to over power the cocoa butter smell. It melts easily and works well in lotions and body butters though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to make chocolate at home - attempting Paleo milk chocolate.  I was using honey to sweeten it- and it came out more like Tootsie Rolls- but- they were delicious.  The cocoa butter smells and tastes great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a body butter. Used it with lemon essential oil...but the smell of the cocoa overpowered the oils that I put in. I didn&#x27;t see anything about that in the reviews I read...so I thought I would say it. My next body butter...I will use oils that go well with the cocoa smell. The product itself works well.</li>
            <li> Came in a good packaging you can open/close for storage. Came in good chunks, nice smell, smooth and tasted good as well. Will recommend it to anyone to use for their soaps or baking.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this cocoa butter before buying and most people said it was delicious so I had high expectations. When I tried it I was let down. Not that it was bad, but it didn&#x27;t live up to what everyone else was saying.</li>
            <li> Smells a little as if it has been burnt, but I&#x27;m still happy</li>
            <li> It is very nice. It smells wonderful. I am using it as an ingredient in a solid lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the cocoa butter and use it to make chocolates. As others say, the aroma makes you want to eat all the chocolate around you! I received a bag of varying size chunks which have been great for cooking with- I just need to figure out the conversion from tbsp of butter to grams as it is difficult to measure the varying chunks consistantly.</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy to use, nice texture for lotion bar making... And better yet, it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to experiment with making my own 85%+ chocolate bars with organic ingredients.  While I haven&#x27;t quite been successful in texture (who knew making real chocolate was so hard, e.g. conching, tempering, etc.), the taste is awesome-  Will be re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Love the organic cocoa butter. I use it for eating and making my own body products. Used it in a whipped body butter and it is very luxiourious.</li>
            <li> We already made some chocolate bars with almonds, something we can&#x27;t get easily with peanut allergies in the house.  The kids love it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I used it for vegan chocolate truffles that came together beautifully.</li>
            <li> I get so many comments of how i smell like chocolate. I love this stuff. It just smells soooooo good. I make a body butter with this and shea butter and other oils and it is wonderful. It will last you a while too and i have seen a great improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, the quality of this cocoa butter is really high. It looks, smells and tastes good - which I take as a good indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my shower I fill the sink with a couple inches of hot water and place a bottle filled with cocoa butter inside. By the time I get out, its liquid. I apply it to my face, stretch marks, scars and any other dry areas on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this one. For $15, its perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect for making all those homemade goodies</li>
            <li> This Cocoa butter s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I use a little of this in baked items, just to experiment, and I think it makes the kitchen smell better. I also think I may try to make a skin cream from it. It feels good rubbed into my skin as is, though.</li>
            <li> I use this cocoa butter to make my own vegan chocolate. The chocolate turns out perfect! It would be great if it came in smaller pieces because in order to melt it I have to cut it up first. But the taste and the consistency to use it for the chocolate are great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Organic Shea Butter from the same company to make homemade belly butter.  I found this product to have a pleasant chocolate odor (similar to cocoa powder).  The individual chunks were separated in the package, but I did order this in the fall and keep it in a cool, dry cabinet.  To make my lotion I melted equal parts shea, cocoa, and organic coconut oil (which I use for cooking) in a glass bowl over a pot as a double boiler.  Then I let it harden back up some (until my mixer whisk made indentations into it) and whipped it on high for several minutes until it looked like cake frosting.  Then I scooped it into some glass jars.  Great smell to the finished product, more cocoa than anything, I&#x27;m not into adding smelly oils to personal care products.    Edit - someone asked me recently so I wanted to add this info. If you make belly butter out this and other products that are all solids at less than 72 degrees, in the winter (or if you keep your AC really low) you will have a solid product. In the winter, I simply put the sealed jar on the floor of the shower while I shower and then it is then softer for use.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter! I&#x27;d ordered a different brand before, and it just didn&#x27;t compare. This one hits the mark every time! Smells so yummy and rich, perfect for making soap. :)</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells absolutely heavenly! Like rich dark chocolate. I used it to make a body butter mixed with coconut and almond oil, smells so good and super moisturizing! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a sugar free low carb white chocolate. It hasn&#x27;t been easy, but the cocoa butter isn&#x27;t the issue. It&#x27;s excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Once melted this butter smells like chocolate. Chocolate is a wonderful fragrance but since I bought this to make body butter with I was not so excited about the fragrance. I like to eat my chocolate, not wear it. :)</li>
            <li> Great butter! Have purchased multiple times now and have been satisfied everytime! I used it for my pregnant belly and no stretch marks !!! Low price and high quality !</li>
            <li> Worked great for making my body butter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I used in making chocolate ice cream and the results were superb.</li>
            <li> Good quality butter. Comes as described - in chunks. Used to make my own chocolate and cannot complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into cooking and got this cocoa butter to use in my homemade peanut butter. So far I&#x27;ve only used a little bit but it seems like high quality stuff. I don&#x27;t plan on using it often so I closed up the package and put it in the back of my fridge, where it&#x27;s supposed to keep for a long time (1-2 years).</li>
            <li> We got our shipment super fast.  Packaging was top notch!  The product was incrediable on all levels!  It smells like good quality chocolate.  Melts in your hand so nice.  (We used ours for lotion bar making.)  We took the suggestion to taste, and now I have to keep it locked up.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. A bit expensive but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice but the product did not have the chocolate aroma that I was looking for. It smelled stale and the product itself was dry. Bought 3 bags for free shipping.  Will not do that again. $40 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I had to review this immediately since I just received product and am thrilled.  I use this for body lotion, I mix with a little organic pure coconut oil.  This is my first time buying this sellers item.  When I opened the bag (which by the way is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; package, not a ziploc bag) the smell was amazing.  The others I purchased smelled like yummy chocolate but this smells LIKE AMAZING RICH CHOCOLATE.  Will be purchasing only this in the future, hope they stay on Amazon.  I ordered two nights ago and its already here, very very happy with this seller and the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an ingredient in DIY lip balm. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cocoa butter because I wanted to make my own salt scrubs. This is very high quality. It comes in a reclosable zipper pouch. Nice large and small solid chunks, smells so good. My salt scrub turned out very good and I will be making more and ordering more of this cocoa butter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Added product to homemade soap and also used the cocoa butter in my bath.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand of cocoa butter, but this worked really well in some homemade chocolate I made. It has a good consistency and melts really well.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box and the aroma hit me I was hooked.  I used some this weekend to make a chocolate sauce that was so delectable that I ate most of it directly from the bowl instead of putting it in my ice cream maker.  I will purchase more when I run low in the future.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for making dark chocolate. Melting cocoa butter is very tricky since the taste will turn very bad if it gets above 120 degrees (yet it needs to reach 118 degrees for starting the tempering process), so in order to help it melt sooner with less heat I shred/slice the cocoa butter in a mixer attachment. It melts quicker in a double boiler when you do this - otherwise the large chunks take too long to heat and you risk the butter getting too hot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and some African shea butter to mix with other ingredients to make my own killer moisturizer for my skin and hair. Great for curly, natural hair, and keeps wrinkles and stretch marks away, especially good to use during weight loss.</li>
            <li> Well, before purchasing this product I read all of the reviews, and there was a lot of great ones so I ordered this cocoa butter so I could make some 100% dairy free chocolate! It was so good!!! I will be getting this for a staple at my home :))) it&#x27;s a great price as well:))</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this vendor and product. The packaging was intact, and the taste of the cocoa butter is wonderful! I have used it to make lotion with as well as eating it a little piece here and there. I will definitely be buying from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> Great quality and smells amazing! I use the kakosi organic cocoa butter along with shea and mango butters to make body butter. The body butter comes out perfect everytime! Will be re ordering when I run out!!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great Price!</li>
            <li> This organic cocoa butter is great. I made body lotion with this and smells delicious and good for skin. I love it</li>
            <li> Happy with the smell and quality of this Cocoa butter. Made lotion yesterday and was very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I am using cocoa butter for more then 15 years for cooking. I have tried different brands, and so far this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;This butter has a very gentle chocolate smell. The texture is perfect for home-made chocolate, very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The only cocoa butter I can easily melt without filling bitter or soapy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I have found it!</li>
            <li> Good product just wish it were smaller chunks. Good consistancy though.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever ordered cocoa butter, as I am getting started in making home made lip balm, body butters and cold process soaps.  The item was fulfilled by Amazon, so the shipping was spot on, and right on time.  The package was professionally done, appeared to be &amp;#34;factory sealed.&amp;#34;  I had to get scissors to cut the top open, but it does have a re-sealable zip top, in event that (you) don&#x27;t use all of it at once, you can still use the original package to store the unused cocoa butter.  I was curious to see if the cocoa butter was 16 oz/ 1#, or a little less, so I broke out the handy-dandy kitchen scale, and was glad to see EXACTLY 1 pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I opened it, I was able to smell the delicious chocolate smell, and it made me want to pop a chunk in my mouth - it reminded me of some very expensive (dark) chocolate you can purchase in the store.  In fact, I did eat a very small piece, to see how it tasted, and it was very pleasant, only lacking sweetness.  One other thing, I was also a bit hesitant to order this brand/ from this seller - since there weren&#x27;t very many reviews, and only the stock photo.  I am glad I spent the (nearly dollar extra) for this one.  Superb quality cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to list something on the negative side, it would be (it&#x27;s minor) that there was a lot of very small bits (like very small crumbled pieces).  The cocoa butter I received did not look EXACTLY like the stock image, but since it&#x27;s going to be broken up into smaller pieces to be used, this is not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, about getting this one, don&#x27;t be.  Get this.  You will be happy that you did.</li>
            <li> First, I was surprised with the smell (I was expecting to get deep chocolate smell), but then I get used to it and really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;I was not successful in making home chocolate (reason, why I bought it), but I am happy to use this butter as a cream for my hands and as a massage butter for my face.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter doesn&#x27;t really smell like the cocoa butter I remember.  I mean it doesn&#x27;t even have the aroma I would expect out of a 100% non-food grade cocoa butter from Walgreens.  It doesn&#x27;t really taste like cocoa butter, just oil really.  I made regular chocolate out of this and it tasted bland, the same taste that chocolate with coconut oil tasted like.  I also made white chocolate and it just tasted oily, not like white chocolate.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make white chocolate with, as it specifically lists itself as a food item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bag it smelled amazing. Really \\&quot;chocolaty\\&quot; and rich. I started getting worried when I tasted a little nibble raw by itself, and it tasted BAD. Having tasted a previous cocoa butter, I was very unpleasantly surprised - I didn&#x27;t expect it to taste particularly good by itself, but not bad like that - bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I decided to try and make it into white chocolate anyway. I used my go to recipe that I love, and added and extra 1/3 again of sugar to try and balance out the bitterness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sort of worked. The final product is edible, but has definite strong notes of coffee and a hint of caramel. This is great if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after, and I imagine would be a nice variety for making dark chocolate, but that is not why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does melt quite well on your skin, better than other cocoa butters I have bought for the purpose of skin care. I will most likely use the rest of this batch just for that.</li>
            <li> I used this to replace some of the butter or add additional nutritional fats into my recipes with tremendous results. Brownies turn out light and fluffier, frosting is delicious, I feel that the price is borderline high and will try other products depending on price. I recently purchased another product that I will review shortly.</li>
            <li> High quality product. Smells amazing and works great in the salves and lip balms I make. Such a great product.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased to use mixed with almond oil for massages, but actually found that it is fantastic when used for baking. The flavor is excellent, though has an alcoholic aftertaste, crisps cookies up nicely.</li>
            <li> Great organic product, for a good price. Packaged well. Lovely natural cocoa aroma. I like the fact that did not come in one large chunk, the nice size pieces are easy to work with. Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> ok product, it did not melt like other organic cocoa butter I had bought. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Smells absolutely amazing, I almost didn&#x27;t want to tamper with it! But I&#x27;ve used this in some body products, including a chocolate mint whipped body mousse, and it is divine. Love the repeatable packaging too! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> First let me say that this smells awesome, chocolatey goodness as soon as you open the bag. Great packaging, fast shipping, and great quality, which is probably why I wasn&#x27;t prepared for just how strong the smell was. I used it in word body butter with Shea and coconut oil as well as some essential oils. The body butter turned out great, but I learned that it&#x27;s probably going to be best to just leave it cocoa scented, as even after adding quite a bit of lavender essential oil, I still couldn&#x27;t smell the lavender, and it was doTerra EO, so it&#x27;s not like I was using cheap diluted EO&#x27; s. Fortunately chocolate smelling body butter is okay with me. ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great, packaging is undamaged.  Great value, I will be ordering more of this product, made my life easier.</li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong. I made a rose scented body butter with this using plenty of rose oil. I can&#x27;t smell the rose over the cocoa smell. It smells yummy, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s just very overpowering</li>
            <li> strong smell of chocolate!!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of cocoa butter. I use it as a moisturizer, after melting it down (carefully) into disks that are easier to handle. I place the rough chunks in ramekins and put them in a warm oven for about 30 minutes. Since CB melts at body temperature, you don&#x27;t need high temperatures. Once it liquifies, I let it cool in the ramekins, then refrigerate. Once completely cooled, the disks pop right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little bit of a learning curve to using straight cocoa butter as a body moisturizer. Too much on the skin can feel a little tacky or \\&quot;oily.\\&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t put it on dry skin. It&#x27;s better to apply it in the shower, and it&#x27;s very important to start with just a little. Draw thin lines with the disk, then spread it into a thin layer on your skin. I use CB every day, and my skin has never felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: You will smell like chocolate after applying this product this way. If this is OK with you, you&#x27;re fine. Unrefined CB is the best, as it retains all of its natural antioxidant properties. Fabulous for the skin. Once you go to a \\&quot;deodorized\\&quot; or \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; version, you will lose some of this goodness. Commercial products which include cocoa butter are highly processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also made a homemade facial moisturizer and I included this cocoa butter. The scent was negligible, and easily covered with a few drops of essential oil. Loved how it turned out too. Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is DELICIOUS!!!! Makes great chocolate!</li>
            <li> This is food grade cocoa butter, lots of folks sell cosmetic grade which you can use to make makeup, but I use this to make candy. I take basic melting chocolate discs in milk or dark chocolate and warm them up to 110 degrees in the microwave, then let it cool down to 90 degrees and add in a small amount of chopped cocoa butter and stir it around until it melts and is incorporated. The cocoa butter makes the chocolate better for melting and then coating things like pretzels, or fruit or macadamia nuts or whatever, those are just some things I have done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t work with it very often and never need very much, I think the bag I have is oxidizing now despite resealing it every time. I think I will buy a smaller bag next time.</li>
            <li> These cocoa butter chunks smell and taste fantastic. Rich, creamy, one could really enjoy eating it on its own. Much more tasty than the cocoa wafers I have ordered in the past (but a bit more expensive).</li>
            <li> I made Tummy Butter mixing this with Coconut Oil. It works great..for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed Organic so I bought this. This Cocoa Butter smells really great and worked great for my purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of cocoa butter and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve had. To be fair I did not use this product to ingest. I use it as part of my skin care regimen and apply it directly to my skin. For people wanting to use this product for cooking it probably doesn&#x27;t matter that there may be really tiny broken pieces but for me it was a little irritating.  All in all I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased raw cocoa butter before. When I opened the bag I was nervous because of the other reviews saying it smelled and tasted disgusting. It smelled so yummy, like chocolate. I tasted a tiny bit and it felt like wax in my mouth but melted fairly quickly. It didn&#x27;t have a bad taste or any taste for that matter. Mixed with coconut oil and cocoa powder to make chocolate. Tasted great!</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations. I have already included it in my recipes for body and hair. Will be a repeat customer!!</li>
            <li> Make dark chocolates with this, organic cocoa and no sugar or sugar substitute.  While this recipe might not be for everyone as it is strong with no sugar...the luxurious taste and feel of the cocoa butter made my chocolate luscious and awesome.  GREAT quality.  Very happy.  And YOU can add sugar if you want!</li>
            <li> Nicely package into small chucks and a delightful&lt;br /&gt;smell. Melts quickly and easy to work with. This is&lt;br /&gt;alot for a 16 oz. bag. Alittle goes along way.</li>
            <li> My search is over, this product speaks for itself in quality and quantity.  Most cosmetics only mix a small percent of cocoa butter as an ingredient not enough to be effective.  Select your best oils, combine with organic Ghana shea butter, your bodies largest organ (the skin) will love you for it.  For best results whip with natural oils to cream, do not heat.</li>
            <li> The smaller bite-size pieces are GREAT, but there are too many large chunks that are very hard to cut, as they simply &amp;#34;shred&amp;#34; into shavings. The vendor should figure out how to ofer ALL bite sized pieces.</li>
            <li> Some of the best I have bought. This was super fresh. It does have a faint coffee smell like some other people said. This smells good to me, like unsweetened white chocolate. It melted easily and worked great in my body care products!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice now and I actually am about to place another order for it! Smells amazing, is pure in every form and serves its purpose in our home!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this cocoa butter.  The texture and pieces are easy to use, the butter is very fresh.  Smells fresher or purer than many I have used. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.  Their Shea butter was also terrific.</li>
            <li> I like it better because it is in smaller chucks and I don&#x27;t need to dig it out of a 1 LB container.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to make homemade dark chocolate that the minute I got this I tore it open and got to work. This is a great product. It melted down beautifully and smelled amazing (let&#x27;s be honest, I could sit by the bag and smell it all day, delicious). The chocolate came out perfect.</li>
            <li> I was unsure what to expect from raw cocoa butter, but was pleasantly surprised by the chocolate scent. It mixes well with other oils and butters, and whips up nicely.</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter for making soap and other body products (lotions, lip balms, etc) and have tried lots of different ones from different companies and sellers. I have had some pretty bad experiences with the cocoa butter smelling bad, or being in not so great packaging, so I try to shop around to find the best option. I think I&#x27;ve found it with this one. The packaging is great. It&#x27;s in a sealed, zip-top bag and is absolutely the best smelling cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever gotten. It smelled so good I decided to use some of it to make some homemade dark chocolate. With the recipe I found, the consistency was a little off, but the flavor is amazing. I&#x27;m going to try some different recipes to get the consistency I want, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be shopping around for cocoa butter anymore. This one is going to be it from now on!</li>
            <li> Bought this for making home-made body butter for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came in nice packaging, unlike others found on Amazon. Upon opening the pouch you are instantly presented with a perfect chocolatey smell. Butter melted nicely and re-solidified exactly as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s properties or benefits as an individual product, but when mixed with a good Shea butter and Sweet Almond Oil, it made a Body Butter my wife has been raving about since the first time she used it. In this usage the smell lingers for a little while though it is just barely noticeable. It does take a bit to soak in, works best right after a shower when all the pores are opened up and skin is primed for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will certainly be buying this product again in the future, it&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter! Use it to make lotion bars and it&#x27;s great. Product is clean, chunks in assorted sizes as per the photo. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping And Great Product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make my own lotions and other body care products, and it is wonderful! It comes in a sturdy, resealable bag, and it smells AMAZING! Even just using it in the larger chunks that it comes in by rubbing it on your hands and lips is great! I am definitely going to be ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> This stuff was pretty good! I used it to make a body butter, mixed with coconut oil and liked the feel and smell a lot. I just wish it was a little easier to blend, as I had to put it in my vitamix to blend it and break it down.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a well labeled package. it was quite crumbly. it seemed to be a good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I always loved cocoa butter for my skin&amp; used to use &#x27;queen helene cocoa butter solid&#x27; but they have taken it off the market. this is my first experience with 100% natural cocoa butter&amp;this product has exceeded my wildest expectations. it only took two days to arrive&amp; when I opened the package I was greeted with a wonderful chocolate aroma. I did a little googling &amp;figured out how to melt it down, (I used the microwave&amp; didn&#x27;t add any extra oil because i have very very acne prone skin) when it solidified again I just scraped off a little at a time&amp; massaged over my skin. (it seems that allowing this to melt &amp;re-solidify helps it to melt better in my hands when I&#x27;m ready to use it) when I woke up in the morning every dry patch of skin that I&#x27;ve been battling with for the last 2yrs or so was as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! &amp;I&#x27;ve used soooo many products like shea butter&amp; different lotions &amp;THIS PRODUCT is the Only thing that has allowed my skin to feel like it did years ago. I&#x27;m soo Happy!!! will definitely recommend this to everyone I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anyone knows what type of oil I can add when melted just to make it a little more pliable without causing me to break out (no coconut oil definitely) I would be forever grateful for your advice!</li>
            <li> cocoa butter works on your skin or you could just eat it. bye bye skin problems period. just try it!</li>
            <li> This product has a very large amount of sold cocoa in it.  It melts well and smells fabulous.  I have used it to make my face cream and it works great@!</li>
            <li> This item came exactly as described, and smells amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to use it in all of my projects!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of all the saturated fat that is in butter from cow&#x27;s milk, and whereas cocoa butter contains about the same amount of saturated fat, the mix of fatty acids is considerably healthier. Plus, cocoa butter melts at a much higher temperature than butter, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to see if one could use a 1/3 cocoa butter + 2/3 canola oil (which is very heart healthy) mix in baking as a substitute for cow&#x27;s butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came today and I tried it out. When my wife and girls came home, I had just melted the cocoa butter in the microwave and almost in unison they declared \\&quot;what is that great smell?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the cake turned out great. Great smell and the taste of the cocoa butter definitely came through as well, and the texture was fantastic. I can&#x27;t wait to play with this in other kitchen applications where a chocolatey taste would be appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really appreciate that is is organic and gluten free too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different brands of cocoa butter from amazon, so far this is definitely my favorite. It has a great texture,  smells amazing, and makes perfect chocolate.</li>
            <li> My wife and I went vegan earlier this year. We had found a recipe for making our own chocolate, since most you find in the stores have milk in them. We couldn&#x27;t find cocoa butter anywhere in our area, so we ordered this. It came quickly, and it was exactly what we were hoping for. The chocolate we made was super simple and awesome. Melt 1 cup of the cocoa butter, stir in 1/2 cup unsweet cocoa powder and 1/2 cup of agave nectar. Pour into the bottom of muffin paper. Sprinkle with sea salt and let it set. Perfect dark chocolate. This recipe comes from the Oh She Glows website. She has a lot of great recipes for anyone looking for great vegan recipes. If you can&#x27;t find cocoa butter in your area, I would highly suggest ordering this product. When we run out, we will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> it has a strong chocolate flavor to it, i used it to make body butter mixed with shea butter and it came out great, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This item came exactly as described, and smells amazing, it has a light coffee scent. I like that it was in chunks.</li>
            <li> The product came in many size pieces, which is great for me because use it for many things.  It melts well and tastes great.</li>
            <li> Melts easily for food or topical salve purposes. Scent blends well with essential oils. Great for skin &amp; hair moisture without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used cocoa butter before, but this stuff is great! Love the smell and texture! Works perfectly for my needs!</li>
            <li> yummy.  used to make the chocolate snack posted by Mercola.com</li>
            <li> Nice product, smells great. Bought this to make my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Awesome love it Very good service!THANK YOU</li>
            <li> My partner has a coconut allergy which prevents her from using the vast majority of skin and hair care products available today. For her skin, cocoa butter has been a great relief, and Kakosi&#x27;s comes in convenient chunks to break as neededâ€”in contrast, jarred cocoa butter can be much more of a pain to dislodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unaware, cocoa butter is solid and surprisingly hard at room temperature but melts readily from your body heat, much like chocolate, so you can either hold it in your palm as it melts (if your hands are warm enough) or gently move the solid pieces around your skin and allow the added friction to melt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. A dime-sized chip is enough for me to massage her back for a good half an hour. Remarkable substance, really.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention of making an all natural face cream as well as lip balm. The lip balm smalls so good, and since it is made of only cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil, and a little beeswax, it is all edible so good for lips AND almost as a small lotion bar; I also use it to moisten the ends of my fingers when too dry. It smells soooo good, and I find myself reapplying it often, to dry spots on my hands and my lips! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
