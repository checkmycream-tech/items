            <li>I know you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love it, use it every day!</li>
            <li>his face looked really nice</li>
            <li>Like the coverage,  however, I must mix this with my moisturizer (Lanolin√© Rose firming cream).  </li>
            <li>It evened out my skin and does look nice.</li>
            <li>It settled into my crow&#x27;s feet, and made the mascara on my lower lashes smudge at no fault of my own (I never rub my eyes).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Is has a very strong sunscreen odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty product that I own.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to remove it completely at night would be my best advice.</li>
            <li>, I require safe EWG approved ingredients, and this has it.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the SPF coverage and the lightweight formula</li>
            <li>It is cheap!  </li>
            <li>course I top it off with my Physicians Formula BB powder (which I reapply every 2 hours as the direction says for sun protection)</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Love how it looks.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this and love it.  </li>
            <li>Was glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I used it at the beach last week and was very happy.</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that it isn&#x27;t shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many BB creams.</li>
            <li>Use a circular motion with the brush when applying and stipple the areas that need more coverage.</li>
            <li>Most foundations/bb creams that I&#x27;ve tried rub off on everything, but this stayed on my face all day.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage.</li>
            <li>It also gives more coverage than most BB creams.  </li>
            <li>So, I bought this at Target and was very happy with it initially.</li>
            <li>This may sound too good to be true, but...</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking, nontoxic, price is right and color is perfect.  </li>
            <li>good point is that it has very high sun protection and once you remove it, you wont end up with clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is natural looking, yet has great coverage.  </li>
            <li>It does tend to be more medium than light.</li>
            <li>This really helps me to feel good about my skin without looking like</li>
            <li>Fast, easy and good coverage.</li>
            <li>The light/medium appears dark, yet blends perfectly and produces a youthful glow that lasts all day.and</li>
            <li>Fourth, it has great coverage.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream goes on so smoothly and even.  </li>
            <li>note on the color: My skin&#x27;s light, but not super-light (III on the Fitzpatrick scale).  </li>
            <li>The coverage and color were just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34; I bought light to medium.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and the BB cream</li>
            <li>I have fair skin (not super white) and it matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>I also love the SPF 30 sunscreen protection offered by the Beauty Balm Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy as I dotted the Beauty Balm onto my face and then gently smoothed it out.</li>
            <li>product is cheap and may be a worth a try for you.</li>
            <li>I bought this looking for a quick make up routine for the work week</li>
            <li>It has tremendous coverage for a bb cream.  </li>
            <li>like it very much!  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>The Physicians Formula Super BB All-in-1 Beauty Balm Cream worked very well to brighten and smooth out my maturing complexion.</li>
            <li>Good, light texture and feel, not all heavy and cake like.</li>
            <li>I use this regularly and it works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, great coverage, and rated well on ewg.org (less hazardous chemicals than previous BB creams I had been using).</li>
            <li>The color is so orangey right out of the tube,  </li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 stars, but the color wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of coverage for day to day makeup.</li>
            <li>i liked the feel of the product - the light medium color was too dark and didnt blend with my skin tone</li>
            <li>Amazon had only med/light available, but I need light.</li>
            <li>it is very natural and smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight but offers buildable coverage-you may have to add a little more to spots where the coverage is most needed-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light, but not really pale</li>
            <li>/&gt;In pictures it acts exactly like mineral makeup</li>
            <li>First and foremost</li>
            <li>you are beautiful!&amp;#34; - guess BB cream really does work!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how much brighter (and perhaps younger)</li>
            <li>When I wash after work and remove it my skin feels smooth but not dry.</li>
            <li>, my pores are quite large too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>so it was good in the heat, but was smeared easily and had a weird texture.</li>
            <li>I like this particular brand because it doesn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>Most beauty creams leave my skin feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is light - just enough to neutralize your skin tone but not too much that it looks like you have foundation on.</li>
            <li>this BB cream seems to make my pores and holes look much deeper than they really are.</li>
            <li>My skin has really never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I have to mix it with lotion to smooth properly.</li>
            <li>It has sunscreen in it and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>For additional coverage on blemishes I sometimes use the concealer, but it seems to be keeping the breakouts to a minimum, so I haven&#x27;t needed it so much.</li>
            <li>After wearing it for the whole day however, I noticed it started almost &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very watery and doesn&#x27;t apply evenly.</li>
            <li>Also, I did get a lot of bumps along my jawline and neck, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if that was due to this product.</li>
            <li>This makes me hesitant to use something that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but this one has much better coverage than other bb creams i have tried and doesnt grease me up at all.  </li>
            <li>I like these particular sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li>The color works with my very light skin tone and, just the fact it doesn&#x27;t feel dry is enough for me to give it 5 Stars AND to buy it again!</li>
            <li>BB creams from Sephora or a department store would cost nearly twice as much as this!&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li>The formula may be ok, but this color is very odd.</li>
            <li>Combine with loose powder to set and more lasting.</li>
            <li>I actually would give it 5 stars, but my husband says it has a funny smell to it.  </li>
            <li>The last one used was Smashbox and this product is better than Smasbox at half the price.</li>
            <li>I am pretty much always a light/medium to medium and this product in light/medium was way too dark and orangy for me.  </li>
            <li>it covers my rosecea completely.</li>
            <li>and it offers moisturizing without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>But lately I&#x27;ve been noticing more acne with use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like nearly every drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>This one has a natural satin finish, but it delivers medium coverage that conceals my acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably just my sensitive skin, but proceed with some skepticism.</li>
            <li>I work outside and live in Florida, so I sweat!</li>
            <li>It looked fine when I was wearing clothes, but it was noticeable when I was in my swim suit because my face was a bit darker than the rest of my body - a problem accentuated by the slight white cast of the sunscreen that I used on my body.</li>
            <li>As far as cleansing in concerned, I wash my face diligently every nice without fail with a high-end face wash, so  washing the makeup off didn&#x27;t help in my case.</li>
            <li>I have many age spots and freckles, large pores, and Italian/Green yellow undertones - essentially, my skin is not great.  </li>
            <li>My cheeks can get red sometimes, and depending on how red they are on a particular day, I sometimes forego foundation and just wear this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps my face moisturized but not oily, provides enough coverage, and looks NATURAL.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not too thick</li>
            <li>It has an SPF rating of 30, which means that it not only contains sunscreen, but actually contains it in high enough amounts for it to legitimately protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>No single makeup product can transform my looks as well as this thing</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry to normal skin and live in Southern California where it tends to be extremely sunny.</li>
            <li>Will be going back to Bare Minerals bb cream tha t I prefer.</li>
            <li>i can have considerably oily skin occasionally, which is much less frequent during the winter (now!)</li>

            <li> It has sunscreen in it and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> For additional coverage on blemishes I sometimes use the concealer, but it seems to be keeping the breakouts to a minimum, so I haven&#x27;t needed it so much.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for the whole day however, I noticed it started almost &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very watery and doesn&#x27;t apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Also, I did get a lot of bumps along my jawline and neck, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if that was due to this product.</li>
            <li> This makes me hesitant to use something that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but this one has much better coverage than other bb creams i have tried and doesnt grease me up at all.  </li>
            <li> I like these particular sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li> The color works with my very light skin tone and, just the fact it doesn&#x27;t feel dry is enough for me to give it 5 Stars AND to buy it again!</li>
            <li> BB creams from Sephora or a department store would cost nearly twice as much as this!&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li> The formula may be ok, but this color is very odd.</li>
            <li> Combine with loose powder to set and more lasting.</li>
            <li> I actually would give it 5 stars, but my husband says it has a funny smell to it.  </li>
            <li> The last one used was Smashbox and this product is better than Smasbox at half the price.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much always a light/medium to medium and this product in light/medium was way too dark and orangy for me.  </li>
            <li> it covers my rosecea completely.</li>
            <li> and it offers moisturizing without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> But lately I&#x27;ve been noticing more acne with use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like nearly every drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li> This one has a natural satin finish, but it delivers medium coverage that conceals my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just my sensitive skin, but proceed with some skepticism.</li>
            <li> I work outside and live in Florida, so I sweat!</li>
            <li> It looked fine when I was wearing clothes, but it was noticeable when I was in my swim suit because my face was a bit darker than the rest of my body - a problem accentuated by the slight white cast of the sunscreen that I used on my body.</li>
            <li> As far as cleansing in concerned, I wash my face diligently every nice without fail with a high-end face wash, so  washing the makeup off didn&#x27;t help in my case.</li>
            <li> I have many age spots and freckles, large pores, and Italian/Green yellow undertones - essentially, my skin is not great.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks can get red sometimes, and depending on how red they are on a particular day, I sometimes forego foundation and just wear this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moisturized but not oily, provides enough coverage, and looks NATURAL.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not too thick</li>
            <li> It has an SPF rating of 30, which means that it not only contains sunscreen, but actually contains it in high enough amounts for it to legitimately protect your skin.  </li>
            <li> No single makeup product can transform my looks as well as this thing</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry to normal skin and live in Southern California where it tends to be extremely sunny.</li>
            <li> Will be going back to Bare Minerals bb cream tha t I prefer.</li>
            <li> i can have considerably oily skin occasionally, which is much less frequent during the winter (now!)</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s not super-dry, but dry enough that I sometimes get flaky patches of skin in the winter, and it actually feels soothing to put this on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;(3)</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product in the past and really likes it, however, this order</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way in covering up blemishes.  </li>
            <li> it did last a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a strange tint, I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I was paying high dollar amount for big name products and still not satisfied with either the performance or ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that I may react to something in the physical sunscreens in general since I started getting the bumps all over my forehead (not acne but just little bumps that take a long time to go away) when I used a zinc oxide powder before.</li>
            <li> I like bb creams because they agree with my dry, tight, flaky skin, but I don&#x27;t like how sheer they generally are.</li>
            <li> The only big issue is that it was a bit too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> After stopping the BB cream, my skin regained its natural glow a few days later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the general shade of the makeup is not very light, but as long as you don&#x27;t have stark-white skin it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 different ones and have come down to two that I would actually use.</li>
            <li> I bought this and didn&#x27;t know if it would be dark enough</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and one of the least expensive of them all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this online, but i was considering purchasing this product a few weeks before i actually got it.  </li>
            <li> I was astonished at how this single product transformed me from a tired and dirty-looking passenger to a fresh-faced young woman.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to blame the product without due course,</li>
            <li> Now, I see other reviewers stating it caused acne for them too.  </li>
            <li> No funny smells.</li>
            <li> This was a little darker than I expected and kinda made me look orange...</li>
            <li> They also look dark and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone considered fair who could use it without looking like they just got a terrible spray tan.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed that they discontinued the above item after using it for many years.  </li>
            <li> The texture is too heavy, not nice to see that it is actually on your skin...</li>
            <li> so I used it again, and again, got a pimple on my temple (odd place for me).  </li>
            <li> I still use it though because I think that after a little while the smell goes away.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a little mineral concealer over it with a brush</li>
            <li> After I cleanse my face in the morning, I use a little toner and put this BB cream on.</li>
            <li> I do not look like I have a heavy application of anything on my face.</li>
            <li> but it has become my everyday product - even for a night on the town.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do reviews often although I rely so heavily on what others say about products.</li>
            <li> Use everyday for coverage and moisture.</li>
            <li> I gave it time to keep trying with different amounts and techniques to apply it, so i could see if it was me not applying it right, but no, this product is awful for my type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure this color will work well on those with super-light skin.</li>
            <li> have combination, acne prone skin with a few holes left behind by a bad vase of acne during my teen years</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> worse is that after a few days of using it, my skin was duller and drier, and I got a pimple.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is too dark, but might keep it for the summer.</li>
            <li> It just lost its glow and looked so unhealthy.</li>
            <li> and was desperately hungry for dinner, so I just slathered some of this on my face and nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, because I bought the cream, powder, and highlighter package.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not too thick</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite!</li>
            <li> I gave it time to keep trying with different amounts and techniques to apply it, so i could see if it was me not applying it right, but no, this product is awful for my type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination, acne prone skin with a few holes left behind by a bad vase of acne during my teen years, my pores are quite large too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this BB cream seems to make my pores and holes look much deeper than they really are. They also look dark and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face gets greasy immediately after applying and the rest of my make up seems to melt in just a couple off hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In pictures it acts exactly like mineral makeup, you wont have any makeup showing in the photo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is has a very strong sunscreen odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good point is that it has very high sun protection and once you remove it, you wont end up with clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with oily skin, big pores or acne problems.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way in covering up blemishes.  I actually would give it 5 stars, but my husband says it has a funny smell to it.  I still use it though because I think that after a little while the smell goes away.  I think this bottle will last me a while because you really only need a pea sized amount, but I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I am fully impressed with this product, ingredients, performance, and price.  First and foremost, I require safe EWG approved ingredients, and this has it.  Second, my dermatologists suggests something with both titanium dioxide &amp; zinc and this has it.  Third, this does NOT look like makeup...it is very natural and smooth texture.  I do not look like I have a heavy application of anything on my face. Fourth, it has great coverage.  I have many age spots and freckles, large pores, and Italian/Green yellow undertones - essentially, my skin is not great.  This really helps me to feel good about my skin without looking like I plastered my face.  And I feel protected.  To boot, you cannot beat the price.  I was paying high dollar amount for big name products and still not satisfied with either the performance or ingredients.  This stuff is perfect - I hope they keep it on the shelves, I am a life time buyer!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I do use a daily moisturizer before applying but the need just depends on your skin type.  The BB cream goes on so smoothly and even.  My skin has really never looked better.  I love the SPF coverage and the lightweight formula is so wonderful.  I bought this looking for a quick make up routine for the work week but it has become my everyday product - even for a night on the town.  I just apply a little mineral concealer over it with a brush and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and it works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most beauty creams leave my skin feeling very dry.  I like this particular brand because it doesn&#x27;t!  The color works with my very light skin tone and, just the fact it doesn&#x27;t feel dry is enough for me to give it 5 Stars AND to buy it again!</li>
            <li> The texture is too heavy, not nice to see that it is actually on your skin...</li>
            <li> Lightweight so I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m wearing it, yet it covers my rosecea completely. SPF 30 makes my dermatologist happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try a cheaper bb cream but will not be purchasing again. The cream is very thick and heavy. I have to mix it with lotion to smooth properly. Will be going back to Bare Minerals bb cream tha t I prefer.</li>
            <li> I bought this and didn&#x27;t know if it would be dark enough but it was perfect. It has sunscreen in it and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do reviews often although I rely so heavily on what others say about products. This may sound too good to be true, but...My skin looks so much better! The light/medium appears dark, yet blends perfectly and produces a youthful glow that lasts all day.and the coverage lasts all day. This is my new favorite brand. If you&#x27;re still debating, stop&lt;br /&gt;and place your order.</li>
            <li> BB Creams-are so not what they claim! I&#x27;ve tried 5 different ones and have come down to two that I would actually use. This is my favorite and one of the least expensive of them all. It&#x27;s light weight but offers buildable coverage-you may have to add a little more to spots where the coverage is most needed- and it will even out your skin tone. I work outside and live in Florida, so I sweat! It does not run off like a foundation would and it offers moisturizing without a greasy feel. When I wash after work and remove it my skin feels smooth but not dry. It is not something I would wear when I go out in the evening, but for a lightweight coverage with sunscreen during the day, it&#x27;s perfect. For additional coverage on blemishes I sometimes use the concealer, but it seems to be keeping the breakouts to a minimum, so I haven&#x27;t needed it so much.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty product that I own.  Let me count the reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It is cheap!  BB creams from Sephora or a department store would cost nearly twice as much as this!&lt;br /&gt;(2) It is good for your skin.  It has an SPF rating of 30, which means that it not only contains sunscreen, but actually contains it in high enough amounts for it to legitimately protect your skin.  It&#x27;s also moisturizing, and it definitely works in that regard.  My skin&#x27;s not super-dry, but dry enough that I sometimes get flaky patches of skin in the winter, and it actually feels soothing to put this on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;(3) It has tremendous coverage for a bb cream.  A lot of bb creams are sheer, with maybe a hint of color.  Depending on your skin, this could replace your foundation.  My cheeks can get red sometimes, and depending on how red they are on a particular day, I sometimes forego foundation and just wear this.&lt;br /&gt;(4) When I&#x27;m in a rush to go somewhere and want to improve my appearance quickly, this stuff is PERFECT.  I once got home from an airplane flight (you know how haggard a person looks after that!) and was desperately hungry for dinner, so I just slathered some of this on my face and nothing else.  I was astonished at how this single product transformed me from a tired and dirty-looking passenger to a fresh-faced young woman.  No single makeup product can transform my looks as well as this thing can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the color: My skin&#x27;s light, but not super-light (III on the Fitzpatrick scale).  Not sure this color will work well on those with super-light skin.</li>
            <li> This was a little darker than I expected and kinda made me look orange... it did last a long time so it was good in the heat, but was smeared easily and had a weird texture.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed that they discontinued the above item after using it for many years.  I called the company and this product was recommended.  I just got it and like it very much!  It is very natural looking, nontoxic, price is right and color is perfect.  It is natural looking, yet has great coverage.  This one comes in a tube and I use it with my makeup sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry to normal skin and live in Southern California where it tends to be extremely sunny. After I cleanse my face in the morning, I use a little toner and put this BB cream on. It keeps my face moisturized but not oily, provides enough coverage, and looks NATURAL. For this reason, this works well on guys too! When my brother had no choice but to use some of this (because we didn&#x27;t have regular sunscreen on our hike) his face looked really nice but you couldn&#x27;t tell that he was wearing makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I top it off with my Physicians Formula BB powder (which I reapply every 2 hours as the direction says for sun protection) and my skin has been looking great :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I&#x27;m already on my 3rd tube and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using this.</li>
            <li> My go to foundation for a couple of years. Over 65 and does not settle into creases.  Use everyday for coverage and moisture. Combine with loose powder to set and more lasting.</li>
            <li> Like the coverage,  however, I must mix this with my moisturizer (Lanolin√© Rose firming cream).  The color is so orangey right out of the tube,  I don&#x27;t know anyone considered fair who could use it without looking like they just got a terrible spray tan. Good, light texture and feel, not all heavy and cake like. Love that it&#x27;s SPF 30. Relatively nontoxic,  too (it gets a fairly low rating by the EWG). Been using it for a couple years and won&#x27;t change anytime soon, though.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product in the past and really likes it, however, this order I&#x27;m rating never made it to her, US Postal Service lost it somewhere.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much always a light/medium to medium and this product in light/medium was way too dark and orangy for me.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it. Love how it looks. But lately I&#x27;ve been noticing more acne with use. Make sure to remove it completely at night would be my best advice.</li>
            <li> It is obvious on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this and love it.  Was glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expecations. I used it at the beach last week and was very happy. The only big issue is that it was a bit too dark for my skin. It does have quite a bit of color to it. I&#x27;m light, but not really pale so I took a guess at which shade to get. It looked fine when I was wearing clothes, but it was noticeable when I was in my swim suit because my face was a bit darker than the rest of my body - a problem accentuated by the slight white cast of the sunscreen that I used on my body. What I love about it is that it isn&#x27;t shiny or greasy. It evened out my skin and does look nice. When I applied enough of it to really protect well in the sun, it did feel a bit too heavy. I wanted to wash my face really well after a few hours, but that may be because I&#x27;m not used to using any foundation at all. Also, I did get a lot of bumps along my jawline and neck, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure if that was due to this product. I suspect that I may react to something in the physical sunscreens in general since I started getting the bumps all over my forehead (not acne but just little bumps that take a long time to go away) when I used a zinc oxide powder before.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and after using it once or twice, I got a pimple on my chin.  Didn&#x27;t want to blame the product without due course, so I used it again, and again, got a pimple on my temple (odd place for me).  Now, I see other reviewers stating it caused acne for them too.  So, now I actually do blame the product.  Too bad, because I bought the cream, powder, and highlighter package.  The coverage and color were just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34; I bought light to medium. I don&#x27;t think I would buy them again, even if it hadn&#x27;t caused acne.  As far as cleansing in concerned, I wash my face diligently every nice without fail with a high-end face wash, so  washing the makeup off didn&#x27;t help in my case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many BB creams. The last one used was Smashbox and this product is better than Smasbox at half the price. I have fair skin (not super white) and it matches perfectly. I use it instead of foundation. It covers what it needs to cover but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy feeling. I apply this with my URBAN DECAY OPTICAL BLURRING BRUSH which I think makes the difference. Use a circular motion with the brush when applying and stipple the areas that need more coverage. Can&#x27;t beat the price, especially with CVS coupons.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy and good coverage. This is perfect for when I&#x27;m in a rush heading out on a hike or something where I want to use sunscreen but hide my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars, but the color wasn&#x27;t right. Bought a sample size of this in the store before and loved it. Great coverage, feel and protection. Amazon had only med/light available, but I need light. Unfortunately this is too dark, but might keep it for the summer.</li>
            <li> This is a great (cheap!!) BB cream. I use Clinique foundation for covering acne and undereye circles so this goes on the rest of my face. It does its job well, providing enough coverage without being gloppy or anything. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like nearly every drugstore foundation. Overall a great product and the BB cream I&#x27;ll be sticking with from now on.</li>
            <li> i liked the feel of the product - the light medium color was too dark and didnt blend with my skin tone</li>
            <li> This is the best bb cream I&#x27;ve tried. I like bb creams because they agree with my dry, tight, flaky skin, but I don&#x27;t like how sheer they generally are. This one has a natural satin finish, but it delivers medium coverage that conceals my acne. Most foundations/bb creams that I&#x27;ve tried rub off on everything, but this stayed on my face all day.</li>
            <li> Bright pinkish-orange color. It&#x27;s such a strange tint, I couldn&#x27;t use it. The formula may be ok, but this color is very odd.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, great coverage, and rated well on ewg.org (less hazardous chemicals than previous BB creams I had been using).</li>
            <li> Love the coverage. Smooth transaction!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily, even after wearing all day. It does tend to be more medium than light.</li>
            <li> I love this! Just the right amount of coverage for day to day makeup. No funny smells.</li>
            <li> Perfect color.  I like these particular sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this online, but i was considering purchasing this product a few weeks before i actually got it.  i can have considerably oily skin occasionally, which is much less frequent during the winter (now!) This makes me hesitant to use something that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but this one has much better coverage than other bb creams i have tried and doesnt grease me up at all.  the general shade of the makeup is not very light, but as long as you don&#x27;t have stark-white skin it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from amazon, but got it at a CVS instead yesterday. (coupons!!!)&lt;br /&gt;and I must say, when i went home and applied it I saw an immediate difference. I put some on my niece&#x27;s face and she&#x27;s a bit lighter and it blended in so well, too.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking this was all in my head, today I wore it to one of my jobs and one of the girls I was babysitting turned around and looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Woah. you are beautiful!&amp;#34; - guess BB cream really does work! (lol)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice all in one!</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream that I&#x27;ve tried. My skin feels great all day and the Light/Medium is perfect for my light coloring.  It also gives more coverage than most BB creams.  Try this ladies I know you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found out PF made a BB cream (they are cruelty-free and lack parabens). So, I bought this at Target and was very happy with it initially. Light medium was the perfect shade for me and the product goes on very smoothly. The coverage is light - just enough to neutralize your skin tone but not too much that it looks like you have foundation on. After wearing it for the whole day however, I noticed it started almost &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; around my eyes. It settled into my crow&#x27;s feet, and made the mascara on my lower lashes smudge at no fault of my own (I never rub my eyes). I tried it again with UDPP underneath my lower lashes the next day and still, it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse is that after a few days of using it, my skin was duller and drier, and I got a pimple. It just lost its glow and looked so unhealthy. After stopping the BB cream, my skin regained its natural glow a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is cheap and may be a worth a try for you. It&#x27;s probably just my sensitive skin, but proceed with some skepticism.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the color I ordered and didn&#x27;t notice until I opened and tried to use. I won&#x27;t be ordering online for this again. As for the product it didn&#x27;t blend well but again is wasn&#x27;t what I ordered!</li>
            <li> great on my legs and arms!! as well</li>
            <li> I did not like this BB Cream. It is not flattering at I am going to try mixing it with an oil but it doesn&#x27;t do it for me the way it is.</li>
            <li> The Physicians Formula Super BB All-in-1 Beauty Balm Cream worked very well to brighten and smooth out my maturing complexion. I also love the SPF 30 sunscreen protection offered by the Beauty Balm Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy as I dotted the Beauty Balm onto my face and then gently smoothed it out. I was pleased with how much brighter (and perhaps younger) my face looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it every day! Makes my skin look airbrushed.</li>
            <li> Very watery and doesn&#x27;t apply evenly.</li>
