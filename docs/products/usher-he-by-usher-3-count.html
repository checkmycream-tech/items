            <li>I loved the set itself.</li>
            <li>The (2) perfumes (eau de toillete) did not seem in good condition.</li>
            <li>This is was a good deal for the pack, which came just as pictured.</li>

            <li>Two enthusiastic thumbs up.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lingering smell but not overpowering like some colognes.</li>
            <li>Got this for my honey he smell amazing love it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I love the sent it looks just like it did online.</li>
            <li>Free shipping!</li>
            <li>It is my favorite cologne, so I thought I would order the set with the shower gel and after shave as well.</li>
            <li>shower gel and after shave seem okay.</li>
            <li>They do smell better than the cologne though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better price on Amazon than buying it in an department store.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and after shave balm.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>He loves this product and so do I , he were it well :) :)</li>
            <li>:) :) love smelling this one on him</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>If Usher endorses a cologne, it&#x27;s gotta be good, right?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already got compliments on how good it smells so if you want a great smelling cologne get usher black or usher silver</li>
            <li>It reminded me of the cheap \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; that you could find in a gas station bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is the only cologne that my husband will wear and it smells great on him.</li>
            <li>Specially the afther shave..</li>
            <li>Maybe if you&#x27;ve never had the real thing before this seems like a good deal, or maybe I got a dud (I highly doubt it).</li>
            <li>its such a good price, considering at the mall</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Item shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>Shipping was good, product was as expected.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money,I see more of this product in my mans future!</li>
            <li>I first got it tho cheaper on here</li>
            <li>The bottle itself felt rough almost like fine sandpaper as opposed to the normally smooth bottle.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive compared to prices in stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are comparable to the real products or not.</li>
            <li>and I know very well this product.</li>
            <li>I asked some other people to compare the two to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me.</li>
            <li>Everyone I asked could immediately tell a difference and commented on how much the new \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; smelled like</li>
            <li>bought this for my 15 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I said, I&#x27;ve bought real Usher on numerous occasions.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 14yr old son as a Xmas gift.</li>
            <li>The after shave doesn&#x27;t break out his sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>Where I live - hard to fine.</li>
            <li>There was one main problem - THIS IS NOT REAL</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s what I ordered previously and it was the real deal.</li>

            <li> bought this as a gift, excellent set</li>
            <li> Item shipped very fast! Very good fragrance for a special man! Free shipping! Happy customer:)) I thought it would&#x27;ve came in box as shown in picture but didn&#x27;t. Very inexpensive compared to prices in stores.</li>
            <li> I rarely review products, and I&#x27;ve never written a negative review - until now. I&#x27;ve bought Usher cologne several times in the past from department stores as well as online (including Amazon). It is my favorite cologne, so I thought I would order the set with the shower gel and after shave as well. There was one main problem - THIS IS NOT REAL USHER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and immediately compared it to my last bottle. The bottle itself felt rough almost like fine sandpaper as opposed to the normally smooth bottle. The cologne smelled like it had been watered down with alcohol. It reminded me of the cheap \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; that you could find in a gas station bathroom. I asked some other people to compare the two to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me. Everyone I asked could immediately tell a difference and commented on how much the new \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; smelled like alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel and after shave seem okay. I&#x27;ve never bought them before, so I don&#x27;t know if they are comparable to the real products or not. They do smell better than the cologne though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;ve bought real Usher on numerous occasions. I know what it smells like, and this is not it. I&#x27;m not sure why it has such high ratings on Amazon. Maybe if you&#x27;ve never had the real thing before this seems like a good deal, or maybe I got a dud (I highly doubt it). It doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star rating, but one was required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the method of shipping (or something like that), I was not able to return the product (convenient). I wasted about $35 dollars on a fake product - I would never do it again. If I were you, I would order this individual bottle of Usher from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012RSXNG?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I ordered previously and it was the real deal. Or I would just go to a department store. It may be expensive, but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any (all) men!  Well worth the money,I see more of this product in my mans future!</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Get lots of compliments on this cologne. It&#x27;s a much better price on Amazon than buying it in an department store.</li>
            <li> NICE ADDITION TO MY FRAGRANCE COLLECTION. GREAT PRICES ON AMAZON AS ALWAYS. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING TO FRAGANCE SHOPS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Usher alright.  The stores in the different malls in our area kept telling us they would have to order it for us.  Found it here at Amazon.com.  My husband is extremely please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift but is a great fragrance</li>
            <li> Love the scent, makes a great gift. Bought it for my brother in law for Christmas. He was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I been using Usher cologne for years. Love the fragrance and after shave balm. Where I live - hard to fine.</li>
            <li> excellent product, nice smell</li>
            <li> Awesome price for this</li>
            <li> If Usher endorses a cologne, it&#x27;s gotta be good, right?  Bought this set for my fianc&amp;eacute; for Xmas . It&#x27;s a great value and smells amazing. Two enthusiastic thumbs up.</li>
            <li> LIke everyone else, I LOVE this fragrance! Got this for my 14yr old son as a Xmas gift. Though it didnt look like the pic (came in regular gift set box), it did come with all components and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The (2) perfumes (eau de toillete) did not seem in good condition. I bought before and I know very well this product.</li>
            <li> i love this!! its such a good price, considering at the mall the cologne is $60 itself, but for this price i get all this! its great, it smell great and i definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves it. It has a nice lingering smell but not overpowering like some colognes. The after shave doesn&#x27;t break out his sensitive skin either. Delivered faster than estimated too.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne that my husband will wear and it smells great on him. This is was a good deal for the pack, which came just as pictured.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my boyfriend.  He loves it and I love it.  Smells great c:</li>
            <li> my wife buys this for my son every year. this year we saved money and didn&#x27;t have to look around for it!</li>
            <li> Product as described, flawless on-time delivery and you can&#x27;t beat the price......</li>
            <li> He loves this product and so do I , he were it well :) :) :) :) love smelling this one on him</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I can smell it tho the box. Hopefully the guy I give it to likes it like he like the other, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the same is we&#x27;re I first got it tho cheaper on here</li>
            <li> Excellent product... Specially the afther shave..</li>
            <li> Come with a lot for the price because, one bottle this size at the department store costs $50.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my honey and he loves it</li>
