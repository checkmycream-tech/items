    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li>The product, Closys Oral Rinse, is excellent.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist was impressed with the improved condition of my mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li>TRULY THE BEST !!!</li>
            <li>Best mouth wash out there.  </li>
            <li>Excellent mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Wonderful anti-bacterial effect.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and Transaction</li>
            <li>This product, is the best I have found for protecting my teeth and mouth from bacteria.</li>
            <li>It is also superb for keeping plaque off the teeth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t tingle, which is great, but it works against bacteria because it does contain chlorine dioxide.  </li>
            <li>After all of the great reviews, I was expecting SOMETHING.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years, great alternative to flavored mouthwashes, and does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hygienist tells me all the time what a good job I&#x27;m doing on my teeth</li>
            <li>This product arrived timely and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Loved the service and the this product is unflavored and that&#x27;s make it sooo good</li>

            <li>Love Closys!</li>
            <li>The price is so much better than over the counter too !</li>
            <li>Otherwise this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It tastes like water but the effects are amazing.  </li>
            <li>No flavor, but the mint essence is nice when added to the bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice taste with the added flavor and dentist says it may also whiten a little!&lt;br /&gt;five</li>
            <li>The taste is so pleasant that I find it easy to use twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Safe and effective.</li>
            <li>But Dr. Elie advises against that because \\&quot;a chlorine-dioxide rinse is most effective if it is unflavored.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best for breath freshening, yet does not taste strong.</li>
            <li>OK, as a pre wash.  </li>
            <li>Gurgle for more than 30 seconds as well as swoosh around in your mouth for another 30 seconds and let this miracle take care of business.  </li>
            <li>i love this mouth wash, it&#x27;s alchol free!  </li>
            <li>I brush, floss, scrape my tongue, chew gum, eat mints, gargle and nothing lasts for more than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash seems to balance the ph in my mouth and some days I use it more than once.</li>
            <li>Unlike most antiseptic oral rinses, there is no alcohol and burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, anthrax contaminated facilities were reportedly treated by chlorine dioxide.</li>
            <li>Love how it gets rid of all the undesirable tastes and odor in mouth with no bite or aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>So glad I discovered it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gifted it to others</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I add the entire vial and find it perfect for my tastes, but not everyone would agree.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s an interesting read.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, and lasts for 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Closys for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I like being able to purchased a product without alcohol sugars.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also great is you can find decent prices here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Part of a fabulous protocol for healthy gums and teeth</li>
            <li>kinda works, it was fun to add my own flavoring</li>
            <li>Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth]] by Elie Phillips DDS.</li>
            <li>Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I used it and it didn&#x27;t have that strong alcohol taste.  </li>
            <li>I use it without the added flavor and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>THE MINT TASTE IS FINE FOR ME.</li>
            <li>The taste is just fine</li>
            <li>Kind of tingly that lasted a long time and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a dentist&#x27;s book, &amp;#34;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye&amp;#34;  She recommended a few products, of which I got all of them and was very happy with the results--no more pain, thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Has a light peppermint taste from the peppermint oil you mix in.</li>
            <li>Everything about it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews I have read by people who use this as a standalone rinse are very positive about it.    </li>
            <li>To get a newly-produced bottle, I choose to order this product from Amazon, and the Closys I received from Amazon always seemed very fresh.    </li>
            <li>I wrote a detailed overview under that item&#x27;s listing, if you are interested in learning more about her system.)    </li>
            <li>I used this product for six month along with flossing and my dentist said my gums and teeth were in great shape better than the previous cleaning.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth clean w/o any sugary film.</li>
            <li>my mouth is clean</li>
            <li>If you could pair that coupon with a drugstore chain&#x27;s occasional sale or %-off discount coupon, a 32-ounce bottle bought in a bricks-and-mortar store might cost in the region of $9 or $10 thatway, which is a good deal.    </li>
            <li>At the present time, Amazon sells this rinse at good prices, in four sizes:</li>
            <li>it leaves it clean and fresh, without feeling like</li>
            <li>and my mouth still feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It tastes fine, but makes everything taste funny the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Yet it is powerful ion its effect.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this rinse has no artificial colors, flavors, taste enhancers, sweeteners, alcohol, etc.    </li>
            <li>Simple, effective.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth more sensitive.</li>
            <li>improved an infection that had been ongoing improved overall oral health highly recommend to all friends, colleagues, &amp; loved ones.</li>
            <li>This product was good for me, but ineffective for 2 out of 3 peoples in my family who tried it and experienced an unpleasant aftertaste or irritation that prevented using this mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>If you just want to give this rinse a trial before committing to ordering a lot of it, or if you want a small travel-size bottle for popping in your briefcase/purse/backpack/suitcase, the 3.4-ounce bottle is a good buy at just over two dollars at the moment, and it&#x27;s an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; product which means it ships free with a valid Amazon order.</li>
            <li>I liked the taste and slight burning sensation of this alcohol free mouth wash</li>
            <li>more words sometime less is better</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is the first step in Dr. Ellie&#x27;s dental program.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had coffee, chinese food, more coffee</li>
            <li>It actually tastes like water, however, it freshens your breath and keeps your gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>Morning breath isn&#x27;t really even an issue either!</li>
            <li>If you are hesitant you can try the trial/travel size first.</li>
            <li>I have just begun using the product, and am very hopeful it will remove bacteria from my mouth, keeping the chances of infection to a minimum!</li>
            <li>Some reviewers mention a funny taste in their mouth.</li>
            <li>The best value per ounce is with the two large bottles, but I also bought one 16-ounce bottle because it&#x27;s easier to use that size of bottle on a daily basis in my bathroom (when it runs low, I fill it up from the 32-ounce bottle which I store outside the bathroom).    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what the long term health effects of chlorine dioxide may be, but this product works.</li>
            <li>From that article, the reduction of mouth odor was not dramatic (by about 40-50%).</li>
            <li>But if swishing CloSYS around in my mouth twice a day can help save me from needing to see a periodontist or receiving yet another chair-side lecture by my dentist&#x27;s super critical  hygienist, it&#x27;ll be well worth it.  </li>
            <li>other mouth wash products with alcohol are actually harming your mouth, and this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It has a very light, tiny bubbling action when used.</li>
            <li>very slight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS~~~~</li>
            <li>or really it&#x27;s a non-flavor to me</li>
            <li>so you can add as much as you prefer.  </li>
            <li>Control\\&quot; that lets users add however much mint flavor they like to  suit their tastes.</li>
            <li>Product itself is nice and effective but i was not happy when i was not informed of a back order on the product after ordering it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE lemons and other citrus fruits.</li>
            <li>For anyone who is only familiar with the quart size container, this pony size is a true visual deception.</li>
            <li>She also finds it helpful for removing \\&quot;the kind of bacteria that are found in gum pockets around your teeth\\&quot; and especially recommends it for seniors, teenagers and people with extremely dry mouths.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mouthwash if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>It is free of alcohol and does not sting or dry the mouth.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly pronounced when I swallow.  </li>
            <li>Also, I was surprised by the claim that (a strong and unstable oxidant) chloride dioxide was stabilized in solution so efficiently for a long shelf life.</li>
            <li>highly recomend it</li>
            <li>We like the idea that this has &amp;#34;no taste,&amp;#34; and was highly recommended by our dentist.  </li>
            <li>I loathe normal mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>the free sample of toothpaste that was enclosed inside the box had an expiration date nearly 16 months prior to my shopping trip, so it was logical to assume that those bottles came off the assembly line quite some time earlier.  </li>
            <li>Use it to clean wounds, clear ear wax, clean eye lids, knock down budding sore throats with spray, clear sinus problems with dropper.</li>
            <li>It has absolutely no flavor, but does seem to clean the mouth.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t for me, but the person who uses it has had a drastic change that no other mouthwash did much about.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve tried it, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t leave the intense or strong aftertaste of usual mouthwashes and your mouth</li>
            <li>It has barely any taste (it tastes mostly like water), but all sizes of Closys -- aside from the 3.4 ounce travel/trial size bottle -- come with a little container of peppermint oil flavor drops for those customers who choose to add some flavor.    </li>
            <li>Closys rinse is a clear, non-staining mouth rinse.    </li>
            <li>It may have also helped improve issues with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I got this for a regimen for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive and appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not a laughing matter to me even though I laugh with them.  </li>
            <li>High price for only 16 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes your breath fresh, cuts down on plaque and prevents stains on the teeth.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash really works for dry mouth as recommended by my husband&#x27;s dentist.  </li>
            <li>No other mouthwash has performed like this.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is supposed to get rid of the bad mouth cavity causing bacteria while letting the good ones live.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s odd is that when I&#x27;m rinsing, the taste is actually quite mild, relatively speaking.  </li>
            <li>In a peer-reviewed research article \\&quot;Efficacy of a chlorine dioxide-containing mouthrinse in oral malodor a one-time use of a chlorine dioxide-containing mouthrinse\\&quot; published by TKL Research, Inc., in 2000, it was reported that testing of chlorine dioxide mouse rinse in 31 men and women significantly improved mouth odor pleasantness, reduced mouth odor intensity, and reduced volatile sulfur compound concentrations in mouth air for at least 8 hours after use.</li>
            <li>I drink water almost exclusively, and even a day after using, the rinse gives such a sour taste to the water that I can&#x27;t manage more than a few sips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She also recommends xylitol, which sounds toxic is actually a natural sugar like substance from birch trees or corn which kills the bad bacteria and allows the good ones to survive.</li>
            <li>As I sit here and type this review, it&#x27;s been nearly 24 hours since my last (and final) rinse yesterday evening.  </li>
            <li>My hands are  unable to handle such a large bottle, not to mention the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fit in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>also recommends Listerine, but I won&#x27;t use it since it has an acid pH which may eat up my enamel, and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use her fluoride mouthwash recommendation because I heard it may make the teeth less flexible and more brittle.</li>
            <li>Chloride dioxide, the final active ingredient of this mouthwash, is a known biocide approved by FDA for certain uses.</li>
            <li>I would love to give it to some other people but don&#x27;t want to be rude.</li>
            <li>For the first few days, I was rinsing in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is still the case, but it&#x27;s worth checking their site to see.  </li>
            <li>If I had realized this was a small bottle I could have bought the 32 oz for a few dollars more at CVS.</li>
            <li>and you can put a few drops of it in the large bottle of mouth</li>
            <li>I never use the little bottle of mint that comes with it since the Closys really is flavorless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive and the rise doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like other mouthwash does.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and notice that I don&#x27;t have any breath (good, bad, or otherwise).The instructions recommend that you use 2 caps--I only use 1 and still get results.  </li>
            <li>It may not taste as good as brand name mouthwash but since the first day that I started using CloSYS Rinse; no more bad breath for 24 hrs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wrote a detailed overview under that item&#x27;s listing, if you are interested in learning more about her system.)    </li>
            <li> I used this product for six month along with flossing and my dentist said my gums and teeth were in great shape better than the previous cleaning.</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth clean w/o any sugary film.</li>
            <li> my mouth is clean</li>
            <li> If you could pair that coupon with a drugstore chain&#x27;s occasional sale or %-off discount coupon, a 32-ounce bottle bought in a bricks-and-mortar store might cost in the region of $9 or $10 thatway, which is a good deal.    </li>
            <li> At the present time, Amazon sells this rinse at good prices, in four sizes:</li>
            <li> it leaves it clean and fresh, without feeling like</li>
            <li> and my mouth still feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It tastes fine, but makes everything taste funny the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Yet it is powerful ion its effect.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this rinse has no artificial colors, flavors, taste enhancers, sweeteners, alcohol, etc.    </li>
            <li> Simple, effective.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth more sensitive.</li>
            <li> improved an infection that had been ongoing improved overall oral health highly recommend to all friends, colleagues, &amp; loved ones.</li>
            <li> This product was good for me, but ineffective for 2 out of 3 peoples in my family who tried it and experienced an unpleasant aftertaste or irritation that prevented using this mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> If you just want to give this rinse a trial before committing to ordering a lot of it, or if you want a small travel-size bottle for popping in your briefcase/purse/backpack/suitcase, the 3.4-ounce bottle is a good buy at just over two dollars at the moment, and it&#x27;s an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; product which means it ships free with a valid Amazon order.</li>
            <li> I liked the taste and slight burning sensation of this alcohol free mouth wash</li>
            <li> more words sometime less is better</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the first step in Dr. Ellie&#x27;s dental program.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had coffee, chinese food, more coffee</li>
            <li> It actually tastes like water, however, it freshens your breath and keeps your gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> Morning breath isn&#x27;t really even an issue either!</li>
            <li> If you are hesitant you can try the trial/travel size first.</li>
            <li> I have just begun using the product, and am very hopeful it will remove bacteria from my mouth, keeping the chances of infection to a minimum!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mention a funny taste in their mouth.</li>
            <li> The best value per ounce is with the two large bottles, but I also bought one 16-ounce bottle because it&#x27;s easier to use that size of bottle on a daily basis in my bathroom (when it runs low, I fill it up from the 32-ounce bottle which I store outside the bathroom).    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what the long term health effects of chlorine dioxide may be, but this product works.</li>
            <li> From that article, the reduction of mouth odor was not dramatic (by about 40-50%).</li>
            <li> But if swishing CloSYS around in my mouth twice a day can help save me from needing to see a periodontist or receiving yet another chair-side lecture by my dentist&#x27;s super critical  hygienist, it&#x27;ll be well worth it.  </li>
            <li> other mouth wash products with alcohol are actually harming your mouth, and this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It has a very light, tiny bubbling action when used.</li>
            <li> very slight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS~~~~</li>
            <li> or really it&#x27;s a non-flavor to me</li>
            <li> so you can add as much as you prefer.  </li>
            <li> Control\\&quot; that lets users add however much mint flavor they like to  suit their tastes.</li>
            <li> Product itself is nice and effective but i was not happy when i was not informed of a back order on the product after ordering it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE lemons and other citrus fruits.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is only familiar with the quart size container, this pony size is a true visual deception.</li>
            <li> She also finds it helpful for removing \\&quot;the kind of bacteria that are found in gum pockets around your teeth\\&quot; and especially recommends it for seniors, teenagers and people with extremely dry mouths.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mouthwash if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> It is free of alcohol and does not sting or dry the mouth.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly pronounced when I swallow.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was surprised by the claim that (a strong and unstable oxidant) chloride dioxide was stabilized in solution so efficiently for a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> highly recomend it</li>
            <li> We like the idea that this has &amp;#34;no taste,&amp;#34; and was highly recommended by our dentist.  </li>
            <li> I loathe normal mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> the free sample of toothpaste that was enclosed inside the box had an expiration date nearly 16 months prior to my shopping trip, so it was logical to assume that those bottles came off the assembly line quite some time earlier.  </li>
            <li> Use it to clean wounds, clear ear wax, clean eye lids, knock down budding sore throats with spray, clear sinus problems with dropper.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no flavor, but does seem to clean the mouth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me, but the person who uses it has had a drastic change that no other mouthwash did much about.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve tried it, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t leave the intense or strong aftertaste of usual mouthwashes and your mouth</li>
            <li> It has barely any taste (it tastes mostly like water), but all sizes of Closys -- aside from the 3.4 ounce travel/trial size bottle -- come with a little container of peppermint oil flavor drops for those customers who choose to add some flavor.    </li>
            <li> Closys rinse is a clear, non-staining mouth rinse.    </li>
            <li> It may have also helped improve issues with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I got this for a regimen for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive and appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not a laughing matter to me even though I laugh with them.  </li>
            <li> High price for only 16 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> It makes your breath fresh, cuts down on plaque and prevents stains on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> This mouthwash really works for dry mouth as recommended by my husband&#x27;s dentist.  </li>
            <li> No other mouthwash has performed like this.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is supposed to get rid of the bad mouth cavity causing bacteria while letting the good ones live.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s odd is that when I&#x27;m rinsing, the taste is actually quite mild, relatively speaking.  </li>
            <li> In a peer-reviewed research article \\&quot;Efficacy of a chlorine dioxide-containing mouthrinse in oral malodor a one-time use of a chlorine dioxide-containing mouthrinse\\&quot; published by TKL Research, Inc., in 2000, it was reported that testing of chlorine dioxide mouse rinse in 31 men and women significantly improved mouth odor pleasantness, reduced mouth odor intensity, and reduced volatile sulfur compound concentrations in mouth air for at least 8 hours after use.</li>
            <li> I drink water almost exclusively, and even a day after using, the rinse gives such a sour taste to the water that I can&#x27;t manage more than a few sips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She also recommends xylitol, which sounds toxic is actually a natural sugar like substance from birch trees or corn which kills the bad bacteria and allows the good ones to survive.</li>
            <li> As I sit here and type this review, it&#x27;s been nearly 24 hours since my last (and final) rinse yesterday evening.  </li>
            <li> My hands are  unable to handle such a large bottle, not to mention the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fit in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> also recommends Listerine, but I won&#x27;t use it since it has an acid pH which may eat up my enamel, and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use her fluoride mouthwash recommendation because I heard it may make the teeth less flexible and more brittle.</li>
            <li> Chloride dioxide, the final active ingredient of this mouthwash, is a known biocide approved by FDA for certain uses.</li>
            <li> I would love to give it to some other people but don&#x27;t want to be rude.</li>
            <li> For the first few days, I was rinsing in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is still the case, but it&#x27;s worth checking their site to see.  </li>
            <li> If I had realized this was a small bottle I could have bought the 32 oz for a few dollars more at CVS.</li>
            <li> and you can put a few drops of it in the large bottle of mouth</li>
            <li> I never use the little bottle of mint that comes with it since the Closys really is flavorless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive and the rise doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like other mouthwash does.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and notice that I don&#x27;t have any breath (good, bad, or otherwise).The instructions recommend that you use 2 caps--I only use 1 and still get results.  </li>
            <li> It may not taste as good as brand name mouthwash but since the first day that I started using CloSYS Rinse; no more bad breath for 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific, and arrives, usually, with a little bottle of peppermint additive that we purposely don&#x27;t use, but others would enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Next to no taste (you can add mint if you want, because they include a small bottle of flavoring) and very soothing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth seem to be less sensitive since I am using all these products</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t add the flavor it comes with this has almost no taste so it is a really great solution for people like me who really hate the taste of mint and other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Completely natural and comes with a little breath minter.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed that my gums were no longer bleeding or even sensitive after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I NEED A LONG TIME TO FINISH IT.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is a little expensive for a product that had been on the market for many years.</li>
            <li> only thing that the flavor liquid for the mouth wash still deosnt make the mouth was sweet&lt;br /&gt;but other than</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough to know it was a smaller bottle - half the size I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this rinse for a few weeks, too soon for a personal testimonial.</li>
            <li> A pre-rinse with CloSYS  before brushing, says Dr. Elie, \\&quot;is extremely gentle on the delicate mouth tissues and yet actively removes some kinds of harmful mouth</li>
            <li> It has very little taste, if anything its a tiny bit soapy but totally manageable.</li>
            <li> Slightly helped morning breath, but only with the mint drops.  </li>
            <li> She recommends we rinse before brushing, using a routine that allows the back teeth to be bathed in the rinse, because the area around the back molar teeth is where gum disease usually starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth felt really clean, but not worth it for the weird feeling.</li>
            <li> Be careful on pricing.</li>
            <li> My mouth is less dry</li>
            <li> Chlorite would produce chlorine dioxide under acidic conditions in the mouth, but as stated on the label, the description of the active ingredient appears to be inaccurate.</li>
            <li> It is made of: water, stabilized chlorine dioxide (the active ingredient), trisodium phosphate, and citric acid.    </li>
            <li> like steralizing my mouth at least twice a day, as much as is possible, and feel this is the way to do it without any harshesss.</li>
            <li> (much less so than by Listerine).</li>
            <li> But after seeing a review saying DRUGSTORE.com has half the price</li>
            <li> Made my gums feel odd...</li>
            <li> It controls the bad breath, but I can only trust the claims about high anti-microbial efficiency (comparable to Chlorhexidine, with some advantages, according to the website of Rowpar Pharmaceuticals, the distributor of this product).</li>
            <li> I find that rinsing with water a few times helps to neutralize this odd flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel, after a few days of using this, that your teeth and mouth and tongue are&lt;br /&gt;cleaner</li>
            <li> It is NOT cheap but it work.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, the stains on my teeth have disappeared after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I bought 16oz from Swanson Vitamins and a put a quarter tablespoon each day of the granules on my tongue to dissolve and swish around for a few minutes each day.</li>
            <li> A few reviewers of this product have said that Closys has altered their sense of taste, but I did not notice any harmful effects on my tastebuds.    </li>
            <li> However, in my town, 3 drugstores sell Closys, but when I went to buy some locally, all the boxes of it were on bottom shelves, dusty, and out-of-date.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any flavor, but it does come with a little mint flavor bottle where you can add a drop to a small cup, or all of it to the bottle if you want a minty</li>
            <li> No more burning, it&#x27;s like rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CloSYS antiseptic rinse for the past week, but now I&#x27;m throwing it away.  </li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t like the alcoholic nature.</li>
            <li> I could not handle the strong aftertaste, so I took a reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to just use the rinse at night, but unfortunately, the aftertaste is just as bad.  </li>
            <li> I am dead serious about my oral health and teeth maintenance.</li>
            <li> I get cleanings at least four times a year.</li>
            <li> This moutwash is miraculous to say the least.</li>
            <li> Use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Now it is very rare and in addition my bad breath is under control!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps differing biology makes others less susceptible to the sourness of this rinse, but I think anyone who experiences it the way I have would be unable to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Still a little expensive.</li>
            <li> It has next to no taste, which I like because I can tell whether it&#x27;s just masking my bad breath, or eliminating it.  </li>
            <li> She claims that when used before brushing and without any added flavor, this chlorine dioxide rinse  can not only strengthen and protect teeth, it can also have an immediate effect on bad</li>
            <li> Whether it actually has any breath-freshening properties is irrelevant to me, because the rinse leaves such a terrible aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> people are allergic to peppermint and it can be a bit irritating to some people&#x27;s mouths.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I&#x27;d adapt to the taste, but it seems like it&#x27;s just getting worse, as though the aftertaste is compounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other mouthwashes, takes care of bad breath by killing bacteria on your tongue and your throat.  </li>
            <li> I know this stuff seems expensive by comparison, but for me it&#x27;s this or no mouthwash at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tasteless, unless you add the mint oil it comes with.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have bad morningbreath anymore.</li>
            <li> It kills bad breathe too.  </li>
            <li> My breath is embarrassingly bad</li>
            <li> My kids (mouthy teens) begged me to get help for my bad breath.  </li>
            <li> After using it I haven t had bad breath since.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t use the peppermint drops), but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I know they are bad for my tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> CloSYS Antiseptic Oral Rinse with mint flavor was recommended to me by my Dental Hygienist to eliminate bad breath.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of medications that may cause the bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Thus, the price was bad.</li>
            <li> It claims to kill 99.9% of germs that cause bad breath within seconds, to reduce the population of harmful bacteria in the mouth for hours after use, and to reduce plaque and tartar buildup.    </li>
            <li> I have always hated mouthwash...</li>
            <li> I just got very shocked.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t feel the buildup of nasty odors in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started Dr Ellies program (you can find it when you google Dr Ellie). I am trying to remineralize my teeth so see if some tiny cavities will disappear the next time I see the dentist. She recommends this prerinse, Crest toothpaste, Listerine and Act fluoride rinse in combination with Xylitol to remineralize your teeth. My mouth is less dry and I do not have bad morningbreath anymore. My teeth seem to be less sensitive since I am using all these products and I don&#x27;t get sore throats like I used to anymore. The only thing I do not like about this product is the price!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> OK, as a pre wash.  Needs some flavor, even with the added flavor pac.</li>
            <li> The product, Closys Oral Rinse, is excellent.  However, I ordered two 16 ounce bottles and the supplier sent one 32 ounce bottle.  The supplier said they were sending the correct size bottles ----- that was almost one month ago.  My hands are  unable to handle such a large bottle, not to mention the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fit in the medicine cabinet.  I have no recouse with this supplier --- just have to charge it off.  Next time I&#x27;ll try to get this locally.  Or from another on-line supplier.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the first step in Dr. Ellie&#x27;s dental program.  It makes your breath fresh, cuts down on plaque and prevents stains on the teeth.  It has no taste so I don&#x27;t bother using the flavor that is provided with the mouthwash.  My dental hygienist was impressed with the improved condition of my mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li> High price for only 16 oz bottle. If I had realized this was a small bottle I could have bought the 32 oz for a few dollars more at CVS.</li>
            <li> I had the beginnings of gum disease and my dentist reccomended Closys mouth rinse.  I have always hated mouthwash...too strong...burns...horrible taste.  This is very different.  Next to no taste (you can add mint if you want, because they include a small bottle of flavoring) and very soothing.  After a few weeks I noticed that my gums were no longer bleeding or even sensitive after brushing.  The taste is so pleasant that I find it easy to use twice a day.  It kills bad breathe too.  NO ALCOHOL.  It even soothes the mouth sores I get from medication.    TRULY THE BEST !!!</li>
            <li> I am dead serious about my oral health and teeth maintenance. I get cleanings at least four times a year. I use this along with a WaterPik, Sonicare toothbrush and follow this at night with a rinse of Act flouride mouth rinse.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in over ten years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is flavorless but includes a tiny separate bottle of peppermint oil and you can put a few drops of it in the large bottle of mouth rinse if you prefer a flavored mouth rinse.&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to adjust the amount of peppermint to your taste.&lt;br /&gt;Many people are allergic to peppermint and it can be a bit irritating to some people&#x27;s mouths. I put only three drops in this so it is very slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel, after a few days of using this, that your teeth and mouth and tongue are&lt;br /&gt;cleaner and fresher. This contains a form of chlorine which is patented by this company.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn the mouth the way daily use of hydrogen peroxide would. It is almost like swishing water in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like steralizing my mouth at least twice a day, as much as is possible, and feel this is the way to do it without any harshesss.</li>
            <li> Slightly helped morning breath, but only with the mint drops.  Unfortunately, not enough mint drops for that entire bottle. It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> No flavor, but the mint essence is nice when added to the bottle. It has a very light, tiny bubbling action when used. It makes my mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Best mouth wash out there.  Unlike other mouthwashes, takes care of bad breath by killing bacteria on your tongue and your throat.  Gurgle for more than 30 seconds as well as swoosh around in your mouth for another 30 seconds and let this miracle take care of business.  No more burning, it&#x27;s like rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is only familiar with the quart size container, this pony size is a true visual deception. Be careful on pricing. Otherwise this product is amazing. Use it to clean wounds, clear ear wax, clean eye lids, knock down budding sore throats with spray, clear sinus problems with dropper.</li>
            <li> i love this mouth wash, it&#x27;s alchol free!  other mouth wash products with alcohol are actually harming your mouth, and this product is amazing!  it leaves it clean and fresh, without feeling like your mouth is on fire!</li>
            <li> My breath is embarrassingly bad and I know it.  My friends know that I know it and we joke about it, but it&#x27;s really not a laughing matter to me even though I laugh with them.  I brush, floss, scrape my tongue, chew gum, eat mints, gargle and nothing lasts for more than 30 minutes.  I received the CloSYS rinse yesterday and tried it out this morning.  It has next to no taste, which I like because I can tell whether it&#x27;s just masking my bad breath, or eliminating it.  I gargled and swished for the 30 seconds and that was it.  It has been over 7 hours and my mouth still feels clean and fresh.  I&#x27;ve had coffee, chinese food, more coffee and I can&#x27;t feel the buildup of nasty odors in my mouth.  My tongue is not fuzzy. The difference between yesterday afternoon and this afternoon are like night and day.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I really can&#x27;t.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This moutwash is miraculous to say the least. It does not taste like anything, almost like water. Yet it is powerful ion its effect. After years of trying different products, my dentist recommended Closys. It is the absolute best for breath freshening, yet does not taste strong. Also use the companion toothpaste by the same name.</li>
            <li> I Use this every day, has made a big difference in my dental and gum health, just had a check up last week big improvement</li>
            <li> Completely natural and comes with a little breath minter.  It tastes like water but the effects are amazing.  My kids (mouthy teens) begged me to get help for my bad breath.  After using it I haven t had bad breath since.  I would love to give it to some other people but don&#x27;t want to be rude.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CloSYS antiseptic rinse for the past week, but now I&#x27;m throwing it away.  Whether it actually has any breath-freshening properties is irrelevant to me, because the rinse leaves such a terrible aftertaste.  For the first few days, I was rinsing in the morning and at night.  I could not handle the strong aftertaste, so I took a reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to just use the rinse at night, but unfortunately, the aftertaste is just as bad.  What&#x27;s odd is that when I&#x27;m rinsing, the taste is actually quite mild, relatively speaking.  It does have a medicinal taste (I didn&#x27;t use the peppermint drops), but it&#x27;s not too bad.  As I sit here and type this review, it&#x27;s been nearly 24 hours since my last (and final) rinse yesterday evening.  I&#x27;ve eaten breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a couple of snacks today, and I can still taste the sourness of the rinse in the back of my mouth.  It&#x27;s particularly pronounced when I swallow.  I drink water almost exclusively, and even a day after using, the rinse gives such a sour taste to the water that I can&#x27;t manage more than a few sips.  I was hoping I&#x27;d adapt to the taste, but it seems like it&#x27;s just getting worse, as though the aftertaste is compounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps differing biology makes others less susceptible to the sourness of this rinse, but I think anyone who experiences it the way I have would be unable to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it twice a day, along with the toothpaste.  It has dramatically changed the health of my teeth.  It&#x27;s tasteless, unless you add the mint oil it comes with.  It helps with tartar buildup, gingivitis, yellowing and stains.  It may have also helped improve issues with sensitive teeth.  My hygienist tells me all the time what a good job I&#x27;m doing on my teeth and it&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent mouthwash. It appears to do everything it claims to do. I use it without the added flavor and it&#x27;s fine. I do recommend this item and will continue to reorder it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a dentist&#x27;s book, &amp;#34;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye&amp;#34;  She recommended a few products, of which I got all of them and was very happy with the results--no more pain, thank you very much!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK. I NEED A LONG TIME TO FINISH IT. THE MINT TASTE IS FINE FOR ME. I USE THIS FOR CURE MY TOOTH INFLAMMATION. IT REALLY WORKS~~~~</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t tingle, which is great, but it works against bacteria because it does contain chlorine dioxide.  Safe and effective.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample.  I used it and it didn&#x27;t have that strong alcohol taste.  It actually tastes like water, however, it freshens your breath and keeps your gums healthy.  The bottle states that it kills 99% of the bacteria in your mouth. When I rinse at night I have no morning breath the morning.  I found the 16 oz bottle on  Amazon for @ $10.00.  Bought a couple bottles and a tube of the toothpaste.  I found that I could get the 32 oz bottle at Walgreens for $12.00.  I will never be without this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Although the peppermint takes a bit to get used to, this has worked wonders. It wasn&#x27;t for me, but the person who uses it has had a drastic change that no other mouthwash did much about. Morning breath isn&#x27;t really even an issue either! When I&#x27;ve tried it, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t leave the intense or strong aftertaste of usual mouthwashes and your mouth just seems clean/neutral. What&#x27;s also great is you can find decent prices here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> After all of the great reviews, I was expecting SOMETHING. I didn&#x27;t mind the lack of taste (I didn&#x27;t bother putting in the flavoring), but didn&#x27;t notice this working at all.</li>
            <li> Part of a fabulous protocol for healthy gums and teeth</li>
            <li> I LOVE lemons and other citrus fruits. I know they are bad for my tooth enamel. This mouthwash seems to balance the ph in my mouth and some days I use it more than once. There is no dye. I&#x27;m very sensitive and the rise doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like other mouthwash does.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it has stop the bacteria growing in my gums .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend it</li>
            <li> Love Closys! Leaves mouth clean w/o any sugary film. Has a light peppermint taste from the peppermint oil you mix in.</li>
            <li> Use it at least once a day. Flavor packet helps. Recommended by my dentist. Still a little expensive. But hope it works!</li>
            <li> No alcohol means no burning!  Wonderful anti-bacterial effect.  This product has literally saved my teeth!  Since I started using closys, my disease has finally begun to dissipate.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash really works for dry mouth as recommended by my husband&#x27;s dentist.  The price is so much better than over the counter too !</li>
            <li> I would of given it 5 stars if the price had not gone up...</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t add the flavor it comes with this has almost no taste so it is a really great solution for people like me who really hate the taste of mint and other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> improved an infection that had been ongoing improved overall oral health highly recommend to all friends, colleagues, &amp; loved ones.</li>
            <li> This product arrived timely and in good condition.  Unlike most antiseptic oral rinses, there is no alcohol and burning sensation.  My dental hygentistic recommended it to me and I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I use it without the flavoring that comes in the box with it.  It has absolutely no flavor, but does seem to clean the mouth.</li>
            <li> This product was good for me, but ineffective for 2 out of 3 peoples in my family who tried it and experienced an unpleasant aftertaste or irritation that prevented using this mouth rinse. Therefore, only 2 stars. In addition, it is a little expensive for a product that had been on the market for many years. I liked the taste and slight burning sensation of this alcohol free mouth wash (much less so than by Listerine). It controls the bad breath, but I can only trust the claims about high anti-microbial efficiency (comparable to Chlorhexidine, with some advantages, according to the website of Rowpar Pharmaceuticals, the distributor of this product). In a peer-reviewed research article \\&quot;Efficacy of a chlorine dioxide-containing mouthrinse in oral malodor a one-time use of a chlorine dioxide-containing mouthrinse\\&quot; published by TKL Research, Inc., in 2000, it was reported that testing of chlorine dioxide mouse rinse in 31 men and women significantly improved mouth odor pleasantness, reduced mouth odor intensity, and reduced volatile sulfur compound concentrations in mouth air for at least 8 hours after use. From that article, the reduction of mouth odor was not dramatic (by about 40-50%). I am a chemist and would like to comment about one marketing pitch for this product. Chloride dioxide (ClO2) is said to react with sulfur containing volatile compounds produced by bacteria found on the back of the tongue, rather than simply masking the order. Also, I was surprised by the claim that (a strong and unstable oxidant) chloride dioxide was stabilized in solution so efficiently for a long shelf life. Indeed, a Wikipedia article on ClO2 stated that the term \\&quot;Stabilized chlorine dioxide\\&quot;  is a misnomer, referring simply to sodium chlorite, not chlorine dioxide. Chlorite would produce chlorine dioxide under acidic conditions in the mouth, but as stated on the label, the description of the active ingredient appears to be inaccurate. I suppose that giving no reference to sodium chlorite was intentional, as a related oxidant, sodium hypochlorite, is a component of chlorine bleach (never put chlorine bleach in the mouse!). Chloride dioxide, the final active ingredient of this mouthwash, is a known biocide approved by FDA for certain uses. Interestingly, anthrax contaminated facilities were reportedly treated by chlorine dioxide.</li>
            <li> I used this product for six month along with flossing and my dentist said my gums and teeth were in great shape better than the previous cleaning.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and Transaction</li>
            <li> Love how it gets rid of all the undesirable tastes and odor in mouth with no bite or aftertaste.  So glad I discovered it.  I&#x27;ve gifted it to others</li>
            <li> CloSYS Antiseptic Oral Rinse with mint flavor was recommended to me by my Dental Hygienist to eliminate bad breath. I brushed my teeth 3 - 4 times a day but did not help.  I take a lot of medications that may cause the bad breath.  This product work!!!  It may not taste as good as brand name mouthwash but since the first day that I started using CloSYS Rinse; no more bad breath for 24 hrs. I used it twice a day. It is NOT cheap but it work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the flavoring. The taste is just fine or really it&#x27;s a non-flavor to me is just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I loathe normal mouthwashes. I find the taste overpowering and they make me gag. Also I don&#x27;t like the alcoholic nature. This mouthwash is totally inoffensive. It has very little taste, if anything its a tiny bit soapy but totally manageable. If you are hesitant you can try the trial/travel size first. I know this stuff seems expensive by comparison, but for me it&#x27;s this or no mouthwash at all.</li>
            <li> I got this for a regimen for sensitive teeth. It tastes fine, but makes everything taste funny the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I use it alone with Dr. Ellie&#x27;s 3 part protocol and I have to say, the stains on my teeth have disappeared after a few months.  My teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive and appear whiter.  I also notice that my toothpaste is &amp;#34;foamier&amp;#34; when I brush after rinsing with the Closys.  I never use the little bottle of mint that comes with it since the Closys really is flavorless.</li>
            <li> Everything about it is fantastic. Just the price... But after seeing a review saying DRUGSTORE.com has half the price, I went there and checked... Yes. 12 dollars for 32 oz. I am not working as their advertisement agent.. I just got very shocked.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product, she sells it in her office, but suggested  I purchase it through Amazon for a price savings!  It is a great product. The peppermint essential oil comes in a separate vial so you can add as much as you prefer.  I add the entire vial and find it perfect for my tastes, but not everyone would agree.  I have just begun using the product, and am very hopeful it will remove bacteria from my mouth, keeping the chances of infection to a minimum!</li>
            <li> Recommended in the book Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye by Ellie Phillips. This mouthwash is supposed to get rid of the bad mouth cavity causing bacteria while letting the good ones live. It doesn&#x27;t have any flavor, but it does come with a little mint flavor bottle where you can add a drop to a small cup, or all of it to the bottle if you want a minty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also recommends xylitol, which sounds toxic is actually a natural sugar like substance from birch trees or corn which kills the bad bacteria and allows the good ones to survive. They think it&#x27;s sugar, but they can&#x27;t digest it and die. I bought 16oz from Swanson Vitamins and a put a quarter tablespoon each day of the granules on my tongue to dissolve and swish around for a few minutes each day. I also bought xylitol mints and gum on Amazon to use a couple times a day after meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also recommends Listerine, but I won&#x27;t use it since it has an acid pH which may eat up my enamel, and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use her fluoride mouthwash recommendation because I heard it may make the teeth less flexible and more brittle. Anyways, it&#x27;s an interesting read.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough to know it was a smaller bottle - half the size I expected.  Thus, the price was bad.</li>
            <li> I recently began using CloSYS as part of the twice daily routine recommended in the book [[ASIN:B009LPLMRU Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth]] by Elie Phillips DDS. A pre-rinse with CloSYS  before brushing, says Dr. Elie, \\&quot;is extremely gentle on the delicate mouth tissues and yet actively removes some kinds of harmful mouth bacteria.\\&quot;  She also finds it helpful for removing \\&quot;the kind of bacteria that are found in gum pockets around your teeth\\&quot; and especially recommends it for seniors, teenagers and people with extremely dry mouths. She claims that when used before brushing and without any added flavor, this chlorine dioxide rinse  can not only strengthen and protect teeth, it can also have an immediate effect on bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s all this about not adding flavor?  Well, CloSYS, when you buy it, comes flavorless, but the box the bottle comes in also contains a wee squeeze bottle of \\&quot;Flavor Control\\&quot; that lets users add however much mint flavor they like to  suit their tastes. But Dr. Elie advises against that because \\&quot;a chlorine-dioxide rinse is most effective if it is unflavored.\\&quot; She recommends we rinse before brushing, using a routine that allows the back teeth to be bathed in the rinse, because the area around the back molar teeth is where gum disease usually starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this rinse for a few weeks, too soon for a personal testimonial. But if swishing CloSYS around in my mouth twice a day can help save me from needing to see a periodontist or receiving yet another chair-side lecture by my dentist&#x27;s super critical  hygienist, it&#x27;ll be well worth it.  And then some.</li>
            <li> My gums used to bleed everytime I brushed my teeth. Now it is very rare and in addition my bad breath is under control!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what the long term health effects of chlorine dioxide may be, but this product works. I use it in the morning and notice that I don&#x27;t have any breath (good, bad, or otherwise).The instructions recommend that you use 2 caps--I only use 1 and still get results.  Some reviewers mention a funny taste in their mouth. I find that rinsing with water a few times helps to neutralize this odd flavor. It&#x27;s not terrible, and lasts for 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Nice taste with the added flavor and dentist says it may also whiten a little!&lt;br /&gt;five more words sometime less is better</li>
            <li> Closys rinse is a clear, non-staining mouth rinse.    It is free of alcohol and does not sting or dry the mouth.    It claims to kill 99.9% of germs that cause bad breath within seconds, to reduce the population of harmful bacteria in the mouth for hours after use, and to reduce plaque and tartar buildup.    It has barely any taste (it tastes mostly like water), but all sizes of Closys -- aside from the 3.4 ounce travel/trial size bottle -- come with a little container of peppermint oil flavor drops for those customers who choose to add some flavor.    It is made of: water, stabilized chlorine dioxide (the active ingredient), trisodium phosphate, and citric acid.    I like the fact that this rinse has no artificial colors, flavors, taste enhancers, sweeteners, alcohol, etc.    A few reviewers of this product have said that Closys has altered their sense of taste, but I did not notice any harmful effects on my tastebuds.    I had not heard of Closys before I began to follow Dr. Ellie&#x27;s dental care system a couple of years ago.  (It is: \\&quot;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth\\&quot;. I wrote a detailed overview under that item&#x27;s listing, if you are interested in learning more about her system.)    Because the Dr. Ellie program involves using 3 different dental rinses back-to-back every time you brush your teeth, I could not tease apart the effects of the Closys rinse by itself -- however, it seemed to work well.    Most of the reviews I have read by people who use this as a standalone rinse are very positive about it.    ---  By the way -- Closys used to offer a printable dollar-off coupon on their website, and you could print it off regularly. I am not sure if this is still the case, but it&#x27;s worth checking their site to see.  If you could pair that coupon with a drugstore chain&#x27;s occasional sale or %-off discount coupon, a 32-ounce bottle bought in a bricks-and-mortar store might cost in the region of $9 or $10 thatway, which is a good deal.    However, in my town, 3 drugstores sell Closys, but when I went to buy some locally, all the boxes of it were on bottom shelves, dusty, and out-of-date. I could tell they were out-of-date because even though the paperboard box and the rinse bottle did not have any expiration date on them, the free sample of toothpaste that was enclosed inside the box had an expiration date nearly 16 months prior to my shopping trip, so it was logical to assume that those bottles came off the assembly line quite some time earlier.  To get a newly-produced bottle, I choose to order this product from Amazon, and the Closys I received from Amazon always seemed very fresh.    ---  At the present time, Amazon sells this rinse at good prices, in four sizes: two 32-ounce bottles packed together, one 32-ounce bottle, one 16-ounce bottle, and one 3.4-ounce miniature bottle.    The best value per ounce is with the two large bottles, but I also bought one 16-ounce bottle because it&#x27;s easier to use that size of bottle on a daily basis in my bathroom (when it runs low, I fill it up from the 32-ounce bottle which I store outside the bathroom).    If you just want to give this rinse a trial before committing to ordering a lot of it, or if you want a small travel-size bottle for popping in your briefcase/purse/backpack/suitcase, the 3.4-ounce bottle is a good buy at just over two dollars at the moment, and it&#x27;s an \\&quot;add-on\\&quot; product which means it ships free with a valid Amazon order.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific, and arrives, usually, with a little bottle of peppermint additive that we purposely don&#x27;t use, but others would enjoy.  We like the idea that this has &amp;#34;no taste,&amp;#34; and was highly recommended by our dentist.  Been using it for years, great alternative to flavored mouthwashes, and does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying!  And Amazon recently noted on our cart info that the price was recently lowered.  Simple, effective.  Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I liken it to an apple a day keeping the doctor away - Using Closys each day keeps the dentist at bay. This product, is the best I have found for protecting my teeth and mouth from bacteria. It is also superb for keeping plaque off the teeth. No other mouthwash has performed like this. I highly recommend this mouthwash if you are concerned about keeping your teeth as clean as possible. You will really see a difference at your next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> Loved the service and the this product is unflavored and that&#x27;s make it sooo good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Closys for more than 10 years. Closys has no alcohol or alcohol sugars (isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol). I like being able to purchased a product without alcohol sugars. Closys leaves no aftertaste except for peppermint flavor. The only downside is the cost. It&#x27;s probably one of the most expensive mouthwashes in the market but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was really good my mouth is clean&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that the flavor liquid for the mouth wash still deosnt make the mouth was sweet&lt;br /&gt;but other than that it is really good</li>
            <li> Made my gums feel odd... like they&#x27;d been immersed in bleach. Kind of tingly that lasted a long time and not in a good way. Made my teeth more sensitive. My mouth felt really clean, but not worth it for the weird feeling. Awful.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference on my teeth&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> kinda works, it was fun to add my own flavoring</li>
            <li> Product itself is nice and effective but i was not happy when i was not informed of a back order on the product after ordering it.  i only found out over a week later when i started to inquire about my order status.</li>
