            <li>/&gt;We are now looking at some of their tweezers as well and are hoping the quality is as good as they are with the clippers!</li>

            <li>A fine durable product, makes a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that there are two of these clipper available because sometimes my brother just goes away carrying with him any stuff without and sounds at all</li>
            <li>Amazing quality.</li>
            <li>What can you say about this kind of product?</li>
            <li>Really liked the two sizes in the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have one for fingernails and one for toes.</li>
            <li>These are really nice.  </li>
            <li>Toe clipper works better with good grip, neither has any way to file nails and/or take the edge off.</li>
            <li>I gave up on nail clippers over $0.99 after shattering a pair of Revlon ones (I guess I don&#x27;t know my own strength?).</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best clippers around.  </li>
            <li>They are nice quality.</li>
            <li>which is nice if you don&#x27;t plan to travel with them.</li>
            <li>this nice.  </li>
            <li>wow!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The fit and finish are very nice.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these, having read great reviews.</li>

            <li>it makes a great, clean cut.</li>
            <li>They cut very nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes very nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Nice and strong nail clippers!</li>
            <li>Good stuff Easy to use</li>
            <li>Very strong nail clippers that do not bend even when used on thicker toe-nails.</li>
            <li>Tweezer man is the best by far!</li>
            <li>By far the best set of clippers!</li>
            <li>If I had bought these Tweezerman Deluxe nail clippers years ago, I&#x27;d have known better.  </li>
            <li>These nail clippers are by far the best ones out there!</li>
            <li>These are by far the best clippers I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Great pruduct, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t think they would be all that much better than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very good, high quality nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>do own two pairs of the Tweezerman brand tweezers which I love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>Most clippers tend to snag my toe-claws, but this was a good, clean, cut.</li>
            <li>Now with the Teezerman Deluxe Nail Clippers we get easy cuts that make trimming nails a snap.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be better.</li>
            <li>I love that this purchase came as two-size set.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I bought these nail clippers on a recommendation and when I tried them out, they weren&#x27;t able to clip my nails.</li>
            <li>I love this clipper.</li>
            <li>These clippers really are great.</li>
            <li>came in on time and they did a great job thanks</li>
            <li>Have not rusted in the shower after many months.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman need we say more.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>should they start to work better.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>These are simply the best nailvlippers I&#x27;ve found on the market.  </li>
            <li>Simply put these are the best nail clippers ever!</li>
            <li>We use the fingernail clipper more that the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li>I purchased these after seeing them rated by several websites as the best nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Toe nail cclippers - not too sure about.  </li>
            <li>I love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>After going through many sets of clippers that needed to be trashed almost immediately, this set was bought based on the Amazon feedback.  </li>
            <li>Can find a better quality elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Would rather pay more for better quality.</li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t think about nail clippers and just pick up the 99 cent ones from the grocery check-out isle.</li>
            <li>I believe more should be included.</li>
            <li>It also has a more stable feel to it.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>so I ordered more.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>I have had personal experience with the tweezers, I was impressed by them, they saved my life one time (read the review).</li>
            <li>better made than the lost ones.  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I need to clip many time to cut the nails.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman products.  </li>
            <li>What more do you need?</li>
            <li>Better quality too.</li>
            <li>just ok.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, will probably last me 20 years!</li>
            <li>Never again will I buy the cheap kind and replace them every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They provide a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good and very fast shipp</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a real good nail clipper you plan to invest in to use for a long time without repurchasing, this is not it.</li>
            <li>These are very precise and sharp - the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Great set of nail clippers; clean cuts and that&#x27;s really all that needs to be said.</li>
            <li>product arrived as expected and is the perfect replacement for my decades-old clippers.  </li>
            <li>They perform as expected but are not as awesome as I was hoping for at this price.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;d be better off with the cheap drugstore clippers these replaced.</li>
            <li>No question my cheap drug store clippers are easier to use and do a better job.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They do a good job, but who wants to spend time clipping nails?</li>
            <li>Came to Amazon to find a good pair and wanted to share that these are absolute junk.</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re good, strong in construction and very well made.</li>
            <li>We have been very happy with this set and are thinking about buying another set so that the other clippers can be trashed.</li>
            <li>awesome!  Sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li>perfect sharp nail clippers  one for me, one for my husband.</li>
            <li>never knew such good slippers exist!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and are the best pairs i&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li>Easy to grip.</li>
            <li>They feel more as if they&#x27;re tearing my nail off and don&#x27;t do a clean cut.</li>
            <li>They cut easily, too.</li>
            <li>The lever may pop off and the holding pin is easy to lose.</li>
            <li>They clip easily and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>cut easily</li>
            <li>Cuts clean vs the cheap brands that chews your nail off!</li>
            <li>These are strong and reliable.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy &amp; strong.</li>
            <li>these are strong and do the job well.  </li>
            <li>They are quite attractive, but they share a major problem -- they do not cut.</li>
            <li>This is not the first Tweezerman product I own.  </li>
            <li>you care about nice things, and are willing to splurge on nail clippers, don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li>Best Set of Clippers I have had hands down.</li>
            <li>Strong, accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are hands down, the best pair of clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Very sharp clippers that are perfectly aligned.  </li>
            <li>Mine came perfect and very sharp.</li>
            <li>Cuts my nails just fine</li>
            <li>they clip toenails just fine.  </li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy these clippers because they feel strong (not flexy) when I cut my toenails.</li>
            <li>Very good-- just what I expected</li>
            <li>Solid and good looking, but wish they had been sharpened more finely.  </li>
            <li>Once you use these you will never use a cheap pair again.</li>
            <li>Cuts smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Remaining nails are smooth without a burr.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to my clippers making a click sound and at that point the nail being clipped.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers cut cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction, and the quality of the clip is amazing.</li>
            <li>Get the pour-homme ultra slim clippers for $28, and you will see how amazing a real quality cutter works.</li>
            <li>The two pieces of the clipper don&#x27;t meet precisely, so the clipper just doesn&#x27;t cut well.</li>
            <li>The blades are great, you can cut a lot of things not only nails...</li>
            <li>No traction available on fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>I bought this set at a local department store (Target) and I was expecting great things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not too impressed though - same or more effort involved than with my old non-brand-name clippers, both toe and fingernail versions.  </li>
            <li>no function to smooth nails.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut precisely.  </li>
            <li>fair, better than those above</li>
            <li>But still, solidly made and good looking, better than anything I&#x27;d used before</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The larger toenail clipper is excellent too, with a  straight clipper edge to trim the thicker nails of the feet correctly.</li>
            <li>$.99 pair from the drug store cuts better, is much lighter and more portable, includes a nail file, and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I thought these were going to be some great clippers, but really they are nothing special.</li>
            <li>looks good but any other clipper I have used is better quality than this one, go to Walmart and get a set like this one for 6 dollars and really better quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These came recommended from thewirecutter website, and I have to say that this, along with a few other merchandise recommended on that website, makes me question how exactly they come up with their verdicts on &#x27;best of the best&#x27;.</li>
            <li>However, this toe nail clipper is super strong and it cuts my toe nails with ease.</li>
            <li>Although I have never purchased Tweezerman brand items before, I am familiar with their products and their reputation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cutting quality is great and these have lasted me for a long time with care.</li>
            <li>Uniquely wierd is the amount that the lever bends.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>The nail clipper was a bit small and flimzy, but the toe mail clipper is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used very cheap clippers (the kind that come with travel kits) night and day difference.</li>
            <li>works great really sharp and cuts easy</li>
            <li>These are a great pair of tweezers: sharp, strong, and comforatble to hold.</li>
            <li>They are machined well so the blades meet cleanly and... clip toenails.  </li>
            <li>Feels like clean quality in the hand.</li>
            <li>thingie that you can clean under your nails with.  </li>
            <li>Clean cut.</li>
            <li>They clip nails cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Cut cleanly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than other clippers, plus good pricepoint too.</li>
            <li>Curved for fingers, straight for toes, super sharp and a perfect clean cut every time.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, cute well and easily.  </li>
            <li>The only thing they do not have that would make a good addition is a under the nail tool.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really expect much more.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for a this product.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, toe nail clipper is straight like all toe nail clippers should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>These are great clippers, sharp stainless steel,not some crappy metal with chrome plating like many of the others.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>These are pretty good, but for the price and based on the reviews, I expected more.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp, great product and performance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually need new nail clippers, but I saw all the great reviews and figured, for cheap money I might as well upgrade since I will probably be using them for years and years to come.  </li>
            <li>Seriously the best nail clippers ever used.</li>
            <li>The others were adequate.  </li>
            <li>amazing thing about the pour homme clippers is that they actually *cut* your nails instead of crushing them.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair of cheap Trim deluxe clippers and they work twice better than the tweezerman clippers for half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend these over the super cheapies that you can buy in the grocery store checkout lane.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Both broke the very first time we use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These clippers feel so much better than a normal drug store pair</li>
            <li>it was ok , and it came on time , no complaint .</li>
            <li>/&gt;These have a great feel and are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and they feel great mechanically.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Best quality nail clippers I have ever used and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>feels more solid and durable, plus they are easy to identify as yours - a plus in a house where kids keep &#x27;borrowing&#x27; your stuff</li>
            <li>One thing though: they need to be &amp;#34;broken in.&amp;#34; The first twenty of so times you use them, they cut really sharply and the nail clippings fly all over the place.</li>
            <li>So much better than the 15-20 year old clippers I got from my parents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice there is a more precise one for smaller nails and a larger set.</li>
            <li>I was going to make fun of my girlfriend for spending $10 on nail clippers, then I used them.</li>
            <li>They are also very solidly constructed so its more comfortable to use than a flimsy set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think these are well-made, reasonably-priced, and quite effective.</li>
            <li>I recently read a review on the Tweezerman Deluxe Nail Clippers via The Sweethome blog.</li>
            <li>Unlike most every pair I have ever owned/used, these cut through the nail with ease COMPLETELY, there is no need to clip and pull, these cut all the way through every time.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>overall gets the job done though and looks nice too.</li>
            <li>Kind of an essential piece they forgot to design this with.</li>
            <li>I can imagine someone just wanting one clipper to do everything, I wanted distinct two clippers.</li>
            <li>Great nail clipper set, very hefty, sturdy and sharp.  </li>
            <li>but luckily I found all the pieces and was able to put it back together quickly.</li>
            <li>Other than that its good I guess</li>
            <li>Stick with them though, and that stops and they become more like normal, drugstore type clippers, only better in every way.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>Fingernail clipper arrived with defect right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews about the blades not matching up or something not being right with the blades.</li>
            <li>The best clipper I ever owned was, of all things, a Sharper Image clipper which had a rubber inlay in the handle, making them VERY comfortable to hold, and also making them virtually impossible to slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li>The fingernail clippers are fine but the toenail clippers do not have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; or power to cut through toenails easily.</li>
            <li>These are nice but not sure they cut any better than the $4 ones I can buy and the checkout line.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves both clippers, thanks maybe he will leave my alone now, more in the future for sure, thanks</li>
            <li>They are lighter than the average model, yet feel more secure and deliver a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly and healthy my nails grow back.</li>
            <li>Not only is the black/gunmetal look a lot more professional looking, but the quality within this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I figured it was time to upgrade and spend a little more money in order to get a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to trimming your nails quickly and aren&#x27;t interested in giving it any more thought than that, I&#x27;d go find some regular old-school clippers elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Had it been a little larger it would have been wonderful.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and cut nicely.</li>
            <li>very sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li>very sharp good product</li>
            <li>Good set of nail clippers, very sharp and cut thru the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li>These look good in the drawer with all of my other grooming supplies, but otherwise don&#x27;t perform any better than a cheaper generic pair.  </li>
            <li>Good solid klipper , i could have used this years ago , and finnaly just went on amazon and ordered it (after my son kept taking my old one)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken several years, but I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing the cheap nail clippers that are available at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Quality not as good as typical Tweezerman</li>
            <li>They are precise and solid unlike the cheap ones you find sold for 99 cents at the checkout line.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how well the clippers have kept sharp and the way in which I can clip my toes/fingers.</li>
            <li>They cut my nails very ruggedly and after the very first use, the metal lever got caught in the hole that acts as the fulcrum</li>
            <li>These are nice and sharp, although quality is not quite as good other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li>Each of the clippers are very sharp and precise and they are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a huge quality difference from anything I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li>I promise never to go back to the cheap nail clippers again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do seem like a better overall quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the pour-homme ultra-slim clippers for over a year now, and while they&#x27;re a lot more expensive (3 times more), they&#x27;re more than 3 times</li>
            <li>The first nail I cut with this clipper went flying, and is sitting somewhere buried in my carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first set my wife took so</li>
            <li>The larger pair worked ok.</li>
            <li>When I first took them out of the package, the metal and design looked like they were made by Apple.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how these are any better than what I could&#x27;ve bought at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Will never go back to the cheap ones!</li>
            <li>Look to a different brand with better quality control.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time buying a Tweezerman product.</li>
            <li>I think my Roomate fell in love with my last pair!!</li>
            <li>These work only slightly better than generic nail clippers from the pharmacy or supermarket, but seem to be better made.</li>
            <li>I opened nail tweezers for first time and tried to turn clipper handle to use.</li>
            <li>After losing my last pair, I decided to see if Tweezerman made a better product.</li>
            <li>The bigger ones work much better.</li>
            <li>Definitely higher quality than others I have bought.</li>
            <li>Very well made!</li>
            <li>These clippers are heavy compared to the crappy ones in the grocery store checkout line, which I take to be a good sign.  </li>
            <li>The cutting surface is at a slant, and is really sharp, so they give the nail a nice clean, perfect tapered cut.</li>
            <li>I did my right hand first and had to really struggle to cut one nail.</li>
            <li>So you think, these are just basic/cheap nail clippers, I don&#x27;t really care about the quality - right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all relative when it comes to preferences on personal hygiene equipment, but for me, I prefer to have a nice clean &#x27;click&#x27; when i cut my nails.</li>
            <li>Under light pressure most clippers cut almost immediately, with little or no bending in the lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The clippers are sharp and have a nice feel in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They look really sharp and nice quality also, sturdy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp for the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp?  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s even better is that if they become dull, Tweezerman will sharpen them for free!</li>
            <li>Good cutting and easy to grip, but no file to smooth the edge of the fingernail.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and cut the nails cleanly (no ragged edges) and easily.</li>
            <li>I also love the flt black finish on the handle because it looks cool</li>
            <li>Any number of reviewers have made positive comments about these clippers.</li>
            <li>I can only give 2 stars for fast delivery, and the bigger one being good.</li>
            <li>bought this tweezerman set thinking that they would be as good, judging by the review on thesweethome, but they cut nails no better than the $2 ones you can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>: It seems it is not as easy to position the blade of this new nail clipper onto my finger nail as my old one.</li>
            <li>Very strong and sharp.</li>
            <li>The bigger one isn&#x27;t easy to use and requires a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li>but I wish the large ones had curved blades.</li>
            <li>The Toenail Clipper is quite large.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, the handle doesn&#x27;t rotate around like crappy dollar store clippers, and the metal is of decent quality.</li>
            <li>they are well made pretty heavy gauge material used to manufacture these and they are simply just  great.</li>
            <li>Sharp,  high quality, nice finish.</li>
            <li>The people who say they don&#x27;t make a clean cut are right; I even tried when my nails were wet, right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Only downside is they do not have a little&lt;br /&gt;file or nail scraper with them, which is fine</li>
            <li>Slightly rough out of the box, but after you use them a little they become very good.</li>
            <li>pair is super sharp and precise, no need to go over with a nail file.</li>
            <li>They cut toe nails straight and smooth even the thicker big toe.</li>
            <li>like the straight cut toe nail cutter and for my finger nails</li>
            <li>I expected them to be more ... something.</li>
            <li>so I expected these to be better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be the last set of clippers you buy - I&#x27;ll never use cheap dollar store clippers again.</li>
            <li>toenail clippers are straight across.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly you are supposed to trim your toenails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t curved much</li>
            <li>The straight cut isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it would cut straight across.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Much nicer than store bought junk.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap &amp;#34;check-out lane&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Cuts very well.</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy clippers.</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>I really like these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Very robust.</li>
            <li>The finger nail clippers work on my nails well, but an included nail file would be appreciated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These feel very sturdy and well constructed, and cut nails</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expected a lot more from this company.</li>
            <li>the toenail clipper is straight, not curved.</li>
            <li>just like all tweezerman products I&#x27;ve tried, they work very well.</li>
            <li>Whole family use these for finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>not made very well.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sturdy and cut well.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then Seki brand, but</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>At lease the smaller one is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>The toenail clippers are better, but if you have not used a straight clipper before, consider carefully before you buy these.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in a slightly heavier-duty, more precise-cutting nail clipper set, then these are just what you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>These tend to cut better, stay sharp longer, and are thus far well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the large clipper is not properly sharpened and does not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>I really like the straight edge, which ensures a clean, proper cut of each toenail.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they stay sharp and make a good cut after several months of use.</li>
            <li>however they have no nail filer like most other brands I have had over the years.</li>
            <li>Just slightly better than $2.99 clippers, not sure these are worth it.</li>
            <li>The cut is very sharp and leaves the nails feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>Well made, sharp, accurate, easy to use with larger hands</li>
            <li>Yes, at $9, they might be about $8 more than you ever expected to pay for nail clippers, but I can definitely say that for me, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I love how sharp these are!</li>
            <li>Go to the drug store and you&#x27;ll find better clippers for half the price.</li>
            <li>luckily, i know how to put them back together!</li>
            <li>You will find yourself cutting your nails more often because these are so nice to use.</li>
            <li>, I ended up going back and buying a set for several more family members.  </li>
            <li>, I just thought it was funny as one would never typically buy nail clippers to impress but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied enough to have ordered a second pair for the office.</li>
            <li>even the lever action to cut nails feels very fluid and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think my expectations may have just been too high.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Everything I needed - I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for clippers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The high reviews sold me</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Hopefully someone makes a high quality blade coupled with a rubber surface handle.</li>
            <li>These are some high quality clippers.</li>
            <li>After hearing these Tweezerman clippers come highly recommended, I bit the bullet and bought a pair.</li>
            <li>Looks high quality</li>
            <li>These did not allow me to cut the sharp corners, being so huge and straight angled.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, precise, and work very well.</li>
            <li>Good quality but not as sharp as expected or needed.</li>
            <li>very sharp, very clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Was I surprised!!  </li>
            <li>I cut them pretty regularly, but had never noticed how healthy the sharp cut makes my nails.</li>
            <li>I think I was just expecting a little more.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they came with a case, but at this price, it&#x27;s hard to complain.</li>
            <li>Sharp and strong.</li>
            <li>Since my past experience had been great, I expected that to be the case here.</li>
            <li>They seem better built and MUCH sharper than the usual off-brand clippers.</li>
            <li>They are more expensive than cheap run-of-the-mill clippers, but work way better, especially with my humongous toenails on my big toes!</li>
            <li>These are worth the investment, so buy the fingernail clipper and toenail clipper at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they were broken for good.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, clean, durable - better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>How different could they be, right?  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp, and precise.</li>
            <li>Nice, but doesn&#x27;t have the little nail cleaner in the middle</li>
            <li>These things are strong, durable, and best of all they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; when I clamp down hard on my stubborn thick toe nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just what I want from a new set of nail clippers</li>
            <li>I have owned a set of these for 6 years and had to just order a new set because my girlfriend has stated she lost them.</li>
            <li>but I am gonna go ahead and purchase the Seki Edge Toenail Clippers now and hope they live up to their &#x27;hype&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Fingernail clipper broke into pieces on first use, feels cheap, certainly not made with the same quality control as their tweezers.</li>
            <li>Both are made of strong materials and are very sharp.</li>
            <li>Tired of the cheap nickel plated cheap ones from the pharmacy?</li>
            <li>These are seriously well made and cut nicely.  </li>
            <li>But be careful when you flip the lever around: it comes off the unit, and is challenging to put back on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>The large one broke after just a few uses but we were able to put it back together.</li>
            <li>I though the file was pretty much a standard part of any pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman offers free sharpening but they also require insured postage both ways, which is more expensive than the item&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li>The old cutters we had used to gnaw at our nails and for some reason (I blame my wife!)</li>
            <li>The smaller one fell apart the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and they look clean for nail clippers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and provide clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and cut precisely where I need it.</li>
            <li>All previous ones were cheap walmart purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they also have sharper corners making them less comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Revlon brand for several years, that brand doesn&#x27;t last more than a few years, and they really don&#x27;t clip very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are used to buying the normal everyday cheap Walgreens or Fred Meyers nail clippers</li>
            <li>The long one has good leverage for those thick toenails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a regular nail clipper, not sharp enough to be outstanding, but enough to clip your nails without difficulties to apply pressure.</li>
            <li>So when I was recently looking for some new nail clippers, I found this set and was actually surprised that the price tag was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this set over pretty much any other nail clippers I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used the super \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; drugstore clippers my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re tired of buying cheap crap and want a set of nail clippers that will last a long while and be truly awesome to work with--seriously, these are what you want.</li>
            <li>They are both attractive looking and sharp but the nail clipper is really too small for my hands, and I suspect most men&#x27;s hands and thus difficult to grip.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and well-made.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and well made</li>
            <li>Nothing special - just average.</li>
            <li>The company offered to replace them but to ship the original back would cost the same as buying a new one from a different company.</li>
            <li>I would buy something sharper next time since I really struggle to get them to cut.</li>
            <li>That was unexpected.</li>
            <li>feel like quality in the hand, and so far they cut even through my gnarly toe nails with ease.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised and amazed by this</li>
            <li>Much sharper than generic clippers from pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li>and he said he couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between these and his old worn out clippers.  </li>
            <li>This is the second set I bought, since everyone in the family wants to borrow mine.</li>
            <li>So i ordered these from here because i was gonna be busy all weekend.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels like good quality but not great.</li>
            <li>good quality but too expensive</li>
            <li>does the same quality job, though you won&#x27;t find &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; on it! :) Very sharp!</li>
            <li>They feel very solid when in use and don&#x27;t appear to be cheaply made like other brands.</li>
            <li>, and it&#x27;s cool that they&#x27;re black instead of the ubiquitous silver nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews on thesweethome, they are tuff, cuts clean, comfortable to use, one for foot one for hand, cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li>although minor is that I had to use a little more force them</li>
            <li>Really sharp and useful.</li>
            <li>The item was missing in the original mail package</li>
            <li>my old one broken for long time, I see this one just in a case, and love it very much</li>
            <li>The clippers almost seem to be medical device -- they are that high in quality.</li>
            <li>The flex on the lever doesn&#x27;t help with the apparent effort, and they don&#x27;t seem to be noticeably sharper than my old ones.</li>
            <li>These are sharper than any other cheap clipper I used before, but the straight blade on the larger one and especially the missing nail file are big enough problems that I&#x27;d prefer my old cheap clipper back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are tough and masculine nail clippers, the metal seems thicker than most others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>So much sharper then the crappy clipper&#x27;s from the big corporate stores.</li>
            <li>I expected the clippers to be of very high quality; they were a bit better than average, but not like my other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li>It was a MAJOR pain to open the p trap and retrieve the column piece and then have to package the whole thing up and return it because it would not go back together again.  </li>
            <li>Quality on these seemed pretty good and they were sharp but the little clipper seemed baby size and too small (and I don&#x27;t have big hands).</li>
            <li>The clippers are well made and are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>They use very little force to cleanly cut the nail.</li>
            <li>Sharp looking nail clippers that do a good, not great job.  </li>
            <li>They may seem a little pricey, but they are worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and maintain my positive impression of Tweezerman products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not good enough</li>
            <li>I was unhappy with as the first time I tried it and turned the top part around to get it into the clipping position - it stuck.</li>
            <li>exactly as expected and works very well.</li>
            <li>Quality is readily apparent and they perform admirably.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived duller than my ten year old clipper.</li>
            <li>not very sharp.</li>
            <li>The large clipper is sharp and works well.  </li>
            <li>Quality steel, positive and predictable action.</li>
            <li>Con: I was surprised to see the smaller finger nail clippers don&#x27;t cut through my 7 year old&#x27;s (pretty thin) nails very well.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and sharp.</li>
            <li>The clippers are sharp and cut very well.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and made out of stainless steel not chromed steel.</li>
            <li>Since they are very easy to fall apart if pressure is applied to the wrong places.</li>
            <li>The small tweesers broke on the first use!</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough or usability</li>
            <li>I feel the clippers are not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>I have probably purchased 3 or 4 sets for him from different companies and within a few days will tell me they just don&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li>This fingernail clipper broke apart the first time I tried to use it and the little column piece flew out and went straight down my bathroom sink drain.  </li>
            <li>I use them on our 4 month old and our 2 year old because they are so sharp.</li>
            <li>After some remarkably complex sharpening they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li>one is because it clipped cleanly the one nail I was able to clip before the stupid thing broke.  </li>
            <li>Not as sharp as my older tweezerman clippers .</li>
            <li>The pieces are durable and sharp, cut the nail cleanly and it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re cutting on the nail.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and perform very well.  </li>
            <li>Neither the smaller or larger of the clippers I received are sharp,  the fingernail clipper is especially dull, requiring a great amount of force to use and leaving my nails ragged.  </li>
            <li>I use mine a lot and was tired of the dullness that came to my clippers very quickly.</li>
            <li>handle broke off of the small pair within 10 minutes of using it, just trying to twist it back around to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; the clippers and the thing pops right off.</li>
            <li>Also, parents looking for a stocking stuffer for the less than grooming conscious young person in their life may want to buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, good quality, it cuts finger nails into a an odd shape.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use for my daughter, but they are a little stiff, not so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Less expensive sets/clippers available but worth the money.</li>
            <li>A rounded cut requires either a lot of little straight clips or a file to finish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many nail clippers that were dull right out of the box, or went dull after a few uses.</li>

            <li> Recipient is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> great clippers, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> They work better than any others I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> Love the clippers!</li>
            <li> My friends love them!</li>
            <li> My first pair i bought from Target were great!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> A fine durable product, makes a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that there are two of these clipper available because sometimes my brother just goes away carrying with him any stuff without and sounds at all</li>
            <li> Amazing quality.</li>
            <li> What can you say about this kind of product?</li>

            <li> These are really nice.  </li>
            <li> Toe clipper works better with good grip, neither has any way to file nails and/or take the edge off.</li>
            <li> I gave up on nail clippers over $0.99 after shattering a pair of Revlon ones (I guess I don&#x27;t know my own strength?).</li>

            <li> Nice and strong nail clippers!</li>
            <li> Good stuff Easy to use</li>
            <li> Very strong nail clippers that do not bend even when used on thicker toe-nails.</li>
            <li> Tweezer man is the best by far!</li>
            <li> By far the best set of clippers!</li>
            <li> If I had bought these Tweezerman Deluxe nail clippers years ago, I&#x27;d have known better.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers are by far the best ones out there!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great pruduct, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t think they would be all that much better than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very good, high quality nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> do own two pairs of the Tweezerman brand tweezers which I love, love, love.  </li>
            <li> Most clippers tend to snag my toe-claws, but this was a good, clean, cut.</li>
            <li> Now with the Teezerman Deluxe Nail Clippers we get easy cuts that make trimming nails a snap.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be better.</li>
            <li> I love that this purchase came as two-size set.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail clippers on a recommendation and when I tried them out, they weren&#x27;t able to clip my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper.</li>
            <li> These clippers really are great.</li>
            <li> came in on time and they did a great job thanks</li>
            <li> Have not rusted in the shower after many months.</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman need we say more.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> should they start to work better.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best nailvlippers I&#x27;ve found on the market.  </li>
            <li> Simply put these are the best nail clippers ever!</li>
            <li> We use the fingernail clipper more that the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after seeing them rated by several websites as the best nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Toe nail cclippers - not too sure about.  </li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> After going through many sets of clippers that needed to be trashed almost immediately, this set was bought based on the Amazon feedback.  </li>
            <li> Can find a better quality elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Would rather pay more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Many people don&#x27;t think about nail clippers and just pick up the 99 cent ones from the grocery check-out isle.</li>
            <li> I believe more should be included.</li>
            <li> It also has a more stable feel to it.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> so I ordered more.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I have had personal experience with the tweezers, I was impressed by them, they saved my life one time (read the review).</li>
            <li> better made than the lost ones.  </li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I need to clip many time to cut the nails.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products.  </li>
            <li> What more do you need?</li>
            <li> Better quality too.</li>
            <li> just ok.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, will probably last me 20 years!</li>
            <li> Never again will I buy the cheap kind and replace them every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They provide a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good and very fast shipp</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a real good nail clipper you plan to invest in to use for a long time without repurchasing, this is not it.</li>
            <li> These are very precise and sharp - the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Great set of nail clippers; clean cuts and that&#x27;s really all that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> product arrived as expected and is the perfect replacement for my decades-old clippers.  </li>
            <li> They perform as expected but are not as awesome as I was hoping for at this price.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;d be better off with the cheap drugstore clippers these replaced.</li>
            <li> No question my cheap drug store clippers are easier to use and do a better job.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They do a good job, but who wants to spend time clipping nails?</li>
            <li> Came to Amazon to find a good pair and wanted to share that these are absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re good, strong in construction and very well made.</li>
            <li> We have been very happy with this set and are thinking about buying another set so that the other clippers can be trashed.</li>
            <li> awesome!  Sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> perfect sharp nail clippers  one for me, one for my husband.</li>
            <li> never knew such good slippers exist!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and are the best pairs i&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> Easy to grip.</li>
            <li> They feel more as if they&#x27;re tearing my nail off and don&#x27;t do a clean cut.</li>
            <li> They cut easily, too.</li>
            <li> The lever may pop off and the holding pin is easy to lose.</li>
            <li> They clip easily and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> cut easily</li>
            <li> Cuts clean vs the cheap brands that chews your nail off!</li>
            <li> These are strong and reliable.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy &amp; strong.</li>
            <li> these are strong and do the job well.  </li>
            <li> They are quite attractive, but they share a major problem -- they do not cut.</li>
            <li> This is not the first Tweezerman product I own.  </li>
            <li> you care about nice things, and are willing to splurge on nail clippers, don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li> Best Set of Clippers I have had hands down.</li>
            <li> Strong, accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are hands down, the best pair of clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers that are perfectly aligned.  </li>
            <li> Mine came perfect and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Cuts my nails just fine</li>
            <li> they clip toenails just fine.  </li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these clippers because they feel strong (not flexy) when I cut my toenails.</li>
            <li> Very good-- just what I expected</li>
            <li> Solid and good looking, but wish they had been sharpened more finely.  </li>
            <li> Once you use these you will never use a cheap pair again.</li>
            <li> Cuts smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Remaining nails are smooth without a burr.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to my clippers making a click sound and at that point the nail being clipped.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers cut cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction, and the quality of the clip is amazing.</li>
            <li> Get the pour-homme ultra slim clippers for $28, and you will see how amazing a real quality cutter works.</li>
            <li> The two pieces of the clipper don&#x27;t meet precisely, so the clipper just doesn&#x27;t cut well.</li>
            <li> The blades are great, you can cut a lot of things not only nails...</li>
            <li> No traction available on fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought this set at a local department store (Target) and I was expecting great things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not too impressed though - same or more effort involved than with my old non-brand-name clippers, both toe and fingernail versions.  </li>
            <li> no function to smooth nails.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut precisely.  </li>
            <li> fair, better than those above</li>
            <li> But still, solidly made and good looking, better than anything I&#x27;d used before</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The larger toenail clipper is excellent too, with a  straight clipper edge to trim the thicker nails of the feet correctly.</li>
            <li> $.99 pair from the drug store cuts better, is much lighter and more portable, includes a nail file, and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I thought these were going to be some great clippers, but really they are nothing special.</li>
            <li> looks good but any other clipper I have used is better quality than this one, go to Walmart and get a set like this one for 6 dollars and really better quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These came recommended from thewirecutter website, and I have to say that this, along with a few other merchandise recommended on that website, makes me question how exactly they come up with their verdicts on &#x27;best of the best&#x27;.</li>
            <li> However, this toe nail clipper is super strong and it cuts my toe nails with ease.</li>
            <li> Although I have never purchased Tweezerman brand items before, I am familiar with their products and their reputation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cutting quality is great and these have lasted me for a long time with care.</li>
            <li> Uniquely wierd is the amount that the lever bends.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The nail clipper was a bit small and flimzy, but the toe mail clipper is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used very cheap clippers (the kind that come with travel kits) night and day difference.</li>
            <li> works great really sharp and cuts easy</li>
            <li> These are a great pair of tweezers: sharp, strong, and comforatble to hold.</li>
            <li> They are machined well so the blades meet cleanly and... clip toenails.  </li>
            <li> Feels like clean quality in the hand.</li>
            <li> thingie that you can clean under your nails with.  </li>
            <li> Clean cut.</li>
            <li> They clip nails cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Cut cleanly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than other clippers, plus good pricepoint too.</li>
            <li> Curved for fingers, straight for toes, super sharp and a perfect clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, cute well and easily.  </li>
            <li> The only thing they do not have that would make a good addition is a under the nail tool.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really expect much more.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for a this product.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, toe nail clipper is straight like all toe nail clippers should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers, sharp stainless steel,not some crappy metal with chrome plating like many of the others.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> These are pretty good, but for the price and based on the reviews, I expected more.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp, great product and performance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually need new nail clippers, but I saw all the great reviews and figured, for cheap money I might as well upgrade since I will probably be using them for years and years to come.  </li>
            <li> Seriously the best nail clippers ever used.</li>
            <li> The others were adequate.  </li>
            <li> amazing thing about the pour homme clippers is that they actually *cut* your nails instead of crushing them.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of cheap Trim deluxe clippers and they work twice better than the tweezerman clippers for half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over the super cheapies that you can buy in the grocery store checkout lane.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Both broke the very first time we use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These clippers feel so much better than a normal drug store pair</li>
            <li> it was ok , and it came on time , no complaint .</li>
            <li> /&gt;These have a great feel and are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and they feel great mechanically.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Best quality nail clippers I have ever used and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> feels more solid and durable, plus they are easy to identify as yours - a plus in a house where kids keep &#x27;borrowing&#x27; your stuff</li>
            <li> One thing though: they need to be &amp;#34;broken in.&amp;#34; The first twenty of so times you use them, they cut really sharply and the nail clippings fly all over the place.</li>
            <li> So much better than the 15-20 year old clippers I got from my parents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice there is a more precise one for smaller nails and a larger set.</li>
            <li> I was going to make fun of my girlfriend for spending $10 on nail clippers, then I used them.</li>
            <li> They are also very solidly constructed so its more comfortable to use than a flimsy set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think these are well-made, reasonably-priced, and quite effective.</li>
            <li> I recently read a review on the Tweezerman Deluxe Nail Clippers via The Sweethome blog.</li>
            <li> Unlike most every pair I have ever owned/used, these cut through the nail with ease COMPLETELY, there is no need to clip and pull, these cut all the way through every time.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> overall gets the job done though and looks nice too.</li>
            <li> Kind of an essential piece they forgot to design this with.</li>
            <li> I can imagine someone just wanting one clipper to do everything, I wanted distinct two clippers.</li>
            <li> Great nail clipper set, very hefty, sturdy and sharp.  </li>
            <li> but luckily I found all the pieces and was able to put it back together quickly.</li>
            <li> Other than that its good I guess</li>
            <li> Stick with them though, and that stops and they become more like normal, drugstore type clippers, only better in every way.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> Fingernail clipper arrived with defect right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the blades not matching up or something not being right with the blades.</li>
            <li> The best clipper I ever owned was, of all things, a Sharper Image clipper which had a rubber inlay in the handle, making them VERY comfortable to hold, and also making them virtually impossible to slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li> The fingernail clippers are fine but the toenail clippers do not have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; or power to cut through toenails easily.</li>
            <li> These are nice but not sure they cut any better than the $4 ones I can buy and the checkout line.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves both clippers, thanks maybe he will leave my alone now, more in the future for sure, thanks</li>
            <li> They are lighter than the average model, yet feel more secure and deliver a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly and healthy my nails grow back.</li>
            <li> Not only is the black/gunmetal look a lot more professional looking, but the quality within this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I figured it was time to upgrade and spend a little more money in order to get a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to trimming your nails quickly and aren&#x27;t interested in giving it any more thought than that, I&#x27;d go find some regular old-school clippers elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Had it been a little larger it would have been wonderful.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and cut nicely.</li>
            <li> very sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li> very sharp good product</li>
            <li> Good set of nail clippers, very sharp and cut thru the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li> These look good in the drawer with all of my other grooming supplies, but otherwise don&#x27;t perform any better than a cheaper generic pair.  </li>
            <li> Good solid klipper , i could have used this years ago , and finnaly just went on amazon and ordered it (after my son kept taking my old one)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken several years, but I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing the cheap nail clippers that are available at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Quality not as good as typical Tweezerman</li>
            <li> They are precise and solid unlike the cheap ones you find sold for 99 cents at the checkout line.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how well the clippers have kept sharp and the way in which I can clip my toes/fingers.</li>
            <li> They cut my nails very ruggedly and after the very first use, the metal lever got caught in the hole that acts as the fulcrum</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, although quality is not quite as good other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> Each of the clippers are very sharp and precise and they are super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a huge quality difference from anything I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li> I promise never to go back to the cheap nail clippers again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do seem like a better overall quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the pour-homme ultra-slim clippers for over a year now, and while they&#x27;re a lot more expensive (3 times more), they&#x27;re more than 3 times</li>
            <li> The first nail I cut with this clipper went flying, and is sitting somewhere buried in my carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first set my wife took so</li>
            <li> The larger pair worked ok.</li>
            <li> When I first took them out of the package, the metal and design looked like they were made by Apple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how these are any better than what I could&#x27;ve bought at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> Look to a different brand with better quality control.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time buying a Tweezerman product.</li>
            <li> I think my Roomate fell in love with my last pair!!</li>
            <li> These work only slightly better than generic nail clippers from the pharmacy or supermarket, but seem to be better made.</li>
            <li> I opened nail tweezers for first time and tried to turn clipper handle to use.</li>
            <li> After losing my last pair, I decided to see if Tweezerman made a better product.</li>
            <li> The bigger ones work much better.</li>
            <li> Definitely higher quality than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> Very well made!</li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy compared to the crappy ones in the grocery store checkout line, which I take to be a good sign.  </li>
            <li> The cutting surface is at a slant, and is really sharp, so they give the nail a nice clean, perfect tapered cut.</li>
            <li> I did my right hand first and had to really struggle to cut one nail.</li>
            <li> So you think, these are just basic/cheap nail clippers, I don&#x27;t really care about the quality - right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all relative when it comes to preferences on personal hygiene equipment, but for me, I prefer to have a nice clean &#x27;click&#x27; when i cut my nails.</li>
            <li> Under light pressure most clippers cut almost immediately, with little or no bending in the lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and have a nice feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They look really sharp and nice quality also, sturdy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp for the price.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp?  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s even better is that if they become dull, Tweezerman will sharpen them for free!</li>
            <li> Good cutting and easy to grip, but no file to smooth the edge of the fingernail.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and cut the nails cleanly (no ragged edges) and easily.</li>
            <li> I also love the flt black finish on the handle because it looks cool</li>
            <li> Any number of reviewers have made positive comments about these clippers.</li>
            <li> I can only give 2 stars for fast delivery, and the bigger one being good.</li>
            <li> bought this tweezerman set thinking that they would be as good, judging by the review on thesweethome, but they cut nails no better than the $2 ones you can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> : It seems it is not as easy to position the blade of this new nail clipper onto my finger nail as my old one.</li>
            <li> Very strong and sharp.</li>
            <li> The bigger one isn&#x27;t easy to use and requires a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li> but I wish the large ones had curved blades.</li>
            <li> The Toenail Clipper is quite large.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, the handle doesn&#x27;t rotate around like crappy dollar store clippers, and the metal is of decent quality.</li>
            <li> they are well made pretty heavy gauge material used to manufacture these and they are simply just  great.</li>
            <li> Sharp,  high quality, nice finish.</li>
            <li> The people who say they don&#x27;t make a clean cut are right; I even tried when my nails were wet, right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Only downside is they do not have a little&lt;br /&gt;file or nail scraper with them, which is fine</li>
            <li> Slightly rough out of the box, but after you use them a little they become very good.</li>
            <li> pair is super sharp and precise, no need to go over with a nail file.</li>
            <li> They cut toe nails straight and smooth even the thicker big toe.</li>
            <li> like the straight cut toe nail cutter and for my finger nails</li>
            <li> I expected them to be more ... something.</li>
            <li> so I expected these to be better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be the last set of clippers you buy - I&#x27;ll never use cheap dollar store clippers again.</li>
            <li> toenail clippers are straight across.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly you are supposed to trim your toenails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t curved much</li>
            <li> The straight cut isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would cut straight across.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Much nicer than store bought junk.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap &amp;#34;check-out lane&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Cuts very well.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy clippers.</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Very robust.</li>
            <li> The finger nail clippers work on my nails well, but an included nail file would be appreciated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These feel very sturdy and well constructed, and cut nails</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expected a lot more from this company.</li>
            <li> the toenail clipper is straight, not curved.</li>
            <li> just like all tweezerman products I&#x27;ve tried, they work very well.</li>
            <li> Whole family use these for finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> not made very well.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sturdy and cut well.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then Seki brand, but</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> At lease the smaller one is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> The toenail clippers are better, but if you have not used a straight clipper before, consider carefully before you buy these.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in a slightly heavier-duty, more precise-cutting nail clipper set, then these are just what you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> These tend to cut better, stay sharp longer, and are thus far well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the large clipper is not properly sharpened and does not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> I really like the straight edge, which ensures a clean, proper cut of each toenail.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, they stay sharp and make a good cut after several months of use.</li>
            <li> however they have no nail filer like most other brands I have had over the years.</li>
            <li> Just slightly better than $2.99 clippers, not sure these are worth it.</li>
            <li> The cut is very sharp and leaves the nails feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> Well made, sharp, accurate, easy to use with larger hands</li>
            <li> Yes, at $9, they might be about $8 more than you ever expected to pay for nail clippers, but I can definitely say that for me, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I love how sharp these are!</li>
            <li> Go to the drug store and you&#x27;ll find better clippers for half the price.</li>
            <li> luckily, i know how to put them back together!</li>
            <li> You will find yourself cutting your nails more often because these are so nice to use.</li>
            <li> , I ended up going back and buying a set for several more family members.  </li>
            <li> , I just thought it was funny as one would never typically buy nail clippers to impress but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied enough to have ordered a second pair for the office.</li>
            <li> even the lever action to cut nails feels very fluid and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think my expectations may have just been too high.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Everything I needed - I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for clippers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The high reviews sold me</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hopefully someone makes a high quality blade coupled with a rubber surface handle.</li>
            <li> These are some high quality clippers.</li>
            <li> After hearing these Tweezerman clippers come highly recommended, I bit the bullet and bought a pair.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality</li>
            <li> These did not allow me to cut the sharp corners, being so huge and straight angled.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, and work very well.</li>
            <li> Good quality but not as sharp as expected or needed.</li>
            <li> very sharp, very clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Was I surprised!!  </li>
            <li> I cut them pretty regularly, but had never noticed how healthy the sharp cut makes my nails.</li>
            <li> I think I was just expecting a little more.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they came with a case, but at this price, it&#x27;s hard to complain.</li>
            <li> Sharp and strong.</li>
            <li> Since my past experience had been great, I expected that to be the case here.</li>
            <li> They seem better built and MUCH sharper than the usual off-brand clippers.</li>
            <li> They are more expensive than cheap run-of-the-mill clippers, but work way better, especially with my humongous toenails on my big toes!</li>
            <li> These are worth the investment, so buy the fingernail clipper and toenail clipper at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were broken for good.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, clean, durable - better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> How different could they be, right?  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, and precise.</li>
            <li> Nice, but doesn&#x27;t have the little nail cleaner in the middle</li>
            <li> These things are strong, durable, and best of all they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; when I clamp down hard on my stubborn thick toe nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just what I want from a new set of nail clippers</li>
            <li> I have owned a set of these for 6 years and had to just order a new set because my girlfriend has stated she lost them.</li>
            <li> but I am gonna go ahead and purchase the Seki Edge Toenail Clippers now and hope they live up to their &#x27;hype&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Fingernail clipper broke into pieces on first use, feels cheap, certainly not made with the same quality control as their tweezers.</li>
            <li> Both are made of strong materials and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Tired of the cheap nickel plated cheap ones from the pharmacy?</li>
            <li> These are seriously well made and cut nicely.  </li>
            <li> But be careful when you flip the lever around: it comes off the unit, and is challenging to put back on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> The large one broke after just a few uses but we were able to put it back together.</li>
            <li> I though the file was pretty much a standard part of any pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman offers free sharpening but they also require insured postage both ways, which is more expensive than the item&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li> The old cutters we had used to gnaw at our nails and for some reason (I blame my wife!)</li>
            <li> The smaller one fell apart the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and they look clean for nail clippers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and provide clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cut precisely where I need it.</li>
            <li> All previous ones were cheap walmart purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they also have sharper corners making them less comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Revlon brand for several years, that brand doesn&#x27;t last more than a few years, and they really don&#x27;t clip very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are used to buying the normal everyday cheap Walgreens or Fred Meyers nail clippers</li>
            <li> The long one has good leverage for those thick toenails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a regular nail clipper, not sharp enough to be outstanding, but enough to clip your nails without difficulties to apply pressure.</li>
            <li> So when I was recently looking for some new nail clippers, I found this set and was actually surprised that the price tag was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this set over pretty much any other nail clippers I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used the super \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; drugstore clippers my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re tired of buying cheap crap and want a set of nail clippers that will last a long while and be truly awesome to work with--seriously, these are what you want.</li>
            <li> They are both attractive looking and sharp but the nail clipper is really too small for my hands, and I suspect most men&#x27;s hands and thus difficult to grip.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and well-made.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and well made</li>
            <li> Nothing special - just average.</li>
            <li> The company offered to replace them but to ship the original back would cost the same as buying a new one from a different company.</li>
            <li> I would buy something sharper next time since I really struggle to get them to cut.</li>
            <li> That was unexpected.</li>
            <li> feel like quality in the hand, and so far they cut even through my gnarly toe nails with ease.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised and amazed by this</li>
            <li> Much sharper than generic clippers from pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> and he said he couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between these and his old worn out clippers.  </li>
            <li> This is the second set I bought, since everyone in the family wants to borrow mine.</li>
            <li> So i ordered these from here because i was gonna be busy all weekend.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels like good quality but not great.</li>
            <li> good quality but too expensive</li>
            <li> does the same quality job, though you won&#x27;t find &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; on it! :) Very sharp!</li>
            <li> They feel very solid when in use and don&#x27;t appear to be cheaply made like other brands.</li>
            <li> , and it&#x27;s cool that they&#x27;re black instead of the ubiquitous silver nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on thesweethome, they are tuff, cuts clean, comfortable to use, one for foot one for hand, cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> although minor is that I had to use a little more force them</li>
            <li> Really sharp and useful.</li>
            <li> The item was missing in the original mail package</li>
            <li> my old one broken for long time, I see this one just in a case, and love it very much</li>
            <li> The clippers almost seem to be medical device -- they are that high in quality.</li>
            <li> The flex on the lever doesn&#x27;t help with the apparent effort, and they don&#x27;t seem to be noticeably sharper than my old ones.</li>
            <li> These are sharper than any other cheap clipper I used before, but the straight blade on the larger one and especially the missing nail file are big enough problems that I&#x27;d prefer my old cheap clipper back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are tough and masculine nail clippers, the metal seems thicker than most others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> So much sharper then the crappy clipper&#x27;s from the big corporate stores.</li>
            <li> I expected the clippers to be of very high quality; they were a bit better than average, but not like my other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> It was a MAJOR pain to open the p trap and retrieve the column piece and then have to package the whole thing up and return it because it would not go back together again.  </li>
            <li> Quality on these seemed pretty good and they were sharp but the little clipper seemed baby size and too small (and I don&#x27;t have big hands).</li>
            <li> The clippers are well made and are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> They use very little force to cleanly cut the nail.</li>
            <li> Sharp looking nail clippers that do a good, not great job.  </li>
            <li> They may seem a little pricey, but they are worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and maintain my positive impression of Tweezerman products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not good enough</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with as the first time I tried it and turned the top part around to get it into the clipping position - it stuck.</li>
            <li> exactly as expected and works very well.</li>
            <li> Quality is readily apparent and they perform admirably.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived duller than my ten year old clipper.</li>
            <li> not very sharp.</li>
            <li> The large clipper is sharp and works well.  </li>
            <li> Quality steel, positive and predictable action.</li>
            <li> Con: I was surprised to see the smaller finger nail clippers don&#x27;t cut through my 7 year old&#x27;s (pretty thin) nails very well.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and sharp.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and cut very well.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and made out of stainless steel not chromed steel.</li>
            <li> Since they are very easy to fall apart if pressure is applied to the wrong places.</li>
            <li> The small tweesers broke on the first use!</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough or usability</li>
            <li> I feel the clippers are not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I have probably purchased 3 or 4 sets for him from different companies and within a few days will tell me they just don&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper broke apart the first time I tried to use it and the little column piece flew out and went straight down my bathroom sink drain.  </li>
            <li> I use them on our 4 month old and our 2 year old because they are so sharp.</li>
            <li> After some remarkably complex sharpening they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> one is because it clipped cleanly the one nail I was able to clip before the stupid thing broke.  </li>
            <li> Not as sharp as my older tweezerman clippers .</li>
            <li> The pieces are durable and sharp, cut the nail cleanly and it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re cutting on the nail.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and perform very well.  </li>
            <li> Neither the smaller or larger of the clippers I received are sharp,  the fingernail clipper is especially dull, requiring a great amount of force to use and leaving my nails ragged.  </li>
            <li> I use mine a lot and was tired of the dullness that came to my clippers very quickly.</li>
            <li> handle broke off of the small pair within 10 minutes of using it, just trying to twist it back around to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; the clippers and the thing pops right off.</li>
            <li> Also, parents looking for a stocking stuffer for the less than grooming conscious young person in their life may want to buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, good quality, it cuts finger nails into a an odd shape.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my daughter, but they are a little stiff, not so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Less expensive sets/clippers available but worth the money.</li>
            <li> A rounded cut requires either a lot of little straight clips or a file to finish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many nail clippers that were dull right out of the box, or went dull after a few uses.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve always purchased cheap drugstore nail clippers found in a bin, usually costing less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> your an average person looking for new nail clippers that work well - these are for you</li>
            <li> They are a little more expensive than the average clipper but worth it when you clip your nails.</li>
            <li> Works real well my nails, and believe me, thats no easy feat.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, not great and not as sharp as advertised.  </li>
            <li> never even tried the big set because they are flat, which isn&#x27;t going to work on my fingers or toes.</li>
            <li> The set I bought said (on the back) that I could send them back for sharpening for as long as there was still enough blade to sharpen, with ZERO $$ shipping.</li>
            <li> The small clipper has a curved cutter and the larger one has a straight cutter.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that normally, clippers have a small file with a pointed end, which I find particularly useful, and this one lacks it.</li>
            <li> so far only use it once seems very sharp.</li>
            <li> They look nice but required a lot of force to cut finger nails or toe nails and do not work as well as less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I appears that they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I suspect these will last a long time.</li>
            <li> And my current set I&#x27;ve had for so long</li>
            <li> Tweezerman used to be a good product. :(</li>
            <li> I bought our first set of these to help deal with the thick nails of an elderly parent.  </li>
            <li> I will probably be buying these again in the future once I loose these, which is very likely.</li>
            <li> These felt dull and don&#x27;t cut my big nails very well.</li>
            <li> Total stainless clippers hard to find.</li>
            <li> Unless I lose them, I&#x27;d expect these to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I really thought that I would feel the same about this Tweezerman clipper set, which is the main reason I went with this brand, but unfortunately that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They never last long and often fall apart before too long.</li>
            <li> My old ones broke and was forced to use my old toenail clippers..</li>
            <li> I notice the difference even between the regular tweezerman and of course the regular tweezerman is head and shoulders above the average clipper.  </li>
            <li> With little pressure, the blades are sharp where too much pressure isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> Large size is a bit bulky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I know, I&#x27;ve owned the silver German toenail clippers that resemble lobster claw-crackers, and numerous other old-school clippers.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I need to apply a large amount of force to cut my nails, and my nails aren&#x27;t thick at all.</li>
            <li> This item came highly recommended, and the small clipper was sturdy and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better at cutting?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for many months and they&#x27;re still cutting well.</li>
            <li> The lever is held in place by the opening pressure of the top and bottom cutting sides.</li>
            <li> Only thing keeping from 5 stars is lack of file on small set like my old set.</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman clippers are a little intense compared to the typical clippers everybody&#x27;s been using since forever.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought some better known brand name ones and they were flexing all the time making them almost useless.</li>
            <li> sharp long lasting</li>
            <li> It felt kinda weird cutting my nails without being able to &#x27;clean&#x27; them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that sharp; you need to apply a LOT of pressure to clip with the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> My nails must have gotten thicker or maybe these units just aren&#x27;t sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> It is taking me a bit to get used to them due to this, and I have cut a couple of my nails a bit short, but that is user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my brother in law, as I put together a shaving kit along with, among other things, tweezers of the same brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!</li>
            <li> I tried to dry cut my sons nails with the clipper</li>
            <li> However, both are incapable of clipping cleanly, and that means the manufacturing process is flawed.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even cut through a single sheet of newsprint.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy this brand again, it&#x27;s not worth the extra money</li>
            <li> overall not worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the arm back down because it is stuck in the hole in the front.</li>
            <li> I tried cheap alternatives in the past and some of the broke, I got tough toe nails.</li>
            <li> Be warned, these are very sharp, they can creep up on you and cut earlier than you expect so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> They tore at my nails wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;ll probably find some typical ones and going back to clipping my nails in 20 seconds after a shower.</li>
            <li> No different than the $1 ones I used previously.</li>
            <li> They lack a nail file, so in one aspect they&#x27;re perhaps less functional than the generic ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it has so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Our old clipper set wasn&#x27;t cutting very well</li>
            <li> they cut nails, which i expected.</li>
            <li> It is as I expected they would be.</li>
            <li> But I expected it to come with one of those fold-out nail files.</li>
            <li> Took the buy on these from the Sweethome and have had zero regrets.</li>
            <li> Be careful when spinning the lever around.</li>
            <li> The small can barely cut through my pinky.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re solid and heavy</li>
            <li> and it keeps my finger from slipping while I use them.</li>
            <li> not easy to hold - the small one is too small and uncomfortable to hold and does not cut as good as ones I have used.</li>
            <li> but the mouth is small and difficult to fit nail.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> The big one is big, the little one has a tight radius on the curved cutting edge, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Sharp?</li>
            <li> Sharp and the two sizes meet all needs.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp, clips nails without breaking or chipping them.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, sharp, clips nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After each use I put a daub of hand sanitizer on them and have had no issues with rust or other</li>
            <li> is sharp and gets the job done effortlessly--even with my non-dominant hand.  </li>
            <li> It is well finished and sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp</li>
            <li> And to add insult to injury, due to the design of the clipper handle, the handle hurt my fingers to squeeze due to the shape of the handle</li>
            <li> that you know NASA or some other agency had to have their part in the design process.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, they line up, they cut well.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not interested in taking a risk, check out the Mehaz 660 and 662.  </li>
            <li> see other reviewers complaining about the price point vs performance.  </li>
            <li> Seem to be well made and sharp but there is no fingernail cleaner and</li>
            <li> I bought another set, thinking maybe something was wrong with the first set</li>
            <li> These have been sharp from the start and stayed sharp in 4 months of use by my wife and son.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and hold their edge.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp, sharp, sharp.</li>
            <li> The toe clippers are too large - they seem to be made for cutting something other than a human toenail.</li>
            <li> They would leave rough bits of the nail that would need to get filed down anyway, so I just stuck with nothing but a file.</li>
            <li> The larger nail clippers have a straight cutting edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid product would definitely recommend to anyone that is tired of buying dollar store clippers every month.</li>
            <li> The large clipper is useless.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have thick fingernails, but those little clippers could barely cut through anything.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp and they are difficult to push down and actually cut the nails.  </li>
            <li> There is a noticeable chip out of the blade making it impossible to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Only negative thing</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t in included file.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it to try to return.  </li>
            <li> The toenail clippers were straight and were useless as a replacement for fingernails.</li>
            <li> If you accidentally hold the body too tightly with one hand and the lever with the other hand.</li>
            <li> They feel dangerous because they could easily slip out of your hand while you&#x27;re trying to push down so hard to clip a nail.  </li>
            <li> Also wish the toe clipper opened a bit wider, as some of my nails down there are a bit hardy.  </li>
            <li> Sharp!</li>
            <li> very sharp and even cuts.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and heavy weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year and they are still very sharp.</li>
            <li> They are definitely not cheaply built and flimsy like a lot of the other ones on Amazon seem to be.</li>
            <li> Very sharp</li>
            <li> Both appear to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and so well made.  </li>
            <li> very sharp and durable..</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and cut finger and toe nails with no issues.</li>
            <li> firm to the grip ..stylish .. sharp cut...</li>
            <li> but I still had to use the larger toenail clipper on all my nails (hands and feet) because it was just too difficult to cut through my nails using the smaller fingernail ones.  </li>
            <li> I have hidden them from the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it much since the two cutting parts do not match when closed.</li>
            <li> a compliment is a compliment none the less....</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have stated, quality control may be sub-par on these.  </li>
            <li> The black bit is metal as well.</li>
            <li> the clippers fail to cut through my nails, forcing me to back off and try again with a smaller chunk.</li>
            <li> During that time the nail is gripped, and uncertain movements may twist it during the &amp;#34;waiting period&amp;#34; (because it&#x27;s difficult to exert the required pressure with a steady hand) and this might contribute to the uneveness of the cut.</li>
            <li> unless the company has changed the build none of the bad reviews seem to be true for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they paid, but for a little less than $4.50 a clipper</li>
            <li> heavy duty and very sharp</li>
            <li> lacks a file, the little teeth that hold handle in-line, the little ridges that provide ant grip at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; clipper is a little too dainty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Were hard for me to hold and clipping strength not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought these for clipping my nails as crazy as that sounds, and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> They seem heavy duty and don&#x27;t feel like they will break in my hand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on these, get nicer ones.</li>
            <li> Missing a built-in nail file.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had them for a few months now and they seem to be holding up quite well.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s the difference from air to water, love to hate, and worth it to worthless to get the point across.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Typical Tweezerman quality!  </li>
            <li> I bought them to replace my previous clippers that I&#x27;ve been using for years, and they were just as dull.</li>
            <li> Dull blade, made poor cuts that left snags.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to slowing down and paying attention to cutting my fingernails, otherwise these will cut way too short as compared to typical clippers.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than a dull nail clipper, especially for my toes!</li>
            <li> The middle of the nail is curved inwards and the edges are sharp and pointy after cutting.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fingernail clipper was not sharp at all - I had to squeeze the handle down very hard to get them to cut.</li>
            <li> Down with Tweezerman!!</li>
            <li> The small clippers broke promptly.</li>
            <li> The blades of the small nail clipper are not aligned, and it just does not work.</li>
            <li> Not really better than the ones I got from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t deliver anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> The small clippers fell apart while opening.</li>
            <li> Probably the sharpest out of all the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Cool, not sure why, but cool!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be beneficial to include a metal file and a small knife to get dirt.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman the level bends and bends, and you need to use excessive pressure before the cut occurs.</li>
            <li> but these are the most horrible clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f44141da3e3dc5faf111221168538323]]The small nail clipper does not work.</li>
            <li> I thought it had a small nail file inside the clipper.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp!!</li>
            <li> These are very heavy</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp but they get stuck in your nails and is very difficult to have a proper cut..</li>
            <li> : The lever on these tweezers ALWAYS falls off when you flip it into cutting position, and it&#x27;s not easy to get it back on.</li>
            <li> The larger one is a bit awkward for me to use, but I have unusually small feet and nails.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this is expensive than the other tweezerman nail cutters.</li>
            <li> They just bent the nail no matter how hard I tried.</li>
            <li> Hard to cut off hangnails with the nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Either way you have to push really hard in order to cut your nails.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but these clippers were horribly dull.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea where they even came from, so probably they&#x27;re dull</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to squeeze really hard to get the job done.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut well and feel dull.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because this set seemed to rate quite high.</li>
            <li> They are not as wide as they look a little awkward</li>
            <li> I was unsure what to expect when I read some of the negative reviews before buying, but this clipper set has worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> I just wish at least one of the clippers had a nail cleaner with file.</li>
            <li> At least Amazon took care of me in this situation and refunded my order without any issues.</li>
            <li> I bought then for the convex cutting surface, which is somewhat difficult to find.</li>
            <li> The metal they are made of is so thick that it does not let me get as close of a trim as I need sometimes.</li>
            <li> (it is somewhat sharp - not like a blade, but an unfortunate design flaw).</li>
            <li> The small finger nail clipper is complete crap.</li>
            <li> and they usually start off well and then get worse.</li>
            <li> Weak, you have to squeeze really hard to get it to cut.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the both of the nail clippers were not very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with their actual performance though.</li>
            <li> Well made with very sharp cutting edges.</li>
            <li> would recommend these to anyone that is tired of the weak, cheap-o clippers from wally world.</li>
            <li> They are heavy, feel durable and haven&#x27;t bowed at all when cutting my boyfriend&#x27;s gnarly toenails.</li>
            <li> Im annoyed that these don&#x27;t come with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The small nail clippers have a curved cutting edge to match the curve of your nail.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to see what you&#x27;re cutting, which sometimes forces you to cut off skin when you were aiming for nail and vice versa.</li>
            <li> To anyone looking for an inexpensive pair of clippers that have proven to last, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> our last set (no name brand) was horrible.</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Tweezerman brand.</li>
            <li> So unfortunate.</li>
            <li> mediocre clippers.</li>
            <li> I got some weird ingrown toenail issue as a result that i can&#x27;t seem to find the source of the pain which hasn&#x27;t grown out in even over a month&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> #fail</li>
            <li> very heavy duty!!!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality control.  </li>
            <li> They are not polished, just milled, so slip along a nail very poorly.</li>
            <li> but I always used that pointy end part of the file for scraping out the dirt/gunk under my nails while cutting.  </li>
            <li> The cutting edges line up</li>
            <li> The cutting side (is there a name for that?)</li>
            <li> No problems cutting through nails.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges don&#x27;t meet on one corner.</li>
            <li> I hope I just got a bad pair, but even if I did, the fact that the clipper is uncomfortable to hold and clip with is very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think ill have to replace them for a while!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to cut your nails unless your just out of the shower as they recommend.  </li>
            <li> The quality is laughably bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a nail file for a while now, because of the bad experiences I had with &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate trimming nails.</li>
            <li> these are crap clippers.</li>
            <li> It chips my nails badly for something close to 20$!</li>
            <li> Like they sold me a the bad batch or something!</li>
            <li> The nemesis of ugly, overgrown nails everywhere!</li>
            <li> but we are very disappointed at Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Clipping your nails with anything else feels awful after you&#x27;ve gotten used to these.</li>
            <li> Matter of fact, I found these to be the worst clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best nail clippers I have ever bought. Super sharp and well-made. Easy to grip. Stop buying the junk they sell at drug stores and get this set.</li>
            <li> I was unsure what to expect when I read some of the negative reviews before buying, but this clipper set has worked well for me.  I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> fair, better than those above</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not good enough</li>
            <li> Incredible to use good nail clippers for once</li>
            <li> Nice, but doesn&#x27;t have the little nail cleaner in the middle</li>
            <li> these are built to last and do the job.  bought these for my husband because kids are always stealing his.  Now with TWEEZERMAN written on it, they know not to touch them!</li>
            <li> Curved for fingers, straight for toes, super sharp and a perfect clean cut every time. They also make a beautiful sound - love them</li>
            <li> exactly as expected and works very well. These are the same price as I&#x27;ve seen for just the finger nail clippers in the shops</li>
            <li> So much better than the 15-20 year old clippers I got from my parents. They cut very nice and clean. It&#x27;s nice there is a more precise one for smaller nails and a larger set. I just wish at least one of the clippers had a nail cleaner with file.</li>
            <li> I was going to make fun of my girlfriend for spending $10 on nail clippers, then I used them. Holy smokes, these are excellent nail clippers. I never realized that nail clippers could be so great. Nice and sharp, the handle doesn&#x27;t rotate around like crappy dollar store clippers, and the metal is of decent quality.</li>
            <li> These are without a doubt the highest quality clippers I have ever seen. Once you use these you will never use a cheap pair again. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this is expensive than the other tweezerman nail cutters. Mine used to over lap on bite and so I returned it. I then bought another tweezerman from the local walgreens and it seems to be better. They are all made in china so expect quality issues.&lt;br /&gt;I like the straight cut toe nail cutter and for my finger nails I use Klhip which I think is good but the mouth is small and difficult to fit nail.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> these are great! very sharp and even cuts. our last set (no name brand) was horrible. these work on even the toughest of toe nails! my only beef is they come apart when not handled with kid gloves. luckily, i know how to put them back together!</li>
            <li> These are very heavy and it&#x27;s hard to see what you&#x27;re cutting, which sometimes forces you to cut off skin when you were aiming for nail and vice versa.</li>
            <li> These are great! Awesome value for what I ordered. The blades are sharp and they look clean for nail clippers. They seem heavy duty and don&#x27;t feel like they will break in my hand. The blades are also perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li> Works really good. Cuts smooth.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s all the five stars&#x27; about. It&#x27;s a regular nail clipper, not sharp enough to be outstanding, but enough to clip your nails without difficulties to apply pressure. I love that this purchase came as two-size set. But if you&#x27;re looking for a real good nail clipper you plan to invest in to use for a long time without repurchasing, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Cuts my nails just fine but then again so does the cheapy ones from the supermarket</li>
            <li> Definitely better than other clippers, plus good pricepoint too.</li>
            <li> Im too scared to use the toe clippers. Too big for my toes. Other than that its good I guess</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good and very fast shipp</li>
            <li> These felt dull and don&#x27;t cut my big nails very well. I would buy something sharper next time since I really struggle to get them to cut.</li>
            <li> Sharp,  high quality, nice finish.</li>
            <li> By far the best set of clippers! They work better than any others I&#x27;ve had! Don&#x27;t think ill have to replace them for a while!</li>
            <li> Solid set of clippers</li>
            <li> The small clippers broke promptly.</li>
            <li> Good solid klipper , i could have used this years ago , and finnaly just went on amazon and ordered it (after my son kept taking my old one)</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, cute well and easily.  I would totally recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> It chips my nails badly for something close to 20$! Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and heavy weight. They cut toe nails straight and smooth even the thicker big toe. Overall great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Very strong nail clippers that do not bend even when used on thicker toe-nails. I had previously bought some better known brand name ones and they were flexing all the time making them almost useless. I&#x27;d recommend this set over pretty much any other nail clippers I had.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, great product and performance.</li>
            <li> These would get 5 stars but they don&#x27;t have a file or nail pick.</li>
            <li> Good... But not as good as their amazing tweezers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve used. I feel as though I need to apply a large amount of force to cut my nails, and my nails aren&#x27;t thick at all. They feel more as if they&#x27;re tearing my nail off and don&#x27;t do a clean cut.</li>
            <li> These are nice but not sure they cut any better than the $4 ones I can buy and the checkout line.  No nail file either? I though the file was pretty much a standard part of any pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Just what I want from a new set of nail clippers</li>
            <li> Very high quality and sharp. I&#x27;ve used many nail clippers that were dull right out of the box, or went dull after a few uses. I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year and they are still very sharp.</li>
            <li> Best pair I own. Cut well without smashing.  Remaining nails are smooth without a burr.</li>
            <li> These are strong and reliable. I love them.</li>
            <li> I trim my nails with these.</li>
            <li> Quality is readily apparent and they perform admirably. Only thing keeping from 5 stars is lack of file on small set like my old set.</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Tweezerman brand. Pros: well constructed, durable, good quality, lifetime sharpening. Con: I was surprised to see the smaller finger nail clippers don&#x27;t cut through my 7 year old&#x27;s (pretty thin) nails very well.</li>
            <li> They provide a nice clean cut.  They are also very solidly constructed so its more comfortable to use than a flimsy set of clippers.  Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever owned. They are lighter than the average model, yet feel more secure and deliver a clean cut.</li>
            <li> great clippers. just as is every tweezerman product ive purchased! I purchased this set and the male set too. excellent</li>
            <li> The toenail clippers couldn&#x27;t cut through my toenails</li>
            <li> My husband loves both clippers, thanks maybe he will leave my alone now, more in the future for sure, thanks</li>
            <li> I bought these nail clippers on a recommendation and when I tried them out, they weren&#x27;t able to clip my nails. They just bent the nail no matter how hard I tried. I&#x27;m used to my clippers making a click sound and at that point the nail being clipped. These never clicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never even tried the big set because they are flat, which isn&#x27;t going to work on my fingers or toes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken several years, but I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing the cheap nail clippers that are available at the drug store. They never last long and often fall apart before too long. It&#x27;s one of those &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; items. Although I have never purchased Tweezerman brand items before, I am familiar with their products and their reputation. So when I was recently looking for some new nail clippers, I found this set and was actually surprised that the price tag was reasonable. They are sturdy &amp; strong. They cut easily, too. Just holding them in your hands, you can tell that they are a quality product. My husband was very pleased with them, too. I promise never to go back to the cheap nail clippers again!</li>
            <li> Excellent high-quality, cuts nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Really great set! The pieces are durable and sharp, cut the nail cleanly and it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re cutting on the nail.</li>
            <li> This is not the first Tweezerman product I own.  The others were adequate.  The fingernail clipper in this set was unsharpened.  It wouldn&#x27;t even cut through a single sheet of newsprint.  Very poor quality control.  Tweezerman offers free sharpening but they also require insured postage both ways, which is more expensive than the item&#x27;s price.  I recommend Seki.</li>
            <li> I can only give 2 stars for fast delivery, and the bigger one being good. The blades of the small nail clipper are not aligned, and it just does not work.</li>
            <li> Will never buy another tweezer.  I bought one and loved it, bought another 4 for my sister, daughter, friend and aunt.  Don&#x27;t hesitate get one.</li>
            <li> On a recommendation from a friend I gave these a shot. They seem better built and MUCH sharper than the usual off-brand clippers. I&#x27;m quite happy with them and would recommend them to most anyone.</li>
            <li> Best Set of Clippers I have had hands down. I have owned a set of these for 6 years and had to just order a new set because my girlfriend has stated she lost them. They are sharper and give a cleaner cut then any clippers I&#x27;ve used even going to the professionals and getting a manicure or pedicure. Its a good gift for those who like to have good looking nails.. The only thing they do not have that would make a good addition is a under the nail tool. All in all I am a happy customer and love my Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> Really sharp and useful. I love this clipper.</li>
            <li> The legendary Tweezerman quality continues to impress. Tired of the cheap nickel plated cheap ones from the pharmacy? These tend to cut better, stay sharp longer, and are thus far well worth the money.</li>
            <li> works great really sharp and cuts easy</li>
            <li> These are nail clippers. Not really better than the ones I got from Walgreens. I expected them to be more ... something. Sharp? Better at cutting? I&#x27;m not sure but they didn&#x27;t deliver anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> The large one broke after just a few uses but we were able to put it back together.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers cut cleanly and easily. It would be nice if they came with a case, but at this price, it&#x27;s hard to complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used the super \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; drugstore clippers my entire adult life.  I figured it was time to upgrade and spend a little more money in order to get a better quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do own two pairs of the Tweezerman brand tweezers which I love, love, love.  I really thought that I would feel the same about this Tweezerman clipper set, which is the main reason I went with this brand, but unfortunately that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do seem like a better overall quality but I still had to use the larger toenail clipper on all my nails (hands and feet) because it was just too difficult to cut through my nails using the smaller fingernail ones.  This is the same problem I encountered with the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; clippers I have owned so I expected these to be better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; clippers I have ever owned always had a built-in nail file on them.  Not that I used it to actually file my nails but I always used that pointy end part of the file for scraping out the dirt/gunk under my nails while cutting.  I mistakenly \\&quot;assumed\\&quot; these clippers would come with that feature but they did not, quite to my surprise.  It felt kinda weird cutting my nails without being able to &#x27;clean&#x27; them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think my expectations may have just been too high.  They aren&#x27;t \\&quot;horrible\\&quot; clippers, but for the reasons I gave above, they just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; for me (get it?  haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep these clippers but I am gonna go ahead and purchase the Seki Edge Toenail Clippers now and hope they live up to their &#x27;hype&#x27;.  [[ASIN:B000SSDTOS Seki Edge Toenail Clipper]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Revlon brand for several years, that brand doesn&#x27;t last more than a few years, and they really don&#x27;t clip very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the review on these on [...] site, and placed an order. These clippers really are great. Very sturdy construction, and the quality of the clip is amazing.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Sharp and the two sizes meet all needs.</li>
            <li> This is a part of my list of essential must-have to put in my bag every day. A lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for these. They look great in the picture and feel sturdy, but they fell apart on me. Had to toss them out because they did not hold together. They don&#x27;t even have the nail stick thing in the middle.</li>
            <li> came in on time and they did a great job thanks</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as my older tweezerman clippers .</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I thought these were going to be some great clippers, but really they are nothing special. They are definitely not cheaply built and flimsy like a lot of the other ones on Amazon seem to be. If anything they have the opposite problem. The metal they are made of is so thick that it does not let me get as close of a trim as I need sometimes.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband.  I have probably purchased 3 or 4 sets for him from different companies and within a few days will tell me they just don&#x27;t work right.  He has had these now for a month or so and still raves about them.  I would say they have passed the &amp;#34;critical test&amp;#34;!  Very pleased with this clipper set.</li>
            <li> very sharp and good quality.</li>
            <li> The small tweesers broke on the first use! So unfortunate. See photo below. I can&#x27;t get the arm back down because it is stuck in the hole in the front. Tweezerman used to be a good product. :( Boo.</li>
            <li> What can you say about this kind of product? People will have individual preferences regarding the details of nail clippers. Personally, I think these are well-made, reasonably-priced, and quite effective. They do not have attached nail files, which may matter to some people.</li>
            <li> These were recommended by a respected review site thesweethome.com as being the best clippers for your money. It might be true that these are good for the money you pay, but they&#x27;re not the best clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the pour-homme ultra-slim clippers for over a year now, and while they&#x27;re a lot more expensive (3 times more), they&#x27;re more than 3 times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazing thing about the pour homme clippers is that they actually *cut* your nails instead of crushing them. When you snip off a nail, it doesn&#x27;t go flying off into the air, never to be found again. They just sit there in the jaws of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this tweezerman set thinking that they would be as good, judging by the review on thesweethome, but they cut nails no better than the $2 ones you can get at the grocery store. The first nail I cut with this clipper went flying, and is sitting somewhere buried in my carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about nice things, and are willing to splurge on nail clippers, don&#x27;t get this one. Get the pour-homme ultra slim clippers for $28, and you will see how amazing a real quality cutter works.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and great price.</li>
            <li> Not that sharp; you need to apply a LOT of pressure to clip with the smaller ones.  Don&#x27;t waste money on these, get nicer ones.</li>
            <li> Total stainless clippers hard to find. Have not rusted in the shower after many months. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> They are not polished, just milled, so slip along a nail very poorly.</li>
            <li> Upon second use they broke. The company offered to replace them but to ship the original back would cost the same as buying a new one from a different company.</li>
            <li> Fingernail clipper broke into pieces on first use, feels cheap, certainly not made with the same quality control as their tweezers.</li>
            <li> Does its job but it didn&#x27;t come with a file.  That was unexpected. I didn&#x27;t think they made them like that anymore.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp, clips nails without breaking or chipping them. Only negative thing although minor is that I had to use a little more force them I&#x27;m accostumed to.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and have a nice feel in the hand. The larger one is a bit awkward for me to use, but I have unusually small feet and nails. The set of two is a good value.</li>
            <li> well made and functional.  these are strong and do the job well.  product arrived as expected and is the perfect replacement for my decades-old clippers.  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Solid and good looking, but wish they had been sharpened more finely.  Basically a hopped-up version of the ones you get at the check out at Walgreen&#x27;s.  Also wish the toe clipper opened a bit wider, as some of my nails down there are a bit hardy.  But still, solidly made and good looking, better than anything I&#x27;d used before and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, exactly as described. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Tweezerman honors all their products and happily keeps your items in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hubby and he loves them. Tweezerman need we say more.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re toenail clippers.  they clip toenails just fine.  They are machined well so the blades meet cleanly and... clip toenails.  The price is right.  If you need some buy these.</li>
            <li> mediocre clippers. not very sharp.</li>
            <li> OK.  Large size is a bit bulky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice finish, built like a tank, and they cut great. Everything I needed - I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for clippers.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers, sharp stainless steel,not some crappy metal with chrome plating like many of the others.&lt;br /&gt;They feel like quality in the hand, and so far they cut even through my gnarly toe nails with ease.</li>
            <li> Slightly rough out of the box, but after you use them a little they become very good. They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and provide clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, sharp, clips nails. Win.</li>
            <li> These clipper are awesome. Sharp and strong. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After all this time they still work great. They are more expensive than cheap run-of-the-mill clippers, but work way better, especially with my humongous toenails on my big toes!</li>
            <li> Really liked the two sizes in the package. Bought them for my husband so we won&#x27;t be needing to share mine.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the both of the nail clippers were not very sharp.  I was hoping that they would in time.</li>
            <li> My nails must have gotten thicker or maybe these units just aren&#x27;t sharp enough.  I&#x27;ll give it another month and will post another review should they start to work better.</li>
            <li> Great quality nail clippers. The fit and finish are very nice. The cutting edges line up properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small nail clippers have a curved cutting edge to match the curve of your nail. The larger nail clippers have a straight cutting edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use I put a daub of hand sanitizer on them and have had no issues with rust or other discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the third pair I have purchased. The first set my wife took so I bought a replacement set and an additional set for the office.</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  I&#x27;ve only used very cheap clippers (the kind that come with travel kits) night and day difference.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats Tweezerman for personal care tools. The clippers almost seem to be medical device -- they are that high in quality.</li>
            <li> These are very precise and sharp - the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.  This will be the last set of clippers you buy - I&#x27;ll never use cheap dollar store clippers again.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived duller than my ten year old clipper. After some remarkably complex sharpening they&#x27;re not bad. Feels like clean quality in the hand.</li>
            <li> looks good but any other clipper I have used is better quality than this one, go to Walmart and get a set like this one for 6 dollars and really better quality.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with as the first time I tried it and turned the top part around to get it into the clipping position - it stuck. I had difficulty getting it back on,but it did not cut well. Next time it got stuck again and I cut my finger trying to put the part back on. It is defective so I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> I tried to dry cut my sons nails with the clipper and he screamed because it bent his nail backward.  I tried using these on him again after soaking his nails and they tore at his nails. They tore at my nails wet or dry.  I bought a pair of cheap Trim deluxe clippers and they work twice better than the tweezerman clippers for half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toenail clippers are straight across.  Supposedly you are supposed to trim your toenails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails.  These did not allow me to cut the sharp corners, being so huge and straight angled.  I got some weird ingrown toenail issue as a result that i can&#x27;t seem to find the source of the pain which hasn&#x27;t grown out in even over a month&#x27;s time.  I will never buy this brand again, it&#x27;s not worth the extra money and it&#x27;s actually worse than the cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I expected the clippers to be of very high quality; they were a bit better than average, but not like my other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> These are seriously well made and cut nicely.  They aren&#x27;t curved much so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look really sharp and nice quality also, sturdy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toenail one does not have a good curve but the nail one does....maybe there is a reason for that?</li>
            <li> I love these. they work great, seem well made, and cut with ease. I don&#x27;t know why it has so many bad reviews. unless the company has changed the build none of the bad reviews seem to be true for me. nothing but good things.</li>
            <li> Until this point in my life, I&#x27;d always bought the nail clippers based on price, and my guesses about quality based on the packaging.  How different could they be, right?  If I had bought these Tweezerman Deluxe nail clippers years ago, I&#x27;d have known better.  These have a great heft that announces their quality.  The cutting side (is there a name for that?) is sharp and gets the job done effortlessly--even with my non-dominant hand.  They don&#x27;t do that thing where you have to keep twisting so it doesn&#x27;t come apart in your hand.  Honestly, if you&#x27;re tired of buying cheap crap and want a set of nail clippers that will last a long while and be truly awesome to work with--seriously, these are what you want.</li>
            <li> wow!!!!!!!! sharp long lasting</li>
            <li> Very sharp but I wish the large ones had curved blades. The straight cut isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best nailvlippers I&#x27;ve found on the market.  Nothing is sharper or cuts cleaner.</li>
            <li> they cut nails, which i expected.</li>
            <li> Simply put these are the best nail clippers ever! The long one has good leverage for those thick toenails. Be warned, these are very sharp, they can creep up on you and cut earlier than you expect so be prepared for that. You will find yourself cutting your nails more often because these are so nice to use.</li>
            <li> lacks a file, the little teeth that hold handle in-line, the little ridges that provide ant grip at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave them to Goodwill and bought Revlon at the drug store.</li>
            <li> The item was missing in the original mail package so I got the make-up item. It is well finished and sharp. It is a good deal!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are soo good- I have hidden them from the rest of the family. They use very little force to cleanly cut the nail.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, good quality, it cuts finger nails into a an odd shape. The middle of the nail is curved inwards and the edges are sharp and pointy after cutting. I was thinking it would cut straight across.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers that are perfectly aligned.  Meets my expectation of quality from the Tweezerman brand.</li>
            <li> This item came highly recommended, and the small clipper was sturdy and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the large clipper is not properly sharpened and does not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  They suck</li>
            <li> As described. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent product- great quality</li>
            <li> These are very good, high quality nail clippers.  I would recommend these over the super cheapies that you can buy in the grocery store checkout lane.</li>
            <li> We use the fingernail clipper more that the toenail clipper. Both are made of strong materials and are very sharp. Much nicer than store bought junk.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nail clippers, and they&#x27;re holding up well. You can&#x27;t really expect much more.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp for the price.  They look like quality products and cut my nails very nicely.  The old cutters we had used to gnaw at our nails and for some reason (I blame my wife!) we just used them for years.  Now with the Teezerman Deluxe Nail Clippers we get easy cuts that make trimming nails a snap.</li>
            <li> Good nail clippers. Missing a built-in nail file. Hard to cut off hangnails with the nail clipper. It definitely feels like good quality but not great.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and cut very well.  Only issue is that they don&#x27;t have that plastic nail catcher so nail clippings fly all over the place.  The small clipper has a curved cutter and the larger one has a straight cutter.</li>
            <li> very sharp good product</li>
            <li> I recently read a review on the Tweezerman Deluxe Nail Clippers via The Sweethome blog. They rated them the best nail clippers around. I&#x27;d have to fervently agree with The Sweethome! To anyone looking for an inexpensive pair of clippers that have proven to last, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are by far the best ones out there! I recommend these to anyone looking for nail clippers!</li>
            <li> At lease the smaller one is not as good as I expected. The two pieces of the clipper don&#x27;t meet precisely, so the clipper just doesn&#x27;t cut well. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This don&#x27;t worked for me. The blades are very sharp but they get stuck in your nails and is very difficult to have a proper cut.. Either way you have to push really hard in order to cut your nails. Thanks to Amazon I will get my refund. 0 for tweezerman and a 10 for amazon and his incredible customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> The fingernail clippers are fine but the toenail clippers do not have enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; or power to cut through toenails easily.</li>
            <li> I bought our first set of these to help deal with the thick nails of an elderly parent.  They worked so well, I ended up going back and buying a set for several more family members.  They are easy to use and cut the nails cleanly (no ragged edges) and easily.</li>
            <li> Really good quality clippers. Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Our old clipper set wasn&#x27;t cutting very well so I looked on Amazon and found this set. The high reviews sold me so I ordered them. They do a very nice job.</li>
            <li> Typical Tweezerman quality!  Love the clippers!</li>
            <li> Bought these at Rite Aid for $12.50.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  Was I surprised!!  These are by far the best clippers I have ever owned!  Note:  All previous ones were cheap walmart purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have a great feel and are very sharp.  Unlike most every pair I have ever owned/used, these cut through the nail with ease COMPLETELY, there is no need to clip and pull, these cut all the way through every time.  It is taking me a bit to get used to them due to this, and I have cut a couple of my nails a bit short, but that is user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now looking at some of their tweezers as well and are hoping the quality is as good as they are with the clippers!</li>
            <li> These work great. It&#x27;s nice to have one for fingernails and one for toes. They&#x27;re well made just like anything from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> The small clippers fell apart while opening. The larger pair worked ok. Not that great of quality.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and price</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap &amp;#34;check-out lane&amp;#34; $1.19 clippers again.</li>
            <li> they are durable, look good and cut my nails like they should .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your an average person looking for new nail clippers that work well - these are for you</li>
            <li> I tried these clippers because of the brand name.  A number of years ago I had the impression this brand had the best tweezers on the market.  These clippers didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and made out of stainless steel not chromed steel. I appears that they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but these clippers were horribly dull.  I bought them to replace my previous clippers that I&#x27;ve been using for years, and they were just as dull.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers on the market. Probably the sharpest out of all the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. Never buying another brand again.</li>
            <li> These are really nice.  Hight quality and solid feeling.  I suspect these will last a long time. Well worth the money.  When I first took them out of the package, the metal and design looked like they were made by Apple.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get these fingernail clippers and put them to work. My old ones broke and was forced to use my old toenail clippers..OMG these are &amp;#34;first cabin&amp;#34; and so happy now...</li>
            <li> I purchased these after seeing them rated by several websites as the best nail clippers. But in real-world use, only the toenail clippers work well for me. Maybe I just have thick fingernails, but those little clippers could barely cut through anything. A lot of times they would leave my nails looking ragged. That being said, the toenail clippers are superb. I really like the straight edge, which ensures a clean, proper cut of each toenail. So I&#x27;ll keep them around, but the fingernail clippers are getting tossed out.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the look and feel. Can tell that the material is built to last, no issues I can think of.</li>
            <li> So you think, these are just basic/cheap nail clippers, I don&#x27;t really care about the quality - right? Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle broke off of the small pair within 10 minutes of using it, just trying to twist it back around to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; the clippers and the thing pops right off. The quality is laughably bad.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> So far so good. They are heavy, feel durable and haven&#x27;t bowed at all when cutting my boyfriend&#x27;s gnarly toenails. And the color is manly, I guess...</li>
            <li> Clippers work great and good price.</li>
            <li> Bought these for clipping my nails as crazy as that sounds, and they work very well.  Only downside is they do not have a little&lt;br /&gt;file or nail scraper with them, which is fine but if you want to get under your nails these don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction and product</li>
            <li> They are not as wide as they look a little awkward</li>
            <li> The people who say they don&#x27;t make a clean cut are right; I even tried when my nails were wet, right out of the shower. Because my left hand is weaker I did my right hand first and had to really struggle to cut one nail. I don&#x27;t see how these are any better than what I could&#x27;ve bought at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because this set seemed to rate quite high. They are both attractive looking and sharp but the nail clipper is really too small for my hands, and I suspect most men&#x27;s hands and thus difficult to grip. Toe clipper works better with good grip, neither has any way to file nails and/or take the edge off.</li>
            <li> The large clipper is sharp and works well.  The smaller clipper is out of alighnment and does not cut as well.</li>
            <li> Probably the best clippers I have ever known. I hate trimming nails. As soon as I got this item, I took a shower and then performed the dreaded task. Most clippers tend to snag my toe-claws, but this was a good, clean, cut. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Any number of reviewers have made positive comments about these clippers. I can&#x27;t imagine why. They are quite attractive, but they share a major problem -- they do not cut. They tear. The blades do not meet. If it were only one of the pair, I might consider it a fluke. However, both are incapable of clipping cleanly, and that means the manufacturing process is flawed. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re good, strong in construction and very well made. The blades are great, you can cut a lot of things not only nails...</li>
            <li> It is as I expected they would be. They are sturdy and do their job however they have no nail filer like most other brands I have had over the years.</li>
            <li> I gave up on nail clippers over $0.99 after shattering a pair of Revlon ones (I guess I don&#x27;t know my own strength?). But this pair redeems clippers for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are tough and masculine nail clippers, the metal seems thicker than most others I&#x27;ve seen. After about a month of use, I&#x27;m quite happy! No file on these, but that&#x27;s no worry for me.</li>
            <li> Sharp, clean, durable - better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Great pruduct, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, not great and not as sharp as advertised.  Best I&#x27;ve ever had was Revlon.</li>
            <li> Works, does come with two nail clippers</li>
            <li> Awsome clippers, just not for cuticles...overall gets the job done though and looks nice too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best clippers around.  I know, I&#x27;ve owned the silver German toenail clippers that resemble lobster claw-crackers, and numerous other old-school clippers.  These are worth the investment, so buy the fingernail clipper and toenail clipper at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what&#x27;s even better is that if they become dull, Tweezerman will sharpen them for free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp but I didn&#x27;t like it much since the two cutting parts do not match when closed.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy nail clippers. We&#x27;ve had them for a few months now and they seem to be holding up quite well. Good value for the two.</li>
            <li> Cuts very nice. Excellent nail clippers!</li>
            <li> Cuts very well. I&#x27;ve had these for many months and they&#x27;re still cutting well. They are nice quality.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for a this product.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, toe nail clipper is straight like all toe nail clippers should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside does not have a nail filer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that there are two of these clipper available because sometimes my brother just goes away carrying with him any stuff without and sounds at all</li>
            <li> Not bad. But be careful when you flip the lever around: it comes off the unit, and is challenging to put back on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The lever on these tweezers ALWAYS falls off when you flip it into cutting position, and it&#x27;s not easy to get it back on. Best bet: don&#x27;t fold the lever. .</li>
            <li> I have already hid these clippers from my family because once they use them, I will never see them again.  Wow, what a huge quality difference from anything I have ever used before.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp!! The best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Both broke the very first time we use it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what happended but we are very disappointed at Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as Xmas gift based on ratings.  Recipient is very pleased.  Strong, accurate and easy to use. Less expensive sets/clippers available but worth the money.</li>
            <li> No traction available on fingernail clippers. Toe nail cclippers - not too sure about.  Both appear to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy clippers. I like the feel of the handles because they don&#x27;t seem to slip when you&#x27;re clipping your nails. I wish they had a pick tool but the clippers are great.</li>
            <li> Dull blade, made poor cuts that left snags.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and so well made.  Wish i would have bought these years ago.</li>
            <li> Weak, you have to squeeze really hard to get it to cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this set at a local department store (Target) and I was expecting great things. The set I bought said (on the back) that I could send them back for sharpening for as long as there was still enough blade to sharpen, with ZERO $$ shipping. I was totally surprised and amazed by this so I bought them and took them home. Unfortunately, the fingernail clipper was not sharp at all - I had to squeeze the handle down very hard to get them to cut. And to add insult to injury, due to the design of the clipper handle, the handle hurt my fingers to squeeze due to the shape of the handle (it is somewhat sharp - not like a blade, but an unfortunate design flaw). I did not even try the toenail clippers since I knew I was returning the fingernail clippers. I hope I just got a bad pair, but even if I did, the fact that the clipper is uncomfortable to hold and clip with is very unfortunate. The best clipper I ever owned was, of all things, a Sharper Image clipper which had a rubber inlay in the handle, making them VERY comfortable to hold, and also making them virtually impossible to slip out of my grip. Hopefully someone makes a high quality blade coupled with a rubber surface handle. This doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be rocket science, but, I guess it is.</li>
            <li> Needs a nail file on it! Otherwise excellent. But I expected it to come with one of those fold-out nail files. Oh well!</li>
            <li> Much sharper than generic clippers from pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> This pair of nail clippers gets it done. They feel very solid when in use and don&#x27;t appear to be cheaply made like other brands. The cut is very sharp and leaves the nails feeling very smooth. When a friend saw mine by accident their response was &amp;#34;Are those nail clippers? &amp;#34;Cool, not sure why, but cool!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I just thought it was funny as one would never typically buy nail clippers to impress but a compliment is a compliment none the less....hahaha. For the price, I recommend giving them a try.</li>
            <li> Took the buy on these from the Sweethome and have had zero regrets. Clipping your nails with anything else feels awful after you&#x27;ve gotten used to these.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> if you do then look no further. These babies can cut the hardest of nail. They slice they dice they make fungus go away. Buy today! Obviously they work they&#x27;re nail clippers....</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers. I have been searching for an inexpensive toe nail clipper and when I saw this combo by tweezerman I had to get it. I tried cheap alternatives in the past and some of the broke, I got tough toe nails. However, this toe nail clipper is super strong and it cuts my toe nails with ease. I am happy I brought them.</li>
            <li> These are some high quality clippers. Will never go back to the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman does everything well &amp; these are great w/ the exception that there is no fold out/pull out (?) thingie that you can clean under your nails with.  Kind of an essential piece they forgot to design this with.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on thesweethome, they are tuff, cuts clean, comfortable to use, one for foot one for hand, cannot go wrong with this. Seriously the best nail clippers ever used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually need new nail clippers, but I saw all the great reviews and figured, for cheap money I might as well upgrade since I will probably be using them for years and years to come.  And my current set I&#x27;ve had for so long I have no idea where they even came from, so probably they&#x27;re dull and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too impressed though - same or more effort involved than with my old non-brand-name clippers, both toe and fingernail versions.  The flex on the lever doesn&#x27;t help with the apparent effort, and they don&#x27;t seem to be noticeably sharper than my old ones.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The large clipper is useless.</li>
            <li> After going through many sets of clippers that needed to be trashed almost immediately, this set was bought based on the Amazon feedback.  We have been very happy with this set and are thinking about buying another set so that the other clippers can be trashed.</li>
            <li> These are hands down, the best pair of clippers I have ever owned. They are share, durable, and leave my nails with a perfect, clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> awesome!  Sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> Good quality but not as sharp as expected or needed.</li>
            <li> Provides a great, clean clip. My only wish is that there would be a plastic side guard like with asian style nail clippers to prevent the clippings from flying everywhere. I just ended up reusing one from a similar sized clipper that I already owned.</li>
            <li> very heavy duty!!! feel like it would last! if lost would definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> no function to smooth nails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so good and works great! The best nail clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Good set of nail clippers, very sharp and cut thru the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li> Very strong and sharp.</li>
            <li> These things are strong, durable, and best of all they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; when I clamp down hard on my stubborn thick toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone that is tired of the weak, cheap-o clippers from wally world.</li>
            <li> These clippers feel so much better than a normal drug store pair that it&#x27;s the difference from air to water, love to hate, and worth it to worthless to get the point across. I practically feel like I could get into Fort Knox with them. They feel so well built that you know NASA or some other agency had to have their part in the design process.</li>
            <li> Like a fork, nail clippers either work, or they don&#x27;t.  These do.  They&#x27;re sharp, they line up, they cut well.  As previous reviewers have stated, quality control may be sub-par on these.  If you&#x27;re not interested in taking a risk, check out the Mehaz 660 and 662.  I&#x27;ve heard good things about those.</li>
            <li> Sharp! Good heft &amp; hand feel.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Fingernail clipper arrived with defect right out of the package.  There is a noticeable chip out of the blade making it impossible to get a clean cut.  Look to a different brand with better quality control.</li>
            <li> ...now if only these comes in a case for storing</li>
            <li> Be careful when spinning the lever around. If you accidentally hold the body too tightly with one hand and the lever with the other hand. The lever may pop off and the holding pin is easy to lose. The lever is held in place by the opening pressure of the top and bottom cutting sides. I&#x27;ve never had clippers fall apart in my hands like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting quality is great and these have lasted me for a long time with care. I keep them on my key chain but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for others. Since they are very easy to fall apart if pressure is applied to the wrong places. Had them fall apart a couple of times now but luckily I found all the pieces and was able to put it back together quickly.</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper broke apart the first time I tried to use it and the little column piece flew out and went straight down my bathroom sink drain.  It was a MAJOR pain to open the p trap and retrieve the column piece and then have to package the whole thing up and return it because it would not go back together again.  The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because it clipped cleanly the one nail I was able to clip before the stupid thing broke.  Made in China.  Bleh.</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman clippers are a little intense compared to the typical clippers everybody&#x27;s been using since forever. I had to get used to slowing down and paying attention to cutting my fingernails, otherwise these will cut way too short as compared to typical clippers. They do a good job, but who wants to spend time clipping nails? If you&#x27;re used to trimming your nails quickly and aren&#x27;t interested in giving it any more thought than that, I&#x27;d go find some regular old-school clippers elsewhere. If you&#x27;re interested in a slightly heavier-duty, more precise-cutting nail clipper set, then these are just what you&#x27;ve been looking for. For me, I&#x27;ll probably find some typical ones and going back to clipping my nails in 20 seconds after a shower.</li>
            <li> perfect sharp nail clippers  one for me, one for my husband.</li>
            <li> Great quality have stayed sharpened leaving no ridges</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I have used.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived in excellent condition thank you</li>
            <li> I really like these nail clippers. One thing though: they need to be &amp;#34;broken in.&amp;#34; The first twenty of so times you use them, they cut really sharply and the nail clippings fly all over the place. Stick with them though, and that stops and they become more like normal, drugstore type clippers, only better in every way. They don&#x27;t have files though, so you will have to buy those separately if you want them. I also have the Tweezerman tweezers, which are great too.</li>
            <li> They perform as expected but are not as awesome as I was hoping for at this price.  No problems cutting through nails.</li>
            <li> feels more solid and durable, plus they are easy to identify as yours - a plus in a house where kids keep &#x27;borrowing&#x27; your stuff</li>
            <li> Friend gave me these plus another one as a gift. Nothing special - just average. Can find a better quality elsewhere. Would rather pay more for better quality. Were hard for me to hold and clipping strength not what I expected.</li>
            <li> After reading an article on about the ultimate in grooming products (can&#x27;t remember where), I wanted to purchase these nail clippers. Many people don&#x27;t think about nail clippers and just pick up the 99 cent ones from the grocery check-out isle. I use mine a lot and was tired of the dullness that came to my clippers very quickly. Not only is the black/gunmetal look a lot more professional looking, but the quality within this product is phenomenal. I am very pleased with how well the clippers have kept sharp and the way in which I can clip my toes/fingers. The only way I could ever imagine having to buy these again would be if I lost them. They definitely seem built for life. Yes, at $9, they might be about $8 more than you ever expected to pay for nail clippers, but I can definitely say that for me, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought those for myself but my husband keeps &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; these, will be ordering set for him and our kids. Very sharp and cut precisely where I need it.</li>
            <li> Very robust. The black bit is metal as well.</li>
            <li> very sharp, very clean cuts. durable. great product</li>
            <li> Clean cut. No need to file. Happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem: It seems it is not as easy to position the blade of this new nail clipper onto my finger nail as my old one.</li>
            <li> very sharp and durable..</li>
            <li> My fingers loves these clippers</li>
            <li> It would be beneficial to include a metal file and a small knife to get dirt. These only clip your nails and at the premium price I believe more should be included.</li>
            <li> They clip nails cleanly.  I notice the difference even between the regular tweezerman and of course the regular tweezerman is head and shoulders above the average clipper.  It also has a more stable feel to it.</li>
            <li> Quality not as good as typical Tweezerman</li>
            <li> Sharp looking nail clippers that do a good, not great job.  These clippers are heavy compared to the crappy ones in the grocery store checkout line, which I take to be a good sign.  The finger nail clippers work on my nails well, but an included nail file would be appreciated.  The toe nail clippers don&#x27;t cut quite as well but do get the job done.  No issues with sturdiness, alignment or sharpness of either clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers complaining about the price point vs performance.  I don&#x27;t know what they paid, but for a little less than $4.50 a clipper I&#x27;d say I got what I paid for.  I&#x27;m satisfied enough to have ordered a second pair for the office.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good, but for the price and based on the reviews, I expected more.  Just slightly better than $2.99 clippers, not sure these are worth it.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, although quality is not quite as good other Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li> The clippers are well made and are pretty sharp. My only complaint is that normally, clippers have a small file with a pointed end, which I find particularly useful, and this one lacks it. I don&#x27;t think the product description states that.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time buying a Tweezerman product. Since my past experience had been great, I expected that to be the case here. It wasn&#x27;t! Matter of fact, I found these to be the worst clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen. Like they sold me a the bad batch or something! They would cut the nail, but a pair of scissors my have done just as good a job! the tips of my nails split a bit vertically - which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen happen before. So, no I don&#x27;t recommend. At least Amazon took care of me in this situation and refunded my order without any issues.</li>
            <li> I bought the tweezers from Tweezerman, and was so impressed with them I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These feel very sturdy and well constructed, and cut nails very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I bought then for the convex cutting surface, which is somewhat difficult to find. Totally disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others I definitely dislike the cut with Tweezerman clippers. Uniquely wierd is the amount that the lever bends. Under light pressure most clippers cut almost immediately, with little or no bending in the lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Tweezerman the level bends and bends, and you need to use excessive pressure before the cut occurs. During that time the nail is gripped, and uncertain movements may twist it during the &amp;#34;waiting period&amp;#34; (because it&#x27;s difficult to exert the required pressure with a steady hand) and this might contribute to the uneveness of the cut.</li>
            <li> Expected a lot more from this company. The bigger one isn&#x27;t easy to use and requires a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li> I love these. Mine got lost so I ordered more. I can never go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; nail clippers again.</li>
            <li> I love how sharp these are! There&#x27;s nothing worse than a dull nail clipper, especially for my toes! These are efficient for my fingernails, too! I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly and healthy my nails grow back. I cut them pretty regularly, but had never noticed how healthy the sharp cut makes my nails. This is my second set. I think my Roomate fell in love with my last pair!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he said he couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between these and his old worn out clippers.  Wish he would have told me sooner, I would have returned them.</li>
            <li> You will never need (or want) to buy another pair of clippers again.  The nemesis of ugly, overgrown nails everywhere!</li>
            <li> Seem to be well made and sharp but there is no fingernail cleaner and the toenail clipper is straight, not curved.</li>
            <li> Perfect and sturdy doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy at all. Cuts great and doesn&#x27;t feel like my nail I&#x27;d jagged.</li>
            <li> these were recommended on wirecutter. they&#x27;re wrong. these are crap clippers. you&#x27;d be better off with the cheap drugstore clippers these replaced. the clippers fail to cut through my nails, forcing me to back off and try again with a smaller chunk. they also have sharper corners making them less comfortable to grip. overall not worth it. #fail</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to believe the reviews but these are the most horrible clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are not sharp and they are difficult to push down and actually cut the nails.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to cut your nails unless your just out of the shower as they recommend.  The toe clippers are too large - they seem to be made for cutting something other than a human toenail. The small can barely cut through my pinky.  They feel dangerous because they could easily slip out of your hand while you&#x27;re trying to push down so hard to clip a nail.  Very disappointed.  Go to the drug store and you&#x27;ll find better clippers for half the price.</li>
            <li> These are actually a good quality set.  They clip easily and efficiently.  You don&#x27;t have to squeeze really hard to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought another set, thinking maybe something was wrong with the first set but this time, neither one worked.  Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Solid product would definitely recommend to anyone that is tired of buying dollar store clippers every month.</li>
            <li> My friends love them!</li>
            <li> my old one broken for long time, I see this one just in a case, and love it very much</li>
            <li> My wife purchased these from Sally&#x27;s and told me the price. We are used to buying the normal everyday cheap Walgreens or Fred Meyers nail clippers and they usually start off well and then get worse. These have been sharp from the start and stayed sharp in 4 months of use by my wife and son. they are well made pretty heavy gauge material used to manufacture these and they are simply just  great. They work like you would expect nail clippers to work. I don&#x27;t think I will need to ever buy another set unless of course I lose them. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Good quality nail clippers.  They are precise and solid unlike the cheap ones you find sold for 99 cents at the checkout line.</li>
            <li> just like all tweezerman products I&#x27;ve tried, they work very well. I given the tweezers as gifts. everyone loves good tweezers.</li>
            <li> Each of the clippers are very sharp and precise and they are super easy to use. I am very happy I decided to purchase the set.</li>
            <li> The clippers do not have a file or fingernail cleaner, which was a bummer. The clippers are sharp. The Toenail Clipper is quite large. I only use it for my big toe.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned. They are a little more expensive than the average clipper but worth it when you clip your nails. They do not compress until the nail comes off. With little pressure, the blades are sharp where too much pressure isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> so far only use it once seems very sharp.</li>
            <li> Well made, sharp, accurate, easy to use with larger hands (me).&lt;br /&gt;They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Quality steel, positive and predictable action. Have several pair in office, bedroom, briefcase.</li>
            <li> never knew such good slippers exist!</li>
            <li> These work only slightly better than generic nail clippers from the pharmacy or supermarket, but seem to be better made.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and cut nicely.</li>
            <li> I opened nail tweezers for first time and tried to turn clipper handle to use. It got stuck on its side. Won&#x27;t move. Had to throw away...</li>
            <li> Good cutting and easy to grip, but no file to smooth the edge of the fingernail.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my brother in law, as I put together a shaving kit along with, among other things, tweezers of the same brand. I have had personal experience with the tweezers, I was impressed by them, they saved my life one time (read the review). Based the tweezers, I trusted that these had the same quality and construction and I believe they do.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough or usability</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a nail file for a while now, because of the bad experiences I had with &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; nail clippers. They would leave rough bits of the nail that would need to get filed down anyway, so I just stuck with nothing but a file. After hearing these Tweezerman clippers come highly recommended, I bit the bullet and bought a pair. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t think they would be all that much better than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong! The cutting surface is at a slant, and is really sharp, so they give the nail a nice clean, perfect tapered cut. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and perform very well.  I bought these from a review I read on thesweethome.com and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good-- just what I expected</li>
            <li> great clippers, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better</li>
            <li> Whole family use these for finger and toe nails. I use them on our 4 month old and our 2 year old because they are so sharp. Second set because we keep one downstairs and one upstairs.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these clippers because they feel strong (not flexy) when I cut my toenails. They are sharp and maintain my positive impression of Tweezerman products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any of my mail friends who can&#x27;t find their nail clippers. Makes a great add on. Also, parents looking for a stocking stuffer for the less than grooming conscious young person in their life may want to buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s cool that they&#x27;re black instead of the ubiquitous silver nail clipper.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve always purchased cheap drugstore nail clippers found in a bin, usually costing less than a dollar. After losing my last pair, I decided to see if Tweezerman made a better product. They do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened these clippers, my immediate impression was &amp;#34;solid.&amp;#34; These clippers feel well built, and have a bit of a heft to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work brilliantly, trimming each nail with a perfect snip. They&#x27;re sharp, and precise. There&#x27;s no squeezing twice, or trying to maneuver the clipper. They just work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger toenail clipper is excellent too, with a  straight clipper edge to trim the thicker nails of the feet correctly.</li>
            <li> The big one is big, the little one has a tight radius on the curved cutting edge, exactly what I wanted. I can imagine someone just wanting one clipper to do everything, I wanted distinct two clippers.</li>
            <li> lost the others.  bought these as a replacement.  better made than the lost ones.  cut easily</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these, having read great reviews. They&#x27;re solid and heavy which is nice if you don&#x27;t plan to travel with them. I was disappointed with their actual performance though. They don&#x27;t cut well and feel dull. I have to use a fair amount of pressure and it don&#x27;t come away cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My $.99 pair from the drug store cuts better, is much lighter and more portable, includes a nail file, and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, value and price, the Tweezerman name says it all.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. They are very sharp and cut finger and toe nails with no issues. Makes very nice clean cuts. I also love the flt black finish on the handle because it looks cool and it keeps my finger from slipping while I use them.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST nail clippers EVER!  They are sharp and hold their edge.  I&#x27;ve never had any nail clippers this nice.  They are feel good in my hand and aren&#x27;t slippery, so I can hold onto them well, even after I&#x27;ve put lotion on my hands or when my hands are moist after a shower.  They may seem a little pricey, but they are worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Clips nails, and clips them well.</li>
            <li> In terms of performance, these clippers are noticeably more... expensive. No different than the $1 ones I used previously. However, they DO look and feel a bit nicer. They work fine. I think I was just expecting a little more.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f44141da3e3dc5faf111221168538323]]The small nail clipper does not work. The cutting edges don&#x27;t meet on one corner. These must be defective.</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers.  But if you&#x27;re a dude with manly finger nails, then you&#x27;re going to want to use the big toe nail clipper on your hands too.  The &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; clipper is a little too dainty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it makes a great, clean cut.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great buy! I&#x27;m buying another set!</li>
            <li> They look nice but required a lot of force to cut finger nails or toe nails and do not work as well as less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality and I think it is. These are sharper than any other cheap clipper I used before, but the straight blade on the larger one and especially the missing nail file are big enough problems that I&#x27;d prefer my old cheap clipper back.</li>
            <li> Works real well my nails, and believe me, thats no easy feat. (Pun intended) Im going to hide these from my kids, these are all mine!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there isn&#x27;t in included file.  Otherwise, they stay sharp and make a good cut after several months of use.</li>
            <li> good quality but too expensive</li>
            <li> it was ok , and it came on time , no complaint . it is very good quality .</li>
            <li> Nice and strong nail clippers! Thank you !</li>
            <li> Good stuff Easy to use</li>
            <li> These look good in the drawer with all of my other grooming supplies, but otherwise don&#x27;t perform any better than a cheaper generic pair.  If you like the look, great.  Just don&#x27;t expect anything different when it comes to using them.  They lack a nail file, so in one aspect they&#x27;re perhaps less functional than the generic ones.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the blades not matching up or something not being right with the blades. Mine came perfect and very sharp. even the lever action to cut nails feels very fluid and smooth. I will probably be buying these again in the future once I loose these, which is very likely.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and well made</li>
            <li> Garbage.  They cut my nails very ruggedly and after the very first use, the metal lever got caught in the hole that acts as the fulcrum and they were broken for good.  Came to Amazon to find a good pair and wanted to share that these are absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Cut cleanly and evenly. Sturdy, just what I needed. Good price for both toenail and fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> not made very well. Dissapointed for the tweezerman name.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sturdy and cut well.</li>
            <li> The smaller one fell apart the first time I used it.  I had to put it back together.  It doesn&#x27;t cut precisely.  Not worth it to try to return.  The bigger ones work much better.</li>
            <li> Neither the smaller or larger of the clippers I received are sharp,  the fingernail clipper is especially dull, requiring a great amount of force to use and leaving my nails ragged.  The toenail clippers are better, but if you have not used a straight clipper before, consider carefully before you buy these.  A rounded cut requires either a lot of little straight clips or a file to finish.  No question my cheap drug store clippers are easier to use and do a better job.</li>
            <li> A great pair of nail clippers!</li>
            <li> Great quality - good value.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for good review. I need to clip many time to cut the nails. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and they feel great mechanically. They also look very nice.</li>
            <li> I think through reviews and use, tweezerman are the best nail clippers around. Sharp, easy to handle. I have a regular manicure set, and I replaced the clippers with Tweezerman clippers</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products.  The nail clipper was a bit small and flimzy, but the toe mail clipper is perfect.  5 for quality but I would recommend just buying the toe nail clipper alone if it saves you money to do so.</li>
            <li> not the best for the money, good quality</li>
            <li> Excellent! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Definitely higher quality than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers broke upon taking them out of the packaging.  I put them together and after every clip, they break again...and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toenail clippers are great though.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then Seki brand, but does the same quality job, though you won&#x27;t find &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; on it! :) Very sharp!</li>
            <li> These are a great pair of tweezers: sharp, strong, and comforatble to hold. Unless I lose them, I&#x27;d expect these to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Where is the file?! I don&#x27;t know about you but when I clip my toe nails I need that file to prevent ingrown toenails. Im annoyed that these don&#x27;t come with them. Down with Tweezerman!!</li>
            <li> These are sharp, sharp, sharp. Also lightweight, and durable. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I thought it had a small nail file inside the clipper. It doesn&#x27;t. I feel the clippers are not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I bought theses tweezers as a gift and he loved them. The tweezers worked perfectly.  Great quality and excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent nail clippers. Very good for nail clipping</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp?  I tried others and this cut effortlessly.  Very well made!</li>
            <li> Tweezer man is the best by far!</li>
            <li> Quality on these seemed pretty good and they were sharp but the little clipper seemed baby size and too small (and I don&#x27;t have big hands). Had it been a little larger it would have been wonderful. The toenail clippers were straight and were useless as a replacement for fingernails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all relative when it comes to preferences on personal hygiene equipment, but for me, I prefer to have a nice clean &#x27;click&#x27; when i cut my nails. These get about 3/4 of the intended cut off, then i need to clip again so I&#x27;m almost doubling the effort. I&#x27;ve purchased cheaper ones from the drugstore that work cleaner than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came recommended from thewirecutter website, and I have to say that this, along with a few other merchandise recommended on that website, makes me question how exactly they come up with their verdicts on &#x27;best of the best&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Well made with very sharp cutting edges.</li>
            <li> A fine durable product, makes a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> So much sharper then the crappy clipper&#x27;s from the big corporate stores. Better quality too. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great set of nail clippers; clean cuts and that&#x27;s really all that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Best quality nail clippers I have ever used and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, and work very well.</li>
            <li> just ok. not easy to hold - the small one is too small and uncomfortable to hold and does not cut as good as ones I have used.</li>
            <li> firm to the grip ..stylish .. sharp cut... great set!! thx</li>
            <li> These work great! Perfect size!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my daughter, but they are a little stiff, not so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The big toe nail clipper works well. The small finger nail clipper is complete crap.</li>
            <li> Great nail clipper set, very hefty, sturdy and sharp.  Very happy with this purchase, will probably last me 20 years!</li>
            <li> these are great clippers. heavy duty and very sharp</li>
            <li> This is the second set I bought, since everyone in the family wants to borrow mine. Cuts clean vs the cheap brands that chews your nail off!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products are wonderful!!</li>
            <li> My first pair i bought from Target were great! My grandmother wanted to keep them and i decided to let her keep them. So i ordered these from here because i was gonna be busy all weekend. I love these! They&#x27;re sharp and are the best pairs i&#x27;ve ever bought! Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a nail filer attached, but no biggy!</li>
            <li> Best pair of nail clippers I have ever owned. Never again will I buy the cheap kind and replace them every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;This pair is super sharp and precise, no need to go over with a nail file. The cuts are clean and perfect each time.</li>
