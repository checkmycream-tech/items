            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes! I was a little worried about the quality of the product because of how cheap it was but it smells just the same as the bottle my mom had bought in stores when it was still sold in stores. I will be buying this perfume again! I recommend wearing this perfume in the evening, I think it has kind of a sultry smell to it if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> Horrible!! I received a red t shirt not perfume!</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE everyday perfume :):)</li>

            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I always buy it on-line because I can find it so much cheaper than at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> CUMPLIO LAS ESPECTATIVAS</li>
            <li> Not the same scent... Doesnt last like perfume... Would not recommend to buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this item. I received it on time. I am looking to order more in the near future. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing! And such a low price. I&#x27;ve ordered at least 4 bottles now</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent! I get compliments on it all the time and it makes my boyfriend so happy,,he loves it too so I try to wear it around him a lot,,,Great scent. Can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed with this perfume.</li>
            <li> I absolute love the perfume. I got a deal for 3.4 ounces of this classic scent.  The bottle was brand new and delivered in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love it smells amazing will buy again</li>
            <li> Smells so good! I get so many compliments on it. The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long though. I usually put it on once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this perfume, but every time I wear it I get compliments.  Even my son stopped me the first day I wore this and pulled me close to smell me, and said, &amp;#34;mmmmmmmmmmm,&amp;#34; which says a lot seeing as I wear perfume every day and he has never done this before.  It will be one of my signature fragrances, for sure.  Great price for a huge bottle, as well.  A little goes a long way, and I smell the fragrance all day as I move.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be one of her more sophisticated scents and I certainly agree. The bottle is pretty cool. The scent is like a light musk. It&#x27;s very soft, which I think u could do during the day. It&#x27;s like a strong floral, so it&#x27;s not too overly powerful. I could see myself going to work with this, like it&#x27;s not one of those head turner perfumes, it&#x27;s subtly musky.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a day time thing in MY OPINION. But it&#x27;s also a nice night time scent, it&#x27;s versatile in that sense. For a very detailed review, see: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li> Fair price and arrived on time</li>
