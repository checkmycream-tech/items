    <ol>
            <li>An excellent buy!</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY STRONG PINE STENCH!!!!</li>
            <li>Vaseline Men is one of the best lotions I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed that Vaseline came out with a lotion that dries in about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>and I can say that it is the best i have ever used, the skin feels relieved when I apply it.</li>
            <li>My wonderful hubby uses lotion like women use perfume</li>
            <li>This is perhaps the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is the perfect moisturizer that also doubles as an aftershave.</li>
            <li>Best part: Non greasy</li>
            <li>and it soothes perfectly.</li>
            <li>The smell is very good, though it is not for everyone.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>great and works excellent!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and a great price.</li>
            <li>Good news for those that dislike the scented version!</li>
            <li>Another great feature of this product is after it dries</li>
            <li>The scent smells great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and moisturizes to a degree.</li>
            <li>By the brand being Vaseline you would think it was a great product but</li>
            <li>moisturizes and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Happy with it.</li>
            <li>the scent its also great...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy and the 3 pack</li>
            <li>It does feel great on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This face and body lotion works great for men.  </li>
            <li>It really is a great body lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is so great that you don&#x27;t need cologne and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This lotion comes in a huge bottle and is a great bargain and is a perfect combination of moisturizer and cologne.</li>
            <li>but I want a skin moisturizer that has no scent or a very mild one at best.</li>
            <li>and I loved that</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even feel like you put on lotion after about 30 seconds which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I bought the Vaseline Men Fast-drying because it smelled good in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Good lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion works fairly well on my hands at arm.</li>
            <li>Good lotion and smells good.  </li>
            <li>The good:  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, good price, works.  </li>
            <li>It does provide good moisturization for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good thing...</li>
            <li>The package is around 20 ounces, that&#x27;s good quantity.</li>
            <li>Feels good going on</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have greasy palms after applying and smells good.</li>
            <li>It works great not too much smell and best of all, no shimmer.</li>
            <li>A great lotion for my son that keeps him looking good and smelling better.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer and I love the cedar smell.</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is effective and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I have never had so many women ask me how I smell so good.  </li>
            <li>So when he tried this, he really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li>If I wanted to scent my body, I&#x27;d buy Axe, and I just don&#x27;t expect this kind of thing from Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out, and found my hands and elbows feel nicely softened.  </li>
            <li>and he found he liked this product a lot.  </li>
            <li>It actually is nice and not over powering.  </li>
            <li>Works great for moisturization, has a great manly scent and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, does not overpower, and is suitable for males and females, but like any scented product may conflict with most women&#x27;s perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Nice lotion, Has a pleasant scent and rubs in just fine...</li>
            <li>The Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a very good buy, dries fast</li>
            <li>In 1 Moisturizer Body, Face and Hands, 13.5 Ounce]] (reviewed here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELTMVCRRZA5I/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B007PWRXHO&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty) for just over a year, at the behest of my beloved, this was purchased for me by said light of my life as an alternative product.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering - it won&#x27;t replace your cologne, but it does smell good and you can smell it lightly on your skin for a while after you apply</li>
            <li>Plus it smells pretty good too, and the container is huge--a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant cucumber smell that quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light, it does not bother me and my wife likes.</li>
            <li>but the feeling is very light.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this lotion as it absorbs fast and leaves a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>it smells nice, but it is almost too strong IMO.  </li>
            <li>I dont get that sticky feeling you get from most lotions.  </li>
            <li>I personally love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although, the skin becomes smooth!</li>
            <li>Although I am not affected by the scent, many women, including my wife and coworkers cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li>Is ok, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It is okay for him because he doesn&#x27;t wear any cologne, but if you do you might want something that is scent-free.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to give this Vaseline Body and Face Lotion for Men</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t like to use the lotions that I have because they have a more feminine smell.</li>
            <li>I have to reapply it more often than I want to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Most of us don&#x27;t want to smell like girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Vaseline</li>
            <li>I understand that they&#x27;re directing this one towards men, and that it can be used on the face after shaving, but a more low-key smell would have been a better</li>
            <li>This seems more like a cologne to</li>
            <li>I decided to try this more on a whim than anything else.  </li>
            <li>more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love it regardless.</li>
            <li>If you continue using it, leaving about 2 or 3 hours in between usage, your hands quickly become very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try the kind specially formulated for guys.</li>
            <li>If you want VERY light moisturizing and you like a strong scent, you might like this product.  </li>
            <li>The Vaseline men&#x27;s skin care lotion is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good body lotion/moisturizer, but apparently there are not too many good choices currently available for men.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, non greasy feeling and absorbs quickly making skin feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly and feel nice.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>really like the refreshing scent and good skin moisturizing of this Vaseline lotion</li>
            <li>This lotion smells very earthy and musky, in a pleasant way, and not too strong.</li>
            <li>far the lotion has been great in the spring time.  </li>
            <li>Even for the areas that will get you a citation for indecent exposure, if I didn&#x27;t want to slide off the sheets or leave a grease slick worthy of a sequel to Coming to America, and I have sampled just about anything that claimed to be a good moisturizer with rapid absorption, the best options have been Lubiderm or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also ergonomically designed for easy gripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of them and this one is no exception, does much for the sandpaper heel syndrome, as an old school application of copious amounts of petroleum jelly is the thing that works best for me..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a rather strong perfume scent which people may or may not like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For me, this lotion is too watery and the scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li>Smell is just waaaaaaaay too strong for any man to wear all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said that it&#x27;s not too strong to it doesn&#x27;t interfere with his after shave cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel greasy like some of the lotions that I have in the house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, but the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the scent was was too strong.  </li>
            <li>you like the strong scent, then this will probably appeal as a four-or-five star product for you.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it too strong.</li>
            <li>but it has a strong cologne like scent that had me washing my hands after I used it.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it, too, but she  thinks it is  strong.</li>
            <li>The lotion feels fine going on and keeps your skin sufficiently hydrated.</li>
            <li>but I always find these too strong - if you seek out scent free products as I do, you probably won&#x27;t like this either.</li>
            <li>This does get absorbed into to skin quickly and feels nice</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent and what I like is how quick it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>like they used a ton of cheap cologne from my grandpas medicine cabinet in the mixture.</li>
            <li>It provides you with a naturally fresh and healthy looking skin that is not oily or clammy.</li>
            <li>There is a fragrance free version which I use.</li>
            <li>B004D2DQCU Lubriderm Men&#x27;s 3-in-1 Lotion, Body, Face and Post-shave Lotion, Fragrance Free, 16  Ounce]]</li>
            <li>The smell of this lotion is like cheap aftershave multiplied by a factor of five.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions such as a rash that burns or itches.  </li>
            <li>This lotion applies smoothly and continues to feel moist on the skin for an extended period.  </li>
            <li>He also likes the texture, which is smooth, not greasy, and absorbs</li>
            <li>Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion, Fragrance Free, 20.3-Ounce Pump (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>After a couple of hours your hands still feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any product can completely eliminate winter itching, but this does a fairly good job of limiting that itchiness.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty awesome product for our dry winters.</li>
            <li>But right now, I&#x27;m just glad I get to use whatever face wash</li>
            <li>Vaseline seems to have a knack for being able to make skin care products that strike the right balance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I gave him this bottle of his very own manly scented lotion, I have noticed he is actually using it!  </li>
            <li>The masculine scent is nice however, it is strong and may turn some people off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick absorbing and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Since discovering this product I&#x27;m pleased that I am no longer supporting these overpriced products and their marketing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth and drys quickly without leaving your skin feeling greasy or nasty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s always been a concern, one that frankly has always been most effectively addressed by petroleum jelly or cocoa butter in areas that are not publicly visible.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not girly at all, and it works great on my really dry feet.  </li>
            <li>Love that it smells good, and does&#x27;t leave you greasy like other lotions.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able do prove that ir really works like it says it do.</li>
            <li>I have written to Lever for a catalogue of their full product line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve gone a full working day</li>
            <li>The price is fair considering how big the bottle is.</li>
            <li>, they work OK but really kept buying out of habit.  </li>
            <li>This is really a whole level better</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been regular users of Vaseline moisturizers in our home for several years, so I thought this new lotion directed towards men would be a nice variation on a product with which we&#x27;ve been very happy.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very masculine &amp; I think it is very strong.</li>
            <li>, the lotion works well and has a nice, mild masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer, but the smell is overwhelming strong and not a very good one at that.  </li>
            <li>The head of the pump is practical, you can get a fairly small amount with a gentle pump and you can rotate the head to fit whatever angle works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough you can use your own cologne.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>But the smell isn&#x27;t cloying and fades quickly, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It has proven to be effective with fast absorption, superior to the cocoa butter formulas I have been using most recently as well as the Lubiderm and Nivea products that are also languishing under the bathroom sink waiting for their respective calls to service.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get tacky or sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li>For the $6 I paid for a single bottle, I am pretty happy with this product</li>
            <li>, it is absorbed quickly, lasts a long time and smells good.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is absorbed quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since you can&#x27;t remove the scent from the lotion, I would recommend first testing it out before buying it!</li>
            <li>The lotion is going to smell different with each person mixing with their own scent.  </li>
            <li>I sing in my church choir and our director warns us not to wear powerful scents because some of the members have allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh 20.3oz (Pack of 3)]]],</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the Vaseline Aloe Fresh.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bother the more sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>He likes that it has a pump at the top instead of squeeze bottle action.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also has a nice generic scent.  </li>
            <li>this is going right in the trash</li>
            <li>He also said that it absorbs into his skin right away and makes his skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>Maybe right for someone, just not me.</li>
            <li>I guess they discovered that if you use the words \\&quot;balm\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; and put it in a small bottle like some kind of secrete potion they can get more for it.</li>
            <li>I think that term would be more appropriate - more like \\&quot;old aftershave\\&quot; rather than a \\&quot;little accident\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the very first pump, the consistency of the lotion was noticeably different than previously experienced with the same brand and line.</li>
            <li>this Vaseline is absorbed very fast, and stays on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>This product works well for light moisture but has a strong fragrance initially that appears to diminish to some degree !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough for most people</li>
            <li>there is not much more to say than great</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect is actually pretty good, but I can&#x27;t use this product anymore due to the smell problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion is thicker than the Nivea equivalent and doesn&#x27;t spread over the old visage quite as easily.</li>
            <li>I personally liked the fragrance of it, which didn&#x27;t last long but had a refreshing quality.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy/oily residue on your hands.</li>
            <li>I keep this at work, and it works very very well.</li>
            <li>but i must say it really feels unnatural!</li>
            <li>but more likely my skin type.</li>
            <li>Any of the standard Vaseline lotions will serve you better than this one.</li>
            <li>Kudos to Vaseline for providing the product in a larger size than most competitors and also for shaping the bottle</li>
            <li>After using this lotion it would probably be my first choice going forward.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s exactly what it does</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny cause</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly when it happened</li>
            <li>ingredients (claimed) good for nourishing sun and weather dried</li>
            <li>The lotion is light enough that it quickly absorbs into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine.</li>
            <li>moisturizes really well, which was a little surprising.</li>
            <li>Good enough that he likes them both for different reasons.  </li>
            <li>lotion is good, it gets absorbed quickly without leaving grease or leftovers behind.</li>
            <li>Vaseline Men and Body FACE lotion works so much better, last longer and really makes my face feel</li>
            <li>The lotion really drys very fast (about 3 seconds)</li>
            <li>20.3 ounce bottle is good sized and usually lasts me for months.</li>
            <li>I would like this product more if the scent was a bit more subtle.</li>
            <li>This Vaseline Men lotion works really well with a great subtle, but manly smell.</li>
            <li>but in the end had to tell her that it was not as nice as my previous moisturizer</li>
            <li>Personally, I like the way it moisturizes my skin, but unfortunately,I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product based on the strong scent.</li>
            <li>Not only is it objectionably strong, but it&#x27;s also quite feminine-smelling.  </li>
            <li>This 20plus ounce bottle is huge and will last you for a while.</li>
            <li>because like Vaseline&#x27;s fast absorbing lotion they would not leave my face greasy looking or feeling.</li>
            <li>Personally I really like the smell of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using some while at the store to see if you really like it.  </li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>It was time for a moisturizer and the Vaseline Fast Absorbing</li>
            <li>This will be very quick:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>husband also commented that he does not like to use it as a face cream so much.</li>
            <li>He really likes the silky feeling</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>and once it is rubbed in you really don&#x27;t feel it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle so when you put it on you face</li>
            <li>Too often skin lotions go on greasy and then sink in so fast</li>
            <li>It really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and didn&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li>I know smell is a very subjective thing</li>
            <li>and I agree that this is fast absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I tried Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and really like it.</li>
            <li>something the green kind never does.</li>
            <li>consistency also means easily washed away with water and doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long as the Lubriderm product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say that I have tried many other products before falling for this one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good in that it absorbs into the skin faster as they advertise on the label, but after about 5 hours I found I needed more lotion, so it appears that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as what I usually use.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The difference is no other lotion I possess has such a strong scent as the Vaseline fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I am a bit surprised that this is listed for men with what I consider to be such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Vaseline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s: Body and Face Lotion&amp;#34; is a nice solution to dry hands, especially for those of us who do a lot of weekend-house and yard cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>1 bottle down 2 more to go.</li>
            <li>And, that dry, ashy skin is smooth and somewhat softer.</li>
            <li>After i use this, my skins really become soft!</li>
            <li>It really works, you rub it in and you can turn doorknobs again almost right away instead of having to remember to leave the bathroom door open so you can get out.</li>
            <li>I really highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a good choice for dry skin, especially with facial hair.</li>
            <li>It does absorb very quickly though, so I imagine it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s moisturizing job through nanoospherical hydroglobules or some other made-up pseudoscientific gibberish.</li>
            <li>The product actually does what it says in that it is very fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>As advertised, it soaks in fast and keeps my hands and elbows soft and resilient for hours.</li>
            <li>leave the skin feeling soft and resilient with leaving much of an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy as advertised once absorbed, which only takes a minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could never get a lotion that would actuall get my hands to feel normal and not greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion is also too watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed deeply into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure does last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not the product for me because of the scent but it may be fine for other people.</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;nice masculine scent that has moderate strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband likes to take very hot showers, which leaves his skin dry, particularly in the winter.  </li>
            <li>but as long as you aren&#x27;t bathing in the lotion, the smell disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>that I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Adequate for moisturizing skin after long hours outdoors or after many performing many skin drying tasks such as repeated hand washing for disinfection at home or at work.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Revitalizing</li>
            <li>: Nothing is that bad about it, I&#x27;m sure higher end brands might do more justice to your skin</li>
            <li>consistency makes the lotion easy to spread over skin surfaces without feeling slightly greasy like the</li>
            <li>However, for me it just doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling smooth - it seems to absorb too much (is that possible).&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I was pleased that this morning I opened up the bathroom cabinet to find my better half had got bored with my whinging over the last week or so and had replaced the bottle with my tried and trusted Nivea for Men...</li>
            <li>There is a nice subtle fragrance that is not too floral or too \\&quot;manly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular user of Vaseline lotions -- the green kind with aloe is one of my favorites --</li>
            <li>Its a little greasy when first applied but quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose, so I often think scents are overpowering and cause nasal pain.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how well it will fair against the colder dry winters.</li>
            <li>Unlike other lotions that leave you feeling a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, this Vaseline product really does dry after so many seconds.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, though, and don&#x27;t enjoy a strong \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent in your everyday body lotion, stick with other options.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on it instantly gave me a head ache</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for the first time and it&#x27;s going to be the last time.</li>
            <li>first impression is that it&#x27;s thinner than the regular Vaseline Intensive lotion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gives me the same level of moisturizing as my Arbonne lotion, but it is also much cheaper!</li>
            <li>The first few days or weeks would be fine but sooner than later, my face would dry out tremendously.</li>
            <li>but it provides less lotion, doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long, and costs more than the unscented Lubriderm product I normally use.</li>
            <li>Boy was I wrong, not only does it have a smell of pine, but that smell is extremely strong and potent to the point that it&#x27;s unwearable.</li>
            <li>He really likes this lotion; it&#x27;s thin, not at all greasy or sticky &amp; is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>Other than the lack of the fresh man scent that my girlfriend likes, this lotion is exactly the same as the scented one.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the scent is very similar to Armani Code, a cologne I wear pretty regularly but in combination with other scents I may wear like Aramis or Burberry, this lotion is a non-starter.nt</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve used this lotion for only a couple of days but it seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>I bought the fragrance free this time around and am now missing the fragrance.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my natural scent,</li>
            <li>/&gt;&gt;Acceptable, piney, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until he returned home and began using his regular lotion that he realized how much he missed the Vaseline Men.  </li>
            <li>it is just a bit masculine.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion that would not affect my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I admit that I have have thought of Vaseline as on old fashioned product that&#x27;s been around forever.  </li>
            <li>so well I was surprised</li>
            <li>It dries to quickly and does not last long.</li>
            <li>We live in Northern Wisconsin and during the winter dry skin is a real issue.  </li>
            <li>This has a faint, pleasant odor that is masculine enough to convince guys</li>
            <li>I like the smell, which is a little strong if you use a lot of the lotion (and if you use it on your entire body, people will smell you comming).</li>
            <li>This lotion is a light enough scent that the scent is very noticeable to me, but not overpowering or painful like many lotions.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not unpleasant, just odd.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I found it didn&#x27;t provide significant moisture to my skin, though it did leave a powerful fragrance that was still very noticeable hours later.  </li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I expected it to.</li>
            <li>It really helps the dry skin he&#x27;s been getting this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a major issue with lotion absorbing slowly since I apply it right after a shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So Vaseline had a big hurdle to clear if they wanted to make an impression.  </li>
            <li>my 27 year old daughter actually likes the fragrance of this one also.  </li>
            <li>I have rather sensitive skin and non face specific lotions can cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it.</li>
            <li>Because it is designed for men, I highly recommend it for men who have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, the reasons I don&#x27;t like it as much - it has an odd fragrance, which others have unkindly described as \\&quot;old man\\&quot;, but, when I think about it there is something \\&quot;grandfatherly\\&quot; about the fragrance, so</li>
            <li>Does what every guy would want it to do: Gets rid of chapped hands quickly without leaving any shiny shimmer or slick feeling.  </li>
            <li>have very dry skin, and this leaves it very hydrated almost instantly after</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li>is very similar to Armani Code, a cologne I wear pretty regularly but in combination with other scents I may wear like Aramis or Burberry, this lotion is a non-starter.</li>
            <li>I dont think the smell is too strong or too weak.  </li>
            <li>He prefers the way Nivea feels going on and the way his skin feels for the first few hours after its application.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is easily absorbed into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling slick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as though I really needed to add another mundane step to my daily decision making process, with procurement of this variety of Vaseline lotion, now I have to decide what fragrance cologne I intend to wear before I</li>
            <li>It definitely cures dry skin and the smell is really not TOO intense -</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY STRONG PINE STENCH!!!!</li>
            <li> Vaseline Men is one of the best lotions I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed that Vaseline came out with a lotion that dries in about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> and I can say that it is the best i have ever used, the skin feels relieved when I apply it.</li>
            <li> My wonderful hubby uses lotion like women use perfume</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is the perfect moisturizer that also doubles as an aftershave.</li>

            <li> Happy with it.</li>

            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This lotion comes in a huge bottle and is a great bargain and is a perfect combination of moisturizer and cologne.</li>
            <li> but I want a skin moisturizer that has no scent or a very mild one at best.</li>
            <li> and I loved that</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even feel like you put on lotion after about 30 seconds which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vaseline Men Fast-drying because it smelled good in the bottle.  </li>

            <li> It works great not too much smell and best of all, no shimmer.</li>

            <li> Love that!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It is effective and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I have never had so many women ask me how I smell so good.  </li>
            <li> So when he tried this, he really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to scent my body, I&#x27;d buy Axe, and I just don&#x27;t expect this kind of thing from Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out, and found my hands and elbows feel nicely softened.  </li>
            <li> and he found he liked this product a lot.  </li>
            <li> It actually is nice and not over powering.  </li>
            <li> Works great for moisturization, has a great manly scent and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant, does not overpower, and is suitable for males and females, but like any scented product may conflict with most women&#x27;s perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Nice lotion, Has a pleasant scent and rubs in just fine...</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a very good buy, dries fast</li>
            <li> In 1 Moisturizer Body, Face and Hands, 13.5 Ounce]] (reviewed here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELTMVCRRZA5I/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B007PWRXHO&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty) for just over a year, at the behest of my beloved, this was purchased for me by said light of my life as an alternative product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering - it won&#x27;t replace your cologne, but it does smell good and you can smell it lightly on your skin for a while after you apply</li>
            <li> Plus it smells pretty good too, and the container is huge--a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant cucumber smell that quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very light, it does not bother me and my wife likes.</li>
            <li> but the feeling is very light.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this lotion as it absorbs fast and leaves a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> it smells nice, but it is almost too strong IMO.  </li>
            <li> I dont get that sticky feeling you get from most lotions.  </li>
            <li> I personally love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although, the skin becomes smooth!</li>
            <li> Although I am not affected by the scent, many women, including my wife and coworkers cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Is ok, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It is okay for him because he doesn&#x27;t wear any cologne, but if you do you might want something that is scent-free.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to give this Vaseline Body and Face Lotion for Men</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t like to use the lotions that I have because they have a more feminine smell.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply it more often than I want to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Most of us don&#x27;t want to smell like girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Vaseline</li>
            <li> I understand that they&#x27;re directing this one towards men, and that it can be used on the face after shaving, but a more low-key smell would have been a better</li>
            <li> This seems more like a cologne to</li>
            <li> I decided to try this more on a whim than anything else.  </li>
            <li> more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love it regardless.</li>
            <li> If you continue using it, leaving about 2 or 3 hours in between usage, your hands quickly become very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try the kind specially formulated for guys.</li>
            <li> If you want VERY light moisturizing and you like a strong scent, you might like this product.  </li>
            <li> The Vaseline men&#x27;s skin care lotion is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good body lotion/moisturizer, but apparently there are not too many good choices currently available for men.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, non greasy feeling and absorbs quickly making skin feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly and feel nice.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li> really like the refreshing scent and good skin moisturizing of this Vaseline lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion smells very earthy and musky, in a pleasant way, and not too strong.</li>
            <li> far the lotion has been great in the spring time.  </li>
            <li> Even for the areas that will get you a citation for indecent exposure, if I didn&#x27;t want to slide off the sheets or leave a grease slick worthy of a sequel to Coming to America, and I have sampled just about anything that claimed to be a good moisturizer with rapid absorption, the best options have been Lubiderm or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also ergonomically designed for easy gripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of them and this one is no exception, does much for the sandpaper heel syndrome, as an old school application of copious amounts of petroleum jelly is the thing that works best for me..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a rather strong perfume scent which people may or may not like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For me, this lotion is too watery and the scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li> Smell is just waaaaaaaay too strong for any man to wear all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said that it&#x27;s not too strong to it doesn&#x27;t interfere with his after shave cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel greasy like some of the lotions that I have in the house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, but the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the scent was was too strong.  </li>
            <li> you like the strong scent, then this will probably appeal as a four-or-five star product for you.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it too strong.</li>
            <li> but it has a strong cologne like scent that had me washing my hands after I used it.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, too, but she  thinks it is  strong.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels fine going on and keeps your skin sufficiently hydrated.</li>
            <li> but I always find these too strong - if you seek out scent free products as I do, you probably won&#x27;t like this either.</li>
            <li> This does get absorbed into to skin quickly and feels nice</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent and what I like is how quick it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> like they used a ton of cheap cologne from my grandpas medicine cabinet in the mixture.</li>
            <li> It provides you with a naturally fresh and healthy looking skin that is not oily or clammy.</li>
            <li> There is a fragrance free version which I use.</li>
            <li> B004D2DQCU Lubriderm Men&#x27;s 3-in-1 Lotion, Body, Face and Post-shave Lotion, Fragrance Free, 16  Ounce]]</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is like cheap aftershave multiplied by a factor of five.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions such as a rash that burns or itches.  </li>
            <li> This lotion applies smoothly and continues to feel moist on the skin for an extended period.  </li>
            <li> He also likes the texture, which is smooth, not greasy, and absorbs</li>
            <li> Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion, Fragrance Free, 20.3-Ounce Pump (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> After a couple of hours your hands still feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any product can completely eliminate winter itching, but this does a fairly good job of limiting that itchiness.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty awesome product for our dry winters.</li>
            <li> But right now, I&#x27;m just glad I get to use whatever face wash</li>
            <li> Vaseline seems to have a knack for being able to make skin care products that strike the right balance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I gave him this bottle of his very own manly scented lotion, I have noticed he is actually using it!  </li>
            <li> The masculine scent is nice however, it is strong and may turn some people off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick absorbing and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Since discovering this product I&#x27;m pleased that I am no longer supporting these overpriced products and their marketing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth and drys quickly without leaving your skin feeling greasy or nasty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s always been a concern, one that frankly has always been most effectively addressed by petroleum jelly or cocoa butter in areas that are not publicly visible.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not girly at all, and it works great on my really dry feet.  </li>
            <li> Love that it smells good, and does&#x27;t leave you greasy like other lotions.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able do prove that ir really works like it says it do.</li>
            <li> I have written to Lever for a catalogue of their full product line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is true</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gone a full working day</li>
            <li> The price is fair considering how big the bottle is.</li>
            <li> , they work OK but really kept buying out of habit.  </li>
            <li> This is really a whole level better</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been regular users of Vaseline moisturizers in our home for several years, so I thought this new lotion directed towards men would be a nice variation on a product with which we&#x27;ve been very happy.  </li>
            <li> the scent is very masculine &amp; I think it is very strong.</li>
            <li> , the lotion works well and has a nice, mild masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, but the smell is overwhelming strong and not a very good one at that.  </li>
            <li> The head of the pump is practical, you can get a fairly small amount with a gentle pump and you can rotate the head to fit whatever angle works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light enough you can use your own cologne.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> But the smell isn&#x27;t cloying and fades quickly, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It has proven to be effective with fast absorption, superior to the cocoa butter formulas I have been using most recently as well as the Lubiderm and Nivea products that are also languishing under the bathroom sink waiting for their respective calls to service.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get tacky or sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li> For the $6 I paid for a single bottle, I am pretty happy with this product</li>
            <li> , it is absorbed quickly, lasts a long time and smells good.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is absorbed quickly into the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since you can&#x27;t remove the scent from the lotion, I would recommend first testing it out before buying it!</li>
            <li> The lotion is going to smell different with each person mixing with their own scent.  </li>
            <li> I sing in my church choir and our director warns us not to wear powerful scents because some of the members have allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh 20.3oz (Pack of 3)]]],</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the Vaseline Aloe Fresh.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bother the more sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> He likes that it has a pump at the top instead of squeeze bottle action.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also has a nice generic scent.  </li>
            <li> this is going right in the trash</li>
            <li> He also said that it absorbs into his skin right away and makes his skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> Maybe right for someone, just not me.</li>
            <li> I guess they discovered that if you use the words \\&quot;balm\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; and put it in a small bottle like some kind of secrete potion they can get more for it.</li>
            <li> I think that term would be more appropriate - more like \\&quot;old aftershave\\&quot; rather than a \\&quot;little accident\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the very first pump, the consistency of the lotion was noticeably different than previously experienced with the same brand and line.</li>
            <li> this Vaseline is absorbed very fast, and stays on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> This product works well for light moisture but has a strong fragrance initially that appears to diminish to some degree !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough for most people</li>
            <li> there is not much more to say than great</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect is actually pretty good, but I can&#x27;t use this product anymore due to the smell problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion is thicker than the Nivea equivalent and doesn&#x27;t spread over the old visage quite as easily.</li>
            <li> I personally liked the fragrance of it, which didn&#x27;t last long but had a refreshing quality.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy/oily residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> I keep this at work, and it works very very well.</li>
            <li> but i must say it really feels unnatural!</li>
            <li> but more likely my skin type.</li>
            <li> Any of the standard Vaseline lotions will serve you better than this one.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Vaseline for providing the product in a larger size than most competitors and also for shaping the bottle</li>
            <li> After using this lotion it would probably be my first choice going forward.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s exactly what it does</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny cause</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly when it happened</li>
            <li> ingredients (claimed) good for nourishing sun and weather dried</li>
            <li> The lotion is light enough that it quickly absorbs into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine.</li>
            <li> moisturizes really well, which was a little surprising.</li>
            <li> Good enough that he likes them both for different reasons.  </li>
            <li> lotion is good, it gets absorbed quickly without leaving grease or leftovers behind.</li>
            <li> Vaseline Men and Body FACE lotion works so much better, last longer and really makes my face feel</li>
            <li> The lotion really drys very fast (about 3 seconds)</li>
            <li> 20.3 ounce bottle is good sized and usually lasts me for months.</li>
            <li> I would like this product more if the scent was a bit more subtle.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Men lotion works really well with a great subtle, but manly smell.</li>
            <li> but in the end had to tell her that it was not as nice as my previous moisturizer</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the way it moisturizes my skin, but unfortunately,I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product based on the strong scent.</li>
            <li> Not only is it objectionably strong, but it&#x27;s also quite feminine-smelling.  </li>
            <li> This 20plus ounce bottle is huge and will last you for a while.</li>
            <li> because like Vaseline&#x27;s fast absorbing lotion they would not leave my face greasy looking or feeling.</li>
            <li> Personally I really like the smell of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using some while at the store to see if you really like it.  </li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> It was time for a moisturizer and the Vaseline Fast Absorbing</li>
            <li> This will be very quick:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> husband also commented that he does not like to use it as a face cream so much.</li>
            <li> He really likes the silky feeling</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> and once it is rubbed in you really don&#x27;t feel it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle so when you put it on you face</li>
            <li> Too often skin lotions go on greasy and then sink in so fast</li>
            <li> It really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and didn&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li> I know smell is a very subjective thing</li>
            <li> and I agree that this is fast absorbing.  </li>
            <li> I tried Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and really like it.</li>
            <li> something the green kind never does.</li>
            <li> consistency also means easily washed away with water and doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long as the Lubriderm product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say that I have tried many other products before falling for this one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good in that it absorbs into the skin faster as they advertise on the label, but after about 5 hours I found I needed more lotion, so it appears that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as what I usually use.  </li>
            <li> &quot; The difference is no other lotion I possess has such a strong scent as the Vaseline fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I am a bit surprised that this is listed for men with what I consider to be such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Vaseline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s: Body and Face Lotion&amp;#34; is a nice solution to dry hands, especially for those of us who do a lot of weekend-house and yard cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1 bottle down 2 more to go.</li>
            <li> And, that dry, ashy skin is smooth and somewhat softer.</li>
            <li> After i use this, my skins really become soft!</li>
            <li> It really works, you rub it in and you can turn doorknobs again almost right away instead of having to remember to leave the bathroom door open so you can get out.</li>
            <li> I really highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a good choice for dry skin, especially with facial hair.</li>
            <li> It does absorb very quickly though, so I imagine it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s moisturizing job through nanoospherical hydroglobules or some other made-up pseudoscientific gibberish.</li>
            <li> The product actually does what it says in that it is very fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> As advertised, it soaks in fast and keeps my hands and elbows soft and resilient for hours.</li>
            <li> leave the skin feeling soft and resilient with leaving much of an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy as advertised once absorbed, which only takes a minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could never get a lotion that would actuall get my hands to feel normal and not greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion is also too watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed deeply into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure does last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not the product for me because of the scent but it may be fine for other people.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;nice masculine scent that has moderate strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband likes to take very hot showers, which leaves his skin dry, particularly in the winter.  </li>
            <li> but as long as you aren&#x27;t bathing in the lotion, the smell disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> that I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Adequate for moisturizing skin after long hours outdoors or after many performing many skin drying tasks such as repeated hand washing for disinfection at home or at work.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Revitalizing</li>
            <li> : Nothing is that bad about it, I&#x27;m sure higher end brands might do more justice to your skin</li>
            <li> consistency makes the lotion easy to spread over skin surfaces without feeling slightly greasy like the</li>
            <li> However, for me it just doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling smooth - it seems to absorb too much (is that possible).&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I was pleased that this morning I opened up the bathroom cabinet to find my better half had got bored with my whinging over the last week or so and had replaced the bottle with my tried and trusted Nivea for Men...</li>
            <li> There is a nice subtle fragrance that is not too floral or too \\&quot;manly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Vaseline lotions -- the green kind with aloe is one of my favorites --</li>
            <li> Its a little greasy when first applied but quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose, so I often think scents are overpowering and cause nasal pain.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it will fair against the colder dry winters.</li>
            <li> Unlike other lotions that leave you feeling a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, this Vaseline product really does dry after so many seconds.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, though, and don&#x27;t enjoy a strong \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent in your everyday body lotion, stick with other options.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it instantly gave me a head ache</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for the first time and it&#x27;s going to be the last time.</li>
            <li> first impression is that it&#x27;s thinner than the regular Vaseline Intensive lotion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gives me the same level of moisturizing as my Arbonne lotion, but it is also much cheaper!</li>
            <li> The first few days or weeks would be fine but sooner than later, my face would dry out tremendously.</li>
            <li> but it provides less lotion, doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long, and costs more than the unscented Lubriderm product I normally use.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong, not only does it have a smell of pine, but that smell is extremely strong and potent to the point that it&#x27;s unwearable.</li>
            <li> He really likes this lotion; it&#x27;s thin, not at all greasy or sticky &amp; is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> Other than the lack of the fresh man scent that my girlfriend likes, this lotion is exactly the same as the scented one.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the scent is very similar to Armani Code, a cologne I wear pretty regularly but in combination with other scents I may wear like Aramis or Burberry, this lotion is a non-starter.nt</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve used this lotion for only a couple of days but it seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> I bought the fragrance free this time around and am now missing the fragrance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my natural scent,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&gt;Acceptable, piney, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until he returned home and began using his regular lotion that he realized how much he missed the Vaseline Men.  </li>
            <li> it is just a bit masculine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion that would not affect my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit that I have have thought of Vaseline as on old fashioned product that&#x27;s been around forever.  </li>
            <li> so well I was surprised</li>
            <li> It dries to quickly and does not last long.</li>
            <li> We live in Northern Wisconsin and during the winter dry skin is a real issue.  </li>
            <li> This has a faint, pleasant odor that is masculine enough to convince guys</li>
            <li> I like the smell, which is a little strong if you use a lot of the lotion (and if you use it on your entire body, people will smell you comming).</li>
            <li> This lotion is a light enough scent that the scent is very noticeable to me, but not overpowering or painful like many lotions.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not unpleasant, just odd.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found it didn&#x27;t provide significant moisture to my skin, though it did leave a powerful fragrance that was still very noticeable hours later.  </li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It really helps the dry skin he&#x27;s been getting this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a major issue with lotion absorbing slowly since I apply it right after a shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So Vaseline had a big hurdle to clear if they wanted to make an impression.  </li>
            <li> my 27 year old daughter actually likes the fragrance of this one also.  </li>
            <li> I have rather sensitive skin and non face specific lotions can cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it.</li>
            <li> Because it is designed for men, I highly recommend it for men who have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, the reasons I don&#x27;t like it as much - it has an odd fragrance, which others have unkindly described as \\&quot;old man\\&quot;, but, when I think about it there is something \\&quot;grandfatherly\\&quot; about the fragrance, so</li>
            <li> Does what every guy would want it to do: Gets rid of chapped hands quickly without leaving any shiny shimmer or slick feeling.  </li>
            <li> have very dry skin, and this leaves it very hydrated almost instantly after</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> is very similar to Armani Code, a cologne I wear pretty regularly but in combination with other scents I may wear like Aramis or Burberry, this lotion is a non-starter.</li>
            <li> I dont think the smell is too strong or too weak.  </li>
            <li> He prefers the way Nivea feels going on and the way his skin feels for the first few hours after its application.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is easily absorbed into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling slick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as though I really needed to add another mundane step to my daily decision making process, with procurement of this variety of Vaseline lotion, now I have to decide what fragrance cologne I intend to wear before I</li>
            <li> It definitely cures dry skin and the smell is really not TOO intense -</li>
            <li> I hate walking into the health and beauty section of my local grocery or department store and selecting a bottle of lotion that has lots of dainty flowers and other feminine designs on it.  </li>
            <li> summerize, this works very, very well both for just plain dry skin and for people with skin/facial conditions or problems.  </li>
            <li> The smell is manly, a little sweet, and a little musky.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself is almost solid black, giving it a masculine appearance.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not that big a deal to me as the smell doesn&#x27;t linger for long.</li>
            <li> If you want yourself and your home and everything you come into contact with to smell like a chemical toilet, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the scents were never very masculine.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin I was a little worried about a lotion that claimed could be used on the body and face.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know how I feel about that since it was probably the only area where I previously had the upper hand.</li>
            <li> I got this for use after showers since swimming has started to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Bye bye dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effectiveness - Go ahead, use the face wash you want because after applying this lotion to your face, it will no longer dry out.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion because I was looking for something that cured my winter-related dry skin, didn&#x27;t leave me smelling like flowers, and was not greasy.</li>
            <li> I tend to get dry skin in the winter and therefor apply lotion throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and my skin started to get dry and itchy in the winter.</li>
            <li> after showering or when my skin feels dry.  </li>
            <li> My husband says it keeps his dry skin moisturized all</li>
            <li> Its white, creamy lotion has a slight scent that is not flowery or cloying.  </li>
            <li> This results in his skin occasionally getting painfully dry, at which point he gives in and has to use my heavy duty</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bumped it down one star as the actual moisturizing effects is below a lot of other products on the market.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would of liked to have a little SPF, because I have to put lotion on, then sun screen (which always smells like crap).  </li>
            <li> The lotion&#x27;s scent is OVERWHELMING (in a bad way).  </li>
            <li> on my husband, that is, not really for myself.  </li>
            <li> My doctor told me I have to shave my beard and that growing back my beard would be painful and super itchy and may cause the problem to reappear.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to grip, has a stable base, and a traditional pump dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can almost not stand it (still) due to the strength of the smell.  </li>
            <li> In any case, this is a small price to pay for a product that actually seems to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted smell is subjective, but the smell is at the \\&quot;quality level\\&quot; of things like Axe and other over-saturated \\&quot;extreeeeme</li>
            <li> Because even if you like the smell, it may annoy other people around you.</li>
            <li> a test, I used this product on my left side this morning and my usual lotion on my right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does feel thinner than other lotions I use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few minutes, you can still feel the effects, but the look and feel of dry skin is gone.</li>
            <li> it really gives u a weird feeling.</li>
            <li> ride my motorcycle every day to university, and usually I feel very uncomfortable of using some lotions shortly after putting my helmet on because they don&#x27;t dry fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> Usually we buy lotions that say they are for dry/extremely dry skin, but this worked.</li>
            <li> I applied some to my hands a half hour ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s charm is that hidden revitalizing quality that makes you feel protected by two skins.</li>
            <li> I also notice that my face looks and feels less oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> A half hour after my husband applies it</li>
            <li> I typically use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is not greasy, and does absorb quickly, but the scent is horrible and not subtle - a mixture of skunk and leather.</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion itself can have a strong, flowery smell that can be quite annoying.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes use a little with my aftershave if my razor decided I needed to be roughed up a little</li>
            <li> The sent is a little heavy but the lotion works well.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again due to the fragrance !!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty unpleasant burn at that.  </li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday.</li>
            <li> Its green bottle, printed with a few leaves from the Aloe vera plant, is about as unisexual a design as you can find.  </li>
            <li> everyday lotion for hands and body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband uses this lotion everyday.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a sort of almost satiny residue on your hands for a few minutes after use though-</li>
            <li> In the past I used Nivea Shaving Balm right after shaving but it smells bad, cost a lot</li>
            <li> I got this lotion for my teenage son because we have had a horribly cold winter here, and he has been complaining about having dry skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less expensive than purchasing at the local Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> I put a small amount on at night and had to get up around midnight to wash it off my face</li>
            <li> All is said in the title, don&#x27;t waste your money on this!  </li>
            <li> My husband usually uses Nivea for men maximum hydration lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I usually buy the scented ones...</li>
            <li> /&gt;With just a small, perhaps a quarter-size squeeze</li>
            <li> the past I&#x27;ve used Lubriderm and Gold Bond</li>
            <li> It works well for dry skin, and dries faster than other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  </li>
            <li> - Some people will find this the biggest complaint because I have to agree, the lotion does smell like &amp;#34;old people&amp;#34; cologne or something.</li>
            <li> At least for me it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> For example, I put it on my elbows in the morning, and the smell is still there in the late afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had a complaint about the scent being too</li>
            <li> or at least feels like a greasy, oily feeling to your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to thick and doesn&#x27;t make his face greasy.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s face wash, so</li>
            <li> I wrongly assumed that because this was a mens lotion it wouldn&#x27;t have a smell at all, or at least not a strong one.</li>
            <li> It actually doesn&#x27;t smell to bad either.</li>
            <li> This is a confused product.</li>
            <li> My motivation for writing this comment is from being frustrated with having to spend ~$6 for a small bottle for after shave balms (Nivea, Loreal, Gillette)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made my skin break out,</li>
            <li> I have observed a gradual improvement from the painful dryness he had started with.  </li>

            <li> The lotion&#x27;s scent is OVERWHELMING (in a bad way).  I applied some to my hands a half hour ago and I can almost not stand it (still) due to the strength of the smell.  The moisturizing effect is actually pretty good, but I can&#x27;t use this product anymore due to the smell problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and I love the cedar smell. As advertised, it soaks in fast and keeps my hands and elbows soft and resilient for hours. Reapply after you wash your hands to prevent chapping. An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this stuff. My motivation for writing this comment is from being frustrated with having to spend ~$6 for a small bottle for after shave balms (Nivea, Loreal, Gillette) because like Vaseline&#x27;s fast absorbing lotion they would not leave my face greasy looking or feeling. Since discovering this product I&#x27;m pleased that I am no longer supporting these overpriced products and their marketing. I guess they discovered that if you use the words \\&quot;balm\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; and put it in a small bottle like some kind of secrete potion they can get more for it. I also  never used a hand lotion on a regular basis for the same greasy reason until now. The scent is very light, it does not bother me and my wife likes. It&#x27;s also light enough you can use your own cologne.</li>
            <li> I got this for use after showers since swimming has started to dry out my skin.  It works great not too much smell and best of all, no shimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, but the smell is overwhelming strong and not a very good one at that.  I used once and threw it away.  Vaseline should try to make this unscented.  I have never had a lotion smell like a bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li> I used this once and never will again. I put a small amount on at night and had to get up around midnight to wash it off my face I changed my pillow slip and my bed still smells.   Its like they used a ton of cheap cologne from my grandpas medicine cabinet in the mixture. I can see a hint of smell in a lotion but not this!!!</li>
            <li> Personally I really like the smell of the lotion.  The lotion is going to smell different with each person mixing with their own scent.  I would recommend using some while at the store to see if you really like it.  I dont think the smell is too strong or too weak.  The smell is manly, a little sweet, and a little musky.  Another great feature of this product is after it dries I dont get that sticky feeling you get from most lotions.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I would of liked to have a little SPF, because I have to put lotion on, then sun screen (which always smells like crap).  That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m usually outside.  Overall I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is very good, though it is not for everyone. I personally love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, and this leaves it very hydrated almost instantly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ride my motorcycle every day to university, and usually I feel very uncomfortable of using some lotions shortly after putting my helmet on because they don&#x27;t dry fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;However this Vaseline is absorbed very fast, and stays on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Vaseling Aloe with Cucumber and I loved that but I finally ran out so I decided to try this variety.&lt;br /&gt;And....I&#x27;m just as pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and drys quickly without leaving your skin feeling greasy or nasty.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a rather strong perfume scent which people may or may not like.&lt;br /&gt;I rather like it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for winter dryness if used daily.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday. Everytime I wash my hands I use it. After shower, I put it on my back. keeps my skin from cracking.</li>
            <li> After i use this, my skins really become soft! but i must say it really feels unnatural! it really gives u a weird feeling. Although, the skin becomes smooth!</li>
            <li> All is said in the title, don&#x27;t waste your money on this!  I keep trying to wash the scent off my body with soap and water I can&#x27;t get it to go away!  When I first put it on it instantly gave me a head ache this is going right in the trash</li>
            <li> Does what every guy would want it to do: Gets rid of chapped hands quickly without leaving any shiny shimmer or slick feeling.  It does have an aftershave type of scent, but that seems to be a personal preference (some like it, some don&#x27;t) but as long as you aren&#x27;t bathing in the lotion, the smell disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works well for light moisture but has a strong fragrance initially that appears to diminish to some degree !! I would not purchase again due to the fragrance !!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and non-greasy. Doesn&#x27;t even feel like you put on lotion after about 30 seconds which is a good thing. The masculine scent is nice however, it is strong and may turn some people off. I would like this product more if the scent was a bit more subtle.</li>
            <li> I used to use fragrance-free Lubriderm but then they \\&quot;improved\\&quot; the formula.  I bought the Vaseline Men Fast-drying because it smelled good in the bottle.  Unfortunately, I found it didn&#x27;t provide significant moisture to my skin, though it did leave a powerful fragrance that was still very noticeable hours later.  For me, this lotion is too watery and the scent is too strong.  If I used enough to actually moisturize, I would smell like a perfume factory.    If you want VERY light moisturizing and you like a strong scent, you might like this product.  Otherwise try something else.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy/oily residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good body lotion/moisturizer, but apparently there are not too many good choices currently available for men. Decided to give Vaseline a try after reading the reviews. Personally, I like the way it moisturizes my skin, but unfortunately,I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product based on the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this lotion as it absorbs fast and leaves a very pleasant scent. I use it twice daily and it&#x27;s especially soothing after shaving.</li>
            <li> Good lotion. I personally liked the fragrance of it, which didn&#x27;t last long but had a refreshing quality. I bought the fragrance free this time around and am now missing the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My husband actually remembers to put this on after showers. It&#x27;s not to thick and doesn&#x27;t make his face greasy. This lotion is a good choice for dry skin, especially with facial hair.</li>
            <li> This lotion works fairly well on my hands at arm. I keep it at my desk at work and use a bit after washing my hands.  I have a very sensitive nose, so I often think scents are overpowering and cause nasal pain.  This lotion is a light enough scent that the scent is very noticeable to me, but not overpowering or painful like many lotions. The scent smells great. It is non-greasy as advertised once absorbed, which only takes a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bumped it down one star as the actual moisturizing effects is below a lot of other products on the market. For the $6 I paid for a single bottle, I am pretty happy with this product</li>
            <li> Bye bye dry skin. Bye bye that oily look. Believe me when I say that I have tried many other products before falling for this one. It provides you with a naturally fresh and healthy looking skin that is not oily or clammy. Even when you sweat you cannot sweat it. I know that I can&#x27;t get enough of it. It&#x27;s charm is that hidden revitalizing quality that makes you feel protected by two skins. That is yours and yours again every day.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Good lotion and smells good.  It does not make you feel sticky after use.</li>
            <li> The good:  It works well for dry skin, and dries faster than other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  Although I am not affected by the scent, many women, including my wife and coworkers cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li> After using a Nivea product [[ASIN:B007PWRXHO Nivea For Men Maximum Hydration 3 In 1 Moisturizer Body, Face and Hands, 13.5 Ounce]] (reviewed here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELTMVCRRZA5I/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B007PWRXHO&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty) for just over a year, at the behest of my beloved, this was purchased for me by said light of my life as an alternative product. Believe me, I tried to like this lotion but in the end had to tell her that it was not as nice as my previous moisturizer (Jeez, I cannot believe this phrase would have even crossed my lips a year ago - what on earth is happening to my masculinity?). Anyhow, the reasons I don&#x27;t like it as much - it has an odd fragrance, which others have unkindly described as \\&quot;old man\\&quot;, but, when I think about it there is something \\&quot;grandfatherly\\&quot; about the fragrance, so I think that term would be more appropriate - more like \\&quot;old aftershave\\&quot; rather than a \\&quot;little accident\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is thicker than the Nivea equivalent and doesn&#x27;t spread over the old visage quite as easily. It does absorb very quickly though, so I imagine it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s moisturizing job through nanoospherical hydroglobules or some other made-up pseudoscientific gibberish. However, for me it just doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling smooth - it seems to absorb too much (is that possible).&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I was pleased that this morning I opened up the bathroom cabinet to find my better half had got bored with my whinging over the last week or so and had replaced the bottle with my tried and trusted Nivea for Men...</li>
            <li> Very good product. It smells great and moisturizes to a degree. Haven&#x27;t been able do prove that ir really works like it says it do.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> This is not greasy, and does absorb quickly, but the scent is horrible and not subtle - a mixture of skunk and leather.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a related product, but happened upon this one...being specifically tailored to men, I was sold.  It is effective and inexpensive.  I have written to Lever for a catalogue of their full product line.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself constantly buying different face washes because the one you use keeps &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; out your face, then do yourself a favor and get yourself a moisturizer! It hasn&#x27;t occurred to me that up until now, it wasn&#x27;t the various face washes at fault but more likely my skin type. The first few days or weeks would be fine but sooner than later, my face would dry out tremendously. I have had enough. It was time for a moisturizer and the Vaseline Fast Absorbing is the one I chose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness - Go ahead, use the face wash you want because after applying this lotion to your face, it will no longer dry out. The product actually does what it says in that it is very fast absorbing. Unlike other lotions that leave you feeling a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, this Vaseline product really does dry after so many seconds. You&#x27;ll obviously still notice that its on your face but the feeling is very light. The lotion claims to protect you for 24 hours. I don&#x27;t know if this is true but I&#x27;ve gone a full working day and my face felt equally protected. I also notice that my face looks and feels less oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell - Some people will find this the biggest complaint because I have to agree, the lotion does smell like &amp;#34;old people&amp;#34; cologne or something. However, it is not that big a deal to me as the smell doesn&#x27;t linger for long. At least for me it didn&#x27;t. In any case, this is a small price to pay for a product that actually seems to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve used this lotion for only a couple of days but it seems to do the job very well. The price is fair considering how big the bottle is. But right now, I&#x27;m just glad I get to use whatever face wash I want knowing that this lotion will help prevent the dryness afterwards!</li>
            <li> Is ok, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> By the brand being Vaseline you would think it was a great product but its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smell is just waaaaaaaay too strong for any man to wear all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lotion does nothing but absorb rather than moisturize and tackle dryness as stated on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I been using it for a while, I will stick to it! it´s great and works excellent!  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I keep this at work, and it works very very well. It actually doesn&#x27;t smell to bad either. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> If you want yourself and your home and everything you come into contact with to smell like a chemical toilet, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not, you&#x27;ll probably want to go with the unscented variety.</li>
            <li> there is not much more to say than great it works for me as need it</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I expected it to. Good news for those that dislike the scented version! There is a fragrance free version which I use.</li>
            <li> This will be very quick:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes and smells great.  I have never had so many women ask me how I smell so good.  Of course, I tell them it&#x27;s my natural scent, but in reality I owe it all to this lotion.  Good stuff, good price, works.  period.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and like the smell for men.  Will buy it again in the future.  Happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion has a very strong scent.  Granted it smells nice, but it is almost too strong IMO.  A half hour after my husband applies it I can still smell it on him like he just applied.  It is okay for him because he doesn&#x27;t wear any cologne, but if you do you might want something that is scent-free.  It does provide good moisturization for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also commented that he does not like to use it as a face cream so much.</li>
            <li> My husband usually uses Nivea for men maximum hydration lotion.  He really likes the silky feeling it gives his skin.  So Vaseline had a big hurdle to clear if they wanted to make an impression.  The final verdict?  The Vaseline men&#x27;s skin care lotion is pretty good.  Good enough that he likes them both for different reasons.  He prefers the way Nivea feels going on and the way his skin feels for the first few hours after its application.  But he prefers the way his skin feels five plus hours later with the Vaseline lotion.  He has no preference with the scents.  His solution is to alternate between the two.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is well known for their skin care products.  I was glad to give this Vaseline Body and Face Lotion for Men a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Well designed container that&#x27;s easy to grip, has a stable base, and a traditional pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Acceptable, piney, masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Light consistency makes the lotion easy to spread over skin surfaces without feeling slightly greasy like the [[ASIN:B004D2DQCU Lubriderm Men&#x27;s 3-in-1 Lotion, Body, Face and Post-shave Lotion, Fragrance Free, 16  Ounce]] that I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Adequate for moisturizing skin after long hours outdoors or after many performing many skin drying tasks such as repeated hand washing for disinfection at home or at work.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Revitalizing ingredients (claimed) good for nourishing sun and weather dried skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Lighter consistency also means easily washed away with water and doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long as the Lubriderm product.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;I still prefer unscented over perfumy lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;This Vaseline lotion (20.3oz) costs almost double the price of the Lubriderm (24oz) product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I really like the refreshing scent and good skin moisturizing of this Vaseline lotion but it provides less lotion, doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long, and costs more than the unscented Lubriderm product I normally use.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion for my teenage son because we have had a horribly cold winter here, and he has been complaining about having dry skin. He doesn&#x27;t like to use the lotions that I have because they have a more feminine smell. So when he tried this, he really liked the fragrance. He said that it&#x27;s not too strong to it doesn&#x27;t interfere with his after shave cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel greasy like some of the lotions that I have in the house. He also said that it absorbs into his skin right away and makes his skin feel softer. I will continue to buy this for him from now on.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY STRONG PINE STENCH!!!! I wrongly assumed that because this was a mens lotion it wouldn&#x27;t have a smell at all, or at least not a strong one. Boy was I wrong, not only does it have a smell of pine, but that smell is extremely strong and potent to the point that it&#x27;s unwearable.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for the first time and it&#x27;s going to be the last time. The smell of this lotion is like cheap aftershave multiplied by a factor of five. I can&#x27;t apply it without holding my breath. Any of the standard Vaseline lotions will serve you better than this one.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Vaseline lotions but this one only has one drawback for me. It dries to quickly and does not last long. I have to reapply it more often than I want to. Maybe right for someone, just not me.</li>
            <li> Now we have Vaseline body &amp; face lotion for men!  This is a good thing...my hubby has been using my Vaseline lotions for years...and I usually buy the scented ones...the scents were never very masculine. I can&#x27;t say the same thing for Vaseline Men Body &amp; Face Lotion..the scent is very masculine &amp; I think it is very strong. My hubby has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease which affects his smell, so he&#x27;s not bothered by it. He really likes this lotion; it&#x27;s thin, not at all greasy or sticky &amp; is absorbed quickly.  It really helps the dry skin he&#x27;s been getting this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, but the scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> This is a confused product. It is both a moisturizing lotion and a fragrance! But nothing on the box and packaging and product name suggests that the lotion is also a fragrance. An annoying one at that. And it has staying power. For example, I put it on my elbows in the morning, and the smell is still there in the late afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted smell is subjective, but the smell is at the \\&quot;quality level\\&quot; of things like Axe and other over-saturated \\&quot;extreeeeme man\\&quot; colognes. Annoying smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is good, it gets absorbed quickly without leaving grease or leftovers behind. The package is around 20 ounces, that&#x27;s good quantity. The head of the pump is practical, you can get a fairly small amount with a gentle pump and you can rotate the head to fit whatever angle works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you can&#x27;t remove the scent from the lotion, I would recommend first testing it out before buying it! Because even if you like the smell, it may annoy other people around you.</li>
            <li> The lotion really drys very fast (about 3 seconds) the scent its also great...&lt;br /&gt;would recomend it, and buy it again</li>
            <li> In order to keep my skin from drying out, especially during the winter months, I generously apply a lotion all over my body and face after taking a shower.  I hate walking into the health and beauty section of my local grocery or department store and selecting a bottle of lotion that has lots of dainty flowers and other feminine designs on it.  Also, the lotion itself can have a strong, flowery smell that can be quite annoying.  I sing in my church choir and our director warns us not to wear powerful scents because some of the members have allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Lately, I have been using Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh [[[ASIN:B001ECQ4JE Vaseline Body Lotion, Aloe Fresh 20.3oz (Pack of 3)]]], because it contains aloe that heals and rejuvenates the skin.  It also has a pleasant cucumber smell that quickly dissipates.  Its green bottle, printed with a few leaves from the Aloe vera plant, is about as unisexual a design as you can find.  Thankfully, there is the Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion.  It works just as well as the Vaseline Aloe Fresh.  Its white, creamy lotion has a slight scent that is not flowery or cloying.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two weeks and I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions such as a rash that burns or itches.  The bottle itself is almost solid black, giving it a masculine appearance.  It is also ergonomically designed for easy gripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is easily absorbed into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling slick or greasy.  Because it is produced by Vaseline, I feared that it would.  Vaseline Men is one of the best lotions I have ever used.  Because it is designed for men, I highly recommend it for men who have dry skin.  My parents came to visit me for Easter.  During their stay, Dad sampled my Vaseline Men.  It wasn&#x27;t until he returned home and began using his regular lotion that he realized how much he missed the Vaseline Men.  He called me, asking where he could buy it.  I told him to order it from Amazon and pay for it with his Discover Cashback Bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosit from Amazon and pay for it with his Discover Cashback Bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;nice masculine scent that has moderate strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve kept a bottle on my desk at work for years.&lt;br /&gt;never had a complaint about the scent being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great everyday lotion for hands and body.&lt;br /&gt;yes i&#x27;ve used it in my hair, but not on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 20.3 ounce bottle is good sized and usually lasts me for months.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  Feels good going on and once it is rubbed in you really don&#x27;t feel it on your skin.  It is gentle so when you put it on you face it doesn&#x27;t bother the more sensitive skin around my eyes.  There is a nice subtle fragrance that is not too floral or too \\&quot;manly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Vaseline lotions -- the green kind with aloe is one of my favorites -- so I wanted to try the kind specially formulated for guys. This has a faint, pleasant odor that is masculine enough to convince guys it&#x27;s a product for them. (It smells like aftershave.) But the smell isn&#x27;t cloying and fades quickly, which is what I wanted. The lotion feels fine going on and keeps your skin sufficiently hydrated. Unfortunately, it made my skin break out, something the green kind never does. Your mileage may vary, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion applies smoothly and continues to feel moist on the skin for an extended period.  Too often skin lotions go on greasy and then sink in so fast the skin feels sticky before one is done rubbing it in.  Vaseline seems to have a knack for being able to make skin care products that strike the right balance.  The fragrance is pleasant, does not overpower, and is suitable for males and females, but like any scented product may conflict with most women&#x27;s perfumes.  Kudos to Vaseline for providing the product in a larger size than most competitors and also for shaping the bottle so it won&#x27;t slip out of the hands.  After using this lotion it would probably be my first choice going forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed that Vaseline came out with a lotion that dries in about 15 seconds. It really works, you rub it in and you can turn doorknobs again almost right away instead of having to remember to leave the bathroom door open so you can get out. Plus it smells pretty good too, and the container is huge--a good value for the money. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a great price.</li>
            <li> Mistook this for the scented one that looks very similar to this bottle. Other than the lack of the fresh man scent that my girlfriend likes, this lotion is exactly the same as the scented one. 1 bottle down 2 more to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and love it. I decided to purchase from Amazon.com given that&#x27;s it&#x27;s less expensive than purchasing at the local Wal-mart.  With the very first pump, the consistency of the lotion was noticeably different than previously experienced with the same brand and line. Either the manufacturer has recently changed the formulation or the lotion has been cut with water and resold to maximize profit.  Whichever the case, I will no longer purchase this item from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. It really does work as advertised. The sent is a little heavy but the lotion works well.</li>
            <li> I used it tonight and the only thing it did was make my room smell like I had been non stop masturbating. my face was irritated all night and because of it, I couldn&#x27;t sleep. I&#x27;m going back to Nivea</li>
            <li> And I am barely on my 3rd bottle. Definitely a very good buy, dries fast so i don&#x27;t have greasy palms after applying and smells good.</li>
            <li> It has just arrived, and forst of all it arrived just on time and well packed, I have used the product before and I can say that it is the best i have ever used, the skin feels relieved when I apply it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this lotion everyday.  He loves it.  He likes that it has a pump at the top instead of squeeze bottle action.</li>
            <li> I could never get a lotion that would actuall get my hands to feel normal and not greasy. This is the stuff.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and didn&#x27;t really care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the scent was was too strong.  Not only is it objectionably strong, but it&#x27;s also quite feminine-smelling.  Come on, we&#x27;re guys!  Most of us don&#x27;t want to smell like girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also didn&#x27;t care for the way it burns my face.  After shaving, I&#x27;d expect a lotion designed for the face and body of a man not to burn his face.  But that&#x27;s exactly what it does and it&#x27;s a pretty unpleasant burn at that.  I want a product that moisturizes and nourishes my skin, not one that burns it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is also too watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed deeply into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan and would never buy it.  2 stars.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been regular users of Vaseline moisturizers in our home for several years, so I thought this new lotion directed towards men would be a nice variation on a product with which we&#x27;ve been very happy.  Unfortunately, it only took one squeeze - and one smell - to decide that going forward I&#x27;ll continue to use the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Vaseline lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this lotion serves moderately well as a moisturizer for use on the body, although not as well as the Vaseline Intensive Repair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any oily residue, and the product is fast-absorbing.  I don&#x27;t think any product can completely eliminate winter itching, but this does a fairly good job of limiting that itchiness.  The problem with this product is the smell, which reminded me of something that my dad may have worn when I was a kid, or perhaps a cologne that one would purchase at a gas station.  If I wanted to scent my body, I&#x27;d buy Axe, and I just don&#x27;t expect this kind of thing from Vaseline.  I understand that they&#x27;re directing this one towards men, and that it can be used on the face after shaving, but a more low-key smell would have been a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the strong scent, then this will probably appeal as a four-or-five star product for you.  If you&#x27;re like me, though, and don&#x27;t enjoy a strong \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; scent in your everyday body lotion, stick with other options.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion because I was looking for something that cured my winter-related dry skin, didn&#x27;t leave me smelling like flowers, and was not greasy. Well its almost 3/3. It definitely cures dry skin and the smell is really not TOO intense - it is just a bit masculine. My only problem is that it is a bit greasy for about 30 mins after application. Other than that, I really can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion that would not affect my sensitive skin. I tend to get dry skin in the winter and therefor apply lotion throughout the day. Having sensitive skin I was a little worried about a lotion that claimed could be used on the body and face. But to my surprise this stuff works. Its a little greasy when first applied but quickly dissipates. It does have a fragrance but I don&#x27;t find it too strong. It&#x27;s a great buy and the 3 pack sure does last a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to take very hot showers, which leaves his skin dry, particularly in the winter.  However, he is resistant to using lotions from my side of the bathroom because he doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a girl.  This results in his skin occasionally getting painfully dry, at which point he gives in and has to use my heavy duty creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I gave him this bottle of his very own manly scented lotion, I have noticed he is actually using it!  I have observed a gradual improvement from the painful dryness he had started with.  He likes the fragrance, it is similar to colognes he would choose, a lighter sandalwood spicy scent.  He also likes the texture, which is smooth, not greasy, and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out, and found my hands and elbows feel nicely softened.  I like the fragrance, too... on my husband, that is, not really for myself.  I have noticed I can still catch of a whiff of it hours after he put it on, so it lasts nicely, similar to cologne.  Love that!</li>
            <li> My wonderful hubby uses lotion like women use perfume and he found he liked this product a lot.  Nice fragrance, non greasy feeling and absorbs quickly making skin feel refreshed.  It&#x27;s funny cause my 27 year old daughter actually likes the fragrance of this one also.  It actually is nice and not over powering.  Vaseline products have been around for a dogs age and they are a company that is keeping their product line up to par with the times and needs of todays consumer.</li>
            <li> This does get absorbed into to skin quickly and feels nice but it has a strong cologne like scent that had me washing my hands after I used it. I know smell is a very subjective thing but I want a skin moisturizer that has no scent or a very mild one at best. This seems more like a cologne to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t seem to find a scent listed on the bottle. I am a bit surprised that this is listed for men with what I consider to be such a strong scent. Again, some men would not mind but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absorbed quickly into the skin and I agree that this is fast absorbing.  It does feel great on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the product for me because of the scent but it may be fine for other people. It does absorb quickly and feel nice.</li>
            <li> This face and body lotion works great for men.  It&#x27;s quick absorbing and smells nice.  I&#x27;m hesitant to put this lotion on my face though. I have rather sensitive skin and non face specific lotions can cause me to break out.  I would rather apply something else without a scent on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the lotion has been great in the spring time.  I am not sure how well it will fair against the colder dry winters.</li>
            <li> Summary: I&#x27;ll stick with the regular Vaseline Intensive Care...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy, I didn&#x27;t start using lotion until after I turned 40 and my skin started to get dry and itchy in the winter. I typically use [[ASIN:B001ECQ4IU Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion, Fragrance Free, 20.3-Ounce Pump (Pack of 3)]] after showering or when my skin feels dry.  I also use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, I used this product on my left side this morning and my usual lotion on my right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression is that it&#x27;s thinner than the regular Vaseline Intensive lotion.  That&#x27;s good in that it absorbs into the skin faster as they advertise on the label, but after about 5 hours I found I needed more lotion, so it appears that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as what I usually use.  I didn&#x27;t have a major issue with lotion absorbing slowly since I apply it right after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has a nice generic scent.  It&#x27;s mild enough for most people but I always find these too strong - if you seek out scent free products as I do, you probably won&#x27;t like this either.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells very earthy and musky, in a pleasant way, and not too strong. The smell lasts for hours. My husband  uses it in place of cologne, but it won&#x27;t actually overpower your cologne. My husband says it keeps his dry skin moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a sort of almost satiny residue on your hands for a few minutes after use though-it&#x27;s not unpleasant, just odd. After a couple of hours your hands still feel silky smooth. If you continue using it, leaving about 2 or 3 hours in between usage, your hands quickly become very healthy looking. This is a pretty awesome product for our dry winters.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly when it happened but I noticed (actually it was pointed out to me) sometime within the last few years the time it takes the two members of this union to get ready to leave together has been reversed. I also don&#x27;t know how I feel about that since it was probably the only area where I previously had the upper hand. In any event, one of the reasons is after showering, it seems my skin dries out like it should be the next landing zone for a Mars rover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always been a concern, one that frankly has always been most effectively addressed by petroleum jelly or cocoa butter in areas that are not publicly visible. Even for the areas that will get you a citation for indecent exposure, if I didn&#x27;t want to slide off the sheets or leave a grease slick worthy of a sequel to Coming to America, and I have sampled just about anything that claimed to be a good moisturizer with rapid absorption, the best options have been Lubiderm or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a workable option, with a caveat. It has proven to be effective with fast absorption, superior to the cocoa butter formulas I have been using most recently as well as the Lubiderm and Nivea products that are also languishing under the bathroom sink waiting for their respective calls to service. None of them and this one is no exception, does much for the sandpaper heel syndrome, as an old school application of copious amounts of petroleum jelly is the thing that works best for me.. Excluding the petroleum jelly, all of the products mentioned  leave the skin feeling soft and resilient with leaving much of an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as though I really needed to add another mundane step to my daily decision making process, with procurement of this variety of Vaseline lotion, now I have to decide what fragrance cologne I intend to wear before I \\&quot;body moisturize.\\&quot; The difference is no other lotion I possess has such a strong scent as the Vaseline fast absorbing. Fortunately, the scent is very similar to Armani Code, a cologne I wear pretty regularly but in combination with other scents I may wear like Aramis or Burberry, this lotion is a non-starter.nt is very similar to Armani Code, a cologne I wear pretty regularly but in combination with other scents I may wear like Aramis or Burberry, this lotion is a non-starter.</li>
            <li> This product seems pretty good. I mean, it&#x27;s face wash, so there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it. It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine. Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Men lotion works really well with a great subtle, but manly smell. The smell is not overpowering - it won&#x27;t replace your cologne, but it does smell good and you can smell it lightly on your skin for a while after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes really well, which was a little surprising. Usually we buy lotions that say they are for dry/extremely dry skin, but this worked. It is not greasy at all, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get tacky or sticky on the skin. It really is a great body lotion. It leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star product all the way around. Works great for moisturization, has a great manly scent and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Vaseline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s: Body and Face Lotion&amp;#34; is a nice solution to dry hands, especially for those of us who do a lot of weekend-house and yard cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll notice immediately that it feels just like any lotion except that there&#x27;s an oily feel to it as soon as you put it on and even when you rub it into your hands, there&#x27;s a-- or at least feels like a greasy, oily feeling to your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just a small, perhaps a quarter-size squeeze, I found myself wiping any extra lotion on to my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes, you can still feel the effects, but the look and feel of dry skin is gone. And, that dry, ashy skin is smooth and somewhat softer. This is perhaps the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the lotion works well and has a nice, mild masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I tried Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and really like it.I like the smell, which is a little strong if you use a lot of the lotion (and if you use it on your entire body, people will smell you comming). I don&#x27;t mind it, in fact, I like it.My wife likes it, too, but she  thinks it is  strong. It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy but it does feel thinner than other lotions I use. I don&#x27;t think it gives me the same level of moisturizing as my Arbonne lotion, but it is also much cheaper! This 20plus ounce bottle is huge and will last you for a while. There is a lot  of value here andI give it 4.5 stars, with a nod up to 5.</li>
            <li> I admit that I have have thought of Vaseline as on old fashioned product that&#x27;s been around forever.  I decided to try this more on a whim than anything else.  We live in Northern Wisconsin and during the winter dry skin is a real issue.  Plus I have a facial skin condition, more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve used Lubriderm and Gold Bond, they work OK but really kept buying out of habit.  This works so well I was surprised, it is absorbed quickly, lasts a long time and smells good.  This is really a whole level better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I will keep using it, a while ago I was diagnosed with folliculitis.  My doctor told me I have to shave my beard and that growing back my beard would be painful and super itchy and may cause the problem to reappear.  Shaving actually is somewhat pain and my skin burns for 24 hours afterward.  In the past I used Nivea Shaving Balm right after shaving but it smells bad, cost a lot and I still had to apply either Lubriderm or Gold Bond every three hours or so for a day to keep the burning under control.  Vaseline Men and Body FACE lotion works so much better, last longer and really makes my face feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summerize, this works very, very well both for just plain dry skin and for people with skin/facial conditions or problems.  I really highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is the perfect moisturizer that also doubles as an aftershave. The lotion is light enough that it quickly absorbs into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion is so great that you don&#x27;t need cologne and it lasts throughout the day. A great lotion for my son that keeps him looking good and smelling better. This lotion comes in a huge bottle and is a great bargain and is a perfect combination of moisturizer and cologne. I love it!</li>
            <li> Best part: Non greasy/Fast absorbing/Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Worst: Nothing is that bad about it, I&#x27;m sure higher end brands might do more justice to your skin but I love it regardless.</li>
            <li> I found this at the supermarket by chance and have used it since that time.  Has a nice scent and what I like is how quick it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Love that it smells good, and does&#x27;t leave you greasy like other lotions. skin feels refreshed, built for men! !</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, Has a pleasant scent and rubs in just fine... I sometimes use a little with my aftershave if my razor decided I needed to be roughed up a little and it soothes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and nicely into the skin.  The fragrance is not girly at all, and it works great on my really dry feet.  My new favorite lotion.</li>
