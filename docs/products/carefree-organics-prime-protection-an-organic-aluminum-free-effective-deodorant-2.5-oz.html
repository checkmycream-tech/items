            <li>I may just have to figure out how to make my own.</li>

            <li>I need a strong deodorant and so far this is the best of all the organic products out there.</li>

            <li>Great organic deodorant that really works...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks, I ended up buying this one without many expectations.  </li>
            <li>Its works perfectly and not only on me, but on my wife as well.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Kiss my face so far works the best rarely needs to be reapplied the downside</li>
            <li>although is aluminum free still has the most chemicals out of the 3.</li>
            <li>FINALLY I have found something that works, smells great without overpowering, and gives me peace of mind knowing it is chemical free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit sticky but the smell is awesome!  </li>
            <li>It smells great too, fresh and natural, not like baby powder or \\&quot;tropical mango\\</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far in terms of natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>SurprisedI  Tried many non-aluminium deodorants without success, I had stopped looking.  </li>
            <li>Rash free on day 3.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great overall...</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about Prime Protection and I love their other products</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it!!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite in the Carefree Organics line!</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to many products and this deodorant works and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fresh and</li>
            <li>If I wear a white top it does discolor the underarm area, and is more like a paste.</li>
            <li>it wore off rather quick.</li>
            <li>So far, this is not irritating his skin and smells good.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing find, still can&#x27;t believe it is so affordable.</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s worth it, to avoid the aluminum in store-bought deodorant/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try it directly on fresh shaved skin just in case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts a long time (all day) and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>BUT it will keeps one feeling fresh and smells VERY neutral (not too masc not too fem).</li>
            <li>This deodorant works really well!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I will know if it really works!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li>works good but little to sticky!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t claim to be &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; but it really is.</li>
            <li>like i said its akin to a very sticky glue...</li>
            <li>It really kept me from sweating all day.</li>
            <li>Good and absorbent BUT overpriced and thick.  </li>
            <li>I got it back in April, and its June now, and within those two months it gave me this huge, bright red, raw rash with peeling skin.</li>
            <li>but due to its ability to keep me dry and smelling good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more goopy and lasts about half the day.</li>
            <li>The search for a decent deodorant continues...</li>
            <li>I finally found a safe, organic deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>Had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>There is only downsidesâ€¦the product has so much beeswax that it is kind of hard to apply and it can also stain your clothes on a hot day.</li>
            <li>if I still like it after more than a few days.  </li>
            <li>I live on the beach</li>
            <li>I am so sensitive to gluten that I developed rashes from natural deodorants that used barley or hops (even though there is some debate about barley and/or hops containing gluten).</li>
            <li>Did not think I had THAT sensitive of skin.</li>
            <li>So far i tried Toms of  Maine, Kiss my Face and this one.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this deodorant, but the fact it leaves yellow oil-like stains on my shirts is a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to walk around with yellow stains under their pits, or have someone see your shirts in the laundry with pit stains.</li>
            <li>but I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>No reactions thus far, but</li>
            <li>Smell is soft</li>
            <li>I live in FL and we swear ALOT here, especially in the summer, so</li>
            <li>Only organic deodorant I have found that actually lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>left rash on skin would not recommend for people with sensitive skin or allergies</li>
            <li>I had tried every possible natural and/or organic deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>Having tried several organic deodorants this one is my favorite for smell but goes on tough.</li>
            <li>As a cancer survivor it is so important for me to choose organic products, but I am a tough case because I am also a runner</li>

            <li> As a cancer survivor it is so important for me to choose organic products, but I am a tough case because I am also a runner</li>
            <li> I mean, for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> it is a bit harder in texture than other deodorants, but i don&#x27;t see this as a problem really...</li>
            <li> It also has a somewhat worrying disclaimer at the very bottom in small text, &amp;#34;Warning - the safety of this product has not been determined.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; What, exactly, is that supposed to mean, from a company called &amp;#34;Carefree Organics&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> It hurts really bad, and its so raw that when my bra gets even close to touching the raw area, it makes huge blisters.</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t so dry when applying.  </li>
            <li> It lasts forever, but I will admit I don&#x27;t use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Very dry texture</li>
            <li> and it is rough when applying.</li>
            <li> always stayed wet and stained my clothes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it goes on really dry</li>
            <li> it lasts longer than the other organic deodorants..</li>
            <li> This deodorant is quite pricey but it does work compared to other organic/natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural and organic deodorants and was so unhappy with them.</li>
            <li> I went from smelling princess like to all out beast in less than one hour after shower/application.</li>
            <li> This active girl is quite happy......and odorless!</li>
            <li> it does have a slight cooling tingle after application, which one should probably expect with ingredients like peppermint, tea tree oil, and rosemary...</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> it also seems a bit expensive to me at over $12, but so far i think that the quality justifies the price...</li>
            <li> one negative aspect I can say is that it goes on very dry and is hard to rub on, catches on the skin and hair of my armpit during application.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it not work but was difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few of them on my quest for non-aluminum/chemical free deodorants and have been very disappointed until now.</li>
            <li> Its hard to go on.</li>
            <li> so you had to press hard on your skin to apply product.  </li>
            <li> but now i hardly notice I&#x27;m wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> Goes on hard because of its wax-like consistency.</li>
            <li> so you do not smell like deodorant (which is never a good thing) and</li>
            <li> very hard to use...</li>
            <li> It is just utterly terrible, which is a shame, considering it really worked.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very subtle and therefore is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> Toms of Maine was the worst needs to be reapplied several times during the day.  </li>
            <li> (so that&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable)  </li>
            <li> Sorry guys, didn&#x27;t like this...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very irritating.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t do it for me:(</li>
            <li> threw it away :(</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and cannot wear anything with fragrance.</li>
            <li> Hugo Naturals and Nourish were especially awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Have me a rash so I stopped using it and my tags went away. Did not think I had THAT sensitive of skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! So far this is the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love it! I was looking for a change from using a deodorant with Aluminum &amp; found this. It really works!</li>
            <li> Best all natural deodorant ever</li>
            <li> I love this! It lasts forever, but I will admit I don&#x27;t use it every single day. I need a strong deodorant and so far this is the best of all the organic products out there.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a fresh, pleasant smell. It works just as well for me as any chemically-laden deodorant. I gave it 4 stars because of the color and texture. If I wear a white top it does discolor the underarm area, and is more like a paste. However you do get used to the feeling. It may not be possible for an organic product like this to be white, so I do understand, but just keep that in mind when buying, or use another deodorant when wearing white shirts. But I think it&#x27;s worth it, to avoid the aluminum in store-bought deodorant/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> left rash on skin would not recommend for people with sensitive skin or allergies</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!  I have tried several \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants over the years and have remained unimpressed...until I used Prime Protection from Carefree Organics!  The consistency is great, it smells amazing, and best of all...IT WORKS!!!  This is my new favorite in the Carefree Organics line!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very irritating. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but this would be great if it were an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product! I have tried several natural and organic deodorants and was so unhappy with them. This truly works great! It has a nice smell and keeps you odor free all day! I will recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Only organic deodorant I have found that actually lasts the whole day.  I really like this stuff. Great smell and it feels great on. Thanks for making it!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  Its hard to go on. Think sand paper on your pits. BUT it will keeps one feeling fresh and smells VERY neutral (not too masc not too fem).</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase. There is only downsidesâ€¦the product has so much beeswax that it is kind of hard to apply and it can also stain your clothes on a hot day. Besides that I don&#x27;t stink any more so I will take the downside any day of the week!</li>
            <li> So far i tried Toms of  Maine, Kiss my Face and this one. Toms of Maine was the worst needs to be reapplied several times during the day.  This one sometimes needs to be reapplied sometimes not but I noticed it leaves oily marks on my shirts so I stopped using it. Kiss my face so far works the best rarely needs to be reapplied the downside is of course although is aluminum free still has the most chemicals out of the 3.</li>
            <li> Love this product..I will definitely order this again..it lasts longer than the other organic deodorants..Will recommend this to my family and friends..</li>
            <li> This deodorant is quite pricey but it does work compared to other organic/natural deodorants. I have tried a couple of different ones but based on the reviews I ordered this brand and it works quite well. During the summer it needs to be re-applied thru the day</li>
            <li> been searching for a good organic aluminum free deodorant for awhile now.  I used to use Everyman Jack but decided to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time (all day) and smells nice.  I especially like the tea tree scent.&lt;br /&gt;The one negative aspect I can say is that it goes on very dry and is hard to rub on, catches on the skin and hair of my armpit during application.  (so that&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable)  but due to its ability to keep me dry and smelling good I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant, but the fact it leaves yellow oil-like stains on my shirts is a deal-breaker. Nobody wants to walk around with yellow stains under their pits, or have someone see your shirts in the laundry with pit stains. The deodorant seemed to work well, though, for the two days I used it. And I also appreciate that it has organic ingredients (though there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any certification process noted, so they may just be claiming it). It also has a somewhat worrying disclaimer at the very bottom in small text, &amp;#34;Warning - the safety of this product has not been determined.&amp;#34; What, exactly, is that supposed to mean, from a company called &amp;#34;Carefree Organics&amp;#34;? The search for a decent deodorant continues... I may just have to figure out how to make my own.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, it&#x27;s grainy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very pleasant smell and works all day.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes. Not only did it not work but was difficult to apply. Very dry texture so you had to press hard on your skin to apply product.  I don&#x27;t know if it was defective but I won&#x27;t be finding out.</li>
            <li> I had tried every possible natural and/or organic deodorant on the market. Most smelled good but didn&#x27;t work at all. I had heard great things about Prime Protection and I love their other products so I gave it a go. I will never go without this deodorant again!! It&#x27;s the ONLY one that has worked for me and its consistent-I&#x27;ve gone through 3 already and they are all consistently awesome. It smells great too, fresh and natural, not like baby powder or \\&quot;tropical mango\\&quot; scent that some companies think appeal to women as an underarm scent. A side note-this deodorant has no barley/hops or gluten containing ingredients. I am so sensitive to gluten that I developed rashes from natural deodorants that used barley or hops (even though there is some debate about barley and/or hops containing gluten). Bottom line-try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Having tried several organic deodorants this one is my favorite for smell but goes on tough. It&#x27;s more goopy and lasts about half the day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well!  The best I&#x27;ve found so far in terms of natural deodorants.  The only negative is that it goes on really dry and it is rough when applying. I just wish it weren&#x27;t so dry when applying.  However it lasts all day (for the most part) and has a pleasant smell. I would and have definitely recommended it.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys, didn&#x27;t like this...always stayed wet and stained my clothes...just didn&#x27;t do it for me:(</li>
            <li> Just purchased this for my daughter and she loves it.  It both smells and works great!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The best organic deodorant I have found yet.</li>
            <li> burned my skin. threw it away :( waste of money</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great and lasts the whole day. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> As a cancer survivor it is so important for me to choose organic products, but I am a tough case because I am also a runner and I put my deodorant to the test. FINALLY I have found something that works, smells great without overpowering, and gives me peace of mind knowing it is chemical free! It doesn&#x27;t claim to be &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; but it really is. Doesn&#x27;t ever leave stains on my shirts and can&#x27;t see it at all on my skin.  Such an amazing find, still can&#x27;t believe it is so affordable. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great organic deodorant that really works...and you can avoid many of the harmful chemicals!! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very hard to use...it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing glue into my armpits. I&#x27;ve reduced the amount i use and that seems to help..but now i hardly notice I&#x27;m wearing this stuff. i don&#x27;t like the feel of it under my arms...like i said its akin to a very sticky glue...albeit great smelling glue...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, my husband said I &#x27;smell like a hippy&#x27; cause it wore off rather quick. Also it sticks to your clothes, so if you wear a red shirt, boom red armpits. I mean, for what it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m likely looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Good and absorbent BUT overpriced and thick.  Goes on hard because of its wax-like consistency.</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and cannot wear anything with fragrance. So far, this is not irritating his skin and smells good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whats in it that did this, but the deodorant seemed to have somehow burnt my skin, and my skin all peeled off where this deodorant has been rubbed on. I got it back in April, and its June now, and within those two months it gave me this huge, bright red, raw rash with peeling skin. It hurts really bad, and its so raw that when my bra gets even close to touching the raw area, it makes huge blisters. It is just utterly terrible, which is a shame, considering it really worked. It really kept me from sweating all day. But I just cant use it any longer because it is ruining the skin in my armpit.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I wanted to switch to an organic deodorant and chose this one based on the reviews.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but I like it so far.  It&#x27;s a little bit sticky but the smell is awesome!  Clean and fresh and almost kind of minty I guess from the tea tree oil.  I will let you know if I still like it after more than a few days.  I live in FL and we swear ALOT here, especially in the summer, so I will know if it really works!</li>
            <li> Ahhhh! I finally found a safe, organic deodorant that actually works! I have tried quite a few of them on my quest for non-aluminum/chemical free deodorants and have been very disappointed until now. Prime Protection by Carefree Organics is amazing! No reactions thus far, but I wouldn&#x27;t try it directly on fresh shaved skin just in case. I tested it on an &amp;#34;Africa hot&amp;#34; day in Florida and it did not disappoint!  (These brands ....Hugo Naturals and Nourish were especially awful. I went from smelling princess like to all out beast in less than one hour after shower/application. Pictures below of what not to buy!) So thankful I found this product and have ordered extras for house, gym bag and work. This active girl is quite happy......and odorless!</li>
            <li> works good but little to sticky!</li>
            <li> SurprisedI  Tried many non-aluminium deodorants without success, I had stopped looking.  After a couple of weeks, I ended up buying this one without many expectations.  Its works perfectly and not only on me, but on my wife as well.  I live on the beach and it&#x27;s hot.  Smell is soft so you do not smell like deodorant (which is never a good thing) and it lasts well into the weekend even when skipping a shower.  Rash free on day 3.</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to many products and this deodorant works and does not irritate my skin.  The fragrance is very subtle and therefore is not a problem.  Rcommend for people with allergies or people who do not want to use aluminum products.</li>
            <li> Smells great but I didn&#x27;t react well with this stuff. I broke out.</li>
            <li> this is a really good one. It lasts forever.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great overall... i love the transparency about the ingredients, and find that it has an awesome fresh scent... it does have a slight cooling tingle after application, which one should probably expect with ingredients like peppermint, tea tree oil, and rosemary... i actually like this feeling... it is a bit harder in texture than other deodorants, but i don&#x27;t see this as a problem really... it&#x27;s just a bit different than people might be accustomed to... it also seems a bit expensive to me at over $12, but so far i think that the quality justifies the price...</li>
