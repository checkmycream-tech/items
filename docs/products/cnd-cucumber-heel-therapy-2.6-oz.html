            <li>Your feet will love the attention and you will love the massage.</li>
            <li>This heel therapy is okay.  </li>
            <li>but once they started getting better</li>
            <li>This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found for dry skin.  </li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day - about once a week is good enough.</li>
            <li>One lucky day, I was having a salon pedicure and the pedicurist suggested that I try CND SpaPedicure Cucumber Heel Therapy.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used this cream I saw and felt the difference!</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean, it&#x27;s always hot, easy to have cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love it and recommend and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I put it on every night, and in the morning, soft, smooth hands.  </li>
            <li>At first I used it twice a day</li>
            <li>With the dry skin sloughed off the lotion was better absorbed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>really dry, cracked heels since I was pregnant with my son over 3 years ago</li>
            <li>It keeps my heels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I use this after using OPI professional pedicure foot file...just as they do at my local salon when getting a pedicure.</li>

            <li> The only lotion that works on dry crackily heels.</li>
            <li> therapy works wonders not only on dry cracked heels</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks my severely cracked heels have almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> with the dry air I still have the dry heel problem</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty with dry, pealing finger nails.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry feet (soles) and carpet makes them even dry in winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bazillion products for rough heels that split in the wintertime, and this stuff is like gold.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I did help it along though with a pumice stone every other night in the shower.</li>
            <li> It heals the cracks on my heels and keeps down the callouses on the side of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> For years I tried many products to  soothe my horrible dry cracked heels - nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I am a runner and have very bad calluses, but this makes my feet so smooth!  </li>
            <li> Usually foot creams are heavily scented with mint.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to use it everyday to see a difference!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get out of the jar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> also on toes made tender by winter cold.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is just OK. A nail tech used it on my feet during a pedicure and I loved the way it felt. It still feels good - it is a nice, soft, whipped lotion - but it&#x27;s nothing special. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well (compared to Bag Balm, Glytone Heel and Elbow Cream, etc). You&#x27;re just as well off to use any regular (and cheaper) foot lotion than to use this.</li>
            <li> I love the heel therapy.  It keeps my heels so soft.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cream is helpful but I live in the desert and with the dry air I still have the dry heel problem</li>
            <li> This product defintelly works. I love it and recommend and would definitely buy it again. Visible results in a week.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean, it&#x27;s always hot, easy to have cracked heels. The first night I used this cream I saw and felt the difference! It absorbs right away, not leaving a greasy feel, and leaves your feet soft, feeling and looking great! I ordered this product based solely on reviews and because it was 5 star rated, I don&#x27;t regret it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For years I tried many products to  soothe my horrible dry cracked heels - nothing worked. One lucky day, I was having a salon pedicure and the pedicurist suggested that I try CND SpaPedicure Cucumber Heel Therapy.  It&#x27;s amazing! It smoothed my cracked heels.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now, with continued results.  The price at Amazon is much better than at the salon.</li>
            <li> I use this after using OPI professional pedicure foot file...just as they do at my local salon when getting a pedicure. Love the smell and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found for dry skin.  I actually bought it for my hands and especially cuticles after receiving a sample from my nail salon.  I put it on every night, and in the morning, soft, smooth hands.  I love the light cucumber scent.  I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bazillion products for rough heels that split in the wintertime, and this stuff is like gold.  It doesn&#x27;t just ride on the surface - it hydrates the tissues beneath and heals the chapped skin.  I don&#x27;t know how this product isn&#x27;t in every home!</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty with dry, pealing finger nails.  I was originally given this product in a beauty products package as a gift.  It was to be used with pedicures and it worked so well I tried it on my fingernails and the problem is abating.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Best heel cream I have ever used.  Love it and it&#x27;s not greasy and does a wonderful job on rough feet.</li>
            <li> using need to use it more</li>
            <li> The only lotion that works on dry crackily heels. It&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s hard to get out of the jar but it stays on heels! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of those placebo products. Baby lotion works just as good and not as oily.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Usually foot creams are heavily scented with mint.  This one has a very light aroma of cucumber which doesn&#x27;t overpower.  It is the most luscious cream!  I have problem feet and I find myself massaging my foot longer because it feels so good.  A little goes a long way so the jar lasts quite a while for me.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my hands and night.</li>
            <li> Cucumber heal therapy works wonders not only on dry cracked heels&lt;br /&gt;but also on toes made tender by winter cold.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best foot cream i have ever used.  It heals the cracks on my heels and keeps down the callouses on the side of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;Plus is smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever for your heels. Your feet will love the attention and you will love the massage.</li>
            <li> Best product for cracked heels.......have used for years!</li>
            <li> I have very dry feet (soles) and carpet makes them even dry in winter. I ordered this after reading the reviews and found that it works as described. I don&#x27;t use it every day - about once a week is good enough.</li>
            <li> This heel therapy is okay.  I have had really dry, cracked heels since I was pregnant with my son over 3 years ago and it&#x27;s never gone away.  It didn&#x27;t work all that well for me.</li>
            <li> Love CND Cucumber Heel Therapy! I am a runner and have very bad calluses, but this makes my feet so smooth!  Very reasonably priced on Amazon.  Almost $10 cheaper than at the nail salon I go to!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks my severely cracked heels have almost completely healed. At first I used it twice a day but once they started getting better I just used it once. I did help it along though with a pumice stone every other night in the shower. With the dry skin sloughed off the lotion was better absorbed. Everybody is different but I would recommend this product even if it is just to have silky to the touch feet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good pricing and product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this, works really well! You don&#x27;t even have to use it everyday to see a difference!</li>
