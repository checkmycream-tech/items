            <li>I will be buying more when I use all of this hydrating gel.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Mary Kay Moisturizing Gel a couple of years ago, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the consistency of this product, regarding the lack of &#x60;heaviness&#x27; you feel when you apply.</li>
            <li>However, it does not include a sunscreen- which means I need to STILL apply a sunscreen on top of this product--which almost defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for moisturizing and it actually gets RID of my pimples</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend using it/ purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer, I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.</li>
            <li>Many people rave about that moisturizer</li>
            <li>I love mary kay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it; not greasy but gives skin moisture</li>
            <li>Love this Mary Kay product</li>
            <li>I love this product because of how lightweight and non-greasy it is, and my skin loves it because it never leaves greasy residue or makes me break out, it always just soaks it up.  </li>
            <li>I always have to apply another one on top of this one or in addition to.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love it keepsy</li>
            <li>love this lightweight cream for overnight treatment on face and neck.  </li>
            <li>However, a friend recommended I try Garnier&#x27;s Moisture Rescue hydrating gel that is available at most discount stores for under $7.00.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>easy to use and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is decent and the service is good if you can&#x27;t find an MK representative</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use after being outside in the sun or wind.  </li>
            <li>However the cream feels nice and is very creamy.</li>
            <li>It was delivered in a timely manner and was securely packaged to insure</li>
            <li>Just a heads up though, after using it you will want to rub your face forever just because it feels so smooth...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes without clogging your pores and absorbs nicely  and makes your face very soft.</li>
            <li>I buy most personal care items from the grocery store, so I&#x27;m a bit more frugal - read, cheap - than some).</li>
            <li>I liked this product, and have bought Mary Kay products directly from a rep before.</li>
            <li>It hydrates well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>I also normally buy it from my Mary K rep for much more ;(</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed quickly....</li>
            <li>I love all of Mary Kay products and this gel is just the right amount of hydration without feeling heavy or greasy and did I say I love Mary Kay!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is useful to me after I use one of my acid peels (which help keep the acne at bay).</li>
            <li>Only kind I will use.</li>
            <li>Expected more oil control and the smell is not that appealing.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as ordered and they shipped it very fast.</li>
            <li>very hydrating without greasy feeling at all!</li>
            <li>That is exactly what it&#x27;s like.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use is regularly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I totally use Mary Kay Products and have for many years.</li>
            <li>I tried it and found that it not only hydrates at 1/3 the cost, but also firms and leaves a pleasant cooling tingle following application.</li>
            <li>Really like this product because it performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This gel makes it much easier.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I would much prefer a pump or squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>This oil free gel is the only moisturizer I can use that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores creating that unattractive &amp;#34;glistening&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much difference since I just started it.</li>
            <li>This one really fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>They deliver the items so fast, Thank you very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it every day and really like it.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel smooth but, at the same time, not making it feel oily.</li>
            <li>Very pricy for amount</li>
            <li>The gel melts into the face with a cooling effect that is in no way greasy, heavy, or irritating-even in extremely warm weather.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to try this product when i first came across it because i have incredibly sensitive skin and a lot of allergies bit</li>
            <li>I use it daily - allows makeup to go on much smoother &amp; stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>, if I could just find a decent moisturizer for MY HAIR....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Maybe in few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I swear to you after using this only 3 times the dry spots are now almost completely smooth!</li>
            <li>Until then-- two coats of moisturizer for me, with main purpose to keep a clear complexion. . .not</li>
            <li>Feels nice and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It works well if you are just looking for something light and not super creamy, but when I apply it to any of my drier patches and areas of my face, they never improve in appearance or texture from just this moisturizer-</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer makes my skin feel unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>THAT I AM 47 YEARS YOUNG.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel geasy or heavy at all and is just over all fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I tried a free sample a few years ago and have used it every day since.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to go directly to MK reps.</li>
            <li>Only (1) draw-back, which really isn&#x27;t a draw-back: it is not necessary to use every day!</li>
            <li>I generally order this from my Mary Kay representative, which is why my review doesn&#x27;t say AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li>I use various treatments that tend to dry out my skin in certain places.</li>
            <li>and it takes only a tiny bit on the tips of your fingers to completely cover your face and neck, so one jar lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>my face is less dry, feel fresh to the skin and not sticky.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best face moisturizer</li>
            <li> Non greasy nice feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and am very pleased with it.  I feel it has prevented continued wrinkles around my eyes and continue to use it every day.  The speed of arrival was wonderful too.</li>
            <li> very hydrating without greasy feeling at all! Great product for summer!</li>
            <li> Great cream. No oily sensation at all.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time keeping my skin hydrated no matter what time of year it is.  This gel makes it much easier.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of other lotions but after a couple of hours they always give out and I need to reapply.  This one keeps my skin moist throughout the day without having to be reapplied all the time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I have been using for several years.  Soothing around the entire area.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use after being outside in the sun or wind.  It feels refreshing and it relaxes.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and replenishes moisture in my combination skin. I love this for nighttime conditioning. Great price.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Makes my skin look so great that friends asked if I was pregnant! Because my face was glowing.  I also normally buy it from my Mary K rep for much more ;(&lt;br /&gt;$32. Plus $5 shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I have combination skin that turns very dry in the winter.  when I use something with oil, it always breaks me out.  My Mary Kay lady said it is like giving you skin a big drink of water.  Perfect description!  That is exactly what it&#x27;s like.</li>
            <li> I just tried one jar but will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay products are the best I have ever used. I will be buying more when I use all of this hydrating gel. Love it</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Mary Kay Moisturizing Gel a couple of years ago, and fell in love. The formula is the same today as it was then...awesome! The gel melts into the face with a cooling effect that is in no way greasy, heavy, or irritating-even in extremely warm weather. Skin will feel totally hydrated and set for whatever makeup regiment you choose. Only (1) draw-back, which really isn&#x27;t a draw-back: it is not necessary to use every day! 3x&#x27;s per week is enough after the initial cleansing in the morning. That&#x27;s just how well this product works. I&#x27;m hooked, and you will be, too</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my doctor, who knows I struggle with finding a product/moisturizer that does not break me out!! I am pleased with the consistency of this product, regarding the lack of &#x60;heaviness&#x27; you feel when you apply. However, it does not include a sunscreen- which means I need to STILL apply a sunscreen on top of this product--which almost defeats the purpose. ; ( If Mary-Kay could just blend a sunscreen component into this product, I think it would be perfect! Until then-- two coats of moisturizer for me, with main purpose to keep a clear complexion. . .not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because it s feel so wegithless over my skin and also odorless</li>
            <li> I love this product and use is regularly.  The product was exactly as ordered and they shipped it very fast.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Great for moisturizing any part of skin, even ears.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and I love it! It is the only product that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, or makes me break out from oil. It is perfect for moisturizing and it actually gets RID of my pimples haha. I love it and recommend using it/ purchasing it. If not from amazon, then you could contact a local Mary Kay supplier who would have it. I haven&#x27;t gotten mine from amazon yet, and I have always bought this product from a Mary Kay supplier, so fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> Fast.  Great, would do business again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference in my skin. However the cream feels nice and is very creamy. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product because it performs exactly as advertised.  I use it daily - allows makeup to go on much smoother &amp; stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This gel is excellent for oily skin &amp; those of us who are using drying lotions like retin-A. No further break outs &amp; hydrates well.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer, I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued. My skin is sensitive, oily and acne prone. I use various treatments that tend to dry out my skin in certain places. This moisturizer makes my skin feel unbelievably soft. I have had zero issues with breaking out since using this. This gives me enough moisture in drier areas without making my T zone oily. I was using Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel but I think that irritated and clogged my skin a bit. Many people rave about that moisturizer but it didn&#x27;t do it for me. My only complaint would be the packaging. It looks nice but I would much prefer a pump or squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is light-weight and does not make your face oily.  It lasts me a good 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is truly a terrific product. I spend a lot of time outdoors and was in desperate need of a moisturizer if I wanted to avoid having my face turn into a well used catchers mitt. This product did the trick. However, a friend recommended I try Garnier&#x27;s Moisture Rescue hydrating gel that is available at most discount stores for under $7.00. I tried it and found that it not only hydrates at 1/3 the cost, but also firms and leaves a pleasant cooling tingle following application. Unfortunately, Mary Kay and I are now divorced.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PURPLE STUFF FOR 6 YEARS NOW MORNING &amp; NIGHT AND NOBODY ON THIS PLANET CAN EVEN GUESS THAT I AM 47 YEARS YOUNG.  I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT MY PURPLE STUFF.</li>
            <li> No complaints with this order. It was delivered in a timely manner and was securely packaged to insure item did not break. The moisturizer itself is absolutely amazing (which I already knew before ordering). I have rough patches my cheeks and my nose and my forehead and chin tend to be oily. I swear to you after using this only 3 times the dry spots are now almost completely smooth! Only 3 times! It doesn&#x27;t feel geasy or heavy at all and is just over all fantastic.  I was nervous to try this product when i first came across it because i have incredibly sensitive skin and a lot of allergies bit I didn&#x27;t have a single negative reaction.  Just a heads up though, after using it you will want to rub your face forever just because it feels so smooth...that may not be the best idea haha</li>
            <li> Love this oil-free gel moisturizer!  Speedy shipping!  A++++++</li>
            <li> it moisturizes without clogging your pores and absorbs nicely  and makes your face very soft. nobody guesses my age they think im younger than I am I love mary kay</li>
            <li> This Hydrating Gel is great on my skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  I use this product exclusively for moisturizing my face.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> After using for a few years I switch to Loreal.  Hidra rejuvinating cream.  All my red spots disappeared and no longer I feel like my face needs hidration. Thank you Loreal</li>
            <li> Love it; not greasy but gives skin moisture</li>
            <li> Love this Mary Kay product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer! And I got it for a wonderful price! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome experience-very speedy and I love Mary Kay products-thank-you!</li>
            <li> Mary Kay is always a winner. Been using the product since my youngest was born and that was 19 years ago.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing moisturizer on my face because in the heat and humidity my face perspires so much that I feel like it&#x27;s melting! This oil free gel is the only moisturizer I can use that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores creating that unattractive &amp;#34;glistening&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s absorbed quickly....and it takes only a tiny bit on the tips of your fingers to completely cover your face and neck, so one jar lasts quite a while. This is the best price anywhere too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I am 75 and am ALWAYS being told I look years younger.  Is it the product? I don&#x27;t know but not taking any chances going to continue using it</li>
            <li> I like it and use long time!</li>
            <li> I generally order this from my Mary Kay representative, which is why my review doesn&#x27;t say AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE.  But please take me seriously, anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor skin is acne prone (dagnabbit) and I do not dare use traditional moisturizers on my skin.  This one \\&quot;does the trick\\&quot; without the awful side effect of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is useful to me after I use one of my acid peels (which help keep the acne at bay). You need to moisturize afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is decent and the service is good if you can&#x27;t find an MK representative (I went through a period like this, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if I could just find a decent moisturizer for MY HAIR....LOL</li>
            <li> my face is less dry, feel fresh to the skin and not sticky. I just used it few weeks ago...didn&#x27;t see much difference since I just started it. Maybe in few more weeks. But I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because of how lightweight and non-greasy it is, and my skin loves it because it never leaves greasy residue or makes me break out, it always just soaks it up.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize at the level I wish it would.  It works well if you are just looking for something light and not super creamy, but when I apply it to any of my drier patches and areas of my face, they never improve in appearance or texture from just this moisturizer- I always have to apply another one on top of this one or in addition to.</li>
            <li> I have used this Gel for years and I just love it.  I totally use Mary Kay Products and have for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really into moisturizers - they usually just make my already-oily skin feel greasy.  But this hydrating gel? Not so. I tried a free sample a few years ago and have used it every day since.  Great find! Minus one star only because it&#x27;s a bit pricey (but keep in mind I buy most personal care items from the grocery store, so I&#x27;m a bit more frugal - read, cheap - than some).</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face.  Very light, hydrates, and disappears into your skin.  I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I love being able to buy Mary Kay online!</li>
            <li> Love this product. So happy it was cheaper</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have been using it for years. The color is unusual in a pale purple. However, it absorbs great.  The only thing I wish it had sunscreen protection.  Hope they continue making this for many years!!!</li>
            <li> This is a joke, it does nothing!</li>
            <li> My grandmother loves this stuff. I personally have been trying to remove the toxic products out of my life.</li>
            <li> I love it keepsy eyes moist</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and love this product!  This works great for anyone that has oily skin.  Only kind I will use.</li>
            <li> love this lightweight cream for overnight treatment on face and neck.  easy to use and lasts forever. non greasy and has no perfumes</li>
            <li> I love all of Mary Kay products and this gel is just the right amount of hydration without feeling heavy or greasy and did I say I love Mary Kay!</li>
            <li> I just received this today, I know this is a good product, I love it and it works really great</li>
            <li> Expected more oil control and the smell is not that appealing.</li>
            <li> I prefer gel formulas on my skin, rather than heavier creams or lotions.  This one really fits the bill.  Feels nice and a little goes a long way.  The only complaint I would have is the scent.  It isn&#x27;t scented, but the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent is just this side of unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, and have bought Mary Kay products directly from a rep before. I bought on amazon so I could save a little money, when I received it, the little lid that comes with this product was not there, so maybe this was previously used or opened. Will continue to go directly to MK reps.</li>
            <li> They deliver the items so fast, Thank you very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love Mary Kay&#x27;s Products!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect for my somewhat oily skin. It hydrates well and absorbs quickly. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and really like it. Makes your face feel smooth but, at the same time, not making it feel oily.</li>
            <li> Very pricy for amount you get but I do like it - nice product</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs into your skin.</li>
    </ol>
