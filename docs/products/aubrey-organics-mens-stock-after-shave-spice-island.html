    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent healing properties with a spicy perfume.</li>
            <li>Good job Aubrey Organics!</li>
            <li>The price also is great.</li>
            <li>that&lt;br /&gt;have pleasant fragrances.</li>
            <li>I know good bay rum that women like.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this since it was an all-natural aftershave and from reviews people said it smelled really good.  </li>
            <li>So I said I&#x27;ll try this given  the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aubrey the wise and wonderful has made the closest thing on earth to Burt&#x27;s original blend and this smells so good like manly strength with an earthy mysteriousness.  </li>
            <li>A great after shave, refreshing and leaves a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Nice aftershave.</li>
            <li>safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>A spicier version that is really nice.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice burn to it when applying after shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn many bay rums and even make my own that&#x27;s had women compliment my scent.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>Women will LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>No, in fact, witch hazel has more of an odor.</li>
            <li>You would be better served splashing bottled water on your face -</li>
            <li>Not my favorite scent.....</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this, I and my wife absolutely loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>This after shave is well worth the price either for yourself,  or would make a nice gift for some man in your life that likes this sort of thing.  </li>
            <li>Let cool and pour all over yourself....same effect for pennies...barf!</li>
            <li>Does not sting and goes on very smooth and cool.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>WOW this is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed at all</li>
            <li>Up to now all Aubrey products I&#x27;ve tried have been very good, but the scent of this aftershave could hardly be described as &#x27;spicy&#x27; - more like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>It permeated my home nearly a full day or two even when I flushed my kitchen sink pipe with 1/2 a gallon of bleach.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Kind of an urban earthy take on manliness!</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, this item is not returnable (If I sold this thing I would be happy I got rid off it, so I can&#x27;t blame them, I wouldn&#x27;t want it back either), so 10 more bucks down the drain...</li>
            <li>It stings just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Great cooling feel with very little burn.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to have the normal burn with Big name brand liquid after shaves and has a pretty good scent</li>
            <li>Overall a good light aftershave for daily use.</li>
            <li>Giving Aubrey their dues, the ingredients of all of their products are natural, healthy and gentle on the user and the environment.  </li>
            <li>This time it&#x27;s ok, but almost has a completely different scent.  </li>
            <li>great scent, doesn&#x27;t last as long as alcohol based colognes</li>
            <li>but it is pretty darn manly.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase of a Bay Rum aftershave.</li>
            <li>as not even a gas mask would have helped ME, during my now peaceful afternoon...</li>
            <li>Many years ago, Burt&#x27;s created a unique take on this scent with more exotic layers that made women (especially my goddess of a girlfriend) crazy, but they discontinued it after selling the company (and the reintroduction is not even close to the original).  </li>
            <li>; even if it was worth taking a chance on getting a decent replacement - or paying for return shipping.  </li>
            <li>This one is very light with just a subtle smell of spice more than rum.</li>
            <li>all natural ingredients, nice warm aroma perfect for winter season, no rash after tough shaves, I dislike the smell of the other evergreen type they sell, heavy splash of alcohol</li>
            <li>The quality of the liquid is very good, nothing wrong except the scent is just not for me.</li>
            <li>Level of liquid showed how much had leaked.  </li>
            <li>the stuff in the leaking bottle had as much smell as water.  </li>
            <li>Very spicy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really recommend trying to find this in a store to smell it before you buy it.</li>
            <li>I actually tried it for it was so cheap compared to so many of the other mens scents there.  </li>
            <li>The bottle, the scent, and the strength in my opinion makes this after shave a real bargain that anyone not familiar with it would think cost much more.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers mentioned this is very masculine, and the women will love it.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the only aftershave we can agree upon: clean, male and not cheap-smelling</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it how strong it was, and how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li>Feels natural and not very harsh but not extremely crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>but I am mostly just getting the clove and a little Vetiver which I now see</li>
            <li>I BUY MORE EVERY FEW MONTHS.</li>
            <li>Its soothing to my newly shaved face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it smells pretty gross.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the small amount remaining of my original bottle (purchased at Whole Foods, which no longer carries it)</li>
            <li>This is a must for the masculine natural man.  </li>
            <li>My action un-leashed a tsunami of smell</li>
            <li>I found an organic food type market near me that has all the scents from this brand</li>
            <li>Our household has switched almost 100% to natural products.</li>
            <li>Well well well, to me (a 40 year old)</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Luckily, the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>Glycerin and other natural ingredients keep skin soft and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Scent actually lasts a long time at least four hours or so which is quite good for an aftershave.</li>
            <li>Cap was loose, liquid had leaked all over the box which was wet and soft, the printing mostly dissolved and illegible, and starting to tear.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted it gone and a days struggle to clear the air in my home with incense, cleaners, candles and the doors open finally made it habitable again!</li>
            <li>it stinks as an old pharmacy (the smell of all those chemical when they prepared drugs), or better yet, as an old dentist office (that tooth powder smell from drilling and, again,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But this particular lotion is a bit stronger and a little different than your average bay rum.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;spice island\\&quot; as they call it is actually a form of bay rum, an old fashioned but still common after shave that comes in a lot of formulas.  </li>

            <li> Bayrum and pepper and other spices</li>
            <li> Alcohol content is well balanced with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I will also try other lotions from Vitacost.</li>
            <li> Can tell there is some moisturizing effect due to the witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I threw the empty bottle away off my property even!</li>
            <li> the odor would be similar, and at least you would know what the contents are.</li>
            <li> So, buy at your own risk and understand that, if like me, you find yourself disgusted, know that you can NOT return it due to Amazons policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that was to pour the stuff down my sink!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the other, but this one definitely lived up to my expectations!  </li>
            <li> Not a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> But not just bay rum, this is a complicated scent like I&#x27;ve never experienced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately opened this after shave in my home on arrival to sample it.</li>
            <li> I cannot possibly relate how awful the smell was l.</li>
            <li> I am shocked after trusting the other reviews at just how bad this product is.</li>
            <li> This Aubrey product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Just aweful, my wife thinks it went bad.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was just a bad batch from the vendor &#x27;BIGFLYSPORTS&#x27; that I purchased it from?</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make a matching colonge.</li>
            <li> I am fussy about aftershave--i hate overpowering sents--</li>
            <li> smokes, this is bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, I and my wife absolutely loved the scent.  This time it&#x27;s ok, but almost has a completely different scent.  Baffling!</li>
            <li> Bought this one and the regular smelling aftershave.  I was disappointed with the other, but this one definitely lived up to my expectations!  Good job Aubrey Organics!</li>
            <li> Nice aftershave. Bayrum and pepper and other spices that&lt;br /&gt;have pleasant fragrances. Its soothing to my newly shaved face.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I think its a quality product&lt;br /&gt;well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Great cooling feel with very little burn. I got the spice island aftershave. Women WILL comment on the scent! They love it. Finally a bay rum that my wife likes! But not just bay rum, this is a complicated scent like I&#x27;ve never experienced. Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Kind of an urban earthy take on manliness! The price also is great.</li>
            <li> Grab a handful of cloves and boil them in water. Let cool and pour all over yourself....same effect for pennies...barf!</li>
            <li> Just aweful, my wife thinks it went bad. Smells like nothing but witch hazel!</li>
            <li> My husband is fussy about his aftershave. I am fussy about aftershave--i hate overpowering sents--I mean, that&#x27;s what carb cleaner is for, right? This is pretty much the only aftershave we can agree upon: clean, male and not cheap-smelling</li>
            <li> This is a must for the masculine natural man.  Women will LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve worn many bay rums and even make my own that&#x27;s had women compliment my scent.  I know good bay rum that women like.  Many years ago, Burt&#x27;s created a unique take on this scent with more exotic layers that made women (especially my goddess of a girlfriend) crazy, but they discontinued it after selling the company (and the reintroduction is not even close to the original).  Aubrey the wise and wonderful has made the closest thing on earth to Burt&#x27;s original blend and this smells so good like manly strength with an earthy mysteriousness.  Giving Aubrey their dues, the ingredients of all of their products are natural, healthy and gentle on the user and the environment.  Thank you Aubrey!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  Cap was loose, liquid had leaked all over the box which was wet and soft, the printing mostly dissolved and illegible, and starting to tear.  Level of liquid showed how much had leaked.  Bigger problem - NO FRAGRANCE AT ALL. Compared to the small amount remaining of my original bottle (purchased at Whole Foods, which no longer carries it) the stuff in the leaking bottle had as much smell as water.  No way to return the product because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hazardous liquid,&amp;#34; even if it was worth taking a chance on getting a decent replacement - or paying for return shipping.  Amazon site not helpful, either.</li>
            <li> I am shocked after trusting the other reviews at just how bad this product is. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Spice Island&amp;#34; that has sunk beneath a vast sea of witch hazel. No, in fact, witch hazel has more of an odor. Perhaps it was just a bad batch from the vendor &#x27;BIGFLYSPORTS&#x27; that I purchased it from? Perhaps not. All I know is that I definitely would not recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s completely useless. You would be better served splashing bottled water on your face - the odor would be similar, and at least you would know what the contents are. So, buy at your own risk and understand that, if like me, you find yourself disgusted, know that you can NOT return it due to Amazons policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent healing properties with a spicy perfume. Glycerin and other natural ingredients keep skin soft and fresh all day. Alcohol content is well balanced with other ingredients. It stings just the right amount. I will also try other lotions from Vitacost.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since it was an all-natural aftershave and from reviews people said it smelled really good.  In my opinion, it smells pretty gross.  It smells like liquor basically, so if that&#x27;s the scent you&#x27;re going for this is the product for you...</li>
            <li> I picked up some of this Spice Island after shave at a one of those warehouse outlets last Christmas. I actually tried it for it was so cheap compared to so many of the other mens scents there.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it how strong it was, and how long it lasted.  It was still noticeably fragrant on me hours after I used it.  The \\&quot;spice island\\&quot; as they call it is actually a form of bay rum, an old fashioned but still common after shave that comes in a lot of formulas.  But this particular lotion is a bit stronger and a little different than your average bay rum.  A spicier version that is really nice.  This after shave is well worth the price either for yourself,  or would make a nice gift for some man in your life that likes this sort of thing.  The bottle, the scent, and the strength in my opinion makes this after shave a real bargain that anyone not familiar with it would think cost much more.  I like it and recommend it here on Amazon...</li>
            <li> all natural ingredients, nice warm aroma perfect for winter season, no rash after tough shaves, I dislike the smell of the other evergreen type they sell, heavy splash of alcohol</li>
            <li> great scent, doesn&#x27;t last as long as alcohol based colognes but I expect that from organic products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have the normal burn with Big name brand liquid after shaves and has a pretty good scent</li>
            <li> WOW this is good stuff.  I would not say it&#x27;s a bay rum but it is pretty darn manly.  I&#x27;m not disappointed at all</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent.....I was hoping it would have some orange notes and maybe cinnamon but I am mostly just getting the clove and a little Vetiver which I now see are labeled on the bottle but I didn&#x27;t know that from the description before purchasing.  It has a nice burn to it when applying after shaving but I would rather not smell like a spiced ham when heading out the door in the morning.  Luckily, the scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of a Bay Rum aftershave. This one is very light with just a subtle smell of spice more than rum. Does not sting and goes on very smooth and cool. Can tell there is some moisturizing effect due to the witch hazel. All organic ingredients and is Vegan with no animal testing. Produced in Tampa Florida. Overall a good light aftershave for daily use. Scent actually lasts a long time at least four hours or so which is quite good for an aftershave.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately opened this after shave in my home on arrival to sample it. My action un-leashed a tsunami of smell so offensive I cannot imagine for a second that someone voluntarily put this &amp;#34;gutter swill&amp;#34; on their skin! I cannot possibly relate how awful the smell was l. I made another mistake following the mistake of taking the cap from this toxic brew. And that was to pour the stuff down my sink! It permeated my home nearly a full day or two even when I flushed my kitchen sink pipe with 1/2 a gallon of bleach. I threw the empty bottle away off my property even! I choose not to even see about a refund. I just wanted it gone and a days struggle to clear the air in my home with incense, cleaners, candles and the doors open finally made it habitable again!</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a smell that I personally do not like. It is as the name suggests, spicy. Very spicy. The quality of the liquid is very good, nothing wrong except the scent is just not for me. I&#x27;d really recommend trying to find this in a store to smell it before you buy it. I found an organic food type market near me that has all the scents from this brand and I will be buying one that I actually like.</li>
            <li> A great after shave, refreshing and leaves a pleasant scent. Too bad they don&#x27;t make a matching colonge. Does anyone know if there is a similar scented colonge?</li>
            <li> Our household has switched almost 100% to natural products. The last bastion is probably my shaving. So I said I&#x27;ll try this given  the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy smokes, this is bad! Other reviewers mentioned this is very masculine, and the women will love it. Well well well, to me (a 40 year old) it stinks as an old pharmacy (the smell of all those chemical when they prepared drugs), or better yet, as an old dentist office (that tooth powder smell from drilling and, again, all those chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just opened the bottle and my wife warned my she will leave the house if I used it - I needed some time by my self, so I did! My mother was visiting - all of the sudden she starts looking in the closet and the bathroom to see if the kids broke off a bottle of some house chemical or something... My kids reaction: &amp;#34;bleah daddy, we&#x27;re going outside with mommy, you go take a shower!&amp;#34; Which I had to do, as not even a gas mask would have helped ME, during my now peaceful afternoon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, this item is not returnable (If I sold this thing I would be happy I got rid off it, so I can&#x27;t blame them, I wouldn&#x27;t want it back either), so 10 more bucks down the drain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I gotta keep looking...</li>
            <li> This Aubrey product was a disappointment. Up to now all Aubrey products I&#x27;ve tried have been very good, but the scent of this aftershave could hardly be described as &#x27;spicy&#x27; - more like rubbing alcohol. Not a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Feels natural and not very harsh but not extremely crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> I BUY MORE EVERY FEW MONTHS.</li>
