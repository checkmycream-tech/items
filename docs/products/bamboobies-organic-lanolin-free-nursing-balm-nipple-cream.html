            <li>I love the product, but I can&#x27;t take it with me anywhere because it will seep out of the jar, making everything oily!!</li>
            <li>Real, healthy ingredients that work like magic!!</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li>It has worked amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and even doubles as a moisturizing lip balm!</li>
            <li>this is awesome stuff works so much better than lanolin  </li>
            <li>They are the most perfect combination and frankly anything with marshmallow is a done deal for me!!</li>
            <li>Best of luck with your new bundle of joy!!!</li>
            <li>This product was a huge help when my son was born, and the lactation consultant I saw even commented she was impressed by the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Loved the name, and the quality seems good.</li>
            <li>Everyone I have recommended this to have also loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>wife says this stuff is good for lips.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything for the soreness, it just makes your nipples not chapped and that&#x27;s good to prevent</li>
            <li>love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>OMG the best for the first 2-3months!</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth it and feels the best out of the creams I have used, plus it&#x27;s organic and made in the U.S.</li>
            <li>I think I had a better breastfeeding experience because of how well this product worked!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am really glad I stumbled on this balm!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this balm, it&#x27;s a life saver!</li>
            <li>I just ordered a bunch more!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Much better than lanolin, and the jar is good sized.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used (I have 3 childten).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this at all yesterday - and could honestly feel the difference today..</li>
            <li>the product itself is very easily spreadable.</li>
            <li>Works as described but has a very strong scent of olive oil that lingres for a while.</li>
            <li>Love how it soothed the pain of the dryness, and the fact that it is all organic made it even better!</li>
            <li>With continued use of coconut oil before pumping and Boobease after, I am much more comfortable!!</li>
            <li>That said, this is a good balm that is smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Best natural product for nipple soreness</li>
            <li>He nurses just fine either way!</li>
            <li>There are better products.</li>
            <li>I have coconut oil and that worked better to sooth the nipple than this.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>But, it made me SO much more comfortable!</li>
            <li>This balm really helps heal and soothe, and it&#x27;s great that you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off before feeding.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it every time after a feed.</li>
            <li>I used another product with my son and I love this one much better.</li>
            <li>I have been recommending this product to my mommy friends. :)</li>
            <li>No nasty smell</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff-</li>
            <li>Much better than lanolin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this product and will continue to use it since I will be having a winter baby.</li>
            <li>I love this over all the creams out there.</li>
            <li>My nipples haven&#x27;t been cracked at all and they are constantly being pumped or sucked on lol!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>my daughter enjoys the taste as well because it is safe to breastfeed with the product on.</li>
            <li>I gifted this to a friend and have never used this product myself</li>
            <li>, I feel that worked better</li>
            <li>love that it is organic</li>
            <li>also!&lt;br /&gt;And when you are done nursing you can use it on rug burns. :-)</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>Many laughs were had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, but you don&#x27;t get enough for the price.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the Earth Mama stuff more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is soo cute too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing it is organic and 100% safe for me and my baby.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li>so if your sore or irritated  it&#x27;s not going to cause you any more pain..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter and more malleable than the Mom &amp; Baby Balm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and shes using it on the baby&#x27;s lips too :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>It feels better than lanolin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is unscented and safe for the baby and doesn&#x27;t stain bras or reusable breast pads.</li>
            <li>Next day delivery was perfect.</li>
            <li>Really liked this product , but I liked the cocoa butter nipple cream I used with my first baby</li>
            <li>but well worth it!!</li>
            <li>Love that this product is natural and it works great.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this is a great product as it does not irritate.</li>
            <li>Being a mother of two and having had way more than my share of pain and cracking, it is my mission to help as many new moms have a GOOD nursing experience from day one.  </li>
            <li>My wife asked me to find an organic product, she used this product at the early stage of nursing, the baby didn&#x27;t reject it and she felt great.</li>
            <li>This balm is light weight, soothing, and safe for baby.</li>
            <li>but more important that she says they don&#x27;t hurt anymore</li>
            <li>It keeps me soft and soothed, and I greatly prefer the texture to lanolin.</li>
            <li>It goes on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li>it has almost no smell, does a good job moisturizing and helps keep overtired new mama breastfeeding nipples in tip top working shape.</li>
            <li>I liked it much better than other that I tried and it has a great effect healing the nipples.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly my NB</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are all naturally-derived and organic as I want to insure that the best, safest ingredients are coming in contact with my little one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very mild and non offensive and</li>
            <li>I read such great reviews of this, but the truth is I could probably make a better salve for myself at home.</li>
            <li>Worthy investment!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d comment on the neutral smell, but I&#x27;m sure every pregnant woman&#x27;s nose is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t get much relief, but I don&#x27;t think it was the balm&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>This balm is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I really liked this balm - Because it is thinner than the Lansinoh cream, it is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>Even today, the next day they look great.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product though kinda messy and a lot like vasoline</li>
            <li>story short, great stuff,  </li>
            <li>Not sticky, it&#x27;s really smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>his had a smooth texture and helped alleviate the redness and soreness to some extent.</li>
            <li>Get this and don&#x27;t turn back, also the breast pads are amazing!</li>
            <li>It works fine for mild dryness</li>
            <li>WOrth the money!</li>
            <li>I love the fact this is made from natural oils and is safe to use without washing off for the baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that this is organic and that I don&#x27;t have to clean it off before the baby feeds.  </li>
            <li>Then again,  I&#x27;m Italian so that could be why I liked it. :)</li>
            <li>I wanted to use something more natural than Lanolin (which I used with my 1st child) because I read about it not being that healthy to use</li>
            <li>This stuff is super smooth.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great for dry skin).</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s safe for the baby to &amp;#34;consume&amp;#34;, it was really convenient for her to just leave on and then go on about her day with her newborn.</li>
            <li>:) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>just use it all over on my actual breast because they&#x27;re getting stretch marks, and this product has shea butter in it, which is good for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this was the only thing that helped my nipple soreness!</li>
            <li>I am a first time mom &amp; I was trying to be super prepared to make breastfeeding easy &amp; this cream added no relief.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Im still pregnant.</li>
            <li>I could not have survived the first two months of breastfeeding without this!  </li>
            <li>what not crazy about the taste and would have to wait until it was totally absorbed to use that boob again or go ahead and wash it of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Love that its all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been breastfeeding for two months now and this balm has kept my nipples soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Works great to ease the cracked and sensitive feeling but the only reason I am giving it a three star is it stains your clothes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 30weeks pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t a clue if that&#x27;s true since most of her tips like, &amp;#34;take a left</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and Im very sensitive to smells, trust me.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all organic because if you had to nurse right after you put it on...it&#x27;s safe for baby to ingest because it&#x27;s made out if all natural food products such as olive oil.</li>
            <li>Costly but well worth the money spent, great all natural cream.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>My friend said the cream itself works fine for providing comfort during her nursing but the biggest plus for her was that, since it is all natural, she didn&#x27;t have to worry about wiping it off before feeding her baby.</li>
            <li>This balm does seem to stain my nursing pads, so just be aware of that.</li>
            <li>It cleared up within a couple of days and looked noticeably better after only one application!</li>
            <li>love it- makes a big difference!</li>
            <li>it really is a miracle !</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s my go to for now;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>my baby wasn&#x27;t a fan of the taste at first.</li>
            <li>this was great because the others were too thick and chunky.</li>
            <li>My little one is one month old today, and I will admit I do not use it after every feeding session, but when I do use it, it feels great.</li>
            <li>its all natural and its worth the money!</li>
            <li>This balm is so much better (and I love that it&#x27;s organic) and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stain\\&quot; clothing (at least it hasn&#x27;t for me yet).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much discomfort breastfeeding and actually used it as a diaper cream on my babies more.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, not rough on the nips.</li>
            <li>She has used various lanolin based products and tells me this product is far superior as far as comfort is concerned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small jar, but it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>I ended up with giant splits along the sides on top of the normal cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li>Live it!!</li>
            <li>The size of this balm is great,  a little goes a long way - I still probably have 2 more weeks left of it.  </li>
            <li>I have only heard good things about boob-ease and when I tried it, it was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Really has helped with cracking and redness.</li>
            <li>So much</li>
            <li>So after being in so much discomfort, I started using the Lansinoh lanolin and I was healed in about 3 days.</li>
            <li>I had a blister that was readily soothed and healed after using this product.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soothing and does the job of taking care of the nipple and the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t like it as much, Medela is cheaper and smoother</li>
            <li>but once I stopped using the boob ease, my nipples became very sore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY healing</li>
            <li>it is very soothing</li>
            <li>I had purchased the Motherlove nipple balm and was using that for a couple of weeks without much improvement.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>It smells like straight olive oil (one of the ingredients).</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s all natural and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have used on several different occasions with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Works way better than Lansinoh Lanolin!!</li>
            <li>I live in Aruba and it is so hot this month that I put the balm in the fridge, otherwise it is too liquidy.</li>
            <li>And they looked normal again!</li>
            <li>&amp; I like it better than all other nipple creams on the market...</li>
            <li>I love it for everything, especially dry chapped skin.</li>
            <li>This is much smoother, less sticky, more soothing and I haven&#x27;t had the staining issue.</li>
            <li>So, I obviously immediately ordered the full size.  </li>
            <li>A must have for new mommies breast feeding !</li>
            <li>all the stuff this company makes is high quality.</li>
            <li>Works fast and like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but that&#x27;s pretty much the only con I could think of.</li>
            <li>I loved these, but at around $12 for an ounce vs around 8 or so bucks for 2 ounces for other creams, I went with the other brand after the two containers I purchased were done.</li>
            <li>I tried this as a last resort but wished I had used it right away.</li>
            <li>which isa huge benefit over other nipple creams.</li>
            <li>It is too light to protect through a bath/shower, but is a must-have for every other time of day.</li>
            <li>My nipples can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s defense, I live in Arizona.  </li>
            <li>I was drawn to it because the ingredients are organic and all natural (no chemicals!).</li>
            <li>Oh, and im pretty sure this jar will last me a few months!</li>
            <li>Second time mom, first time breastfeeding and</li>
            <li>I have also used Lanolin that I got from the hospital, but prefer Book-ease way more (it&#x27;s just the lanolin is in a small tube that I leave in the diaper bag, so it&#x27;s convenient when I forget to pack Book-ease).  </li>
            <li>Smells pleasant to me (unscented but smells earthy to me), not super greasy, not sticky like lanolin can be, it just plain works.</li>
            <li>Great for breastfeeding Moms, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste for the Dads ;)</li>
            <li>I had been using L&#x27;Occitane Mom &amp; Baby Balm, which, don&#x27;t get me wrong, is amazing (I discovered it after I received my first tattoo</li>
            <li>Of course there is a certain amount of tenderness that comes with the first several weeks of breastfeeding no matter what you put on, but the boob ease had made a big difference for me.</li>
            <li>It really soothes well, but my only complaint is that it seems to dry and lose it&#x27;s effectiveness more quickly than lanolin, so I have to reapply often.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and actually calming to me (possibly just because of the association with comfort, but I appreciate it!).</li>
            <li>My baby is only a week old, so I haven&#x27;t had too much dryness or cracking yet,  </li>
            <li>I also like that it is made with natural ingredients, and I don&#x27;t have to wash it off before nursing.</li>
            <li>daughter hesitated for a few seconds the first time she fed after I used the balm,  so she may have been sensitive to the taste at first,  </li>
            <li>While I am unable to review the long-term effectiveness of this product (I am only one week into breastfeeding), so far I am happy with the relief that this product supplies.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a shortcut&amp;#34; are complete bull.</li>
            <li>and it honestly fixed it one night.</li>
            <li>This stuff kept my nipples too soft and didn&#x27;t allow them to toughen up.</li>
            <li>Very needed especially if you pump.</li>
            <li>So, yes it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li>My chapped skin is falling out slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>Mine were sore and pretty dry (not cracked though) and this stuff was like putting water on the nipple.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, without a mess or feeling extra waxy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to new mamas!</li>
            <li>I use this after every pumping session when I have to be away from my little one (working full time).</li>
            <li>I used this consistently for about the first month, and then occasionally if I started to get a little sore.</li>
            <li>I had excruciating pain and eventually developed a milk blister and this product while it helped some, was definitely not enough.</li>
            <li>Also, I wanted it wash it off before nursing, and that&#x27;s no fun when you&#x27;re already REALLY sore!</li>
            <li>Due to latch issues I have been exclusively pumping and developed very sore nipples, even with the proper sized breast shield.</li>
            <li>It really, really works and soothes the adjustment of having your little one at your breast so frequently.</li>
            <li>I could not get the dry skin to clear up!</li>
            <li>I was using this product for the first few days of BF.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the taste seemed to bother the baby the first few times</li>
            <li>and they were super dry and cracked and just plain gross.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>

            <li> This worked great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I can&#x27;t take it with me anywhere because it will seep out of the jar, making everything oily!!</li>
            <li> Real, healthy ingredients that work like magic!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing!</li>
            <li> It has worked amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and even doubles as a moisturizing lip balm!</li>
            <li> this is awesome stuff works so much better than lanolin  </li>
            <li> They are the most perfect combination and frankly anything with marshmallow is a done deal for me!!</li>
            <li> Best of luck with your new bundle of joy!!!</li>
            <li> This product was a huge help when my son was born, and the lactation consultant I saw even commented she was impressed by the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Loved the name, and the quality seems good.</li>
            <li> Everyone I have recommended this to have also loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> wife says this stuff is good for lips.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for the soreness, it just makes your nipples not chapped and that&#x27;s good to prevent</li>
            <li> love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> OMG the best for the first 2-3months!</li>
            <li> it is definitely worth it and feels the best out of the creams I have used, plus it&#x27;s organic and made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I think I had a better breastfeeding experience because of how well this product worked!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am really glad I stumbled on this balm!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this balm, it&#x27;s a life saver!</li>
            <li> I just ordered a bunch more!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Much better than lanolin, and the jar is good sized.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used (I have 3 childten).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this at all yesterday - and could honestly feel the difference today..</li>
            <li> the product itself is very easily spreadable.</li>
            <li> Works as described but has a very strong scent of olive oil that lingres for a while.</li>
            <li> Love how it soothed the pain of the dryness, and the fact that it is all organic made it even better!</li>
            <li> With continued use of coconut oil before pumping and Boobease after, I am much more comfortable!!</li>
            <li> That said, this is a good balm that is smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Best natural product for nipple soreness</li>
            <li> He nurses just fine either way!</li>
            <li> There are better products.</li>
            <li> I have coconut oil and that worked better to sooth the nipple than this.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> But, it made me SO much more comfortable!</li>
            <li> This balm really helps heal and soothe, and it&#x27;s great that you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off before feeding.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it every time after a feed.</li>
            <li> I used another product with my son and I love this one much better.</li>
            <li> I have been recommending this product to my mommy friends. :)</li>
            <li> No nasty smell</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff-</li>
            <li> Much better than lanolin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product and will continue to use it since I will be having a winter baby.</li>
            <li> I love this over all the creams out there.</li>
            <li> My nipples haven&#x27;t been cracked at all and they are constantly being pumped or sucked on lol!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> my daughter enjoys the taste as well because it is safe to breastfeed with the product on.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to a friend and have never used this product myself</li>
            <li> , I feel that worked better</li>
            <li> love that it is organic</li>
            <li> also!&lt;br /&gt;And when you are done nursing you can use it on rug burns. :-)</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Many laughs were had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, but you don&#x27;t get enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the Earth Mama stuff more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is soo cute too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing it is organic and 100% safe for me and my baby.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li> so if your sore or irritated  it&#x27;s not going to cause you any more pain..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter and more malleable than the Mom &amp; Baby Balm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and shes using it on the baby&#x27;s lips too :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> It feels better than lanolin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is unscented and safe for the baby and doesn&#x27;t stain bras or reusable breast pads.</li>
            <li> Next day delivery was perfect.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product , but I liked the cocoa butter nipple cream I used with my first baby</li>
            <li> but well worth it!!</li>
            <li> Love that this product is natural and it works great.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is a great product as it does not irritate.</li>
            <li> Being a mother of two and having had way more than my share of pain and cracking, it is my mission to help as many new moms have a GOOD nursing experience from day one.  </li>
            <li> My wife asked me to find an organic product, she used this product at the early stage of nursing, the baby didn&#x27;t reject it and she felt great.</li>
            <li> This balm is light weight, soothing, and safe for baby.</li>
            <li> but more important that she says they don&#x27;t hurt anymore</li>
            <li> It keeps me soft and soothed, and I greatly prefer the texture to lanolin.</li>
            <li> It goes on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> it has almost no smell, does a good job moisturizing and helps keep overtired new mama breastfeeding nipples in tip top working shape.</li>
            <li> I liked it much better than other that I tried and it has a great effect healing the nipples.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly my NB</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are all naturally-derived and organic as I want to insure that the best, safest ingredients are coming in contact with my little one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is very mild and non offensive and</li>
            <li> I read such great reviews of this, but the truth is I could probably make a better salve for myself at home.</li>
            <li> Worthy investment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d comment on the neutral smell, but I&#x27;m sure every pregnant woman&#x27;s nose is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t get much relief, but I don&#x27;t think it was the balm&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> This balm is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I really liked this balm - Because it is thinner than the Lansinoh cream, it is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Even today, the next day they look great.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product though kinda messy and a lot like vasoline</li>
            <li> story short, great stuff,  </li>
            <li> Not sticky, it&#x27;s really smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> his had a smooth texture and helped alleviate the redness and soreness to some extent.</li>
            <li> Get this and don&#x27;t turn back, also the breast pads are amazing!</li>
            <li> It works fine for mild dryness</li>
            <li> WOrth the money!</li>
            <li> I love the fact this is made from natural oils and is safe to use without washing off for the baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that this is organic and that I don&#x27;t have to clean it off before the baby feeds.  </li>
            <li> Then again,  I&#x27;m Italian so that could be why I liked it. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to use something more natural than Lanolin (which I used with my 1st child) because I read about it not being that healthy to use</li>
            <li> This stuff is super smooth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great for dry skin).</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s safe for the baby to &amp;#34;consume&amp;#34;, it was really convenient for her to just leave on and then go on about her day with her newborn.</li>
            <li> :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> just use it all over on my actual breast because they&#x27;re getting stretch marks, and this product has shea butter in it, which is good for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this was the only thing that helped my nipple soreness!</li>
            <li> I am a first time mom &amp; I was trying to be super prepared to make breastfeeding easy &amp; this cream added no relief.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Im still pregnant.</li>
            <li> I could not have survived the first two months of breastfeeding without this!  </li>
            <li> what not crazy about the taste and would have to wait until it was totally absorbed to use that boob again or go ahead and wash it of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Love that its all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breastfeeding for two months now and this balm has kept my nipples soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Works great to ease the cracked and sensitive feeling but the only reason I am giving it a three star is it stains your clothes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 30weeks pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t a clue if that&#x27;s true since most of her tips like, &amp;#34;take a left</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and Im very sensitive to smells, trust me.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all organic because if you had to nurse right after you put it on...it&#x27;s safe for baby to ingest because it&#x27;s made out if all natural food products such as olive oil.</li>
            <li> Costly but well worth the money spent, great all natural cream.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> My friend said the cream itself works fine for providing comfort during her nursing but the biggest plus for her was that, since it is all natural, she didn&#x27;t have to worry about wiping it off before feeding her baby.</li>
            <li> This balm does seem to stain my nursing pads, so just be aware of that.</li>
            <li> It cleared up within a couple of days and looked noticeably better after only one application!</li>
            <li> love it- makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> it really is a miracle !</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s my go to for now;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> my baby wasn&#x27;t a fan of the taste at first.</li>
            <li> this was great because the others were too thick and chunky.</li>
            <li> My little one is one month old today, and I will admit I do not use it after every feeding session, but when I do use it, it feels great.</li>
            <li> its all natural and its worth the money!</li>
            <li> This balm is so much better (and I love that it&#x27;s organic) and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stain\\&quot; clothing (at least it hasn&#x27;t for me yet).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much discomfort breastfeeding and actually used it as a diaper cream on my babies more.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, not rough on the nips.</li>
            <li> She has used various lanolin based products and tells me this product is far superior as far as comfort is concerned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small jar, but it lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> I ended up with giant splits along the sides on top of the normal cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Live it!!</li>
            <li> The size of this balm is great,  a little goes a long way - I still probably have 2 more weeks left of it.  </li>
            <li> I have only heard good things about boob-ease and when I tried it, it was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Really has helped with cracking and redness.</li>
            <li> So much</li>
            <li> So after being in so much discomfort, I started using the Lansinoh lanolin and I was healed in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I had a blister that was readily soothed and healed after using this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth, soothing and does the job of taking care of the nipple and the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like it as much, Medela is cheaper and smoother</li>
            <li> but once I stopped using the boob ease, my nipples became very sore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY healing</li>
            <li> it is very soothing</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Motherlove nipple balm and was using that for a couple of weeks without much improvement.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> It smells like straight olive oil (one of the ingredients).</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s all natural and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used on several different occasions with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Works way better than Lansinoh Lanolin!!</li>
            <li> I live in Aruba and it is so hot this month that I put the balm in the fridge, otherwise it is too liquidy.</li>
            <li> And they looked normal again!</li>
            <li> &amp; I like it better than all other nipple creams on the market...</li>
            <li> I love it for everything, especially dry chapped skin.</li>
            <li> This is much smoother, less sticky, more soothing and I haven&#x27;t had the staining issue.</li>
            <li> So, I obviously immediately ordered the full size.  </li>
            <li> A must have for new mommies breast feeding !</li>
            <li> all the stuff this company makes is high quality.</li>
            <li> Works fast and like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but that&#x27;s pretty much the only con I could think of.</li>
            <li> I loved these, but at around $12 for an ounce vs around 8 or so bucks for 2 ounces for other creams, I went with the other brand after the two containers I purchased were done.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a last resort but wished I had used it right away.</li>
            <li> which isa huge benefit over other nipple creams.</li>
            <li> It is too light to protect through a bath/shower, but is a must-have for every other time of day.</li>
            <li> My nipples can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s defense, I live in Arizona.  </li>
            <li> I was drawn to it because the ingredients are organic and all natural (no chemicals!).</li>
            <li> Oh, and im pretty sure this jar will last me a few months!</li>
            <li> Second time mom, first time breastfeeding and</li>
            <li> I have also used Lanolin that I got from the hospital, but prefer Book-ease way more (it&#x27;s just the lanolin is in a small tube that I leave in the diaper bag, so it&#x27;s convenient when I forget to pack Book-ease).  </li>
            <li> Smells pleasant to me (unscented but smells earthy to me), not super greasy, not sticky like lanolin can be, it just plain works.</li>
            <li> Great for breastfeeding Moms, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste for the Dads ;)</li>
            <li> I had been using L&#x27;Occitane Mom &amp; Baby Balm, which, don&#x27;t get me wrong, is amazing (I discovered it after I received my first tattoo</li>
            <li> Of course there is a certain amount of tenderness that comes with the first several weeks of breastfeeding no matter what you put on, but the boob ease had made a big difference for me.</li>
            <li> It really soothes well, but my only complaint is that it seems to dry and lose it&#x27;s effectiveness more quickly than lanolin, so I have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and actually calming to me (possibly just because of the association with comfort, but I appreciate it!).</li>
            <li> My baby is only a week old, so I haven&#x27;t had too much dryness or cracking yet,  </li>
            <li> I also like that it is made with natural ingredients, and I don&#x27;t have to wash it off before nursing.</li>
            <li> daughter hesitated for a few seconds the first time she fed after I used the balm,  so she may have been sensitive to the taste at first,  </li>
            <li> While I am unable to review the long-term effectiveness of this product (I am only one week into breastfeeding), so far I am happy with the relief that this product supplies.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a shortcut&amp;#34; are complete bull.</li>
            <li> and it honestly fixed it one night.</li>
            <li> This stuff kept my nipples too soft and didn&#x27;t allow them to toughen up.</li>
            <li> Very needed especially if you pump.</li>
            <li> So, yes it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li> My chapped skin is falling out slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Mine were sore and pretty dry (not cracked though) and this stuff was like putting water on the nipple.</li>
            <li> It applies easily, without a mess or feeling extra waxy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to new mamas!</li>
            <li> I use this after every pumping session when I have to be away from my little one (working full time).</li>
            <li> I used this consistently for about the first month, and then occasionally if I started to get a little sore.</li>
            <li> I had excruciating pain and eventually developed a milk blister and this product while it helped some, was definitely not enough.</li>
            <li> Also, I wanted it wash it off before nursing, and that&#x27;s no fun when you&#x27;re already REALLY sore!</li>
            <li> Due to latch issues I have been exclusively pumping and developed very sore nipples, even with the proper sized breast shield.</li>
            <li> It really, really works and soothes the adjustment of having your little one at your breast so frequently.</li>
            <li> I could not get the dry skin to clear up!</li>
            <li> I was using this product for the first few days of BF.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the taste seemed to bother the baby the first few times</li>
            <li> and they were super dry and cracked and just plain gross.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time breastfeeding my first two, and the creams never seemed to work.</li>
            <li> it really helped when i needed it and even though this is a small tub, it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> The top Lansolin brand is very sticky, hard to apply and sadly stained several shirts/bras of mine before I realized that it doesn&#x27;t come off in the wash.</li>
            <li> I only needed one jar, and I stretched it out as long as possible</li>
            <li> so it last a long time</li>
            <li> you get a lot of product, it should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> With our first baby, I used lanolin and hated that it ruined so many bras and shirts.</li>
            <li> I never felt like the Lansinoh really helped because it was so thick</li>
            <li> It just smells like olive oil a little bit but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I happened to get a sample of the Bamboobies and in one application my nipples were no longer dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was it was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Oh it feels so nice cold!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even nursing yet and am still pregnant, but was experiencing dry nipples (pregnancy is weird).  </li>
            <li> This product was a big let down.</li>
            <li> I have not once had chapped, dry, or soreness ever!</li>
            <li> I was having some &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;  with being very dry &amp; even cracking &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, but a bit thin so it doesn&#x27;t last if your nipples are really dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> So when i received it, I put some on, checked them out a few hours later.</li>
            <li> also this small bottle will last you a long time because only a small amount is needed to apply.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way as well</li>
            <li> I had to resort other lanolin products to relieve the pain and keep me sane.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me, because they&#x27;re just nursing pads, but you may want to be careful with your bras!</li>
            <li> Only bummer is that this is a small container</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product with my other 2 children.</li>
            <li> I have tried two other brands (medela and lanisoh)</li>
            <li> Wish I had had this product when I had my other kids...</li>
            <li> now i no longer ache due to breast feeding, but i still use it to lube the pump before use</li>
            <li> and i didnt have the melting problems that other people had.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over any other product to my friends.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> When she was a little kid, my sister-in-law got bit on her nipple (through her shirt) by a similarly aged little boy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gets a little melty, but i</li>
            <li> New moms: your nursing experience WILL be painful at least for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have used a different product because it only provided mediocre protection and healing.</li>
            <li> I used it during late pregnancy and plan to use it as long as I breast feed, it&#x27;s soothing and healing!</li>
            <li> A little goes a LOOONG way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> it was a little bottle</li>
            <li> For the price i paid for this item, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breastfeeding for a few weeks now and have suffered zero nipple issues by using this balm after each feeding.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t know what a difference it was making until I backed off of using it after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Currently living in Utah where it&#x27;s crazy dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one thing that this product helps relieve the raw after affects of breastfeeding</li>
            <li> (sometimes I forget to put it on at night) for the past week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small tub</li>
            <li> And when I tasted it, there was only a slight hint of olive oil,  which wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My daughter sucks her thumb and it started to get cracked and sore and this worked miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day</li>
            <li> The lanolin cream is too thick to apply to my sore nipples.</li>
            <li> , lanisoh is thick</li>
            <li> i mean it melts when you put it on but not in the bottle.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old baby had a terrible rash on his belly that turned into dry skin patches after healing.</li>
            <li> Seriously I will not breast feed a child without this.</li>
            <li> Thank god mine were just pajamas but still not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Literally within 24 hrs (usually within hrs!!)</li>
            <li> It heals my poor chapped nipples within a 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> And no I don&#x27;t have a poor latch, I&#x27;m also a nurse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells gross like olive oil, and my baby would make a disgusted face if she tasted it.</li>
            <li> I was wary of trying lansinoh because I have heard negative things about lanolin creams and also heard that it stains really bad.</li>
            <li> Since about week 20, my nipples have been dry, sore, and flaky, and it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it stinks like everyone else says.</li>
            <li> Uh oh she&#x27;s mad again, got to go.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this way before I actually needed and based my purchase on the reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d add my two cents- I love the fact this is made from natural oils and is safe to use without washing off for the baby.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very mild and non offensive and the product itself is very easily spreadable. It works fine for mild dryness but it didn&#x27;t work well enough for my nipple trauma. I had excruciating pain and eventually developed a milk blister and this product while it helped some, was definitely not enough. I had to resort other lanolin products to relieve the pain and keep me sane.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it now while using my breast pump and its been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing! I had such a hard time breastfeeding my first two, and the creams never seemed to work. I was always in pain. After getting this with my third I&#x27;ve had NO issues. NONE. No cracking, no pain, no bleeding, nothing. It has worked amazing!</li>
            <li> I was using this product for the first few days of BF. I wish I would have used a different product because it only provided mediocre protection and healing. There are better products.</li>
            <li> The problem with sore nipples when nursing is that you still have to nurse...so no matter how good the balm is, the nipples stay sore! Honestly, I didn&#x27;t get much relief, but I don&#x27;t think it was the balm&#x27;s fault. That said, this is a good balm that is smooth and not sticky. It did stain the inside of my tank but I guess that makes sense! I also had a different balm that seemed to breakdown in the heat...all the ingredients separated and it became grainy. This balm is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I read such great reviews of this, but the truth is I could probably make a better salve for myself at home. It&#x27;s natural, but a bit thin so it doesn&#x27;t last if your nipples are really dry and cracked. Mine were sore and pretty dry (not cracked though) and this stuff was like putting water on the nipple. I have coconut oil and that worked better to sooth the nipple than this. I won&#x27;t buy again. I&#x27;ll make myown.</li>
            <li> I wish I could add another star! This probably kept me from quitting. Even when the sooorrreeeness hit, it helps slide the nipple around in baby&#x27;s mouth for a proper latch. The lanolin hurt to put on, I was so tender- but this was perfect!</li>
            <li> Worked great helped heal my cracked sore nipples within a week! Would recommend to all breast feeding mothers. Will be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for a friend so I can&#x27;t comment on it from a personal stand point per se but I did ask her her thoughts on it so hopefully it will help some of ya&#x27;ll out there. I was drawn to it because the ingredients are organic and all natural (no chemicals!). My friend said the cream itself works fine for providing comfort during her nursing but the biggest plus for her was that, since it is all natural, she didn&#x27;t have to worry about wiping it off before feeding her baby. Since it&#x27;s safe for the baby to &amp;#34;consume&amp;#34;, it was really convenient for her to just leave on and then go on about her day with her newborn.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to find an organic product, she used this product at the early stage of nursing, the baby didn&#x27;t reject it and she felt great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. It&#x27;s the best nipple cream I&#x27;ve used. I put it on after every time I breastfeed. I especially like that you don&#x27;t have to wash it off before breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> I really liked this balm - Because it is thinner than the Lansinoh cream, it is much easier to apply. I also like that it is made with natural ingredients, and I don&#x27;t have to wash it off before nursing. The smell of this product doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and my baby doesn&#x27;t seem to notice a difference when I wear it. He nurses just fine either way! But, it made me SO much more comfortable! Having this cream has been wonderful! I never felt like the Lansinoh really helped because it was so thick and I didn&#x27;t feel like I could get it on. Also, I wanted it wash it off before nursing, and that&#x27;s no fun when you&#x27;re already REALLY sore! This balm does seem to stain my nursing pads, so just be aware of that. It didn&#x27;t bother me, because they&#x27;re just nursing pads, but you may want to be careful with your bras! I recommend this to any nursing mommy!</li>
            <li> Love how it soothed the pain of the dryness, and the fact that it is all organic made it even better! love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> This balm is light weight, soothing, and safe for baby. I use it after every feeding and bath/shower. It is too light to protect through a bath/shower, but is a must-have for every other time of day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one thing that this product helps relieve the raw after affects of breastfeeding but the fact that it&#x27;s organic/natural is the best.</li>
            <li> I actually got this because I have my nipples pierced and they were super dry and cracked and just plain gross. So when i received it, I put some on, checked them out a few hours later. And they looked normal again! Even today, the next day they look great. This is a wonderful product though kinda messy and a lot like vasoline but well worth it!!</li>
            <li> Didnt help at all. For the price i paid for this item, waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product was a huge help when my son was born, and the lactation consultant I saw even commented she was impressed by the ingredients. I used this consistently for about the first month, and then occasionally if I started to get a little sore. This balm really helps heal and soothe, and it&#x27;s great that you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off before feeding. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to new mamas!</li>
            <li> This balm is incredible. I love it for everything, especially dry chapped skin. My 8 month old baby had a terrible rash on his belly that turned into dry skin patches after healing. I could not get the dry skin to clear up! I tried this as a last resort but wished I had used it right away. It cleared up within a couple of days and looked noticeably better after only one application! Real, healthy ingredients that work like magic!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> My little one is one month old today, and I will admit I do not use it after every feeding session, but when I do use it, it feels great. I live in Aruba and it is so hot this month that I put the balm in the fridge, otherwise it is too liquidy. Oh it feels so nice cold!</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as Lansinoh</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it every time after a feed.</li>
            <li> Costly but well worth the money spent, great all natural cream.</li>
            <li> I like that this is organic and that I don&#x27;t have to clean it off before the baby feeds.  It really soothes well, but my only complaint is that it seems to dry and lose it&#x27;s effectiveness more quickly than lanolin, so I have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is a great product as it does not irritate.</li>
            <li> Really has helped with cracking and redness. Works fast and like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Love that this product is natural and it works great. I&#x27;ve been using it since my daughter was born. I used another product with my son and I love this one much better.</li>
            <li> Live it!! My daughter sucks her thumb and it started to get cracked and sore and this worked miracles. Have not used it as nipple cream but I can imagine it would be great.</li>
            <li> I am using it for before I deliver.  I have had some roughness on that area and this helps with that.</li>
            <li> Works as described but has a very strong scent of olive oil that lingres for a while. Not a big issue for me but it may turn off some moms and babies.</li>
            <li> With our first baby, I used lanolin and hated that it ruined so many bras and shirts. This balm is so much better (and I love that it&#x27;s organic) and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stain\\&quot; clothing (at least it hasn&#x27;t for me yet). I have been recommending this product to my mommy friends. :)</li>
            <li> My nipples can&#x27;t live without it lol. No nasty smell and I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! Great for breastfeeding Moms, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste for the Dads ;)</li>
            <li> My baby is only a week old, so I haven&#x27;t had too much dryness or cracking yet,  but my nipples have been sore (my daughter seems to think they are her chew toys!).  I just got my jar of balm in the mail today and already I can feel the difference! So much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter hesitated for a few seconds the first time she fed after I used the balm,  so she may have been sensitive to the taste at first,  but it didn&#x27;t stop her from feeding! And when I tasted it, there was only a slight hint of olive oil,  which wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.  Then again,  I&#x27;m Italian so that could be why I liked it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, great stuff,  love that it&#x27;s all natural and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Seriously I will not breast feed a child without this. Others say to use lanolin but I love love this product. I think I had a better breastfeeding experience because of how well this product worked!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and does what it says. I liked it much better than other that I tried and it has a great effect healing the nipples.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly my NB what not crazy about the taste and would have to wait until it was totally absorbed to use that boob again or go ahead and wash it of.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use something more natural than Lanolin (which I used with my 1st child) because I read about it not being that healthy to use so I purchased this nb. I started using this immediately after my daughter was born,  but after 2 weeks of using it religiously my nipples were sore, cracked, and bleeding. So after being in so much discomfort, I started using the Lansinoh lanolin and I was healed in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I had a blister that was readily soothed and healed after using this product. I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> OMG the best for the first 2-3months! after that I no longer needed anything because I healed/the ladies toughened up and got used to it! I only needed one jar, and I stretched it out as long as possible</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost everything with chemicals, so this product is perfect for me! It heals my poor chapped nipples within a 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Goes on smooth, not rough on the nips. Much better than lanolin, and the jar is good sized. Poverty good for breast feeding nipples!</li>
            <li> Cleared up my cracked nipples in days.  The only problem, is that I have a bunch left, and don&#x27;t need it.  It worked that well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- it has almost no smell, does a good job moisturizing and helps keep overtired new mama breastfeeding nipples in tip top working shape. Two months in and this stuff has helped prevent cracked nipples when used religiously. Only bummer is that this is a small container and you&#x27;ll go through it lickety split.</li>
            <li> love it- makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> Perfect for chapped nipples  I&#x27;ve bought 3</li>
            <li> I like that there&#x27;s no smell to it, it&#x27;s organic, and does make a difference in the nips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breastfeeding for a few weeks now and have suffered zero nipple issues by using this balm after each feeding. It really, really works and soothes the adjustment of having your little one at your breast so frequently. Worthy investment!</li>
            <li> This product helped me through the most difficult phase of breastfeeding. I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product with my other 2 children.</li>
            <li> Much better than lanolin. Baby had no reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This will be my 3rd time buying this!!!! I have not once had chapped, dry, or soreness ever! It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or slimy. It&#x27;s like butter is y he consistency. I love that it&#x27;s all organic because if you had to nurse right after you put it on...it&#x27;s safe for baby to ingest because it&#x27;s made out if all natural food products such as olive oil. I absolutely love this stuff and I will always buy this product with my next babies! :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I can&#x27;t take it with me anywhere because it will seep out of the jar, making everything oily!!</li>
            <li> Smooth, soothing and does the job of taking care of the nipple and the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> Currently living in Utah where it&#x27;s crazy dry and I&#x27;m 30weeks pregnant with my first child. Didn&#x27;t even think that my nipples would crack or get chapped and I came across this product. I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day (sometimes I forget to put it on at night) for the past week and I&#x27;ve noticed improvement. My chapped skin is falling out slowly but surely. I can only imagine results if I applied this religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the buy. One thing-- it does stain your bra. Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but that&#x27;s pretty much the only con I could think of. I&#x27;d comment on the neutral smell, but I&#x27;m sure every pregnant woman&#x27;s nose is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on week 36 of my pregnancy and my skin has fully healed! I am extremely satisfied with this product and will continue to use it since I will be having a winter baby.</li>
            <li> I love this over all the creams out there. The lanolin cream is too thick to apply to my sore nipples. This stuff is super smooth. I don&#x27;t think it stinks like everyone else says. It just smells like olive oil a little bit but nothing major. My nipples haven&#x27;t been cracked at all and they are constantly being pumped or sucked on lol! I love this stuff. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was it was a little smaller than I expected. Get this and don&#x27;t turn back, also the breast pads are amazing!</li>
            <li> Not sticky, it&#x27;s really smooth. Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used (I have 3 childten). It&#x27;s a small tub but it&#x27;ll last as you only need a tiny bit. Love it!</li>
            <li> Omg ! I recommend this to all breastfeeding moms. I have been breastfeeding for over a month now and I have used this product on my nipples since day one and it is just awesome. it feels great. my daughter enjoys the taste as well because it is safe to breastfeed with the product on. also this small bottle will last you a long time because only a small amount is needed to apply. i haven&#x27;t had any dryness, aches or pains or chaffed skin. it really is a miracle !</li>
            <li> Does just what the name says and I don&#x27;t have to worry about what my baby is ingesting. Doesn&#x27;t leave a grease stain either...which isa huge benefit over other nipple creams.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to a friend and have never used this product myself but she told me it works great. I personally like it because it&#x27;s organic and there are no worries when the baby is feeding that they&#x27;re getting something toxic.</li>
            <li> I used this when nursing and it seemed to offer relief. I would recommend it to a friend to use.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product , but I liked the cocoa butter nipple cream I used with my first baby , I feel that worked better</li>
            <li> Bought this for my breast feeding wife. Loved the name, and the quality seems good.</li>
            <li> While I am unable to review the long-term effectiveness of this product (I am only one week into breastfeeding), so far I am happy with the relief that this product supplies.  I still suffer from soreness and dryness/chapped nipples, but application of Boob-ease balm in-between feedings has helped and prevents scabbing.  I love that the ingredients are all naturally-derived and organic as I want to insure that the best, safest ingredients are coming in contact with my little one.</li>
            <li> I loved these, but at around $12 for an ounce vs around 8 or so bucks for 2 ounces for other creams, I went with the other brand after the two containers I purchased were done. If you have the $$ it is definitely worth it and feels the best out of the creams I have used, plus it&#x27;s organic and made in the U.S. I have tried two other brands (medela and lanisoh), lanisoh is thick so I don&#x27;t like it as much, Medela is cheaper and smoother so that&#x27;s my go to for now;)</li>
            <li> Wish I had had this product when I had my other kids...I might have succeeded at breastfeeding them! Literally within 24 hrs (usually within hrs!!) of using it my nipples were no longer sore. I have used on several different occasions with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Works way better than Lansinoh Lanolin!! Everyone I have recommended this to have also loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is organic also!&lt;br /&gt;And when you are done nursing you can use it on rug burns. :-)</li>
            <li> It is great not having to wipe off the cream before nursing.  Provides a lot of relief and I never had any cracking or bleeding!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who is breastfeeding. She has used various lanolin based products and tells me this product is far superior as far as comfort is concerned.</li>
            <li> I started using this from day 1 of breastfeeding but I didn&#x27;t know what a difference it was making until I backed off of using it after a few weeks. Until then I hadn&#x27;t had any problems with cracked or chapped nipples but once I stopped using the boob ease, my nipples became very sore. I immediately started using it again. Of course there is a certain amount of tenderness that comes with the first several weeks of breastfeeding no matter what you put on, but the boob ease had made a big difference for me. I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> this is awesome stuff works so much better than lanolin  must buy if you are breastfeeding  a little goes a long way as well so it last a long time</li>
            <li> When she was a little kid, my sister-in-law got bit on her nipple (through her shirt) by a similarly aged little boy. Once I heard the story, I ordered this as a gag gift. Many laughs were had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says this stuff is good for lips. I haven&#x27;t a clue if that&#x27;s true since most of her tips like, &amp;#34;take a left, it&#x27;s a shortcut&amp;#34; are complete bull.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, but you don&#x27;t get enough for the price. I ended up using the Earth Mama stuff more.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue that I have to wipe off before the next feeding. It&#x27;s VERY healing &amp; I like it better than all other nipple creams on the market... I&#x27;ve tried them all!!!</li>
            <li> I am a third time mom and have breastfed all of my babies! This is great nipple cream! It smells like olive oil but if you don&#x27;t mind that it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s just perfect. I was having some &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;  with being very dry &amp; even cracking &amp; Im still pregnant. I bought this and it honestly fixed it one night. The smell is very mild and Im very sensitive to smells, trust me. Read the ingredients!! They are the most perfect combination and frankly anything with marshmallow is a done deal for me!! ;) lol...yum.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for the soreness, it just makes your nipples not chapped and that&#x27;s good to prevent infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells gross like olive oil, and my baby would make a disgusted face if she tasted it. I like that you get a lot of product, it should last you a long time. The packaging is soo cute too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use it all over on my actual breast because they&#x27;re getting stretch marks, and this product has shea butter in it, which is good for stretch marks. But yeah, it&#x27;s just a moisturizer, that&#x27;s what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided me great relief when my baby was a newborn and it&#x27;s safe so you don&#x27;t have to wash it off before nursing.</li>
            <li> This is great for kids with allergies and eczema</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Smells pleasant to me (unscented but smells earthy to me), not super greasy, not sticky like lanolin can be, it just plain works. Oh, and im pretty sure this jar will last me a few months!</li>
            <li> This balm is simply awesome!! I use it paired with my Bamboobies and am very happy</li>
            <li> I have only heard good things about boob-ease and when I tried it, it was exactly what I expected! it really helped when i needed it and even though this is a small tub, it will last quite a while. WOrth the money!</li>
            <li> This stuff kept my nipples too soft and didn&#x27;t allow them to toughen up. I ended up with giant splits along the sides on top of the normal cracking and bleeding. I went back to lanolin.</li>
            <li> My neighbor recommended this product since lanolin wasn&#x27;t working well for me. This stuff is amazing. I feel better knowing it is organic and 100% safe for me and my baby. It applies easily, without a mess or feeling extra waxy. Great for helping with lubrication during pumping as well.</li>
            <li> New moms: your nursing experience WILL be painful at least for the first few weeks.  Being a mother of two and having had way more than my share of pain and cracking, it is my mission to help as many new moms have a GOOD nursing experience from day one.  I have tried everything out there and here&#x27;s my advice to you: get this cream and some Bamboobies nursing pads.  Use them from day 1 and you will never regret your decision.  Best of luck with your new bundle of joy!!!</li>
            <li> I like this balm and it is definitely soothing.  My only complaint is that it is a bit greasy.  I would describe it as an ointment rather than a balm.  Overall, I am happy with the product.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LOOONG way with this stuff. You will only need one jar.</li>
            <li> I like this balm it is very soothing however it stains your breast pads yellow and it does not come out</li>
            <li> Loved this! I didn&#x27;t have much discomfort breastfeeding and actually used it as a diaper cream on my babies more. It cleared up their rashes instantly.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for a nursing or pumping mothers.. Goes on nice and smooth so if your sore or irritated  it&#x27;s not going to cause you any more pain..</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this was the only thing that helped my nipple soreness! It helped heal as well! A must have for new mommies breast feeding ! Just use it after each feeding you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even nursing yet and am still pregnant, but was experiencing dry nipples (pregnancy is weird).  I had purchased the Motherlove nipple balm and was using that for a couple of weeks without much improvement.  I happened to get a sample of the Bamboobies and in one application my nipples were no longer dry and flaky.  So, I obviously immediately ordered the full size.  I am really glad I stumbled on this balm!</li>
            <li> .. but more important that she says they don&#x27;t hurt anymore and she&#x27;s happy - so I&#x27;m happy.  One idea: you should make a beer flavored version of this for when the breast feeding is over... Uh oh she&#x27;s mad again, got to go.</li>
            <li> i have a lanolin/wool sensitivity so this is the perfect alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the taste seemed to bother the baby the first few times so i wiped it off before feeding. now i no longer ache due to breast feeding, but i still use it to lube the pump before use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pregnant--30 weeks. Since about week 20, my nipples have been dry, sore, and flaky, and it&#x27;s awful. I had been using L&#x27;Occitane Mom &amp; Baby Balm, which, don&#x27;t get me wrong, is amazing (I discovered it after I received my first tattoo, it&#x27;s great for dry skin). But this? THIS. I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 days now. No dryness. No flakes. No soreness. It&#x27;s lighter and more malleable than the Mom &amp; Baby Balm.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. You need it. Get it.</li>
            <li> Very needed especially if you pump. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Key thing about nipple cream/balm to consider is how it goes on and comes off given how often you&#x27;ll be using it. The top Lansolin brand is very sticky, hard to apply and sadly stained several shirts/bras of mine before I realized that it doesn&#x27;t come off in the wash. This is much smoother, less sticky, more soothing and I haven&#x27;t had the staining issue. Totally worth the higher price. They could improve it by having packing of different dimensions - smaller vertical tubes is easier for diaper bags and travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her baby shower. She loves it! It&#x27;s 100% organic and shes using it on the baby&#x27;s lips too :)</li>
            <li> I went back to lanolin. This cream didn&#x27;t do a thing to my soar nipples. Using lanolin and Medela no contact shields healed everything in one day.</li>
            <li> So, yes it&#x27;s all natural...my baby wasn&#x27;t a fan of the taste at first. It smells like straight olive oil (one of the ingredients). I am a first time mom &amp; I was trying to be super prepared to make breastfeeding easy &amp; this cream added no relief. Still feels like my son is an alligator every time he initially latches on. And no I don&#x27;t have a poor latch, I&#x27;m also a nurse. This product was a big let down.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was wary of trying lansinoh because I have heard negative things about lanolin creams and also heard that it stains really bad. This stuff does not and it feels great when things get tender. Second time mom, first time breastfeeding and I would suggest this cream to everyone.</li>
            <li> Best stuff my wife has ever used!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone! Organic and no need to wipe off before nursing as it&#x27;s made out of food.</li>
            <li> This worked great. I traded off with the lanonlin and this product. this absorbs well and i didnt have the melting problems that other people had. i mean it melts when you put it on but not in the bottle. it was a little bottle but it has lasted me 5 months now and I still have a ton left. Love that its all natural.</li>
            <li> Love this! Best thing for sore or cracked nipples!</li>
            <li> This is the only nipple balm that helped me. Due to latch issues I have been exclusively pumping and developed very sore nipples, even with the proper sized breast shield. With continued use of coconut oil before pumping and Boobease after, I am much more comfortable!! Lanolin was not doing the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this balm, it&#x27;s a life saver! I used it during late pregnancy and plan to use it as long as I breast feed, it&#x27;s soothing and healing!</li>
            <li> Best natural product for nipple soreness</li>
            <li> i tried three brands. this was great because the others were too thick and chunky. his had a smooth texture and helped alleviate the redness and soreness to some extent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Love that it is organic. Actually used it as a diaper cream a couple times. seems to do the trick</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I brought it to the hospital with me so was using from day 1. Never had cracked nipples or problems and I think using this helped. Should use After rubbing breastmilk and air drying.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and even doubles as a moisturizing lip balm!</li>
            <li> I could not have survived the first two months of breastfeeding without this!  I was in a ton of pain before I started using this product and recommend it to all my friends who are expecting. It feels better than lanolin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve been breastfeeding for two months now and this balm has kept my nipples soft and healthy. I just ordered a bunch more!</li>
            <li> Truly soothing! I use this after every pumping session when I have to be away from my little one (working full time). It keeps me soft and soothed, and I greatly prefer the texture to lanolin. It goes on much more smoothly. It&#x27;s a small jar, but it lasts a good while. The scent is mild and actually calming to me (possibly just because of the association with comfort, but I appreciate it!). I use this balm three times a day when working and wouldn&#x27;t go without!</li>
            <li> Works great to ease the cracked and sensitive feeling but the only reason I am giving it a three star is it stains your clothes. Thank god mine were just pajamas but still not pleasant.</li>
            <li> My lactation consultant stocks this in her office and recommends it over lanolin because this stuff actually soothes and heals. (Lanolin just sits on the surface and keeps the outer layer soft.)&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented and safe for the baby and doesn&#x27;t stain bras or reusable breast pads.</li>
            <li> I have been breastfeeding for 3 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t use this at all yesterday - and could honestly feel the difference today.. my nipples didn&#x27;t crack or anything but were sore.  I have also used Lanolin that I got from the hospital, but prefer Book-ease way more (it&#x27;s just the lanolin is in a small tube that I leave in the diaper bag, so it&#x27;s convenient when I forget to pack Book-ease).  The size of this balm is great,  a little goes a long way - I still probably have 2 more weeks left of it.  My only complaint is that it gets a little melty, but i it&#x27;s defense, I live in Arizona.  I would recommend this over any other product to my friends.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, can&#x27;t live without it! its all natural and its worth the money! all the stuff this company makes is high quality.</li>
            <li> Next day delivery was perfect. Great product!</li>
