            <li>want to thank the seller for being very quick on responses when I had questions because I didn&#x27;t understand something</li>
            <li>The clear bag was a nice touch when I want to take all three products but don&#x27;t want the clutter!</li>
            <li>I also love love love the smell of this :) and this definitely lasts longer than one month for me!</li>
            <li>, super excited I have a friend who sells this line who had given me samples</li>
            <li>This product if used twice in a day keeps it calm and smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the moisturizer so much that I decided to try the kit.</li>
            <li>These are the full size products.</li>
            <li>boy I should&#x27;ve bought them the first time!</li>
            <li>and they are worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far</li>
            <li>I am loving this product, my skin feels nic after following the 3 step process.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice but the actual face wash dries out my skin and everytime you wash</li>
            <li>The kit works nice, but the moisturizer is definitely on my favorites list right now</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>I was floored and ecstatic to be able to get it at a regular price again!</li>
            <li>Most products either just don&#x27;t work or they do a little good but dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin really nice and soft to the touch and helped with my acne back in the days (before Proactive was discovered).</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have really acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>and i was amazed that it really did balance my oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>you have to use the whole set or else</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see what it&#x27;s doing for my skin.</li>
            <li>So excited I have my Artistry back!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was 17 years old pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>and i love the scent too, smells very fine and expensive.</li>
            <li>More like two and a half to three.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended the hydrating face set that has orange flowers.  </li>
            <li>One of my high school schoolmate told me month ago \\&quot;How</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this instead of the normal acne medication.</li>
            <li>so I suggest shaking the toner to make sure all of the product is white colored and not clear or else</li>
            <li>She has said many times that this has been the only product that has helped her prevent breakouts (with a balanced diet and limited sugar intake also).  </li>
            <li>and I want to thank them for being so professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old and still fighting acne.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brand before and WOW.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s aging my skin instead of helping keep it young.</li>
            <li>can not say if it is the cosmetics itself or the sunscreen in it, but I know that if will make your skin soft immediately and prevent wrinkles over time.</li>
            <li>You could use a very small amount of the product and still see the benefits right from the first use.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of different products for my sensitive skin type.</li>

            <li> the lotion (step 3 ) turned really icky idk if it&#x27;s because of the sunscreen or its expired</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products over the past 15 years!</li>

            <li> Excellent products! Been using it for years and they are worth giving a try. You will get addicted! I love it and i love the scent too, smells very fine and expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good seller. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This kit works good to keep my skin clean, it helps leave your skin feeling moisturizing, but not oily. I used the moisturizer previously with basis face wash and witch hazel for toner and received similar results. I enjoyed the moisturizer so much that I decided to try the kit. The kit works nice, but the moisturizer is definitely on my favorites list right now and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products over the past 15 years!</li>
            <li> I bought the hydrating system.  It was too hydrating.  I bought this, and my skin began to peel!  I found a good balance between the hydrating cleanser, the hydrating toner, and they balancing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for about 9 years and loves it.  I only gave it 4 stars because the shipper/seller was extremely slow.</li>
            <li> Is the best pproduct that i been used</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of different products for my sensitive skin type. This product if used twice in a day keeps it calm and smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Artistry products keep my skin hydrated. You could use a very small amount of the product and still see the benefits right from the first use. And thye last longer too!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great products. It&#x27;s hard to find people that sell Artistry so I was glad I found it on here. I received it quickly and at a great price. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is absolutely wonderful for my facial skin. As long as you use it every day it&#x27;s very effective and I have had noticeable differences in my skin, my boyfriend even makes comments about how good it looks.&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the seller for being very quick on responses when I had questions because I didn&#x27;t understand something and I want to thank them for being so professional. Also the quickness that they were able to get the product out to me was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this through a friend that gave me their price when they worked with Amway, as a favor. It was a great way for me to try the product and realize how great it worked on my skin and how much I loved it! Once they left the business I couldn&#x27;t afford $70 for the set so I had to find store brand face wash, nothing compared. When I found the set on Amazon I was floored and ecstatic to be able to get it at a regular price again! So excited I have my Artistry back!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old and still fighting acne.  I&#x27;ve tried everything. Most products either just don&#x27;t work or they do a little good but dry my skin out. The Artistry Essentials Balancing system cleared my pores, smoothed my skin and moisturizes without making it greasy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used! I have really acne prone skin and it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that I really like. I&#x27;ve used anything from over-the-counter like at Walmart and also I tried skin ID, proactive, And even birth control to help. and it all works for a little bit but the acne ends up coming back. I also love love love the smell of this :) and this definitely lasts longer than one month for me! More like two and a half to three. I wash my face once a day.</li>
            <li> Great product so far, but it&#x27;s too soon to leave a 5 star rating as of yet.  I love this product so far and it has my skin looking amazing already.  I have less pimples than I would normally have.</li>
            <li> My friend once tried selling me these products but I refused, boy I should&#x27;ve bought them the first time! They worked wonders on keeping my face demons away and clearing up my face over all. The clear bag was a nice touch when I want to take all three products but don&#x27;t want the clutter! A little goes a long way for all three and for the toner, for some reason it gets sort of separated when it is left sitting overnight so I suggest shaking the toner to make sure all of the product is white colored and not clear or else the white color stays at the bottom</li>
            <li> This product gave me a break out l. I&#x27;ve stopped using it .</li>
            <li> I am loving this product, my skin feels nic after following the 3 step process. Hoping to get rid of my skin problems.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. It only made my skin worse. Everyone keeps telling me that I had to wait for a couple of weeks to see the result but in just one week the product gave me irreversible damage. I am only saying that this product did not work for me. My mom&#x27;s friends have said that it worked wonders for their skin. So here is my advice, talk to a dermatologist BEFORE using anything that you have doubts on. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Like the after sensetion</li>
            <li> Great product. 100% pleased. Will recommend to anyone. The smell is luxurious. Dont think twice buy product. My skin is not so oily anymore</li>
            <li> Everything is good except for poor packaging and slow delivery. LOVE the cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before so I knew what I was getting. Good moisture without oily skin. I find it best to put it on at night, even though it has &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before and WOW. This has been the best thing for my skincare. I highly recommend trying this instead of the normal acne medication.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. It&#x27;s ok and does keep my skin from getting all oily and shiny, but both toner and lotion reek of alcohol. My skin is not smooth and it does nothing to moisturize. I feel like it&#x27;s aging my skin instead of helping keep it young. Will not be buying again. ********************************************************* Update. After having used up this set I&#x27;ve decided to upgrade my rating from 3 to 4 stars. It is not perfect, but not as bad as I originally thought. It does a good job at keeping the oil under control and protecting from the sun, however, it still did not give me the luxurious feel. I went back to Beauticontrol Spa Facial set.</li>
            <li> I havent begun using this product yet still trying to finish whats left of my current skincare, super excited I have a friend who sells this line who had given me samples and i was amazed that it really did balance my oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Excellent.  These are the full size products. Very affordable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> I used this product and my skin began to decorate. and it was itching. I Don&#x27;t recommended....Is not really from Amway is fake..</li>
            <li> The smell is quite nice but the actual face wash dries out my skin and everytime you wash you have to use the whole set or else my face just feels really dry. I dont use this everyday bc it dries up my skin too mich. I wouldny recommend it unless u have exstremly oily skin. I would highly recommended the hydrating face set that has orange flowers.  Update: the lotion (step 3 ) turned really icky idk if it&#x27;s because of the sunscreen or its expired but it turned all watery.</li>
            <li> Works great for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. My complexion is alot clearer since I have been using this cleanser along with toner and moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 17 years old pretty much every day. It has made my skin really nice and soft to the touch and helped with my acne back in the days (before Proactive was discovered). Now I am 35 and I have noticeably less wrinkles than my pears. One of my high school schoolmate told me month ago \\&quot;How come you have no wrinkles\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I can not say if it is the cosmetics itself or the sunscreen in it, but I know that if will make your skin soft immediately and prevent wrinkles over time. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> My fiance recently ordered this product as she has been using this skin cleanser for some time.  She has said many times that this has been the only product that has helped her prevent breakouts (with a balanced diet and limited sugar intake also).  I know she can feel discouraged with oily skin, and this product seems to work wonderfully for her!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see what it&#x27;s doing for my skin.</li>
    </ol>
