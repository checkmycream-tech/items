            <li>, You guys are awesome Thanks for put out a Product for the Young and old :)</li>
            <li>I have used many moisturizers and this one has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite moisturizer the first time I bought it</li>
            <li>It is rich so</li>
            <li>It feels so rich on my skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully rich cream.  </li>
            <li>Omg just got this today was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my makeup looks when I apply this cream first.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer so much!  </li>
            <li>and I have seen significant changes on my face.</li>
            <li>First off, I love the jar.</li>
            <li>Getting closer to yet another birthday, I wanted to have a nice option for a new face cream.</li>
            <li>I removed my makeup and used face-wipes to clean the skin I was going to moisturize.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to add that my skin has an amazing glow to it, silky smooth and it has helped to hid the wrinkles near my eyes.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is by far a wonderful facial cream to have in your beauty collection.</li>
            <li>For me, this cream has excellent texture and absorbs quickly- from areas of small application it is calming.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent but not one that&#x27;s very noticable unless you stick our nose in the jar.</li>
            <li>I really like the way the container looks and am excited to see how well it moisturizes my skin :)</li>
            <li>Other than that, it goes on nicely and absorbes nicely.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone &amp; sensitive skin...and this product has been quite amazing.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I love the way it makes my skin feel so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and this really keeps my skin moisturized as I need.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, lovely packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several compliments on how good my skin looks and</li>
            <li>It smells good and there is no left over residue feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>I was ready for &amp;#34;just another moisturizer&amp;#34; but have to admit I am pleased with the outcome of this cream over time.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what to say about dramatically different skin because I am not seeing that, but to be fair</li>
            <li>Overall, it is nice for someone who wants to give their skin a nice glow, but do not expect a &#x27;miracle.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It feels cool and non greasy.</li>
            <li>looks so good you look younger</li>
            <li>It dissipated after a while, but when I first applied it, the scent was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>The size is extremely ample and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first because all of the reviews talked about how creamy and wonderful this cream was...and they were right.  </li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Since the first use, I have noticed how silky smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling cool &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the pure natural ingredients and secondly I love the result.</li>
            <li>This for sure will be my go to for moisturizer on my sensitive acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product !!</li>
            <li>It is a very light weight cream that spreads evenly and absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>and this really helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>For a reasonable cost, my skin looks moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you do not like a heavy and think cream like moisturizer then this is a great one for you.</li>
            <li>Great for winter since it is slightly heavy.</li>
            <li>that is just a FEW of its great ingredients!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how soft my face is now, it has repaired the sun damage.</li>
            <li>and I love the soft scent.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft before and smooth before!  </li>
            <li>The instant lift is nice and though it will take some time to truly test the results, it feels like it is  </li>
            <li>As for the product itself, upon opening I was pleased it wasn&#x27;t overly fragrant since my skin is quite sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I felt my face immediately absorbed it in.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and absorbed immediately by the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s watery and lightweight, not oily, the creme leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft, it gives your skin the silky smooth radiance.</li>
            <li>love how soft my face feels after using this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like my face, is fresher more alive.</li>
            <li>Plus as I did not tell my boyfriend and waited to see if he would recognize the difference, he,not always the most detail attentive boyfriend in the world asked 1) if I &amp;#34;did something different with my hair?&amp;#34; (I did not)</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin feels after a few days of use, love this product.</li>
            <li>and i have not seen any changes at all, i bought this product based on Customer&#x27;s review, to me i have not received my money worth</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>This cream seems to work better than I expected.i have extremely sensitive skin,and have had NO issues.it has vitamin c,which I look for in beauty creams.</li>
            <li>Also the fact that I&#x27;m using all natural products makes me feel better to use it on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is made for natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Price not bad when on sale BUT can find on EBay much cheaper!</li>

            <li>I love the fact that it is unscented unlike many of the other types of cremes</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!</li>
            <li>It is light or clean scented, not harsh.</li>
            <li>and when I first used it one of the things that I noticed and loved was the fact that it was so light and didnt leave my face feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Also the ingredients in the cream shocks me in a good way, almost all of them are extremely beneficially to your skin.</li>
            <li>Love the product, high quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love that it has some great super fruits such as Camu Camu, Noni, Goji, Acai, and Green Tea.</li>
            <li>right in</li>

            <li>The cream is not greasy, really keeps the skin soft, and has a soft fragrance that smells good.</li>

            <li>I have been using this wonderful Anti-Aging Face Cream from Live Ultimate for a few months now along with Live Ultimate Camu Advanced Youth Recovery Serum and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>it works very very well for me , i think it all depends on the type of skin you have .</li>
            <li>It has left my skin very smooth and not overly greasy.</li>
            <li>I am liking this product very much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much at all.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very gentle for all ages of skin.</li>
            <li>what more can I say other than it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice daily and love the way it goes on without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>ok not much different</li>
            <li>I am able to wear this cream under neath basic bb cream or MAC foundation and it does not alter the make up</li>
            <li>is doing exactly what it proclaims.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first opened the jar and got some on my finger</li>
            <li>First and foremost hydration is key--so I drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li>I have been using this since the first day it day</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me after I realized how soft and smooth</li>
            <li>would love it if this moisturizer contained SPF, as I do include sun protection in my daily skin care regime.  </li>
            <li>I could feel it start to tighten my &amp;#34;loose chin&amp;#34; with the first application.</li>
            <li>I can feel how soft and smooth my skin gets after applying it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>You will love this Fruitscription Cream,and make it part of your daily regimen!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Noticeable with first use.</li>
            <li>Feel light and natural.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t say anything, and the first time my husband used it he remarked on how watery the product was as well.</li>
            <li>Once I run out I will be back for more of this,</li>
            <li>, I just started using it, so maybe I just need more time with this product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Switched to Olay Regenerist products and noticed changes first night.</li>
            <li>My face feels more hydrated and smootg , i would definitely recommend thus Anti Aging cream to anyone in search of one!</li>
            <li>I liked the very thin consistency because it absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, but the only thing it did for my face is make my pores large.</li>
            <li>After just a few days i could tell a huge difference and my skin looks 100times better.</li>
            <li>With many anti aging cream out there I really love this one the camu complex.</li>
            <li>This product really does wonders..ordered it again after using it for the first time..</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this cream and will be a life long user.</li>
            <li>I applied a small amount on my face and rubbed it in really good.</li>
            <li>The quality is high and the quantity is just right.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, I have not used it long enough to really know.</li>
            <li>It is well made more than many other commercial creams.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and even at 36 still break out.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t break me out even though I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This can easily replace my Vitamin C.  One jar could last atleast two months.</li>
            <li>However, I need more moisture than this provides and at the end of the day leaves my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li>The places where I experience the most dryness have not been dry at all.  </li>
            <li>After the very first use, my skin felt so soft.</li>

            <li>It is not heavy and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using this cream, I have to say that my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>All I can say is my skin feels amazing after using this for just a few days.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I am starting to get compliments from others!</li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin which I hoped for.</li>

            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>Feel free to read the ingredients last</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thin and feels great.</li>
            <li>It leave the skin very moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li>the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>+ is too much-</li>
            <li>Did not notice much of anything.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>its great and my secret from  my girls.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It only takes me a dab on each cheek and forehead to cover my entire face nicely.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are very good for my skin; they include: goji extract, coffee seed, acai, pomegranate, green tea and aloe (among other ingredients)    </li>
            <li>, it is just right in the texture, and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>It does not leave your face greasy like many other creams do.</li>
            <li>nothing special about this lotion-skin felt and looked the same as it did with store brand-off the shelf lotion</li>
            <li>I love that it dries up within less than a minute and that I dont feel</li>
            <li>No break outs-my main concern</li>
            <li>This Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer Vitamin C cream not only leaves your face feeling smooth and soft but the texture leaves my face feeling radiant.</li>
            <li>Most facial creams come in tiny jars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I have high expectations for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The packaging is high end.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s never to early to stop the antiaging process!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick texture that you have to massage into your skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and gentle on my skin, the cream does not cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>This product says to use it on clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick moisturizer</li>
            <li>cleansed my face as I would normally, then applied this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so I am hoping it will last a long time :-)</li>
            <li>The consistency was a lot thicker than normal too.</li>
            <li>I love that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent to it.</li>
            <li>so I only use 2 dimes worth 3x a month.</li>
            <li>There was twice as much product in the jar as most of the other manufacturers of the same type product give to you.  </li>
            <li>Not as rich and creamy as expected.</li>
            <li>I could live without this.  </li>
            <li>I actually have good skin at age 45 and have hardly EVER used any moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>The cream is extremely light and rich-feeling, it only takes a tiny bit to use!</li>
            <li>This had NO negative effects with the first or any subsequent applications.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice subtle smell from the fruits in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>The cream leaves your skin matte, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Product makes my skin very soft and firmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels tighter and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I also love that just a little bit is enough for my whole face</li>
            <li>I think it helped clear my skin up too!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Seroiusly soft!</li>
            <li>i apply after washing my face at night and i wake to beautifully soft and radiant face!</li>
            <li>and I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are definitely less noticeable and the tinted color evens out the imperfections and flaws in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seems to make my fine lines less defined, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>my  skin feels so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>Definitely not liking my first use.</li>
            <li>My dark spots from blemishes are almost gone, my face looks more radiant, and the pores on my face has gotten smaller.</li>
            <li>I used a portion of cream about the size of a large pea and it covered my entire face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for me for a day cream, but not rich enough for the night.</li>
            <li>I love that these little tiny lines I&#x27;ve been noticing around my lips and eyes are fading as well!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is far from that and has a sweet yet subtle scent that you are not afraid to wear all day.</li>
            <li>They smell nice but many left my face greasy, I had a bad reaction or it did not keep the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li>The texture is too clear and I have to dip my finger twice in the jar, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old now and experiencing skin problems that come with aging.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable but if it goes back to the $60 range, I cannot afford it.</li>
            <li>I am retired on a fixed income so this is a luxury item for me.</li>
            <li>I apply this cream directly onto my face after I cleanse in the morning and and night.</li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes I touched the skin on my face and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li>so baby Soft</li>
            <li>could tell that it really is going to help with the aging effects, especially on my neck area.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer lease my face feeling soft immediately.</li>
            <li>My skin has changed completely, it looks way healthier now.</li>
            <li>I definitely would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my Camu complex moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It really soft, creamy.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft but not greasy...</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients and leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I rubbed it in smooth,circular motions all over my face and neck after cleaning and it gave me baby soft feeling skin that stayed moisturized and not looking or feeling oily.</li>
            <li>but once it does, it looks and feels completely natural.</li>
            <li>Took the redness out of my face and made it baby skin soft</li>
            <li>I apply at night also before bed when I remove my make-up for extra moisturizer because in Wisconsin you really need it with the weather.</li>
            <li>My face stays soft and moist (not greasy)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this cream did not irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li>I like the product so far.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>As for the long term benefits of making you look younger, I do not know yet if that is true.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so light and soft feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent to it either like a lot of cream moisturizers do.  </li>
            <li>It was nice and thin for under makeup, but if you are looking for the miracle cream here, KEEP LOOKING.  </li>
            <li>I rub a thin layer onto my face and neck every morning and it feels nice</li>
            <li>and it come in a pretty big far for a facial cream.</li>
            <li>Love the very faint smell, not too overpowering, and that it is light and creamy, and does not leave your face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different anti aging creams and none of them seem to do what I was exactly looking for until now.</li>
            <li>, you only need a tiny bit which goes a long ways, absorbs quickly making my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>For the past month I have been using this fantastic product</li>
            <li>I have used a few other anti aging creams before and this one definitely is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Live Ultimate!</li>
            <li>I am always in the market for a new moisturizer especially they \\&quot;Anti</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to buy again unless I notice a real change to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>However, the one I recently received had a yellowish tint to it (it used to be white) and was very sticky.</li>
            <li>I do prefer a heavy cream for night, but cannot use those in the day since it causes my skin to get greasy quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizer to put on in the morning and decided to try this product because it has the touch of foundation in it.&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, it sounded pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so many creams are too heavy or not thick enough and your skin feels tight within an hour.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely watery (like a really cheap hand lotion), and left my face feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the claimed results, but it looks promising.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised how big the jar was!  </li>
            <li>but apparently they work together to produce the desired results.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of firmness to my skin to give it that little lift it needs in the morning as well.</li>
            <li>When it comes down to creams and lotions I am very picky because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product has truly become a fixture in my nightly routine to help defy the signs of the aging process that we are all trying slow down on our own bodies.</li>
            <li>My skin had been dry and dull because of using so many acne antibiotics and cream</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and due to the oily skin I get surface bumps and with using this product I have noticed</li>
            <li>I have oily skin already,and I definitely do not need a product to make that issue more worse</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t yet noticed any major results after using daily for a couple weeks now but hoping it does!...</li>
            <li>, I do highly recommend buying this product for anyone wanting to try something that meets in the middle between oily and dry skin to be use on both types.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes seem to be a little less noticeable also.  </li>
            <li>I am always a little cautious with any creams or anything I put on my skin as my skin is very sensitive, especially with new substances.</li>
            <li>My skin reacts well to Camu Complex, it quickly absorbs the nutrients and makes me glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way as well, so I put it on and I can apply my makeup right after or just apply and go.  </li>
            <li>contains Vitamin C from CAMU CAMU,  Aloe, Pure Green Tea Extract  Collagen and Shea Butter..</li>
            <li>There was nothing bad about it, nor anything good.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like the complex.</li>

            <li> and I have seen significant changes on my face.</li>
            <li> First off, I love the jar.</li>
            <li> Getting closer to yet another birthday, I wanted to have a nice option for a new face cream.</li>
            <li> I removed my makeup and used face-wipes to clean the skin I was going to moisturize.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to add that my skin has an amazing glow to it, silky smooth and it has helped to hid the wrinkles near my eyes.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is by far a wonderful facial cream to have in your beauty collection.</li>

            <li> It has a very light scent but not one that&#x27;s very noticable unless you stick our nose in the jar.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the container looks and am excited to see how well it moisturizes my skin :)</li>
            <li> Other than that, it goes on nicely and absorbes nicely.</li>

            <li> I was ready for &amp;#34;just another moisturizer&amp;#34; but have to admit I am pleased with the outcome of this cream over time.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what to say about dramatically different skin because I am not seeing that, but to be fair</li>
            <li> Overall, it is nice for someone who wants to give their skin a nice glow, but do not expect a &#x27;miracle.&#x27;</li>

            <li> The size is extremely ample and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because all of the reviews talked about how creamy and wonderful this cream was...and they were right.  </li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Since the first use, I have noticed how silky smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling cool &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to apply.</li>

            <li> and this really helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> For a reasonable cost, my skin looks moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you do not like a heavy and think cream like moisturizer then this is a great one for you.</li>

            <li> As for the product itself, upon opening I was pleased it wasn&#x27;t overly fragrant since my skin is quite sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I felt my face immediately absorbed it in.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and absorbed immediately by the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watery and lightweight, not oily, the creme leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft, it gives your skin the silky smooth radiance.</li>

            <li> My face feels more hydrated and smootg , i would definitely recommend thus Anti Aging cream to anyone in search of one!</li>
            <li> I liked the very thin consistency because it absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, but the only thing it did for my face is make my pores large.</li>
            <li> After just a few days i could tell a huge difference and my skin looks 100times better.</li>
            <li> With many anti aging cream out there I really love this one the camu complex.</li>
            <li> This product really does wonders..ordered it again after using it for the first time..</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream and will be a life long user.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount on my face and rubbed it in really good.</li>
            <li> The quality is high and the quantity is just right.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, I have not used it long enough to really know.</li>
            <li> It is well made more than many other commercial creams.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and even at 36 still break out.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t break me out even though I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This can easily replace my Vitamin C.  One jar could last atleast two months.</li>
            <li> However, I need more moisture than this provides and at the end of the day leaves my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> The places where I experience the most dryness have not been dry at all.  </li>
            <li> After the very first use, my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and love the way my skin looks!</li>

            <li> It goes on smooth and I am starting to get compliments from others!</li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>

            <li> The product is very silky and goes on well.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , it is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes my face very well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Feel free to read the ingredients last</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin and feels great.</li>
            <li> It leave the skin very moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li> the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> + is too much-</li>
            <li> Did not notice much of anything.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> its great and my secret from  my girls.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It only takes me a dab on each cheek and forehead to cover my entire face nicely.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are very good for my skin; they include: goji extract, coffee seed, acai, pomegranate, green tea and aloe (among other ingredients)    </li>
            <li> , it is just right in the texture, and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> It does not leave your face greasy like many other creams do.</li>
            <li> nothing special about this lotion-skin felt and looked the same as it did with store brand-off the shelf lotion</li>
            <li> I love that it dries up within less than a minute and that I dont feel</li>
            <li> No break outs-my main concern</li>
            <li> This Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer Vitamin C cream not only leaves your face feeling smooth and soft but the texture leaves my face feeling radiant.</li>
            <li> Most facial creams come in tiny jars.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I have high expectations for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The packaging is high end.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s never to early to stop the antiaging process!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thick texture that you have to massage into your skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and gentle on my skin, the cream does not cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> This product says to use it on clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thick moisturizer</li>
            <li> cleansed my face as I would normally, then applied this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so I am hoping it will last a long time :-)</li>
            <li> The consistency was a lot thicker than normal too.</li>
            <li> I love that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent to it.</li>
            <li> so I only use 2 dimes worth 3x a month.</li>
            <li> There was twice as much product in the jar as most of the other manufacturers of the same type product give to you.  </li>
            <li> Not as rich and creamy as expected.</li>
            <li> I could live without this.  </li>
            <li> I actually have good skin at age 45 and have hardly EVER used any moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The cream is extremely light and rich-feeling, it only takes a tiny bit to use!</li>
            <li> This had NO negative effects with the first or any subsequent applications.</li>
            <li> and it has a nice subtle smell from the fruits in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> The cream leaves your skin matte, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Product makes my skin very soft and firmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels tighter and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I also love that just a little bit is enough for my whole face</li>
            <li> I think it helped clear my skin up too!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Seroiusly soft!</li>
            <li> i apply after washing my face at night and i wake to beautifully soft and radiant face!</li>
            <li> and I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are definitely less noticeable and the tinted color evens out the imperfections and flaws in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seems to make my fine lines less defined, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> my  skin feels so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Definitely not liking my first use.</li>
            <li> My dark spots from blemishes are almost gone, my face looks more radiant, and the pores on my face has gotten smaller.</li>
            <li> I used a portion of cream about the size of a large pea and it covered my entire face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for me for a day cream, but not rich enough for the night.</li>
            <li> I love that these little tiny lines I&#x27;ve been noticing around my lips and eyes are fading as well!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is far from that and has a sweet yet subtle scent that you are not afraid to wear all day.</li>
            <li> They smell nice but many left my face greasy, I had a bad reaction or it did not keep the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> The texture is too clear and I have to dip my finger twice in the jar, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old now and experiencing skin problems that come with aging.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable but if it goes back to the $60 range, I cannot afford it.</li>
            <li> I am retired on a fixed income so this is a luxury item for me.</li>
            <li> I apply this cream directly onto my face after I cleanse in the morning and and night.</li>
            <li> After a couple of minutes I touched the skin on my face and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> so baby Soft</li>
            <li> could tell that it really is going to help with the aging effects, especially on my neck area.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer lease my face feeling soft immediately.</li>
            <li> My skin has changed completely, it looks way healthier now.</li>
            <li> I definitely would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my Camu complex moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It really soft, creamy.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft but not greasy...</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients and leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it in smooth,circular motions all over my face and neck after cleaning and it gave me baby soft feeling skin that stayed moisturized and not looking or feeling oily.</li>
            <li> but once it does, it looks and feels completely natural.</li>
            <li> Took the redness out of my face and made it baby skin soft</li>
            <li> I apply at night also before bed when I remove my make-up for extra moisturizer because in Wisconsin you really need it with the weather.</li>
            <li> My face stays soft and moist (not greasy)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this cream did not irritate my face at all.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> As for the long term benefits of making you look younger, I do not know yet if that is true.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so light and soft feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent to it either like a lot of cream moisturizers do.  </li>
            <li> It was nice and thin for under makeup, but if you are looking for the miracle cream here, KEEP LOOKING.  </li>
            <li> I rub a thin layer onto my face and neck every morning and it feels nice</li>
            <li> and it come in a pretty big far for a facial cream.</li>
            <li> Love the very faint smell, not too overpowering, and that it is light and creamy, and does not leave your face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different anti aging creams and none of them seem to do what I was exactly looking for until now.</li>
            <li> , you only need a tiny bit which goes a long ways, absorbs quickly making my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> For the past month I have been using this fantastic product</li>
            <li> I have used a few other anti aging creams before and this one definitely is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Live Ultimate!</li>
            <li> I am always in the market for a new moisturizer especially they \\&quot;Anti</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to buy again unless I notice a real change to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, the one I recently received had a yellowish tint to it (it used to be white) and was very sticky.</li>
            <li> I do prefer a heavy cream for night, but cannot use those in the day since it causes my skin to get greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer to put on in the morning and decided to try this product because it has the touch of foundation in it.&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, it sounded pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so many creams are too heavy or not thick enough and your skin feels tight within an hour.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely watery (like a really cheap hand lotion), and left my face feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the claimed results, but it looks promising.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised how big the jar was!  </li>
            <li> but apparently they work together to produce the desired results.</li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount of firmness to my skin to give it that little lift it needs in the morning as well.</li>
            <li> When it comes down to creams and lotions I am very picky because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product has truly become a fixture in my nightly routine to help defy the signs of the aging process that we are all trying slow down on our own bodies.</li>
            <li> My skin had been dry and dull because of using so many acne antibiotics and cream</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and due to the oily skin I get surface bumps and with using this product I have noticed</li>
            <li> I have oily skin already,and I definitely do not need a product to make that issue more worse</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet noticed any major results after using daily for a couple weeks now but hoping it does!...</li>
            <li> , I do highly recommend buying this product for anyone wanting to try something that meets in the middle between oily and dry skin to be use on both types.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes seem to be a little less noticeable also.  </li>
            <li> I am always a little cautious with any creams or anything I put on my skin as my skin is very sensitive, especially with new substances.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts well to Camu Complex, it quickly absorbs the nutrients and makes me glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way as well, so I put it on and I can apply my makeup right after or just apply and go.  </li>
            <li> contains Vitamin C from CAMU CAMU,  Aloe, Pure Green Tea Extract  Collagen and Shea Butter..</li>
            <li> There was nothing bad about it, nor anything good.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really like the complex.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really hard for me to find the right product as wrinkles started appearing on my face</li>
            <li> This moisturiser left my skin feeling dry and tingled a lot when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Im outside a lot and my face gets patches of dry spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick without being too thick but not one of those more watery creams.</li>
            <li> So far it made my skin feel sticky and tight.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the strong initial scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little time to absorb completely into the skin</li>
            <li> With 3 kids in the house under the age of 5, is it often difficult to get more than 6 hours of sleep every night and this product helped to hide the dark circle under my eyes too.   </li>
            <li> However, I have to say it out performs others over the long run.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to see long term benefits.</li>
            <li> 2) had I &amp;#34;changed make up?&amp;#34; (I did not as I use only minimal make up).</li>
            <li> Recently because of medicine changes my face was looking rough and peeling, every morning it always had this husky look.  </li>
            <li> I do not really care for facial creams,serums,etc.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> Just a dab of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time finding a moisturizer that has a scent that is not over powering due to my sensitivity to strong smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this cream, but ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I&#x27;ve been breaking out in little white pimples and getting itchy patches on my skin which has caused me to scratch so much that I have scabs.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit so this bottle is going to last me a while!</li>
            <li> I allow it to dry before placing any additional moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This will last quite a long time since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also the smell has gotten a lot stronger and now burns the sensitive skin around my eyes (never has in the past).</li>
            <li> I guess I will go back to using my usual organic facial moisturizer by Eminence Organics.</li>
            <li> My face is very dry during the winter to the point of flaky.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend who has very dry skin</li>
            <li> The lid was on so tight that when I finally got it opened about a tablespoon of product spoiled our on my shirt!  </li>
            <li> I have one age spot on my cheek which I have been putting a little extra on as I have read vitamin C</li>
            <li> It takes very, very little which will make this jar last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that maybe I got a bad batch because this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Only way I will pay $$$ is if it can make me look at least 4-5 yrs younger.</li>
            <li> The box said to leave on for a few minutes and then rinse off yet on the actual creame it said nothing about rinsing off???</li>
            <li> I plan to reorder it when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li> My mom and I have both been using this moisturizer for the last few day and are blown</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and have already noticed a difference in the tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have never really had a skin care routine and started thinking that 40 is creeping up on me</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no greasiness or oily feeling with this cream.</li>
            <li> and It is SO NICE to see those ugly things get softer and less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I had some ugly eruptions and dry/scaly patches when I first started using it and they are gone gone gone!!!  </li>
            <li> For me, this product leaves my skin feeling slightly sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way/&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 40s, I find that my face gets really dry and tight after washing with soap and water.</li>
            <li> When I tried Camu Camu it too went on smoothly without an unpleasant feel or appearance.</li>
            <li> Noticeable softer skin after only a few days!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear any other foundation</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in my skin compared to other products, and I was disappointed to see that one of the main ingredients is alcohol.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint clean smell with maybe a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smelled really weird, I didn&#x27;t really like using it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> When the weather gets cooler out, my skin usually gets dried out especially around my nose.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this cream will help get rid of the wrinkles &amp; dark spots that the sun has deposited on my face over the years of sunbathing.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase Camu Complex again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right up there with all the expensive brand name drugstore moisturizers if not better than some of them.</li>
            <li> when we laid down I rubbed my cheek with my partners hand</li>
            <li> no more dry aging skin ..</li>
            <li> I truly believe that they&#x27;ve found a winner here with the Goji berry, the Aloe, Green Tea and Shea Butter combination (among other ingredients).</li>
            <li> A little amount is needed to put on your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now.  </li>
            <li> When I apply make up after applying the moisturizer, the make up appears cakey, matte, and makes my skin appear very dry and dull.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this moisturizer, it has made my skin feel firmer and it looks radiant.</li>
            <li> i can see using this everyday as i don&#x27;t wear makeup</li>
            <li> While it is thin it is creamy at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product was heavy for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to brighten skin and firm.</li>
            <li> that have a heavy feel to them on my skin unless I am washing it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heavy moisturizers either...</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this product and completely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and just gives off that &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> After a few days I kept getting told how I look like I am glowing</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals effecting my face.</li>
            <li> It has a soft lotion feel to it,and does not go on the skin to thick or to thin.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Even though I have oily skin, I get dry in the winter with all of the cold air and dry heat.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the antiaging part...??</li>
            <li> I usually put coconut oil under my eyes to keep it hydrated, once I leave it on for about an hour</li>
            <li> Not sure how its helping my skin or not.</li>
            <li> I bought a different brand (because it was cheaper), and I am so sorry</li>
            <li> I am using thyme tincture these day too so not sure if it is thyme or this product.</li>
            <li> Likewise the places where I am usually oily have not been oily.  </li>
            <li> Which leads me to my next observation, the cream is very thin, but I don&#x27;t mind that about this product at all.  </li>
            <li> The moisturiser, though, was not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> The consistency was not rich and creamy, but rather sort of thin and almost liquid.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this moisturizer, and was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> NOT tingling or anything negative.</li>
            <li> However Camu Complex has not phenomenalized my face-</li>
            <li> Camu Complex leaves your face feeling firmer tighter.</li>
            <li> So creamy and not too thick for daytime use.</li>
            <li> No more turkey neck!</li>
            <li> (we don&#x27;t typically throw fake compliments at each other).&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the second jar arrived spoiled--the smell was bad.  </li>
            <li> I had really really bad dry skin, I had serious sun damage that made me look 28 instead of 22.</li>
            <li> I have noticed in just a few days that these set in wrinkles seem softer!!!</li>
            <li> I did get confused on how to use it though.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy about it.</li>
            <li> It is very thin, not like a thick cream.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking this was going to be lame because it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li> Lot of False Claims or may be Fake Reviews ??/</li>
            <li> Useless..  </li>
            <li> so I kept trying to use it, but the smell is awful like it&#x27;s a totally different product - acrid cleaning product smell that I can&#x27;t even face.</li>
            <li> Maybe just a weird batch?</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact my mom even thought it didn&#x27;t have a smell at all, that&#x27;s how faint.</li>
            <li> It has this thin silky texture that glides over your face!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this crème made my face break out.</li>
            <li> When you get the heavy feeling on your skin,it makes your pores feel clogged and start sweating with it on,and that is very annoying and upsetting to say the least.</li>
            <li> so expensive</li>
            <li> I have tried store brand to the expensive brand you would buy at the store.</li>
            <li> But again very, very faint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am doubtful of this product.  </li>
            <li> Has a terrible smell..like a bad hair remover.</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> I am terrible when it comes to remembering to put lotion on after my shower, but since getting this and trying it out I have not forgotten once.  </li>
            <li> Worst Product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it because I was miserable,</li>
            <li> This cream leaves my face moisturized and does not leave a nasty greasy residue.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After a few days of using this moisturizer, it has made my skin feel firmer and it looks radiant. It does not leave my face greasy and it also has a great scent. I highly recommend this product. Looking forward to more awesome results.</li>
            <li> Best facial moisturizer. It stimulates my skin and works well under make up</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin . Not sure about the antiaging part...??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old now and experiencing skin problems that come with aging. The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had is dryness, which leaves my skin flaky. I&#x27;ve tried many good quality moisturizers. They all go on nicely, are absorbable, leave no greasy or oily feel or appearance. However, by the end of the day or the next morning, the flakiness returns. When I tried Camu Camu it too went on smoothly without an unpleasant feel or appearance. However, I have to say it out performs others over the long run. The end of the day and the next morning the flakiness did NOT return!!! When I looked at the ingredients there are many good items on the list fullof natural anti oxidants and enzymes.</li>
            <li> I had really really bad dry skin, I had serious sun damage that made me look 28 instead of 22. My job requires me to work in the sun, this cream arrived on time. I usually put coconut oil under my eyes to keep it hydrated, once I leave it on for about an hour I wipe the oil off and use this before I go to bed and every morning. I love how soft my face is now, it has repaired the sun damage. It also vanished my wrinkles. I look 22 again thank you :)</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff makes my skin feel! I think it helped clear my skin up too!</li>
            <li> This is my new morning moisturizer and I love it! My skin feel great all day and I love the soft scent. It goes on smooth and I am starting to get compliments from others! The quality is high and the quantity is just right. I will be sure to reorder and recommend to others!</li>
            <li> love this cream. it is silky smooth to put on. it absorbs into your skin and feels nice on my face. a great moisturizer. will reorder again.</li>
            <li> The first jar seemed really good.  Then I ordered the 2nd jar and it did not feel the same.  It started breaking me out in a rash and I noticed a foul smell from the cream about a week after I opened it.</li>
            <li> For me, this product leaves my skin feeling slightly sticky and dry. When I apply make up after applying the moisturizer, the make up appears cakey, matte, and makes my skin appear very dry and dull. It is not a luxurious mousitizing effect at all. I would have returned it but, I threw away the packaging. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This moisturiser left my skin feeling dry and tingled a lot when I applied it. I returned the items and was given a prompt refund, so I can&#x27;t fault their customer service. The moisturiser, though, was not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> Not as rich and creamy as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a week and I definitely agree with all of the wonderful reviews. This cream smells wonderful, makes my skin come alive, and has reduced the fine wrinkles that had started to creep in. I use it twice daily and love the way it goes on without feeling greasy. It has a wonderful scent that is not overpowering. It makes me feel radiant! I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Nice cream. It has a nice smell and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> ok not much different</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I have super sensitive skin and even at 36 still break out. I have not had any problems with this cream! I love how it smells! Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Not sure how its helping my skin or not.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say a see a difference yet since i have only been using it for about 2 weeks. But what i can say it that i like that it&#x27;s very light and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging your pores. I did get confused on how to use it though.  The box said to leave on for a few minutes and then rinse off yet on the actual creame it said nothing about rinsing off??? So i just leave it on throughout the day. So far so good. No break outs-my main concern</li>
            <li> So far, I really like the complex. It is not heavy and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. As for the long term benefits of making you look younger, I do not know yet if that is true. However, that is not the reason I got it. I just want a good facial cream that keeps my aging skin looking as good and healthy as possible. I plan to reorder it when this jar is empty. The price is reasonable but if it goes back to the $60 range, I cannot afford it. I am retired on a fixed income so this is a luxury item for me. Please keep the cost as low as possible.</li>
            <li> Useless..  My wife mentioned that after trying for 6 weeks daily, this cream is &amp;#34;Useless&amp;#34; and has not helped at all ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending back to Seller .. Lot of False Claims or may be Fake Reviews ??/</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the cream on my skin but not the texture. The texture is too clear and I have to dip my finger twice in the jar, which I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s okay for me for a day cream, but not rich enough for the night. For the price, it is ok because it is not greasy and the fragrance is pleasant. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to buy again unless I notice a real change to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product, high quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this product in exchange of my unbiased opinion and I am glad I did so.When it comes down to creams and lotions I am very picky because I have sensitive skin but this lotion is great! I am able to wear this cream under neath basic bb cream or MAC foundation and it does not alter the make up but I do feel the cream as if it was tighting up my skin. I love that it dries up within less than a minute and that I dont feel Im wearing it.</li>
            <li> I hate it! Makes my face feel like it&#x27;s going to crack. Very drying. Trying to save fifteen dollars has now cost me thirty on something I can&#x27;t stand to use.</li>
            <li> I like this cream...hard to tell if my wrinkles are minimized but as a cream it is great.</li>
            <li> A+ product ,good smell,not greasy and leave you&#x27;re skin like a baby .</li>
            <li> I bought this product.  I loved it for my 60+ face.  Very nice on old drying skin.  I bought a different brand (because it was cheaper), and I am so sorry I did the CamuCamu was a great product for me and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite moisturizer the first time I bought it but this time I thought maybe they had changed the formula so I kept trying to use it, but the smell is awful like it&#x27;s a totally different product - acrid cleaning product smell that I can&#x27;t even face. Maybe just a weird batch?</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful Anti-Aging Face Cream from Live Ultimate for a few months now along with Live Ultimate Camu Advanced Youth Recovery Serum and am very pleased with the results.  For a reasonable cost, my skin looks moisturized and smooth.  I have been dedicated to taking care of my skin for many years, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Thank you, Live Ultimate!</li>
            <li> This cream feels so wonderful on my face, it goes on so easily and feels very light on my skin afterwards, which is very nice and helpful to me.  i can see using this everyday as i don&#x27;t wear makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this item for free in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
            <li> Very good and moisturized. I can feel the difference in days. Love it</li>
            <li> I could live without this.  There was nothing bad about it, nor anything good.  It is very thin, not like a thick cream.  I noticed no difference in my skin.  Felt I had to apply several times.  My face is very dry during the winter to the point of flaky.  This alone did not do the trick.  It was nice and thin for under makeup, but if you are looking for the miracle cream here, KEEP LOOKING.  For the price, would not purchase again.  So many others on the market that do a better job.</li>
            <li> I arranged for a model to test these products.  Here is her report: I LOVE the Live Ultimate skincare products!  I have used both face masks (I particularly like the scent of the coconut clay mask!) and they are lovely. The Camucomplex is so nice. It works great prior to putting on foundation. So creamy and not too thick for daytime use. The Camusuperberry creme is perfect for bedtime. My skin has never felt so soft before and smooth before!  The instant lift is nice and though it will take some time to truly test the results, it feels like it is  is doing exactly what it proclaims.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this skincare line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample product for impartial review</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised how big the jar was!  Even though in the description it listed the ounces I guess I had to see to believe.  A word of caution here.  The lid was on so tight that when I finally got it opened about a tablespoon of product spoiled our on my shirt!  Which leads me to my next observation, the cream is very thin, but I don&#x27;t mind that about this product at all.  It&#x27;s not at all oily.  It has a very pleasant smell.  The best thing of all about this moisturizer with Camu Camu, after using it a little over a month now I can see a difference in the saggy skin on my neck!  I&#x27;m 59 years old and this makes me a very happy camper!  The fine lines around my eyes seem to be a little less noticeable also.  I will definitely bit this again.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, leaves my skin feeling GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this cream, but ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I&#x27;ve been breaking out in little white pimples and getting itchy patches on my skin which has caused me to scratch so much that I have scabs.  I didn&#x27;t have this problem before so I can only assume it&#x27;s something in this cream.  It may be fine for most, but for me I&#x27;m going to stop using it to see if the problem goes away.  Also didn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin which I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Smelled really weird, I didn&#x27;t really like using it because of the smell. I also don&#x27;t think it made a big difference on my complexion. It was really runny too, and kind of spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom as she has been always trying products for her face.&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with this one. Has been using it and loves how her skin feels and looks after using it.&lt;br /&gt;She is very satisfied and therefore I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product! This moisturizing cream is wonderful! There is no odor and I find it to be light in texture, goes on smooth. I love the way it feels on my face. It is rich so, you only need a tiny bit which goes a long ways, absorbs quickly making my face feel so soft. This is the best anti aging cream ever and will be part of my beauty routine from now on. I recommend!</li>
            <li> nothing special about this lotion-skin felt and looked the same as it did with store brand-off the shelf lotion</li>
            <li> I love the cream. I like the texture and the feel when you put it on the skin.I personally think the cream is helping my skin since I feel that the area that I put it on is lighter than it was before. Also the ingredients in the cream shocks me in a good way, almost all of them are extremely beneficially to your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very light moisturizer. If you do not like a heavy and think cream like moisturizer then this is a great one for you. There is a very light scent and lotion like consistency. While it is thin it is creamy at the same time. This will last quite a long time since a little goes a long way. It does moisturize well and keeps my face feeling hydrated.   Update: It has been almost a month since using this moisturizer and I love the airiness on light weight of this moisturizer for daytime use. I do prefer a heavy cream for night, but cannot use those in the day since it causes my skin to get greasy quickly. This is perfect for day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I apply this cream directly onto my face after I cleanse in the morning and and night. I allow it to dry before placing any additional moisturizers. The result is happy, soft and mostiturized skin. I have very sensitive skin but this doesn&#x27;t not irritated or break out my skin. It also helps plump fine lines and pores to give a more youthful appreance. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it works very very well for me , i think it all depends on the type of skin you have . likely to work well for some and not for others both .</li>
            <li> Uhm...WOW! My mom and I have both been using this moisturizer for the last few day and are blown away!&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the jar and got some on my finger I was thinking this was going to be lame because it&#x27;s so thin. I applied a small amount on my face and rubbed it in really good. After a couple of minutes I touched the skin on my face and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt. Seroiusly soft! I love this stuff. As a matter of fact, I love the way it makes my skin feel so much I look forward to putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;It even smells really good. It has a very faint clean smell with maybe a hint of citrus. But again very, very faint. As a matter of fact my mom even thought it didn&#x27;t have a smell at all, that&#x27;s how faint.</li>
            <li> Love this Cream its very Creamy and smells wonderful, My daughter and I both love how it makes out Skin look so baby Soft, You guys are awesome Thanks for put out a Product for the Young and old :)</li>
            <li> Excellent ingredients, You don&#x27;t need much and it&#x27;s a light formula.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products and this really keeps my skin moisturized as I need.</li>
            <li> WHOA!!!!! I LOVE this moisturizer! After the first application I couldn&#x27;t quit touching my face! It was so smooth and silky feeling. And the next morning it STILL retained that feeling! The light fragrance is an added bonus! It&#x27;s not a thick texture that you have to massage into your skin. It has this thin silky texture that glides over your face! Plus, after ordering it was at my door in two days! WHOOHOO!</li>
            <li> Getting closer to yet another birthday, I wanted to have a nice option for a new face cream. I am so thrilled that I got this luxurious cream! It came in such a nice jar, I really like the overall value of the product. It looks and feels like it should cost so much more! It feels so rich on my skin. I live in Florida, and I really like the sun :) . While I always protect my skin with sunscreen, I still get a great deal of sun. I am NOT looking to ever have that leathery looking skin. First and foremost hydration is key--so I drink plenty of water. This product helps to aid in that hydration as well. It seems to increase the elasticity of my skin, and is doing a great deal of work to keep my skin beautiful and to help correct the flaws that are already there. I just adore this. Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller! Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime! Thank you!! :)</li>
            <li> Nice cream to use, it is just right in the texture, and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift.  And I seriously LOVE it!!  Had to leave a review for it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleansed my face as I would normally, then applied this moisturizer.  It has a nice, silky feel to it.  It absorbs into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling to your face.  It has a light, pleasant smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell that it really is going to help with the aging effects, especially on my neck area.  I have already seen  a huge difference on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this to anybody looking for a GOOD night time Moisturizer!!!</li>
            <li> Makes skin perfectly smooth..fine lines vanishes as they were never there before..This product really does wonders..ordered it again after using it for the first time..no more dry aging skin ..</li>
            <li> Love the non-clear packaging however I think for optimal longevity of the product I would suggest a pump. As for the product itself, upon opening I was pleased it wasn&#x27;t overly fragrant since my skin is quite sensitive to fragrance. Application went on nicely and I felt my face immediately absorbed it in. It has left my skin very smooth and not overly greasy. I will continue to use this for my bedtime routine and look forward to all those antioxidants working away!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and have already noticed a difference in the tone of my skin.  It is not greasy and absorbs easily into my skin.  I use in in the mornings under my make up and in the evenings after cleansing my face.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and while I do not have wrinkles yet, I want to keep it that way and this product is definitely going to help with that.  I have one age spot on my cheek which I have been putting a little extra on as I have read vitamin C will help to fade age spots.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to make it part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> My aunt reports this is the best facial skin moisturizer she&#x27;d used. The ingredient list is beyond my pay grade to understand but apparently they work together to produce the desired results. Be sure to see the ingredient list on the product page to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face cream requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is non-greasy and absorbed immediately by the skin. I have been suffering from acne but looks like this is working on my acne too. I am using thyme tincture these day too so not sure if it is thyme or this product. But anyway I like this product and am definitely going to continue using this. My skin had been dry and dull because of using so many acne antibiotics and cream but this cream has worked wonders for me, making my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer...I have been using this since the first day it day and I love it...my skin feels very soft and the cream it self is very light and has a very pleasant scent. I also love that just a little bit is enough for my whole face so I am hoping it will last a long time :-)</li>
            <li> Im outside a lot and my face gets patches of dry spots. After just a few days i could tell a huge difference and my skin looks 100times better. The texture is also great not greasy and just the right consistency. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Love love love. I love the smell and it makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth. It only takes a little bit so this bottle is going to last me a while!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watery and lightweight, not oily, the creme leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft, it gives your skin the silky smooth radiance.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better since using this product. I love how you don&#x27;t even feel like you have anything even on your face.</li>
            <li> My first jar of this cream was good.  However, the second jar arrived spoiled--the smell was bad.  I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. If you have oily skin like me I would recommend only putting on at night before bed. When I use in the morning my skin gets very oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves my skin soft,without a greasy feel.  I would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> Very light weight, but the only thing it did for my face is make my pores large. Sorry, but I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great anti wrinkle cream. I have been using it as my night cream. I have acne prone &amp; sensitive skin...and this product has been quite amazing. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Started using it on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;By Thursday my skin already looked healthier and more hydrated. Of course I wasn&#x27;t sure if I am just imagining this, since I was expecting results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Friday I met a friend for lunch who greeted me which: Wow your skin looks amazing! (we don&#x27;t typically throw fake compliments at each other).&lt;br /&gt;It is really hard for me to find the right product as wrinkles started appearing on my face (I&#x27;m 33), however I also have some acne.&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the best moisturizer I EVER tried.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C serum for a while with good results, lines diminish and discoloring diminishes. This moisturizer lease my face feeling soft immediately. my make up goes on smoothly over it.  It is chock full of quality, really impressive ingredients and I have high expectations for this moisturizer. fast shipping, lovely packaging. good customer service  Gave a jar to my daughter and she reports that she likes it very much. she has a tendency to break out with creams and lotions but not with this one.so far so good. nice packaging for a gift too.</li>
            <li> I actually have good skin at age 45 and have hardly EVER used any moisturizers.  People think I&#x27;m in my twenties.  That aside, I&#x27;ve been noticing some fine lines creeping in, so I decided to research products pronto.  I&#x27;m very happy with this cream and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product!! My skin has changed completely, it looks way healthier now. I totally recommend  it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a week and I love this cream.  It leaves my skin very soft.  Skin is getting tighter by the day!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this moisturizer. It arrived on time, very nicely packaged. The product is very silky and goes on well. I like the texture a lot. It isn&#x27;t oily or filmy - no residue. Works great under sunblock and light makeup that I wear normally. I use it at night mostly and love waking up to feel my skin still moisturized and not dry for the humid climate I live in. I will continue to use it to see long term benefits.</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 jars of this and LOVED IT! However, the one I recently received had a yellowish tint to it (it used to be white) and was very sticky. The consistency was a lot thicker than normal too. I liked the very thin consistency because it absorbed nicely. Also the smell has gotten a lot stronger and now burns the sensitive skin around my eyes (never has in the past). I&#x27;m hoping that maybe I got a bad batch because this is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Worked well. I could feel my face tighting up and notice my frown line fading!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this anti-aging cream moisturizer. Now that I&#x27;m in my 40s, I find that my face gets really dry and tight after washing with soap and water. I use this moisturizer in the morning and in the evening and I love the results. My face has never felt so good! The cream is extremely light and rich-feeling, it only takes a tiny bit to use! The size is extremely ample and a great value for the price. I love that these little tiny lines I&#x27;ve been noticing around my lips and eyes are fading as well!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft my face feels after using this moisturizer. I truly believe that they&#x27;ve found a winner here with the Goji berry, the Aloe, Green Tea and Shea Butter combination (among other ingredients). I definitely would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I use it with Dr. Oz vitamin serum, they work wonderful together, I love the way my skin feels....</li>
            <li> I am always a little cautious with any creams or anything I put on my skin as my skin is very sensitive, especially with new substances. This had NO negative effects with the first or any subsequent applications. The feeling my face gets after cleansing in the morning then applying the anti aging cream is best described as vibrant. It looks and feels like my face, is fresher more alive. NOT tingling or anything negative. It takes very, very little which will make this jar last a long time. I absolutely LOVE this cream and will be a life long user. Plus as I did not tell my boyfriend and waited to see if he would recognize the difference, he,not always the most detail attentive boyfriend in the world asked 1) if I &amp;#34;did something different with my hair?&amp;#34; (I did not) 2) had I &amp;#34;changed make up?&amp;#34; (I did not as I use only minimal make up). As I said not the most detail oriented in the world.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels outstanding and I KNOW I look great. 5 stars as I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Leaves my skin soft with a very pleasant scent. Already helping with my fine wrinkles. Loving it :)</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after applying this moisturizer. It was soft and smooth. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the strong initial scent. It dissipated after a while, but when I first applied it, the scent was too strong for me. It didn&#x27;t bother me after I realized how soft and smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. So smooth. Love how it feels on my face and it doesn&#x27;t break me out even though I have super sensitive skin. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Noticeable softer skin after only a few days!  Love the fact that it is unscented as sometimes scents will trigger my asthma, but this didn&#x27;t affect me at all. I applied it every morning after cleansing and toning.  Very lightweight and easy to apply. Will definitely continue to use this. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It has more of a serum consistancy and goes on smooth. A little amount is needed to put on your face and neck. It absorbs very easily with no oiliness. I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t leave a shine on my face. Like the ingredients except I am not a fan of silicons. Vitamin C is a regular part of my skin care regimen. This can easily replace my Vitamin C.  One jar could last atleast two months. I use spatula to take it out to avoid contamination.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the claimed results, but it looks promising. I may write another review after I use it for some time.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my Camu complex moisturizer.  I am terrible when it comes to remembering to put lotion on after my shower, but since getting this and trying it out I have not forgotten once.  It leaves my skin so light and soft feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent to it either like a lot of cream moisturizers do.  A little bit goes a long way as well, so I put it on and I can apply my makeup right after or just apply and go.  It gives just the right amount of firmness to my skin to give it that little lift it needs in the morning as well.</li>
            <li> This anti aging cream really is great. It smells so very good and when I first used it one of the things that I noticed and loved was the fact that it was so light and didnt leave my face feeling heavy or greasy. I tend to put this on every night after shower. I love this product&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved this product to try and now giving my unbiased truthful opinion about it*</li>
            <li> The cream leaves your skin matte, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and leaves my skin very soft.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and love the way my skin looks!</li>
            <li> love my camu cream moisturizer! i apply after washing my face at night and i wake to beautifully soft and radiant face! absorbs quickly and is not greasy. i love how wonderful it smells as well!</li>
            <li> It really soft, creamy. My skin feel good. You don&#x27;t need a lot either. You have to tried yourself to believe it. More than words can say! I definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Camu moisturizer is not just for anti aging, I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and I love using it!  The ingredients are natural and gentle on my skin, the cream does not cause me to break out.  I rub a thin layer onto my face and neck every morning and it feels nice, it is very soothing.  This cream is not greasy like many other moisturizers, and it has a pleasant scent..not overwhelmingly strong.  My skin reacts well to Camu Complex, it quickly absorbs the nutrients and makes me glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the mellow scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love it if this moisturizer contained SPF, as I do include sun protection in my daily skin care regime.  SPF can be applied once this soaks into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I could feel it start to tighten my &amp;#34;loose chin&amp;#34; with the first application. No more turkey neck!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, I love the product in this moisturizer, I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I will definably use this product to minimize them when I&#x27;m of age. This product makes my skin feel so good I love how smooth my skin feels after a few days of use, love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost for a month now and i have not seen any changes at all, i bought this product based on Customer&#x27;s review, to me i have not received my money worth</li>
            <li> I am liking this product very much. It is non greasy and has a pleasant, light scent. You don&#x27;t need very much at all. A little goes a long way. It absorbed quickly into my skin. My face felt smooth and moisturized afterwards. I have really dry skin so this product felt great! It really does a great job moisturizing. It did not cause any irritations on my face.I look forward to more results as I continue to use it. This product was received for the purpose of inspection and testing for unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft but not greasy... Very pleased</li>
            <li> This cream seems to work better than I expected.i have extremely sensitive skin,and have had NO issues.it has vitamin c,which I look for in beauty creams.It leaves my skin soft and smooth and also smells great! I use it at night,and also in the morning on my face and neck.I will have to order more of this when it&#x27;s gone,love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> I got this product through a test product site and I very happy with it. I have used a few other anti aging creams before and this one definitely is my favorite so far. It has all natural ingredients and leaves my skin feeling so soft. This is a winner in my book!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product was heavy for me. Made my skin feel sticky in the morning. I gave it to my friend who has very dry skin and she said it worked ok for her.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this cream. My daughter likes to use it too, it&#x27;s very gentle for all ages of skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or clog pores</li>
            <li> I found this product to be excellent . First of all, I love the pure natural ingredients and secondly I love the result. This anti aging cream has really softened my skin and it feels so wonderful now.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing.... It made my face feel great and seen to notice some of the fine lines to diminish around my ears which I didn&#x27;t have many but it&#x27;s noticeable... I will be telling everyone about this product must differently my family and close friends..</li>
            <li> I use this at night along with my camucomplex Vitamin C serum and LOVE my results. My skin looks brighter and I can already see the lines around my eyes diminishing.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this anti aging cream. It smells wonderful and my skin feels so soft and smooth! My skin tone is brighter and more even. I&#x27;ve had several compliments on how good my skin looks and alot are asking what i have been using to make such an improvement. I highly recommend this cream, it&#x27;s affordable and works great! My fine lines already seem to be smoothing out!</li>
            <li> Recently because of medicine changes my face was looking rough and peeling, every morning it always had this husky look.  I received this cream 7 days and I must say, there is a big difference after washing my face twice and day and applying this vitamin c moisturizer cream, it has worked wonders and my family has even noticed the difference.  Now I must order more of this too ensure that I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> The Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer with Vitamin C From Camu Camu is amazing!!! I opened this as soon as I received it in the mail and the scent is amazing. I usually have a hard time finding a moisturizer that has a scent that is not over powering due to my sensitivity to strong smells. This product is far from that and has a sweet yet subtle scent that you are not afraid to wear all day. I also love the fact that it has Shea butter in it! Who doesn&#x27;t love that! Once I applied this product on my face I feel refreshed and awakened. If you are looking for a great moisturizer that will help keep you skin looking and feeling youthful then this is the one for you! This for sure will be my go to for moisturizer on my sensitive acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this crème made my face break out. The consistency was not rich and creamy, but rather sort of thin and almost liquid. It also felt sticky on my face. The second ingredient listed is Cetearyl Alcohol, which is also drying. I guess I will go back to using my usual organic facial moisturizer by Eminence Organics.</li>
            <li> I love this anti aging cream moisturizer. It is not a greasy once you have it on your face.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, I have not used it long enough to really know.</li>
            <li> Product makes my skin very soft and firmer.  Love the light scent.</li>
            <li> This Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer Vitamin C cream not only leaves your face feeling smooth and soft but the texture leaves my face feeling radiant. I have gotten plenty of complements of people asking me if I had changed my makeup or foundation, therefore I was able to spread the word of this amazing product. I now take it everywhere with me in my purse so when people ask, I can just show them the package. Keep up the amazing work. My face and self esteem have never felt better these days. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully rich cream.  Good for everyday, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This order came in on time and was in good condition.  I really enjoyed using the vitamin c cream in conjunction with the mask by Camu Camu.  There was twice as much product in the jar as most of the other manufacturers of the same type product give to you.  My  face needs nourishment and this really helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.  My face seems firmer, and my jawline seems lifted.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels tighter and very soft.  It&#x27;s healthy and not as oily as it used to be.  I have very oily skin and due to the oily skin I get surface bumps and with using this product I have noticed the bumps have lessened and I notice my skin is tighter. Also the fact that I&#x27;m using all natural products makes me feel better to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizer. Keeps my skin hydrated and soft. Great for winter since it is slightly heavy.</li>
            <li> i love it works really good and makes your skin soft also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and so far so good.. goes on smoothnand NO irritation of any kind. Even after shaving! Seems to brighten skin and firm. Haven&#x27;t yet noticed any major results after using daily for a couple weeks now but hoping it does!... Price not bad when on sale BUT can find on EBay much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Excellent cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night before bed, and already notice a tightening of the skin on the foreheads and cheeks.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes my face very well. When the weather gets cooler out, my skin usually gets dried out especially around my nose. After using this, I feel refreshed and younger. I am almost 30, so I figure I better start taking better care of my skin. This product definitely helps with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner. I really like the way the container looks and am excited to see how well it moisturizes my skin :)</li>
            <li> Best cream for the skin. I can feel how soft and smooth my skin gets after applying it. It has ingredients which are amazing for my skin. It is taking all the wrinkles from my face. It is very light weight and unscented. The packaging is high end.</li>
            <li> I ordered this anti aging cream about 2~3weeks ago. This cream makes my skin brighter and gives moisture. I love it. Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling moisturizer!!!&lt;br /&gt;This cream is really good for your skin, it goes on easy and lasts. It absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin feeling really soft and creamy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use alot.. a little goes a long way/&lt;br /&gt;It contains Vitamin C from CAMU CAMU,  Aloe, Pure Green Tea Extract  Collagen and Shea Butter.. that is just a FEW of its great ingredients!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for an anti aging cream moisturizer and I even think it has a great price/</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin! It has a soft lotion feel to it,and does not go on the skin to thick or to thin. It is right in the middle which I like,and it makes this product PERFECT! I do not really care for facial creams,serums,etc. that have a heavy feel to them on my skin unless I am washing it off immediately. When you get the heavy feeling on your skin,it makes your pores feel clogged and start sweating with it on,and that is very annoying and upsetting to say the least. This product did none of that,and I truly appreciate that. I rubbed it in smooth,circular motions all over my face and neck after cleaning and it gave me baby soft feeling skin that stayed moisturized and not looking or feeling oily. I have oily skin already,and I definitely do not need a product to make that issue more worse then it is! A little bit goes a long way so, I do highly recommend buying this product for anyone wanting to try something that meets in the middle between oily and dry skin to be use on both types. You will love this Fruitscription Cream,and make it part of your daily regimen!</li>
            <li> So i love the light scent of this cream but I do not like how it feels on my face. It makes my face feel stiff. You do get a generous amount for the money. I prefer more moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this cream, I have to say that my skin feels amazing. My face feels noticeably smoother and more supple. I love that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent to it. I apply it twice a day and my skin feels moisturized but not oily, which is a huge plus for me. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good anti-aging cream moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I Love this product!! It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I use it morning and night. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I recommend giving it a try. Will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I Love the way this makes my skin feel !!! I would absolutely recommend this product !!</li>
            <li> This cream very good,</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer leaves my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> For the price this is good.  However, I need more moisture than this provides and at the end of the day leaves my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It is working for me, better than most I have tried.  I am using all 3 cream, vitamin c and mask.  I have tried many.  I may stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer to put on in the morning and decided to try this product because it has the touch of foundation in it.&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, it sounded pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are definitely less noticeable and the tinted color evens out the imperfections and flaws in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear any other foundation and I feel I get great coverage with this creme.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, creamy and leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little time to absorb completely into the skin but once it does, it looks and feels completely natural.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of silky smooth skin! This has helped my skin have a nice glow... Does not leave me feeling oily or over moisturized... would recommend! - Amy</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 days now and my skin feels great.  Even though I have oily skin, I get dry in the winter with all of the cold air and dry heat.  I was a little hesitant at first because all of the reviews talked about how creamy and wonderful this cream was...and they were right.  This cream feels GREAT!  A little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t need much at all and it really soaks in and feels great on my skin.  My skin feels so plum and wonderful.  This is the one time I enjoy having plump skin.  The places where I experience the most dryness have not been dry at all.  Likewise the places where I am usually oily have not been oily.  This is a fabulous anti aging face cream and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Has a terrible smell..like a bad hair remover.Feels like I am using a spoiled rotten aloe extract..instead of protecting skin from sun damage its aggravating the sun damage.Worst Product!</li>
            <li> Omg just got this today was so excited to try it. Smells really good great texture and it makes my skin feel really smothe and not oily. I use it as a moisturizer. Like it a lot I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> I received this anti aging face cream for a consumer review in the mail yesterday. I&#x27;m very pleased with this face cream. It is a very light weight cream that spreads evenly and absorbs completely. What I love is that you do not have to use a lot of the cream. A very little bit goes a long way. I used a portion of cream about the size of a large pea and it covered my entire face. My favorite thing about this cream is that it is not greasy or sticky. The scent is very mild, almost unnoticeable. The ingredients are very good for my skin; they include: goji extract, coffee seed, acai, pomegranate, green tea and aloe (among other ingredients)    This product says to use it on clean, dry skin. I removed my makeup and used face-wipes to clean the skin I was going to moisturize. (I left my eye makeup on for photo purposes) I used this cream again after my shower. This will become a part of my nightly skin regimen because of the qualities the cream has: light, thin, greaseless and scentless. It will also be on my list of items to give as gifts throughout the year.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a jar! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a must have! Feel free to read the ingredients last and you will see why this product works! I have sun damaged freckled skin and I am noticing a difference already. I also have the starting of wrinkles and It is SO NICE to see those ugly things get softer and less noticeable! I would definitely try to buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have added to this cream to my nightly facial cleansing regimen.Since the first use, I have noticed how silky smooth my face feels. I have been using this for a week now and notice that the fine lines around my face and forehead are indeed diminished in size and appearance. It is light or clean scented, not harsh. It is easy to use, a little bit goes a long way. Looking forward to getting many usage out of this product.</li>
            <li> The anti aging camu cream amazing! Took the redness out of my face and made it baby skin soft</li>
            <li> This is a great product in helping your face feel smoother and helping fill in the fine lines. I use under my make-up in the morning and love the way it feels not sticky or oily. I apply at night also before bed when I remove my make-up for extra moisturizer because in Wisconsin you really need it with the weather. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face and the size of jar is great value for price. It&#x27;s not a thick moisturizer it&#x27;s thin and feels great. Thank you..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. No difference noted.</li>
            <li> Great but stays sold out</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent that I enjoy. I like to use this if I am staying home for the day, or at night. you can also use it under your makeup if the makeup has spf in it. I think it&#x27;s a great addition to my beauty routine and it come in a pretty big far for a facial cream. Most facial creams come in tiny jars.</li>
            <li> I swapped out the department store brand I have used forever when I received this. Let me say my skin drinks this right in &amp; there is no filmy, greasy feeling to it. I have set in wrinkles in between my eyes and on my forehead.I have noticed in just a few days that these set in wrinkles seem softer!!! Bye Bye department store brand! Think I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it goes on my skin and it has a nice subtle smell from the fruits in the moisturizer. It is light and it is a perfect product for those that have oily skin.   For the past month I have been using this fantastic product and I wanted to add that my skin has an amazing glow to it, silky smooth and it has helped to hid the wrinkles near my eyes. With 3 kids in the house under the age of 5, is it often difficult to get more than 6 hours of sleep every night and this product helped to hide the dark circle under my eyes too.   This product has truly become a fixture in my nightly routine to help defy the signs of the aging process that we are all trying slow down on our own bodies.</li>
            <li> Love this anti-aging cream. It smells good and there is no left over residue feeling on your face. Its not oily. It makes my skin very smooth. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the way my makeup looks when I apply this cream first. Noticeable with first use. I use this product day and night! I get compliments all the time on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the very faint smell, not too overpowering, and that it is light and creamy, and does not leave your face feeling greasy.  After the very first use, my skin felt so soft. This will be a regular in my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> The camucomplex that I received looks like a different bottle than the picture online. It doesnt say with vitamin c on the bottle. I am not happy about it. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my face</li>
            <li> Best cream I had so far</li>
            <li> Great purchase and the skin feels really good after using it</li>
            <li> I really love it. It leave the skin very moisturized and not greasy. Feel light and natural.</li>
            <li> .A+++ product. As described and shown in photo. Bravo.</li>
            <li> I was ready for &amp;#34;just another moisturizer&amp;#34; but have to admit I am pleased with the outcome of this cream over time.  I am now on my third jar.  I use it at night after cleansing my face and find I don&#x27;t even in need it in the morning after I do a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; wash (I found that over treating and/or cleansing exacerbated ALL my skin problems).  My face stays soft and moist (not greasy) the whole day.  I had some ugly eruptions and dry/scaly patches when I first started using it and they are gone gone gone!!!  This cream is soothing and moisturizing and evens out my tone.  Friends who have seen me for awhile have commented on how great I look.  For an old lady, that makes for a sweet day!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. If you need a really heavy moisturizing product, this may not be your best bet, but I have oily skin and it&#x27;s great for me. Seems to make my fine lines less defined, which is what I&#x27;m looking for. It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  I have used better.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34; moisturizer but $70+ is too much- so expensive so I only use 2 dimes worth 3x a month. I  purchased this product on sale- which may be more affordable. Try only if on sale. Only way I will pay $$$ is if it can make me look at least 4-5 yrs younger. Even then, how about buying a top of the line juicer, &amp; juicing veggies &amp; fruit to get your skin healthy for longer- trust me I have relatives who do this and they look 10 yrs younger. Research replenishing moisturizers on etsy.  For me, this cream has excellent texture and absorbs quickly- from areas of small application it is calming. It is well made more than many other commercial creams. However Camu Complex has not phenomenalized my face- and I&#x27;m only 31.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this moisturizer, and was completely disappointed. It is extremely watery (like a really cheap hand lotion), and left my face feeling dry and itchy. I didn&#x27;t say anything, and the first time my husband used it he remarked on how watery the product was as well. It&#x27;s so bad I can&#x27;t even use it because I was miserable, like I didn&#x27;t even put moisturizer on. I don&#x27;t use heavy moisturizers either... I would never recommend this product and completely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I am always in the market for a new moisturizer especially they \\&quot;Anti Aging\\&quot; types. This is one of the great ones I have used so far! The cream is not greasy, really keeps the skin soft, and has a soft fragrance that smells good.</li>
            <li> I have never really had a skin care routine and started thinking that 40 is creeping up on me so maybe it is time to try something. I have had good things about CAMU CAMU from a friend so I decided to try it out. The cream is silky smooth and it is not greasy at all which I loved. Just a dab of it goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and this cream did not irritate my face at all. There is also no overpowering scent to it. I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now and I love how my face looks and feels. Once I run out I will be back for more of this,</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I have used many moisturizers and this one has become my new favorite. It does not leave your face greasy like many other creams do. It leaves my face feeling cool &amp; fresh. I can tell that this cream will help get rid of the wrinkles &amp; dark spots that the sun has deposited on my face over the years of sunbathing. I will definitely purchase Camu Complex again.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer so much!  It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin so quickly.  I have combination skin so many creams are too heavy or not thick enough and your skin feels tight within an hour.  This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> Received the Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer Vitamin Camu Camu Cream yesterday.  The product had no issues inside with packaging and in a very attractive jar.  The cream is very smooth and easy to apply to the face and neck.  Looking forward to using the Camu Camu Cream every day.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth. The jar is very nice and fits in my makeup bag well.  The cream is a nice texture and would buy again .</li>
            <li> I like it but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess I like this. I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in my skin compared to other products, and I was disappointed to see that one of the main ingredients is alcohol. Other than that, it goes on nicely and absorbes nicely. It does not leave your skin feeling greasy or clogged up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say about dramatically different skin because I am not seeing that, but to be fair, I just started using it, so maybe I just need more time with this product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Great product, I skin feels real smooth</li>
            <li> I am doubtful of this product.  Did not notice much of anything.  Switched to Olay Regenerist products and noticed changes first night.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar. It keeps my skin moisture during the winter. I have tried several different products, but this is so far the best!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing. I have to add moisturizer over it. I was looking for a more all in one.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! what more can I say other than it leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed after using it.  I have tried several different anti aging creams and none of them seem to do what I was exactly looking for until now. Camu Complex leaves your face feeling firmer tighter. Will be recommending this product to my friends !!!!</li>
            <li> This product first of all smells amazing. I use it nightly and it makes my face feel so smooth and refreshed afterwards. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a month and I have seen significant changes on my face. My dark spots from blemishes are almost gone, my face looks more radiant, and the pores on my face has gotten smaller. A lot of people have complimented me too after I started using it! I got this for my mom as well. She hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but when she does, I&#x27;ll update this review to tell you if it worked well on her. Otherwise, I would recommend using this product!</li>
            <li> Since I began using CamuComplex my  skin feels so soft and hydrated! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This anti aging cream smells amazing! The cream feels so good on my face and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy which is great! My face feels more hydrated and smootg , i would definitely recommend thus Anti Aging cream to anyone in search of one!</li>
            <li> This cream is an antiaging cream but it is also a moisturizer.  This works great for me because its like I&#x27;m getting two products in one.  Great smelling and easy to apply.  I&#x27;m only 41 but It&#x27;s never to early to stop the antiaging process!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and gives my skin a nice glow. I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; effects, as others have claimed, but I do not have many lines on my face to begin with. Overall, it is nice for someone who wants to give their skin a nice glow, but do not expect a &#x27;miracle.&#x27;</li>
            <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite face moisturizers. First off, I love the jar. It&#x27;s heavy and just gives off that &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; feel. Next is the product inside the jar. It&#x27;s thick without being too thick but not one of those more watery creams. It has a very light scent but not one that&#x27;s very noticable unless you stick our nose in the jar. It only takes me a dab on each cheek and forehead to cover my entire face nicely. I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin. There is absolutely no greasiness or oily feeling with this cream. It makes my skin super soft and smooth from the second I put it on. Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s right up there with all the expensive brand name drugstore moisturizers if not better than some of them.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I have extremely dry skin and have been trying different samples of different products and so far this has been the best one for me. It feels cool and non greasy. I have noticed that my skin looks alot healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing cream. Smells wonderful and goes on lightweight. My skin feels smooth, supple, and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Love that this creme is unscented and non oily.  I love that it has some great super fruits such as Camu Camu, Noni, Goji, Acai, and Green Tea. Such a Treat for my skin.I mainly use this on my face and neck as it makes my skin feel smooth. I love the fact that it is unscented unlike many of the other types of cremes</li>
            <li> This is a great item. I use it every night and I can see a wonderful difference in my skin. This is all I have to use on my face nothing else and it takes care of my face in all forms giving it everything it ends to look refreshed and younger. Thanks for great stuff like this.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream! My skin looks 100% better and healthier. Smells very nice. And it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I love it!</li>
            <li> All I can say is my skin feels amazing after using this for just a few days. my skin feels smooth, and looks great. No greasy residue. I will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far.</li>
            <li> This face cream leaves my face feeling amazing.  So for me this product is a keeper!!!  I washed my faceand applied this before bed.... when we laid down I rubbed my cheek with my partners hand and she said.... wow baby soft and smells good too.  After a few days I kept getting told how I look like I am glowing and then it started with your skin looks so good you look younger some how.  LOL.... its great and my secret from  my girls. Shhhh... don&#x27;t tell.  This is my honest and unbiased opinion and for me I will continue o use of this item.</li>
            <li> Fantastic ingredients, very happy.</li>
            <li> With many anti aging cream out there I really love this one the camu complex. I have tried store brand to the expensive brand you would buy at the store. They smell nice but many left my face greasy, I had a bad reaction or it did not keep the wrinkles away. I will not be wasting any more time or money on another brand again, I have now found my favorite go to anti aging cream. This cream leaves my face moisturized and does not leave a nasty greasy residue. I love the fact that this is made for natural ingredients and I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals effecting my face. This is by far a wonderful facial cream to have in your beauty collection.</li>
            <li> Just received my Camus skin moisturizer. The directions on the box differ from the directions on the actual product. So far it made my skin feel sticky and tight. Definitely not liking my first use. I will continue to use to see if it makes any noticeable difference in my skins appearance and texture.</li>
