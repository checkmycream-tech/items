            <li>I love the texture!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I thought the consistency would be nice for my skin.  </li>
            <li>My new best friend!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>After using this for almost two weeks now, I have had NO breakouts at all which is HUGE!</li>
            <li>This primer is okay if you do not wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I looked more polished.</li>
            <li>I tried this product 3X to make sure.</li>
            <li>more prominent and visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Usually I love neutrogena products, and I had decided to try something new because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product I had been using.  </li>
            <li>My makeup went on smoothly and more even with the primer.</li>
            <li>Yes, Super Target!</li>
            <li>this has won me over as a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>I had the best experience with it that time, but still found it to be greasy, heavy, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>And even more compelling</li>
            <li>But anyways, the primer feels light on my face.</li>
            <li>I have healthy nice pretty skin where I dont really need to wear a lot of make up at all.</li>
            <li>did not bother my sensitive, dry skin - which was nice, but I found no reason to continue using it, and 2 very good reasons to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love the purchage..very very  very good&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and can be used under make-up or alone (a tint of color).</li>
            <li>Not overly thick at all and just perfect when I put my Bareminerals right over it!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does the job of keeping your make-up looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hands feel a little greasy after applying, so I always wash them, but it seems to be a good product!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it will work better on people with normal skin.  </li>
            <li>But I like a very natural blendable foundation on top that allows my freckles to show.</li>
            <li>The price was ok, and I had high hopes when I first squeezed it out.  </li>
            <li>And why not, a product that evens skin tone, and keeps make-up looking freshly applied.</li>
            <li>While my makeup applied nicely over it, and it did extend the wear of my makeup, it did not smooth out fine lines or pores, and I can&#x27;t stand the appearance of my skin while using this primer.  </li>
            <li>I am asian, have light to light medium skin tone</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>and I got 3 more zits later that night.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking really smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this primer, and it is sheer and weightless on the skin.</li>
            <li>this is actually my first one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with oily skin liking this product, and only those with VERY DRY skin might be happy.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this product for smoothing out large pores before applying foundation or powder</li>
            <li>really like how it sits on my face and the way it blends with my foundation.</li>
            <li>cuz I couldn&#x27;t afford the one I really wanted.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the only reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because so many other people wrote such fabulous ones I needed to set the next buyer straight.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes from this primer based on the overwhelming positive reiveiws I&#x27;ve read on this and other websites.  </li>
            <li>It was also a bit more pricey than some of the other drugstore primers, so for that I was also expecting it to do</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>particular primer just didn&#x27;t do either.</li>
            <li>I find that some high end primers including my Sephora face</li>
            <li>My makeup went on okay, but my face started to feel oily after a few hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>Right now with the Summer months in July, I would say it is normal because it MAY get a little oily in some parts like my forehead especially on the humid super hot days.</li>
            <li>I thought this primer might work with the new foundation.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I just started using primers last year and this Neutrogena product was my first primer.</li>
            <li>After trying it for a few days the only thing I consistently noticed was that my fine lines and under eye circles</li>
            <li>You can even wear as a light weight foundation as has a little tint to it.  </li>
            <li>The primer itself gave my skin a silky look without foundation and then with my Neutrogena clear skin powder ( honey beige)</li>
            <li>, that surprised me.  </li>
            <li>But of course, I want the protection and the natural beauty look.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for 2 weeks, to see if it was from that (since it was the only new thing I used in my makeup routine)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this primer really make my makeup last longer, but it definitely make it go on smoother.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I changed nothing in my normal morning routine, and my face was an oil slick by noon.  </li>
            <li>Not every girl likes glitter, especially if their going for a natural look with no shine.</li>
            <li>the bare minerals primer (no sunscreen</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and my pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li>, I just bought the much more expensive smashbox photo finish primer to try (since I&#x27;m new to primer).  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin, leaning towards dry now that I&#x27;m aging, so</li>
            <li>and I have normal to dry skin dependant on the time of the year.</li>
            <li>The next time, I skipped moisturizer AND sunscreen, and had better results, but still not good enough for me to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it my face was shiny and greasy looking, although it did feel smooth, but I knew it was not a good sign.  </li>
            <li>I find that this primer adds the right amount of moisturizer to my skin (not oily at all) to create a smooth base ready for additional make-up.</li>

            <li> I have normal skin, few blemishes and medium freckles.</li>

            <li> It holds my foundation, but I have to powder up later in the day due to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I skipped my morning moisturizer but still applied my heavy duty sunscreen (SPF 15 in the product is not enough for me.)  </li>
            <li> This product helps make pores look smaller and wrinkles less noticeable under makeup giving a smoother finish.  </li>
            <li> Especially in the winter months, my skin can get a little dry.</li>
            <li> but you can use the clinque city block sunscreen, let it dry for a second, and then apply primer to matte it out), try the benefit primer then foundation (it has spf 25), or even try plain neutrogena sunscreen with helioplex.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who has extremely combination skin.</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is due to the antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t as dry, so it can be a little oil for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I find it dishonest that they did not indicate the expiry that is only 6 mths from the sale date.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Primers I like - Palladio Herbal Foundation Primer, and L&#x27;oreal Magic Perfecting Base</li>
            <li> I expect to use it for less than 30x till then &amp; will probably have at least half left over.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product over other heavy wax based primers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white, lotion-like product that feels slightly thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Two stars because it did not irritate my skin, and with as heavy as it felt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed after wearing this primer for a few days I started to breakout.</li>
            <li> and I would avoid heavy liquid foundations and powders for summer seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That works better than this terrible primer.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied once I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product lately</li>
            <li> I am a least make up types..</li>
            <li> It SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I am not going back to any expensive primers!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t hold, my face was terribly shiny rivaling a 16 yr old boy with acne, and I was disgusted.</li>
            <li> Greasy on my chin and nose but not too bad on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I hate glitter!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the worst s</li>

            <li> Bought this at Wal-Mart when I ran out of my primer. Usually I love neutrogena products, and I had decided to try something new because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product I had been using.  The price was ok, and I had high hopes when I first squeezed it out.  It&#x27;s a white, lotion-like product that feels slightly thick and heavy.  I have normal skin, leaning towards dry now that I&#x27;m aging, so I thought the consistency would be nice for my skin.  Nope!  The first time I used it, I changed nothing in my normal morning routine, and my face was an oil slick by noon.  The next time, I skipped my morning moisturizer but still applied my heavy duty sunscreen (SPF 15 in the product is not enough for me.)  Same results.  The next time, I skipped moisturizer AND sunscreen, and had better results, but still not good enough for me to continue using it.  Then a month or so later, I was trying a new foundation that I found to be a little dry, so I thought this primer might work with the new foundation.  I had the best experience with it that time, but still found it to be greasy, heavy, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not recommend this product.  While my makeup applied nicely over it, and it did extend the wear of my makeup, it did not smooth out fine lines or pores, and I can&#x27;t stand the appearance of my skin while using this primer.  Two stars because it did not irritate my skin, and with as heavy as it felt, that surprised me.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with oily skin liking this product, and only those with VERY DRY skin might be happy.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and I use it before I would use any face make up. and it says you can also wear it alone too since it has sun protection of 15 SPF.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product helps make pores look smaller and wrinkles less noticeable under makeup giving a smoother finish.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This primer is okay if you do not wear makeup. Does not blend well with mineral makeup or powder. I tossed it because I have no use for it now.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products! I use their foundation, concealer, moisturizer, face wash, and sun cream. I don&#x27;t know if this primer really make my makeup last longer, but it definitely make it go on smoother. It makes your hands feel a little greasy after applying, so I always wash them, but it seems to be a good product! I just wish it was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> use this daily. it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out</li>
            <li> This is the best primer for my skin. I have oily skin. The first time I used it I was not impressed. It was when I was distracted and put on my makeup later that this product worked well. My makeup went on smoothly and more even with the primer. I looked more polished. I recommend that you let the primer set in to your skin for 2-3 minutes that it works the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only going to wear this in the cooler months, as this has a low spf. I have no idea how it would do in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with Neutrogena. I&#x27;ve noticed after wearing this primer for a few days I started to breakout. I stopped using it for 2 weeks, to see if it was from that (since it was the only new thing I used in my makeup routine)..no breakouts. I wore it again and I got 3 more zits later that night. I wouldn&#x27;t use this again.</li>
            <li> Ew glitter! I hate glitter! Not every girl likes glitter, especially if their going for a natural look with no shine.</li>
            <li> You can even wear as a light weight foundation as has a little tint to it.  Great for those who have skin allergies!</li>
            <li> Only primer I use now.  I have a vary oily nose and this help alot</li>
            <li> Honestly, the only reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because so many other people wrote such fabulous ones I needed to set the next buyer straight. This stuff is the worst s*** I&#x27;ve EVER used as a primer! I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I&#x27;m someone who has extremely combination skin. Greasy on my chin and nose but not too bad on my forehead and cheeks. This stuff didn&#x27;t hold, my face was terribly shiny rivaling a 16 yr old boy with acne, and I was disgusted. I tried this product 3X to make sure. It SUCKS! It doesn&#x27;t even dry properly and makes my expensive oil free makeup look greasy and gross. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the bare minerals primer (no sunscreen but you can use the clinque city block sunscreen, let it dry for a second, and then apply primer to matte it out), try the benefit primer then foundation (it has spf 25), or even try plain neutrogena sunscreen with helioplex. That works better than this terrible primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product lately and I really enjoy it. I like that it has SPF in it, but I do still wear SPF in my daily moisturizer and as a face powder.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how it sits on my face and the way it blends with my foundation. It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking really smooth.</li>
            <li> I was out of town and totally forgot my Sephora Face Primer so I had to run to the closest store to find a primer!! Yes, Super Target! I went with this primer because it was NOT the cheapest one and NOT the most expensive ... wow! My new best friend! I love love love this product! This is a review based on my \\&quot;OWN\\&quot; experience only as I know everyone else&#x27;s skin is different. I am asian, have light to light medium skin tone and I have normal to dry skin dependant on the time of the year. Right now with the Summer months in July, I would say it is normal because it MAY get a little oily in some parts like my forehead especially on the humid super hot days. Anywho, the firs thing I love about this product is it is a primer/ moisterizer/ sunscreen SPF 15 all in one product! That totally saves me time from putting on sunscreen like I did before and THEN putting on the primer! So that is already a plus! After using this for almost two weeks now, I have had NO breakouts at all which is HUGE! I find that some high end primers including my Sephora face primer (matte &amp; the sheer) BOTH caused me breakouts probably because they blocked my  pores. As for this Neutrogena one, NOPE! Not at all! You can tell there is a little sunscreen in there because of the smell of the product but it feels thick enough and yet smooth enough for my skin! I love the texture! Not overly thick at all and just perfect when I put my Bareminerals right over it! I have healthy nice pretty skin where I dont really need to wear a lot of make up at all. But of course, I want the protection and the natural beauty look. But overall!! ... this has won me over as a loyal customer! I love it! I am not going back to any expensive primers!!! I hope that if you are looking at my review and consider it and purchase it, that it works as well for you as it does for me!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing make-up about 25 years. I just started using primers last year and this Neutrogena product was my first primer. It&#x27;s super light and can be used under make-up or alone (a tint of color). Especially in the winter months, my skin can get a little dry. I find that this primer adds the right amount of moisturizer to my skin (not oily at all) to create a smooth base ready for additional make-up. It&#x27;s a great value, too!</li>
            <li> I got this primer cuz I couldn&#x27;t afford the one I really wanted. I was not disappointed at all. It gives you the flawless look with makeup and evens out my skin tone. I have the T Zone skin and usually break out with too much gunk on my face. This primer went over my topical med. lotion for my acne and was perfect as a moisturizer after. My makeup stayed on even after an hour cardio class. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now.  I have normal/dry skin with rosacea, and I use this alone with only translucent powder.  My skin feels and looks terrific! Plus it has antioxidants and sunscreen.  And even more compelling, I just bought the much more expensive smashbox photo finish primer to try (since I&#x27;m new to primer).  I cannot tell the difference.  Yay neutrogena!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does the job of keeping your make-up looking fresh.  I have had good experiences with Neutrogena Products.  Give it a try.  I believe you will like your results.</li>
            <li> Protects your skin from the sun while simultaneously infusing it with antioxidants and skin soothing agents. I love this primer, and it is sheer and weightless on the skin. I prefer this product over other heavy wax based primers.</li>
            <li> I am a least make up types..and this works best...just the primer and some lip gloss and I am good to go go...!</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t use primers AT ALL. this is actually my first one. For an all face look, for eyes I use a photofinish from Revlon. But anyways, the primer feels light on my face. I have normal skin, few blemishes and medium freckles. But I like a very natural blendable foundation on top that allows my freckles to show. The primer itself gave my skin a silky look without foundation and then with my Neutrogena clear skin powder ( honey beige) it grabbed the foundation and held it perfectly. I see a real big difference with the primer on and without the primer. Big thumbs up to this. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who has oily skin and I would avoid heavy liquid foundations and powders for summer seasons.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the primer is great, smells nice, and has a great result with powder foundations.</li>
            <li> I find it dishonest that they did not indicate the expiry that is only 6 mths from the sale date. I expect to use it for less than 30x till then &amp; will probably have at least half left over.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, and i loved it. Good choise&lt;br /&gt;very good, erverhing is good&lt;br /&gt;i love the purchage..very very  very good&lt;br /&gt;ervethings is good, very beautiful, wonderfull</li>
            <li> I discovered primers and have been since been a fan.  And why not, a product that evens skin tone, and keeps make-up looking freshly applied. Love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular primer just didn&#x27;t do either. After trying it for a few days the only thing I consistently noticed was that my fine lines and under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;were more prominent and visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not bother my sensitive, dry skin - which was nice, but I found no reason to continue using it, and 2 very good reasons to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primers I like - Palladio Herbal Foundation Primer, and L&#x27;oreal Magic Perfecting Base</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you will love this product.  My skin isn&#x27;t as dry, so it can be a little oil for my taste.  But, it performs as advertised and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is doing to my skin, but I like it.  As a primer it works okay.  It holds my foundation, but I have to powder up later in the day due to oily skin.  It&#x27;s AFTER I wash my face that I notices the biggest difference.  My skin is soft and my pores are smaller.  I wonder if this is due to the antioxidants.  All I know is I like it.  My skin looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my mineral powder foundation stays put all day.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes from this primer based on the overwhelming positive reiveiws I&#x27;ve read on this and other websites.  Howevever I was not satisfied once I tried it.  As soon as I applied it my face was shiny and greasy looking, although it did feel smooth, but I knew it was not a good sign.  My makeup went on okay, but my face started to feel oily after a few hours of wear.  It also seemed to not hold my makeup on as well.  I have oily skin so I need a primer that can mattify my face and keep it that way.  This primer did not do it for me.  Perhaps it will work better on people with normal skin.  It was also a bit more pricey than some of the other drugstore primers, so for that I was also expecting it to do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would not reccommend this to people with oily/combination skin and I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product is excellant.  It has antioxidents as well as sunscreen which truly makes it a rarity in this category.</li>
            <li> I like this product for smoothing out large pores before applying foundation or powder</li>
