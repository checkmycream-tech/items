            <li>It&#x27;s a great treat.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this soap!!</li>
            <li>I will stick with my Dr. Bonner soaps, they are more affordable and delightfully fragrant.</li>
            <li>Excellent product ... need more products like this one.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be pleasant.</li>
            <li>I loved this soap.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the cloves and cinnamon!</li>
            <li>It has a smell like Christmas and lathers up really nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>(yeah, nice people).</li>
            <li>Even today, carrying a sliver of Thieves&#x27; Soap in one&#x27;s pocket is often an effective counter to ad homeniem attacks and testicular torsion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really nice smell love this bar of soap</li>
            <li>Mailed well &amp; love the product</li>
            <li>They offered up the formula in return for more lenient sentences when they were caught.    </li>
            <li>But seemed ok</li>
            <li>There are many more uses to this miracle cleansing agent, but need I go on?</li>
            <li>I do love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way this smells.  </li>
            <li>But that being said, I love it anyway and use it myself.</li>
            <li>I love Thieves.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Then of course, it is supposed to have a medicinal use, I would not have purchased if I had known about the strong odor.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD</li>
            <li>There is a legend that Thieves&#x27; Soap was originally formulated by Ancient Egyptian ninjas as a protection against the diuretic effects of drinking water from the Nile and to help ward off flea-infested water buffalo.</li>
            <li>Young Living oils are simply THE BEST!</li>
            <li>I have not found better essential oils than those produced by Young Living, and have been extremely happy with almost every product of theirs I have used.    </li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas gift and at first just thought of it as a delightful smelling soap however as the weeks past I noticed something unusual.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more natural, mildly germicidal soap which does not have a huge load of synthetic, probably noxious, chemicals, then definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li>Thieves blend has been tested in laboratories and is quite effective in killing a wide variety of microbes.     </li>
            <li>A short list of the many ailments that this miracle soap has cured;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the smell and great for washing hands after being sick, colds etc, feel like you are REALLY cleaning your hands!</li>
            <li>Gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li>My skin is already feeling softer, and the aroma makes my bathroom smell like a spa - very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know yet how much this will or will not help the dermatitis I have, but am hopeful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!....</li>
            <li>I thought it was a bit much for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks .</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I thought this soap would be highly fragrant.</li>
            <li>This soap helped clear my skin very well.</li>
            <li>This soap is hard for me to use because it has a strong medicinal smell.</li>

            <li> This soap is hard for me to use because it has a strong medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> I have already ran out of it, so it does not last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This soap is made with a special blend of essential oils from Young Living called \\&quot;Thieves.\\&quot; The oil blend is called that because it is based on a formula used by a group of robbers in medieval times who rubbed themselves with the oils to keep from getting sick while robbing plague victims</li>
            <li> Now please excuse me while I race to get my card, purchases must be made!!</li>
            <li> Well it hardly has any odor and is quite small in size for the price.</li>
            <li> In fact the entire time I used the soap I did not get sick once.</li>
            <li> ive run out of the soap and have been sick several times since running out.</li>
            <li> Typically in my family if one person gets sick I will invariable get it as well, even if NO ONE else does.</li>
            <li> my daughter became ill, I waited for the symptoms to start in me and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Three weeks later my mother in law came home with a nasty cough, again I did not catch it.</li>
            <li> And I am usually sick at least once a month during the winter.</li>
            <li> I feel it keeps me from getting sick.  </li>
            <li> I never get sick with this product on board!!</li>

            <li> It was beyond it&#x27;s expiration date. But seemed ok</li>
            <li> Love this product! Recieved it on time! I never get sick with this product on board!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap!! It is just to pricey for me to keep in stocked around the house, so I only treat myself every once in a while.</li>
            <li> This soap helped clear my skin very well. I have already ran out of it, so it does not last as long as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d recommend ordering a couple at a time. But it does well!</li>
            <li> A short list of the many ailments that this miracle soap has cured;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ringworm&lt;br /&gt;Eczema&lt;br /&gt;The flu&lt;br /&gt;Impedigo&lt;br /&gt;Explosive flatulence&lt;br /&gt;Trench Foot&lt;br /&gt;Smart Mouth&lt;br /&gt;ADHD&lt;br /&gt;Rectal/Cranial Inversion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list for Thieves&#x27; Soap reads like a sacred mantra of purity and holiness: Palm oil, Coconut oil, Olea Europea Fruit oil, Glycerin, Clove bud oil....somewhere in the same room, each batch of Thieves&#x27; Soap has been blessed by Incan priests and Dr. Oz by proxy. There is a legend that Thieves&#x27; Soap was originally formulated by Ancient Egyptian ninjas as a protection against the diuretic effects of drinking water from the Nile and to help ward off flea-infested water buffalo. Even today, carrying a sliver of Thieves&#x27; Soap in one&#x27;s pocket is often an effective counter to ad homeniem attacks and testicular torsion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To increase your IQ, SAT test scores, and fertility, use Thieves&#x27; Soap daily in the shower. There are many more uses to this miracle cleansing agent, but need I go on? Your aura will thank you!</li>

Typically in my family if one person gets sick I will invariable get it as well, even if NO ONE else does. Mid February my daughter became ill, I waited for the symptoms to start in me and nothing happened. Three weeks later my mother in law came home with a nasty cough, again I did not catch it. In fact the entire time I used the soap I did not get sick once. Not ONCE. And I am usually sick at least once a month during the winter. ive run out of the soap and have been sick several times since running out. Now please excuse me while I race to get my card, purchases must be made!!</li>
            <li> really nice smell love this bar of soap</li>
            <li> IT WAS PURCHASED FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE HAD A YEAST PROBLEM ON HER SKIN AND THE MEDS THEY GAVE HER HAD ALONG LIST OF SIDE EFFECTS. SO FAR SO GOOD USING IT TWICE AWEEK.</li>
            <li> Young Living oils are simply THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I just received this about 4 days ago, and have used it 3 times.  My skin is already feeling softer, and the aroma makes my bathroom smell like a spa - very relaxing.  I don&#x27;t know yet how much this will or will not help the dermatitis I have, but am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this smells.  The soap leaves my hands softer than before use.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap. It was supposed to help my daughter with a rash, that turned out to be a milk allergy, and this didn&#x27;t do a thing for. But that being said, I love it anyway and use it myself. It&#x27;s like Christmas in a soap bar. I love the cloves and cinnamon! I wish they had this in a body spray! Highly recommend!....I only took a star off for price. I thought it was a bit much for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ... need more products like this one.  I like the fragrance and feel of the soap.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> love the smell and great for washing hands after being sick, colds etc, feel like you are REALLY cleaning your hands!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Thanks . I love Thieves.</li>
