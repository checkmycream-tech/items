            <li>BUT I will still continue to buy because they are great for a night out when you dont have your nails done or feel like doing them!</li>
            <li>They stay on for a couple of days through all of the dishes, cleanups and handwashing I do which is impressive.</li>
            <li>The best part?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li>They are still very good for an evenings event, but they no longer can replace a manicure for me.</li>
            <li>It used to be the best thing I could do to make my nails look nice.  </li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>They offered good variety.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing these again, and in more colors!</li>

            <li>A go-to product for special occasions or events where you might not have time to fancy up your fingers but want to look great.</li>
            <li>They came off very easy and some stay until remover.</li>
            <li>They were easy to apply, I think it took all of 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE them!</li>
            <li>This is is a reliable and attractive product that is easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li>I love this line of nails.</li>
            <li>and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling.</li>
            <li>This product is good is you want to display pretty hands for an evening and an evening alone.  </li>
            <li>It came perfectly wrapped and I love the little \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>I like to have nails but don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon &amp; prefer the option of easy removal if I want to.</li>
            <li>After many years of getting my nails professionally done, I&#x27;m getting more compliments than ever.  </li>
            <li>but I found that to not be true at all</li>
            <li>Sooo easy to use and pretty.</li>
            <li>They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick.</li>
            <li>If you choose the right size there should not be any gaps.</li>
            <li>They have survived two cashier work shifts, many showers, a yoga class, and lots of general abuse.</li>
            <li>It was a better deal for me than getting a manicure because they looked better, longer, didn&#x27;t chip, and looked dry natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from the brand just not</li>
            <li>First time user of this product.  </li>
            <li>They look good but only last two or three days.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I have tried this brand before and worked really well.  </li>
            <li>When applied correctly they appear real b/c of their length.</li>
            <li>As much as I love this brand I would definitely not repurchase the French manicure ones.</li>
            <li>this particular one anymore.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>When applied properly they can last a week fabulously.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to a T and then put clear nail polish on the edges of my nails before every shower.</li>
            <li>No one can tell they&#x27;re not my natural nails.</li>
            <li>Only the little finger and the ring finger nails fit the size of my nails, and I have used plenty of Lee Press On Nails with no problem.</li>
            <li>Convenience-wise, they only take a few minutes to peel and glue once you find the nails that somewhat fit each finger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not especially careful with them</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not especially careful with them</li>
            <li> but I know they won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> They last 12 hours tops before one starts to feel like they might loose one any moment.</li>
            <li> They lasted for 6 days  through an anime convention where my hands came into contact with people and surfaces all day long.</li>
            <li> They no longer stay on my nails very long</li>
            <li> They come with tons of different sizes and enough to replace if a nail pops off after a few days.</li>
            <li> While 3 of the nails came loose on the 5th day I still had to use rubbing alcohol to remove them.</li>
            <li> Not one of them glued down properly.</li>
            <li> so I only ended up being able to wear them for a night :(</li>
            <li> I tried to file around the edges of the nail to make the gap in the adhesive less noticeable but you can still see spots in the middle of the nail.</li>
            <li> These are simply done cheaply with bad glue.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m typically taking them off after 2 days .</li>
            <li> I could typically get them to stay on for about 5-7 days with just replacing a few which broke off from the extras.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t destroy my nails and they stuck well.  </li>
            <li> You can see through the nail to the adhesive and that is just not cute.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have given this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I feel like they are using different glue now</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from press on nails, because I have never had any luck with them.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wear for at least seven.</li>
            <li> Problem is a few were very insecure</li>
            <li> I get the &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; for fake nails</li>
            <li> These are EXTREMELY fake looking nails.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I picked these up from Kroger.</li>
            <li> These have proved me wrong.</li>

            <li> I prefer these over acrylic nails.  I get the &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; for fake nails but I know they won&#x27;t last long.  These do just the trick!  People never believe me when I say they are &amp;#34;press on&amp;#34; nails.  Love love LOVE them!</li>
            <li> This product is good is you want to display pretty hands for an evening and an evening alone.  The pack says that the nails last up to one week but I found that to not be true at all especially is you like to wash your hands regularly.  They last 12 hours tops before one starts to feel like they might loose one any moment.</li>
            <li> Product came in 3-4 days!! It came perfectly wrapped and I love the little \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; bottle it comes in. Problem is a few were very insecure so I only ended up being able to wear them for a night :( BUT I will still continue to buy because they are great for a night out when you dont have your nails done or feel like doing them!</li>
            <li> I love this line of nails. When applied properly they can last a week fabulously. They come with tons of different sizes and enough to replace if a nail pops off after a few days. As much as I love this brand I would definitely not repurchase the French manicure ones. You can see through the nail to the adhesive and that is just not cute. I tried to file around the edges of the nail to make the gap in the adhesive less noticeable but you can still see spots in the middle of the nail. It just doesn&#x27;t look good. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from the brand just not this particular one anymore.</li>
            <li> I am a mom so I do a lot of hand washing. I like to have nails but don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon &amp; prefer the option of easy removal if I want to. I tried several different brands of press on when I found these. I really like them. They stay on for a couple of days through all of the dishes, cleanups and handwashing I do which is impressive. If you choose the right size there should not be any gaps. I would not recommend using the charms however.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I have tried this brand before and worked really well.  Hope to get the same results</li>
            <li> These are EXTREMELY fake looking nails. Not one of them glued down properly. Only the little finger and the ring finger nails fit the size of my nails, and I have used plenty of Lee Press On Nails with no problem. These are simply done cheaply with bad glue. Convenience-wise, they only take a few minutes to peel and glue once you find the nails that somewhat fit each finger. I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product.  I was blown away by the quality, ease and staying power of these nails. I painted them with a lavender polish, top-coated and applied them. They lasted for 6 days  through an anime convention where my hands came into contact with people and surfaces all day long. The nails held on and the polish NEVER started chipping off. While 3 of the nails came loose on the 5th day I still had to use rubbing alcohol to remove them. A go-to product for special occasions or events where you might not have time to fancy up your fingers but want to look great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wore these for a week and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling. They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick. imPress nails damage your nails. I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend to ANYONE. Rather, I am warning everyone what they do to their nails after wearing for just 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> They look good but only last two or three days. I wanted to wear for at least seven. When applied correctly they appear real b/c of their length.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have given this product 5 stars.  It used to be the best thing I could do to make my nails look nice.  I could typically get them to stay on for about 5-7 days with just replacing a few which broke off from the extras.  It didn&#x27;t destroy my nails and they stuck well.  They offered good variety.  It was a better deal for me than getting a manicure because they looked better, longer, didn&#x27;t chip, and looked dry natural.  Unfortunately, I feel like they are using different glue now they they offer an &#x27;extended&#x27; option.  They no longer stay on my nails very long and I&#x27;m typically taking them off after 2 days . They are still very good for an evenings event, but they no longer can replace a manicure for me.</li>
            <li> Absolute best manicure I&#x27;ve ever had.  After many years of getting my nails professionally done, I&#x27;m getting more compliments than ever.  The best part?  No damage to my nails.  This system uses a stretchy adhesive that does not damage nails upon removal.  I use the on my toes too!</li>
            <li> Some of the nails would not stay put. They came off very easy and some stay until remover. I Like the way they look, will use in emergencys.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I picked these up from Kroger. I followed the instructions to a T and then put clear nail polish on the edges of my nails before every shower. I put them on Saturday night, and it is now Wednesday morning and they&#x27;re not budging! They have survived two cashier work shifts, many showers, a yoga class, and lots of general abuse. I&#x27;m not especially careful with them though I do hold them down/press on them throughout the day for peace of mind. I&#x27;m incredibly impressed. These nails are awesome and look real.</li>
            <li> as nice and cheaper than salon nails</li>
            <li> Great. I get tons of compliments. No one can tell they&#x27;re not my natural nails.</li>
            <li> This is is a reliable and attractive product that is easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li> The sizes work on all different hand sizes. Looks really nice , I would buy again .</li>
            <li> Sooo easy to use and pretty. You get 24 nails.</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from press on nails, because I have never had any luck with them. They always fall off one by one in a day. These have proved me wrong. They were easy to apply, I think it took all of 5 minutes! After washing dishes, showering, and my hands being washed over and over, they are still on!! I will be purchasing these again, and in more colors!</li>
