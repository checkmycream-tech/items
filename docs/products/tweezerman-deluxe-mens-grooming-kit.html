            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>Ideal for travel shaving kit or gym bag.  </li>
            <li>Great pointed tweezers, great for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>This kit is handy to have around and is perfect to travel with.</li>
            <li>This is a very handy kit to have around</li>
            <li>This set is a good compromise between \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; and being a caveman.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a good brand.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very nice and  handy.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; compact.</li>
            <li>Why not have your own</li>
            <li>Nice set, but not the sharpest set.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>This is more than the price of the tools.</li>
            <li>The tools are nice but the case is cheap ... won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>This is lot better than what you get at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>This is the top product of the line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought nicer tweezers and a better nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>the bag could be more convenient, some times tools drop out</li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>The scissors are very nicely made, good enough for sideburn trims.  </li>
            <li>Within a month the tools has rusted, great if you are looking for a new and innovative way to get tetanus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scissors are great with stumpy rounded tips, which makes them rather safe to use near the face.</li>
            <li>I use this as we frequently travel, it&#x27;s the perfect size to have in your backpack with just the right products for on the go.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality tools, as is to be expected from Tweezerman.     </li>
            <li>The items easily fall out of the case.  </li>
            <li>This is a very handy little kit, and I consider it is good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tweezers are extremely fine and have a sharp/pin point tip on them.</li>
            <li>Everything worked fine.</li>
            <li>I still plan on bringing a backup kit that I will piece together before I go, but this seemed like it fit the bill for what I needed.</li>
            <li>Excellent gift for someone that needed to keep up on their grooming, too bad they didn&#x27;t use it :p</li>
            <li>Great quality razor sharp and well-built.</li>
            <li>The file handle also broke fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This product provides high quality tweezer, nose safe scissor, nail file and nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>really my biggest issue is with the case, the items (clippers, file, etc) fall out of it easily.</li>
            <li>Does not make a clean crisp cut.</li>
            <li>The lifetime sharpening is a nice idea, but you have to pay to mail the tools back to Tweezerman, and you also have to send them $8 per tool for return shipping.  </li>
            <li>Seems solidly built and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Worth the money -</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d change, it would be nice to have a cover for the nail file.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>would have liked to see some flat edged tweezers in the kit as well</li>
            <li>My only reason for less than five stars is these items are made in China and do not appear to be the best quality steel</li>
            <li>It would have been a great item if only it had been larger.</li>
            <li>It appears to be the same texture on both sides - it would have been nice to have a coarse side and a fine side for finishing, but again I can&#x27;t fault the kit at this price point.</li>
            <li>Small and will fit nicely into my gear.</li>
            <li>there are better products out there in the same price range.  </li>
            <li>I use them more than my standard in house stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most well-designed case, but in my experience, it is not nearly as bad as other reviewers state.    </li>
            <li>Get the job done and come in a nice little case.</li>
            <li>but i ended up getting the same cheap China-made Tweezerman kit.</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier for him to keep track of these items.</li>
            <li>They are quite effective at removing ingrown hairs thanks to the sharp point which has no trouble at all piercing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find myself using this more than any other piece in the kit.    </li>
            <li>It has all your need to keep &lt;br /&gt;the nails and other parts of the body in top condition.</li>
            <li>It includes a variety of tools that seem to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The case is big enough to hold an extra tool or two which is nice.    </li>
            <li>The implements are precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>I am going to end up spending twice as much to replace all of the tools when I wish I just had a different kit to begin with.    </li>
            <li>but like it so much I have bought a second one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend twice as much, but they should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Enough said really.</li>
            <li>The case is a good size, but is difficult to close.    </li>
            <li>The point on them is so fine that you can actually chop hairs if you squeeze them tightly with the tip of the tweezers.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t expect them to stay rust free and sharp for long.  </li>
            <li>however I found the instruments to be too small to be comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>The facial hair scissors finger loops are to small for my fingers to fit in to the loops.</li>
            <li>have long narrow fingers, and the clippers are too small to be useful for me, so I really wonder what really manly hands would do with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The grooming tools appear to be fine, but the kit is poorly designed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The grooming tools appear to be fine, but the kit is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> Tweezers are quite delicate so be careful, but its a clean set with everything you could need</li>
            <li> The pointed tweezers are made of a softer metal, which bend easily - (maybe in my shaving bag)rendering them useless, it won&#x27;t even grasp a hair.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is with the scissors--they are short and curved, unlike Tweezerman&#x27;s other beard/moustache trimmers.</li>
            <li> It can be a little challenge getting it all back in the case but seriously, not a big deal I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit as a throw away travel kit for upcoming travels to hot dusty places.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t anything crazy but they are fine for the price.</li>
            <li> This about what I expected.  </li>
            <li> to me it seems as though it were designed for Womens fingers, which is a little strange given that this is a &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s Grooming Kit&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The kit was not expensive so replacement will not be difficult.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had no problems with items falling out of the case.</li>
            <li> However the quality is not up to par when compared to my other Tweezerman products,  This appears to be another company using the Tweezerman name under a licensing agreement.  </li>
            <li> only gripes I have is that the nail clippers are rather small, and the radius (curvature) of the clipper blades is quite small...</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this as a gift, but soon became disappointed in the cutting quality of the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Needs a set of round nosed tweezers too for the nose and ears, etc.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are too small to use especially if you have hard to cut thick nails.</li>
            <li> THe clippers were so small they were of little use.  </li>
            <li> The small scissor included has rounded tips for use in trimming nasal and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they did break, but they did.  </li>
            <li> I added a cuticle clipper to my kit, which fits behind the nail clipper in the picture.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift, and proved to be utterly useless in a month.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quite dangerous</li>
            <li> Basically it meants you won&#x27;t be inadvertently cutting anything unless you place it between the blades and squeeze the handles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is worthless.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As I stated, this is my third set of these and I love them.  Great quality razor sharp and well-built.</li>
            <li> It only taken 2 months for the nail clipper to brake in to 3 pieces. The facial hair scissors finger loops are to small for my fingers to fit in to the loops. In my opinion this purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this as a gift, but soon became disappointed in the cutting quality of the nail clippers.  They do not work as well as the dollar bin clippers from the local pharmacy, so I replaced them.    The file works well.  I find myself using this more than any other piece in the kit.    The case is a good size, but is difficult to close.    I added a cuticle clipper to my kit, which fits behind the nail clipper in the picture.  The case is big enough to hold an extra tool or two which is nice.    Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone else.  I am going to end up spending twice as much to replace all of the tools when I wish I just had a different kit to begin with.    The lifetime sharpening is a nice idea, but you have to pay to mail the tools back to Tweezerman, and you also have to send them $8 per tool for return shipping.  This is more than the price of the tools.</li>
            <li> This about what I expected.  The tools are nice but the case is cheap ... won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is compact and contains all you need to take care of nails.  Ideal for travel shaving kit or gym bag.  The small scissor included has rounded tips for use in trimming nasal and ear hairs.  My only reason for less than five stars is these items are made in China and do not appear to be the best quality steel so I don&#x27;t expect them to stay rust free and sharp for long.  The kit was not expensive so replacement will not be difficult.</li>

            <li> really my biggest issue is with the case, the items (clippers, file, etc) fall out of it easily.</li>
            <li> I thuoght i was going to get quality grooming kit different from the ones being sold at CVS stores but i ended up getting the same cheap China-made Tweezerman kit. It works.</li>
            <li> The workmanship is excellent. This is lot better than what you get at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality tools, as is to be expected from Tweezerman.     Unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had no problems with items falling out of the case. It&#x27;s not the most well-designed case, but in my experience, it is not nearly as bad as other reviewers state.    My only gripe is with the scissors--they are short and curved, unlike Tweezerman&#x27;s other beard/moustache trimmers. I don&#x27;t understand curved scissors for trimming a beard or moustache...</li>
            <li> This set is a good compromise between \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; and being a caveman. &lt;br /&gt;Trim your nose-hairs, get rid of the unibrow, and keep it in your travel kit.</li>
            <li> Everything works like it is supposed to.  However the quality is not up to par when compared to my other Tweezerman products,  This appears to be another company using the Tweezerman name under a licensing agreement.  The file handle also broke fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my huband as a stocking stuffer. The quality of the tweezerman tools are excellent for the price. Nice &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> So I travel a lot and have always just moved this into and out of my personal hygiene bag for each trip but like it so much I have bought a second one so I don&#x27;t have to worry about where my grooming kit is!!</li>
            <li> This is the top product of the line. It has all your need to keep &lt;br /&gt;the nails and other parts of the body in top condition.</li>
            <li> The case is worthless.  The items just fall out.  The clippers actually broke.  I&#x27;m not sure how they did break, but they did.  The pointed tweezers are made of a softer metal, which bend easily - (maybe in my shaving bag)rendering them useless, it won&#x27;t even grasp a hair.  This was a gift, and proved to be utterly useless in a month.  You may as well buy a cheaper set and save your money.  I&#x27;ve since bought nicer tweezers and a better nail clipper.  I&#x27;ve spend twice as much, but they should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy kit to have around however I found the instruments to be too small to be comfortable in my hand. (and I am female).  THe clippers were so small they were of little use.  The carrying case is very nice and  handy. It would have been a great item if only it had been larger.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy little kit, and I consider it is good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripes I have is that the nail clippers are rather small, and the radius (curvature) of the clipper blades is quite small... to me it seems as though it were designed for Womens fingers, which is a little strange given that this is a &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s Grooming Kit&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long narrow fingers, and the clippers are too small to be useful for me, so I really wonder what really manly hands would do with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are extremely fine and have a sharp/pin point tip on them. They&#x27;re quite dangerous so you need to be really careful if you&#x27;re using them near the face. The point on them is so fine that you can actually chop hairs if you squeeze them tightly with the tip of the tweezers. They are quite effective at removing ingrown hairs thanks to the sharp point which has no trouble at all piercing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to see some flat edged tweezers in the kit as well but at this price I cannot complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are great with stumpy rounded tips, which makes them rather safe to use near the face. Basically it meants you won&#x27;t be inadvertently cutting anything unless you place it between the blades and squeeze the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the double sided nail file is... a nail file. Enough said really. It appears to be the same texture on both sides - it would have been nice to have a coarse side and a fine side for finishing, but again I can&#x27;t fault the kit at this price point.</li>
            <li> This product provides high quality tweezer, nose safe scissor, nail file and nail clipper.  Enough said. Worth the money -</li>
            <li> Within a month the tools has rusted, great if you are looking for a new and innovative way to get tetanus.</li>
            <li> Great pointed tweezers, great for ingrown hairs.  Needs a set of round nosed tweezers too for the nose and ears, etc.  The scissors are very nicely made, good enough for sideburn trims.  The only thing I&#x27;d change, it would be nice to have a cover for the nail file.</li>
            <li> The items easily fall out of the case.  The clippers are too small to use especially if you have hard to cut thick nails. there are better products out there in the same price range.  for grooming tips go to [...]</li>
            <li> The grooming tools appear to be fine, but the kit is poorly designed.  The tools fall out and scatter in my doppkit.</li>
            <li> the bag could be more convenient, some times tools drop out</li>
            <li> Everyone needs one of these items at some point.  Why not have your own</li>
            <li> This kit is handy to have around and is perfect to travel with. It includes a variety of tools that seem to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t anything crazy but they are fine for the price. Get the job done and come in a nice little case. It can be a little challenge getting it all back in the case but seriously, not a big deal I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this as we frequently travel, it&#x27;s the perfect size to have in your backpack with just the right products for on the go. Recommend</li>
            <li> tiny, especially for the cost.  I was expecting more. Probably my fault for not reading the size in the description</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my nephew.  They are something every man needs in his kit.  These tools should serve him well throughout the years.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my son. He said its the best grooming set that he&#x27;s ever had. The implements are precise and sharp. Tweezerman is a good brand. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice set, but not the sharpest set. Does not make a clean crisp cut. Should have looked at a European made set.</li>
            <li> These are great! I use them more than my standard in house stuff. Do yourself a favor and purchase them.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for our son who is on the go alot. It makes it much easier for him to keep track of these items. Everything worked fine.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, you get what you pay for.  Tweezers are quite delicate so be careful, but its a clean set with everything you could need</li>
