            <li>I love Redkin Guts.  </li>
            <li>I love Redken products and this says it will give your hair guts</li>
            <li>this is my favorite product for adding volume to my hair without stickiness.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon, but I will never order this product on line again.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, I have used it before.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product helps amp it up and better with styling.</li>
            <li>I love a lot of the redken products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a medium mousse, nothing too strong.</li>
            <li>Use it all the time and have recommended it to people with fine, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>The cans were so old that the pressure wasn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>They have the original ones at any saloon or grocery stores like Harris Teeter.</li>
            <li>The first one I was able to use once</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and not sticky and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Great for fine, thin, straight hair gives it the body needed and with Aerogel spray gel, that is a great combo.  </li>
            <li>so I have two full bottles that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>For those of us with fine thin hair, this is the best at disguising that.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Great lift and not sticky or oily  Lifts and does not pull down on the hair.  </li>
            <li>have used this for years for my curly hair, it is marketed as a &#x27;root lifter&#x27; but does a great job taming frizzes of curly hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Now I find that I can&#x27;t return it since Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back aerosol cans considered hazardous.</li>
            <li>While I love and have used Redken Guts 10 for many years, the product sent to me was not the quality I expected.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, however, the bottles I received were old and the scent was gone.</li>
            <li>I spray it right into the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for such an excellent hair product!</li>
            <li>I have VERY fine hair and not much of it.</li>
            <li>Can easily be freshened up with the blow dryer again for longer lasting results.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine hair extra body.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very forceful spray</li>
            <li>so it really didn&#x27;t spray and it smelled like vinegar.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I shake it.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine, flat hair , this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>and I usually get more than I want to use too!  </li>
            <li>The product was old and runny, so when I informed the seller, they were nice enough to reimburse my entire payment!  </li>
            <li>this particular one should be called NO Spray Foam.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Hoping they are willing to take the products back</li>
            <li>The only downside (which is just cosmetic) is the can is so large it doesn&#x27;t fit in the cabinet where I keep all my other hair supplies.  </li>
            <li>This must be old, is smell awful...like vinegar.</li>
            <li>This is the old packaging and I suspect that it is ancient.</li>
            <li>This is the only mousse I&#x27;ve found that poofs up my otherwise fine and flat hair, especially in the summer when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li>Plus it really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is just right hold on my hair and does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>You will know you used to much if your hair feel hard, once you find the right amount you will never use anything else.  </li>
            <li>AND I FOUND IT SOMEWHAT HARD TO READ THE FINE PRINT WHEN ORDERING</li>
            <li>The previous reviews were right.</li>
            <li>So far the 2nd can is working</li>
            <li>- it was very runny and harder to apply.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for long lasting, touchable, style-able fullness.</li>
            <li>It gives my roots the right amount of lift without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past (from the store, not amazon) and it is wonderful, but I am sad to have wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I have ultra thin and fine hair.</li>

            <li> I have ultra thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft , loose and look as if i spent hours on it.</li>
            <li> Great product but the spray nozzle failed after only a couple of uses making the can useless.</li>
            <li> It makes curly hair spikey and tends to make hair dry.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected....</li>
            <li> but a wet spray trickles out of it.</li>
            <li> Apply it all over but be careful not to overdue.  </li>
            <li> I spray it all over my curls and then blow dry my hair upside down.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other product reviews.</li>
            <li> I love Redken Guts 10, but what I received was crap.</li>
            <li> Water dripped down my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years but this last  can  was  terrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because this is my favorite rootlift and decided to purchase online because of the cost and time!</li>
            <li> I just wasted about 18 dollars on this volume spray that i&#x27;m going to throw away.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it was a fake or too old, but it didn&#x27;t foam up like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY ORDERED THE WRONG SPRAY.</li>
            <li> Usually buy in the salon, probably will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Similar to foam thickening mousse by living proof, but less expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking the product from the bad performer was old?</li>
            <li> The seller should be forced to stop selling recalled or outdated products.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to people with thin hair</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> I found it quite expensive...</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> but I have a very difficult time spraying it where I want it.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad and do not work as it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> This was a bad can.</li>
            <li> I hate  </li>
            <li> disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product..</li>
            <li> This product did not smell like it should, it smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> This product is awful and does not do what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> It smelled so awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for fine, thin, straight hair gives it the body needed and with Aerogel spray gel, that is a great combo.  On for volume and one to finish the styling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken Guts 10 for a number of years and never found anything else to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  The last two you sent me don&#x27;t work!  The sprayer on both bottles quit working after one use so I have two full bottles that I can&#x27;t use. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected....great root booster for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great product but the spray nozzle failed after only a couple of uses making the can useless.</li>
            <li> Love this product....one of the best mouses on the market.  Redken has great products and will continue to buy. thanks</li>
            <li> I love Redken&#x27;s Guts!  It gives my roots the right amount of lift without being stiff.  My hairdresser turned me on to it.  Redken Guts is the best root boost I have found  and it doesn&#x27;t make my head itch.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were right. The product seems to be the orginal Redken but it is not. Smells bad and do not work as it is supposed to be. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! They have the original ones at any saloon or grocery stores like Harris Teeter.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my cousin when I asked her how she styled her hair to make it stand up a bit on the top of her head.  I guess it  works but I have a very difficult time spraying it where I want it.  It&#x27;s a very forceful spray and I usually get more than I want to use too!  I found it quite expensive...especially since it is just sitting in the bathroom, not being used.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other product reviews. This must be old, is smell awful...like vinegar. Plus Amazon won&#x27;t return this product. I just wasted about 18 dollars on this volume spray that i&#x27;m going to throw away.</li>
            <li> I love Redken Guts 10, but what I received was crap. Not sure whether it was a fake or too old, but it didn&#x27;t foam up like it&#x27;s supposed to. Had to toss it.</li>
            <li> Edited: I gave this 5 stars because the seller is excellent! Customer service went out of their way to make me happy and issued me a full refund! Extremely satisfied with their doing!  This product did not smell like it should, it smelled terrible. It also didn&#x27;t spray out as a foam it sprayed out like water. Very disappointed because this is my favorite rootlift and decided to purchase online because of the cost and time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and seems to be the only product that gives my hair volume and helps to hold a style.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Price was great, fast shippiong. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product was clogged and nothing worked to unclog it. The merchant returned my money</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine hair and not much of it. This gives my hair volume and boost at the root without the stickiness that many products leave. I spray it right into the roots of my hair. Can easily be freshened up with the blow dryer again for longer lasting results. My hairdresser gave me a sample for a gift and I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles since then.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these.  The first one I was able to use once and the then it didn&#x27;t work.  So far the 2nd can is working o.k.</li>
            <li> When you buy a good product.  I have bought this before from another dealer and it did not perform as well.  I&#x27;m thinking the product from the bad performer was old? This one is just the same as buying it at the store.  Use this dealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years but this last  can  was  terrible. Makes my hair  sticky ! Just doesn&#x27;t work.  I hate  wasting my money .Very  disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great lift and not sticky or oily  Lifts and does not pull down on the hair.  Would recommend to people with thin hair</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be a foam. It does not foam at all. I have been using this for 10 years so I know what is is supposed to do. You asked,</li>
            <li> Great price...fast delivery!</li>
            <li> For those of us with fine thin hair, this is the best at disguising that.  It gives my hair &amp;#34;Umph&amp;#34; and body like nothing else has ever succeeded in doing.</li>
            <li> Does make my hair look somewhat thicker.....</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this, so I purchased it. I&#x27;m a fan now. Similar to foam thickening mousse by living proof, but less expensive!</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY ORDERED THE WRONG SPRAY. THERE ARE SO MANY PRODUCTS LABELED GUTS 10 AND I FOUND IT SOMEWHAT HARD TO READ THE FINE PRINT WHEN ORDERING</li>
            <li> Use it all the time and have recommended it to people with fine, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> The spray was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product..this particular one should be called NO Spray Foam. Have no idea if its a faulty can but a wet spray trickles out of it. Now I find that I can&#x27;t return it since Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back aerosol cans considered hazardous. Perhaps Amazon Prime shouldn&#x27;t sell this product. NOT HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only mousse I&#x27;ve found that poofs up my otherwise fine and flat hair, especially in the summer when it&#x27;s humid. Pull back a section of hair and spray a line of this foam at the roots. It&#x27;s not gooey or unnatural feeling. My hair is still healthy. None of it has fallen out. For those experiencing a watery foam...you have to shake it before use. I highly recommend this for long lasting, touchable, style-able fullness.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on amazon before but I am writing one now, if that tells you anything. This product is awful and does not do what it is designed to do. It does NOT foam. It does not smell good. I have used this product in the past (from the store, not amazon) and it is wonderful, but I am sad to have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Spray nozzle does not work properly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.  Comes with a hairspray nozzle and doesn&#x27;t foam.  Amazon won&#x27;t let you return it.</li>
            <li> this is great for thinning hair  really styles hair nice</li>
            <li> Excellent. Keeps body in style overnight and leaves hair with a smooth and shiny look!</li>
            <li> have used this for years for my curly hair, it is marketed as a &#x27;root lifter&#x27; but does a great job taming frizzes of curly hair without weighing it down. Apply it all over but be careful not to overdue.  You will know you used to much if your hair feel hard, once you find the right amount you will never use anything else.  My curls are soft , loose and look as if i spent hours on it.</li>
            <li> Gives my fine hair extra body. My hair looks fuller as well a  breeze to style</li>
            <li> I love Redkin Guts.  It is just right hold on my hair and does not weigh it down.  I will purchase again for good price.</li>
            <li> I love Redken products and this says it will give your hair guts and it sure does!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but I have a lot of it and this product gives it the volume it needs.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite product for adding volume to my hair without stickiness.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> great pricing for a great product</li>
            <li> Loved this product and the price was SO much cheaper than my salon!!! Try the company and you will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years - this batch did not foam up like it should  - it was very runny and harder to apply.</li>
            <li> The cans were so old that the pressure wasn&#x27;t good so it really didn&#x27;t spray and it smelled like vinegar.  Hoping they are willing to take the products back</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I bought two.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It does not behave!  It squirts out in a liquid instead of foam no matter how much I shake it.  I would return it but I don&#x27;e know where it came from!  This is the old packaging and I suspect that it is ancient.</li>
            <li> The product was old and runny, so when I informed the seller, they were nice enough to reimburse my entire payment!  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Product should come out as a foam.  This product came out as watery substance.  Did not perform as foam does.  Water dripped down my face.</li>
            <li> While I love and have used Redken Guts 10 for many years, the product sent to me was not the quality I expected.  In checking further, I discovered that based on the identification numbers on the bottom of the can, the product that was sent to me appeared to be units from a recall several years ago.  It smelled so awful I could not use it.  I love Amazon, but I will never order this product on line again.  The seller should be forced to stop selling recalled or outdated products.</li>
            <li> Only got one bottle but ordered two.  Love the product, I have used it before.  Usually buy in the salon, probably will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however, the bottles I received were old and the scent was gone. It didn&#x27;t foam properly. I didn&#x27;t save enough on this item to buy it online again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  It&#x27;s clean and not sticky and gets the job done.  I would recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> My stylist suggested this as a substitute for the late, great Redken Curl Boost -- sadly Guts 10 is not at all the same product.  It makes curly hair spikey and tends to make hair dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best mousse for me.  It gives  my baby-fine hair enough body so I can work with it.  It&#x27;s a medium mousse, nothing too strong.</li>
            <li> Good quality, very good product!</li>
            <li> I have done hair that needs a boost with a blow dryer and this is the perfect accompaniment to the dryer and Redken&#x27;s 06 thickener.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, flat hair , this is the product for you. Have used it for years and hope Redkin never&lt;br /&gt;changes the formula.</li>
            <li> I got it because it was cheaper than buying it at my beauty shop.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is not too sticky, but has a great hold.  Plus it really lasts a long time.  The only downside (which is just cosmetic) is the can is so large it doesn&#x27;t fit in the cabinet where I keep all my other hair supplies.  Small price to pay for such an excellent hair product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have ultra thin and fine hair. This product helps amp it up and better with styling. I have used it for years. I love a lot of the redken products.</li>
            <li> This was a bad can. I use this product all the time but this one does not foam up and does not perform.</li>
            <li> I spray it all over my curls and then blow dry my hair upside down.  It adds body all around giving my curls a boost all over.</li>
