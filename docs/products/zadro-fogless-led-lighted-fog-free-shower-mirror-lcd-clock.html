            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s husband shaves while showering, which, of course, is the best way to shave.</li>
            <li>but it is the best in-shower lighted shaving mirror on the market.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it&#x27;s a great mirror that he still uses!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect mirror to use while shaving!</li>
            <li>This really is a great product!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>so the suction cups work great, hasn&#x27;t fallen off yet!</li>
            <li>Very nice!</li>
            <li>I bought this about 6 months ago and it has worked great.</li>
            <li>mirror was great for about 2 days...</li>
            <li>Everything about this mirror is great, except that the suction cups don&#x27;t keep it to the wall.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product..</li>
            <li>the suction cups are very strong!  </li>
            <li>This mirror is a good mirror for the shower.</li>
            <li>Product good.</li>
            <li>That, and the fact that this was a surprisingly well built piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the mirror remains on the shower wall.  </li>
            <li>If you ever get a hold of a good one, let me know.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>The clock is keeping good time.    </li>
            <li>The reason I say this is because I have never seen something fall off the wall so many times and, regardless of the fact that both razor holders broke off, the electronics still worked!</li>
            <li>It looks really nice.  </li>
            <li>and if I can find a way to hang it or mount it, it looks like it will work nicely.</li>
            <li>Awesome product - highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The holder does a nice job of balancing my Mach 3 Turbo.  </li>
            <li>The clock is nice, keeps me on time.</li>
            <li>but I had to add more from my own reserves.    </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have more control on it</li>
            <li>A decent product, with a great, bright light, but it does fog up a bit.</li>
            <li>Clock is a nice touch and easy to operate.    </li>
            <li>Then the fogless capacity of the mirror went, when the casing cracked from one of its many falls.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups look like they would be stable and they are - most of the time.</li>
            <li>You have room for hanging 2 shavers and even putting shaving cream on top of it.  </li>
            <li>my better judgement</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for him.  </li>
            <li>You know those products you order online and find that they are even way better than you expect?  </li>
            <li>It may be ok</li>
            <li>- The light and clock are nice touches.    </li>
            <li>I purchased a Z&#x27;Fogless at Costco about 5 years ago and was very happy with it till I recently sprayed it with CLR tile and tub cleaner, which severely spotted the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Your better off using a shiny piece of metal or a hubcap to shave.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on products like this before I decided to buy this item.</li>
            <li>Plus, you can use more than one method; if you are worried about the suction cups, you can also hang it on the shower head with the cord included as insurance.  </li>
            <li>its ok the suction cups don&#x27;t always stick to tile</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Go with a more name brand product that will give you better results.</li>
            <li>The clock and extremely bright light work really well!</li>
            <li>The light is just OK.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is just mirror like plastic stuck to more cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>after that the mirror fogs after about a minute of running the water in shower, suction cups are not as strong as they could be..</li>
            <li>This product looks nice, and everything looks pretty in the package.</li>
            <li>, It doesnt matter if the holding option works (the tape didnt, the suction buddies, work out fine)....</li>
            <li>The razor holders are fine.</li>
            <li>I am only into my first week using this product, but the mirror and light works great!</li>
            <li>A fogless mirror with a light.  </li>
            <li>All those bonus features, the clock and the light and the hanging razors, add weight to the set-up that cannot be contained by those suction cups.  </li>
            <li>My light doesn&#x27;t turn off anymore</li>
            <li>Bought this as another Father&#x27;s Day gift and the light never turned off.  </li>
            <li>cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap plastic, the stick strips that came with</li>
            <li>* cheap construction of the mirror itself.</li>
            <li>Nothing about it looks cheap.  </li>
            <li>On the con side, I got one where the LED light does not work.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>The light stays on and cannot be shut off until it decides to go off itself.  </li>
            <li>The light on this mirror is a joke, and the razor holders don&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>The item itself is really light and feels kinda cheap, but you can&#x27;t go by the feel.  </li>
            <li>The light does help with getting pesky neck hairs.   </li>
            <li>I also like the timer on the light</li>
            <li>&quot; grout free area, there is no way to use them.  </li>
            <li>the clock stopped working, the light would either not turn off for hours, ro wouldnt come on.</li>
            <li>This is a really cheap piece of plastic don&#x27;t be mislead by the promo pic.  </li>
            <li>mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror distorts my face and the light is from the bottom</li>
            <li>&quot; mirror is cheap plastic, and the \\&quot;fog-proofing\\&quot; wore off quickly, so now it is a cheap, plastic, foggy mirror in my shower.</li>
            <li>The mirror definitely is build to survive the fall many many many times but the razor holder is not.</li>
            <li>The mirror itseelf is great, large and clear.</li>
            <li>I think this company spent more time making the ad look good than they did on the product itself.</li>
            <li>suction cups aren&#x27;t sufficient to keep this up on a clean glass surface.  </li>
            <li>Overall I give this a good rating and would have given it a higher rating if the clock and hanging methods worked better.</li>
            <li>I love the built in clock when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Overall, nice looking, relatively easy to setup.</li>
            <li>I am sure some clever person can find a way to make it stick, using some tools that didn&#x27;t come from the box, but that isn&#x27;t what I am looking for when I buy something in this price range.  </li>
            <li>The light is pretty cool though.</li>
            <li>I used the double sided tape on slate tile (which is not a competely flat surface) and it has held perfectly.</li>
            <li>The light worked for the first month</li>
            <li>This mirror looked pretty sweet in the box.  </li>
            <li>this thing is Worth $5 max.</li>
            <li>No big deal, but it would have been nice.  </li>
            <li>love having a shower mirror, somewhere to hang my razor AND a light (I&#x27;ve only used it when the power&#x27;s out, but this does happen..</li>
            <li>I would rate it a one star, but I&#x27;ll give it two because the mirror itself is one of the better ones on the market as far as distortion.  </li>
            <li>The price was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews state that the razors fall off the holders, well they won&#x27;t fall off on their own, only if you bump them...</li>
            <li>So if like me you like a very very hot shower, you may want to splash some hot water on the surface of the mirror every once in a while to keep the fog off.   </li>
            <li>At first it was great &amp; was fogless, then about 4-6 months later it started coming apart until we finally had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>Mirror\\&quot; works great for about a week, until the suctions cups give out for the first time and the mirror plummets to the hard bathtub floor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first thing to go was the clock.  </li>
            <li>I am almost glad the razor holders broke off when it fell because the razor wasn&#x27;t sturdy and would constantly be falling in the shower.</li>
            <li>Worked great for the first couple weeks, then slowly went downhill from there.  </li>
            <li>First off, it is not fogless.  </li>
            <li>The razor \\&quot;holders\\&quot; are a joke - you have to almost balance them on there, and then if you bump it at all, they&#x27;ll fall - more than likely popping your blade off or breaking it all together (which happened to me).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not water proof, so the clock stopped working after the first shower because water got in it.  </li>
            <li>The prongs that cradle the razor should come out and up more to cradle the entire blade, but this is not the case.   </li>
            <li>The third method is a lovely rope to enable you to hang it from a hook.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a better mirror than others, but that&#x27;s the only positive.    </li>
            <li>The light on it is good but not great.</li>
            <li>So far (a few days), it has been great.    </li>
            <li>I pretty much kept the mirror on the wall for the clock.</li>
            <li>The fogless part stops working and there isn&#x27;t much you can do to make the shiny plastic material work the way it did that first week.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because I did not (nor will I because it&#x27;s going right back) get a chance to try the mirror itself to test if it is really fog free (for an extended period of time).  </li>
            <li>my experience with these two, the light is the first thing to go - usually only lasts a couple months before the moisture gets to it.</li>
            <li>Instead, I get out of the shower, dry off, brush my teeth, and the light is still on!</li>
            <li>my clock didn&#x27;t last long, the lights are good for shaving your neck but nothing else.  </li>
            <li>The razor holders work well even for large razors and</li>
            <li>This mirror simply will not mount to the wall with the available options.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt stick to wall very well as I suspected it might not.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to purchase a product that they have to reattach once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>* clock works no matter how much abuse it takes  cons:  </li>
            <li>It is very lite.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient and has a place to hold the razor, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>(Fortunately I had attached a safety strap for just such a situation.)  </li>
            <li>For those of you wondering - the light automatically goes off after 5 minutes, there&#x27;s only an ON switch</li>
            <li>But beware, it really doesnt matter if the razor holders work or not</li>
            <li>For the future, maybe improve the light.</li>
            <li>There are three suction cups that fit on the back.  </li>
            <li>The three suction cups are high enough quality that they hold the mirror to my glass shower enclosure just fine.    </li>
            <li>Worked good for the first couple or few weeks, but subsequently it requires you to splash water on it to get it and keep it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to prolong its usefulness by cleaning with limeaway or other scale remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the unit will last, but I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I have since seen better ones for less money and bought one of those.</li>
            <li>That was one of the main reasons I bought this mirror was</li>
            <li>- Decent sized mirror.   </li>
            <li>the main issue here is...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, the only reason it gets two stars is because I haven&#x27;t seen any others as useful.</li>
            <li>Mirror is small, light shines in your eyes when on and really doesn&#x27;t light up mirror and the razor holders only hold disposable size razor.</li>
            <li>Pricey, and the light is not useful to me (I have a well lit bathroom), but nothing matches the convenience of a fogless mirror to shave by, and this one is large enough to actually use as compared to the cheap ones in Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>My husband will not put new batteries in it because he knows they will just burn out.  </li>
            <li>I was going to get new batteries</li>
            <li>The suction cups are laid out on the back of the mirror in a triangular pattern, one center top and two on bottom.</li>
            <li>NOT fogless, only took 2 showers for it to start fogging, now I keep a washcloth nearby to wipe it off if I&#x27;m using it, and even that doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li>The light works, but it&#x27;s almost blinding and not useful.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely no fogging to this point even on cool mornings when I could not see anything with my old shower mirror.     </li>
            <li>If you like to waste money I would strongly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>On top of that, electronic devices don&#x27;t like being dropped from a height onto a hard surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, the \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; This mirror does fog, in very very high steam conditions.</li>
            <li>its NOT fogless, after 45 days mine completely got fogged.</li>
            <li>The mirror has performed flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li>If you have, what is probably one of the most common types of shower, ceramic tile.  </li>
            <li>The whole thing seem like it&#x27;s going to fall apart any second.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups stopped working after a while and the anti-fog feature wore out as well, so although we loved this mirror in the beginning, in about 2 months time it bacame useless -</li>
            <li>The light has two small LEDs, but they are just bright enough to illuminate under my neck which is the part that is normally hard to see using overhead lighting only.</li>
            <li>So lastly I tried the double-sided tape, which looked like a solid solution at first.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, the light was the last thing to got, leaving me with a basic mirror just like any other mirror that fogged up in the shower, and eventually the whole thing just went in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new one is similar.  </li>
            <li>Overall, stay clear of this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the suction cups will harden &amp; the mirror will barely stick to the wall..crashing to the ground over &amp; over.</li>
            <li>The razor holder barely holds my razor, but is serviceable.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy - my old one once came off the wall and broke the grouted ceramic soap tray built into my shower in half, but the mirror suffered nary a scratch.</li>
            <li>The razor barely hangs on, the light is ridiculously blinding and stays on for 5 min.</li>
            <li>The mirror is not a real mirror, it is a highly polished metal alloy</li>
            <li>Not to mention how embarrassing it is when guests are over and there is a loud boom in the bathroom (which is 5X as loud as any other room because bathrooms echo).   </li>
            <li>At $44.99 I was really hesitant, it&#x27;s just a mirror; but I broke down and bought it.   </li>
            <li>* suction cups are cheap and don&#x27;t work for long  * who wants to pay $30 for what essentially turns into an expensive bathroom clock?</li>
            <li>There are my more on the market to choose from that might not be fogless, but at least they&#x27;re a smaller profile and less protruding.  </li>
            <li>This particular model is not worth the money.</li>

            <li> , It doesnt matter if the holding option works (the tape didnt, the suction buddies, work out fine)....</li>
            <li> The razor holders are fine.</li>
            <li> I am only into my first week using this product, but the mirror and light works great!</li>
            <li> A fogless mirror with a light.  </li>
            <li> All those bonus features, the clock and the light and the hanging razors, add weight to the set-up that cannot be contained by those suction cups.  </li>
            <li> My light doesn&#x27;t turn off anymore</li>
            <li> Bought this as another Father&#x27;s Day gift and the light never turned off.  </li>
            <li> cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap plastic, the stick strips that came with</li>
            <li> * cheap construction of the mirror itself.</li>
            <li> Nothing about it looks cheap.  </li>
            <li> On the con side, I got one where the LED light does not work.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> The light stays on and cannot be shut off until it decides to go off itself.  </li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is a joke, and the razor holders don&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> The item itself is really light and feels kinda cheap, but you can&#x27;t go by the feel.  </li>
            <li> The light does help with getting pesky neck hairs.   </li>
            <li> I also like the timer on the light</li>
            <li> &quot; grout free area, there is no way to use them.  </li>
            <li> the clock stopped working, the light would either not turn off for hours, ro wouldnt come on.</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap piece of plastic don&#x27;t be mislead by the promo pic.  </li>
            <li> mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror distorts my face and the light is from the bottom</li>
            <li> &quot; mirror is cheap plastic, and the \\&quot;fog-proofing\\&quot; wore off quickly, so now it is a cheap, plastic, foggy mirror in my shower.</li>
            <li> The mirror definitely is build to survive the fall many many many times but the razor holder is not.</li>
            <li> The mirror itseelf is great, large and clear.</li>
            <li> I think this company spent more time making the ad look good than they did on the product itself.</li>
            <li> suction cups aren&#x27;t sufficient to keep this up on a clean glass surface.  </li>
            <li> Overall I give this a good rating and would have given it a higher rating if the clock and hanging methods worked better.</li>
            <li> I love the built in clock when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Overall, nice looking, relatively easy to setup.</li>
            <li> I am sure some clever person can find a way to make it stick, using some tools that didn&#x27;t come from the box, but that isn&#x27;t what I am looking for when I buy something in this price range.  </li>
            <li> The light is pretty cool though.</li>
            <li> I used the double sided tape on slate tile (which is not a competely flat surface) and it has held perfectly.</li>
            <li> The light worked for the first month</li>
            <li> This mirror looked pretty sweet in the box.  </li>
            <li> this thing is Worth $5 max.</li>
            <li> No big deal, but it would have been nice.  </li>
            <li> love having a shower mirror, somewhere to hang my razor AND a light (I&#x27;ve only used it when the power&#x27;s out, but this does happen..</li>
            <li> I would rate it a one star, but I&#x27;ll give it two because the mirror itself is one of the better ones on the market as far as distortion.  </li>
            <li> The price was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews state that the razors fall off the holders, well they won&#x27;t fall off on their own, only if you bump them...</li>
            <li> So if like me you like a very very hot shower, you may want to splash some hot water on the surface of the mirror every once in a while to keep the fog off.   </li>
            <li> At first it was great &amp; was fogless, then about 4-6 months later it started coming apart until we finally had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Mirror\\&quot; works great for about a week, until the suctions cups give out for the first time and the mirror plummets to the hard bathtub floor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first thing to go was the clock.  </li>
            <li> I am almost glad the razor holders broke off when it fell because the razor wasn&#x27;t sturdy and would constantly be falling in the shower.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the first couple weeks, then slowly went downhill from there.  </li>
            <li> First off, it is not fogless.  </li>
            <li> The razor \\&quot;holders\\&quot; are a joke - you have to almost balance them on there, and then if you bump it at all, they&#x27;ll fall - more than likely popping your blade off or breaking it all together (which happened to me).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not water proof, so the clock stopped working after the first shower because water got in it.  </li>
            <li> The prongs that cradle the razor should come out and up more to cradle the entire blade, but this is not the case.   </li>
            <li> The third method is a lovely rope to enable you to hang it from a hook.  </li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a better mirror than others, but that&#x27;s the only positive.    </li>
            <li> The light on it is good but not great.</li>
            <li> So far (a few days), it has been great.    </li>
            <li> I pretty much kept the mirror on the wall for the clock.</li>
            <li> The fogless part stops working and there isn&#x27;t much you can do to make the shiny plastic material work the way it did that first week.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because I did not (nor will I because it&#x27;s going right back) get a chance to try the mirror itself to test if it is really fog free (for an extended period of time).  </li>
            <li> my experience with these two, the light is the first thing to go - usually only lasts a couple months before the moisture gets to it.</li>
            <li> Instead, I get out of the shower, dry off, brush my teeth, and the light is still on!</li>
            <li> my clock didn&#x27;t last long, the lights are good for shaving your neck but nothing else.  </li>
            <li> The razor holders work well even for large razors and</li>
            <li> This mirror simply will not mount to the wall with the available options.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt stick to wall very well as I suspected it might not.</li>
            <li> Nobody wants to purchase a product that they have to reattach once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> * clock works no matter how much abuse it takes  cons:  </li>
            <li> It is very lite.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient and has a place to hold the razor, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> (Fortunately I had attached a safety strap for just such a situation.)  </li>
            <li> For those of you wondering - the light automatically goes off after 5 minutes, there&#x27;s only an ON switch</li>
            <li> But beware, it really doesnt matter if the razor holders work or not</li>
            <li> For the future, maybe improve the light.</li>
            <li> There are three suction cups that fit on the back.  </li>
            <li> The three suction cups are high enough quality that they hold the mirror to my glass shower enclosure just fine.    </li>
            <li> Worked good for the first couple or few weeks, but subsequently it requires you to splash water on it to get it and keep it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to prolong its usefulness by cleaning with limeaway or other scale remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the unit will last, but I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have since seen better ones for less money and bought one of those.</li>
            <li> That was one of the main reasons I bought this mirror was</li>
            <li> - Decent sized mirror.   </li>
            <li> the main issue here is...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, the only reason it gets two stars is because I haven&#x27;t seen any others as useful.</li>
            <li> Mirror is small, light shines in your eyes when on and really doesn&#x27;t light up mirror and the razor holders only hold disposable size razor.</li>
            <li> Pricey, and the light is not useful to me (I have a well lit bathroom), but nothing matches the convenience of a fogless mirror to shave by, and this one is large enough to actually use as compared to the cheap ones in Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> My husband will not put new batteries in it because he knows they will just burn out.  </li>
            <li> I was going to get new batteries</li>
            <li> The suction cups are laid out on the back of the mirror in a triangular pattern, one center top and two on bottom.</li>
            <li> NOT fogless, only took 2 showers for it to start fogging, now I keep a washcloth nearby to wipe it off if I&#x27;m using it, and even that doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li> The light works, but it&#x27;s almost blinding and not useful.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no fogging to this point even on cool mornings when I could not see anything with my old shower mirror.     </li>
            <li> If you like to waste money I would strongly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> On top of that, electronic devices don&#x27;t like being dropped from a height onto a hard surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, the \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; This mirror does fog, in very very high steam conditions.</li>
            <li> its NOT fogless, after 45 days mine completely got fogged.</li>
            <li> The mirror has performed flawlessly so far.</li>
            <li> If you have, what is probably one of the most common types of shower, ceramic tile.  </li>
            <li> The whole thing seem like it&#x27;s going to fall apart any second.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups stopped working after a while and the anti-fog feature wore out as well, so although we loved this mirror in the beginning, in about 2 months time it bacame useless -</li>
            <li> The light has two small LEDs, but they are just bright enough to illuminate under my neck which is the part that is normally hard to see using overhead lighting only.</li>
            <li> So lastly I tried the double-sided tape, which looked like a solid solution at first.</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, the light was the last thing to got, leaving me with a basic mirror just like any other mirror that fogged up in the shower, and eventually the whole thing just went in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new one is similar.  </li>
            <li> Overall, stay clear of this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the suction cups will harden &amp; the mirror will barely stick to the wall..crashing to the ground over &amp; over.</li>
            <li> The razor holder barely holds my razor, but is serviceable.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy - my old one once came off the wall and broke the grouted ceramic soap tray built into my shower in half, but the mirror suffered nary a scratch.</li>
            <li> The razor barely hangs on, the light is ridiculously blinding and stays on for 5 min.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not a real mirror, it is a highly polished metal alloy</li>
            <li> Not to mention how embarrassing it is when guests are over and there is a loud boom in the bathroom (which is 5X as loud as any other room because bathrooms echo).   </li>
            <li> At $44.99 I was really hesitant, it&#x27;s just a mirror; but I broke down and bought it.   </li>
            <li> * suction cups are cheap and don&#x27;t work for long  * who wants to pay $30 for what essentially turns into an expensive bathroom clock?</li>
            <li> There are my more on the market to choose from that might not be fogless, but at least they&#x27;re a smaller profile and less protruding.  </li>
            <li> This particular model is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does fog a little but not much and it wipes down easily.  </li>
            <li> (by the way, the are pretty bad for my gillete fussion), it doesnt matter if the light works well</li>
            <li> it was only fogless for a few days but then found out if you buy the special spray solution at $4.99 a small bottle it will not fog that session.  </li>
            <li> It is a strange shade of white...</li>
            <li> and then my husband pointed out the batteries were way too expensive for the amount of light given off and how long they last!</li>
            <li> Also, the light stays on way too long, draining the expensive batteries.</li>
            <li> light is useless...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually not nearly as the picture  </li>
            <li> I have struggled to find a mirror that stays fogless for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I usually never have problems when I order from Amazon, but my past 2 orders haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> After browsing similar products for a few days, I decided on this product, without any prior experiences or expectations.    </li>
            <li> Also, the mirror itself is not very clear, certainly not as clear as other Zadro mirrors I have owned.  </li>
            <li> so basically that means no more light since it sucks down the batteries.  </li>
            <li> The second method is double stick tape, except the protrusions that would hold the suction cups stick out past the thickness of the tape.  </li>
            <li> Give it a few days and you&#x27;ll have to constantly be spraying water on it to see.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy for the support provided, especially if you hang razors on it.  </li>
            <li> this is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The product did not hold in the wall, felt down and broke in pieces, I put it together and last a few days.</li>
            <li> I do not have any problems with small razors hanging on the built-in hangers but larger multiblade shavers seem to have issues.</li>
            <li> Lastly the clips to hold the razor is so small that the razor keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> Recently moved and through that sucker in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> (it doesnt , it lit straight to your eyes and blind you)</li>
            <li> This is simple, I could not rate it with negative stars, because I couldnt.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost like shaving in the dark.</li>
            <li> , the anti-fogging coating breaks down</li>
            <li> It also looks pretty bad after a few months even with constant cleaning with soap.  </li>
            <li> In a small, confines space such as my shower, it is hard to avoid doing so, so I don&#x27;t even use them anymore.</li>
            <li> it were dried up</li>
            <li> Lastly, even though it&#x27;s plastic, it still found ways to leave a funky mold substance around the edge and behind it; even with chemical cleaners you couldn&#x27;t get it off.    </li>
            <li> This shaving mirror is not perfect by far</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> razor holder almost entirely useless, barely holds any razor  4.</li>
            <li> The razor CAN balance on them, but the slightest bump would knock it off - not a lovely shower scenario.</li>
            <li> It would fog up instantly, had hard water stains on it that made it difficult to see to shave.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups on the back got worse and worse, going from holding for about a week to holding for a couple of hours, to not holding at all.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay fogless.</li>
            <li> - The razor holders (at least for my Mach3) are quite insufficient.</li>
            <li> But dont be fooled, this mirror sucks.    </li>
            <li> Sorry, already been in existence since about the 1980s on 60 million other things.</li>
            <li> mounting.... cannot use lanyard, suction cups are useless due to position, I expect the tape to give out any day.</li>
            <li> And it acummulates a lot of water stains, that of course when you try to clean it, makes things worst by scartching the mirror</li>
            <li> Generally they go bad after a 5-6 months.  </li>
            <li> VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A SIMPLE MIRROR.</li>
            <li> The little shelves for the razors are worthless, they simply balance on it, and the slightest brush against them causes the razors to fall off.</li>
            <li> Rather serious defect.</li>
            <li> The little holders for the razor are useless.    </li>
            <li> That did me no good.  </li>
            <li> The suction cups failed to suction after a few months.</li>
            <li> On a serious note, this fell off the wall at least once a week!</li>
            <li> We have tiled walls that are approximately 3\\&quot;x3\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The razors dangle like Democles sword, waiting for you to make that one wrong move.   </li>
            <li> Nothing says \\&quot;I wipe me @$$ with dollar bills\\&quot; like this (relatively) expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Suction cups were useless, tape worked well</li>
            <li> Unfortunately nobody else makes one like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to break.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for the quality of product.</li>
            <li> It is also not fogless at all, unless however you want to take a cold shower.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that it is in no way \\&quot;fogless.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am always shocked when products with fundamental engineering flaws make it out to market.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed within an hour.  </li>
            <li> - I am an idiot for doing so.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed again.  </li>

            <li> This thing is a piece of junk!  Bought it for my husband for Christmas.  Was disappointed within an hour.  Couldn&#x27;t get the clock to work.  The next morning when my husband tried to put it up we couldn&#x27;t get the suction cups to hold it up - used the double sided tape.  And now only 21 days later it is no longer fogless.  I can&#x27;t believe I paid $45 for this - I am an idiot for doing so.  I am trying to figure out if I can return it.  Don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
            <li> This mirror looked pretty sweet in the box.  A fogless mirror with a light.  A clock to keep me on time for work in the morning.  A place to hang my razors.  Well, as we all know, looks can be deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Zadro Z&#x27;Fogless Lighted Shaving Mirror\\&quot; works great for about a week, until the suctions cups give out for the first time and the mirror plummets to the hard bathtub floor.  All those bonus features, the clock and the light and the hanging razors, add weight to the set-up that cannot be contained by those suction cups.  On top of that, electronic devices don&#x27;t like being dropped from a height onto a hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to go was the clock.  Then the fogless capacity of the mirror went, when the casing cracked from one of its many falls.  The suction cups on the back got worse and worse, going from holding for about a week to holding for a couple of hours, to not holding at all.  Strangely enough, the light was the last thing to got, leaving me with a basic mirror just like any other mirror that fogged up in the shower, and eventually the whole thing just went in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always shocked when products with fundamental engineering flaws make it out to market.  This mirror simply will not mount to the wall with the available options.  I am sure some clever person can find a way to make it stick, using some tools that didn&#x27;t come from the box, but that isn&#x27;t what I am looking for when I buy something in this price range.  I expect to get a fully usable product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas last year. We don&#x27;t have it anymore because it fell apart. At first it was great &amp; was fogless, then about 4-6 months later it started coming apart until we finally had to throw it away. It didn&#x27;t hold the store bought razors we use either, they kept falling off.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 6 months ago and it has worked great. I used the double sided tape on slate tile (which is not a competely flat surface) and it has held perfectly. The one complaint I have is the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay fogless. I am currently looking for a replacement mirror because it fogs up and has water spots (even after cleaning with a water repelent). I&#x27;ve had no problem with it holding my Mach 3!!!</li>
            <li> This mirror was a gift for my son-in-law.  He says it works quite well.  Would have rated it 5-stars if the LED lights were just a bit brighter.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a good mirror for the shower. The electonic clock on the mirror did not work from day one. The light on it is good but not great. The mirror itseelf is great, large and clear. It however does not stick to the shower wall well. I do not have any problems with small razors hanging on the built-in hangers but larger multiblade shavers seem to have issues. Overall I give this a good rating and would have given it a higher rating if the clock and hanging methods worked better.</li>
            <li> Worked good for the first couple or few weeks, but subsequently it requires you to splash water on it to get it and keep it \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; every 30 seconds or so.  My light doesn&#x27;t turn off anymore so basically that means no more light since it sucks down the batteries.  It also looks pretty bad after a few months even with constant cleaning with soap.  Gotta look elsewhere for something that works.</li>
            <li> Product good. Doesnt stick to wall very well as I suspected it might not. But arrived in time and competitive pricing! Very nice!</li>
            <li> Bought this as another Father&#x27;s Day gift and the light never turned off.  It burned for a whole weekend and then the battery was dead.  My husband will not put new batteries in it because he knows they will just burn out.  Very disappointed again.  I usually never have problems when I order from Amazon, but my past 2 orders haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my husband about 6 months ago. It hasn&#x27;t been working out for the last 4 of those months. The suction cups look like they would be stable and they are - most of the time. The mirror definitely is build to survive the fall many many many times but the razor holder is not. I am almost glad the razor holders broke off when it fell because the razor wasn&#x27;t sturdy and would constantly be falling in the shower. The light worked for the first month I was going to get new batteries and then my husband pointed out the batteries were way too expensive for the amount of light given off and how long they last! This mirror is equivalent to the $10 plastic ones - it may look nicer, but that only lasts a month!</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money!!!! this thing is Worth $5 max. cheap and flimsy. the plasic mirror is distorted.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap plastic, the stick strips that came with it were dried up and I couldn&#x27;t hang it.  It is also not fogless at all, unless however you want to take a cold shower.  It fogs immediately after turning on the shower.  Lastly the clips to hold the razor is so small that the razor keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> I used this mirror for years.. But, it wasn&#x27;t the actual mirror that I was using; it was the clock. The novelty of the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; part took maybe a week to wear off and be finished. I pretty much kept the mirror on the wall for the clock. The clock and extremely bright light work really well! That, and the fact that this was a surprisingly well built piece of equipment. The reason I say this is because I have never seen something fall off the wall so many times and, regardless of the fact that both razor holders broke off, the electronics still worked! On a serious note, this fell off the wall at least once a week! Nobody wants to purchase a product that they have to reattach once or twice a week. Not to mention how embarrassing it is when guests are over and there is a loud boom in the bathroom (which is 5X as loud as any other room because bathrooms echo).   Basically here are the pros and cons:  Pros:  * clock works no matter how much abuse it takes  cons:  * suction cups are cheap and don&#x27;t work for long  * who wants to pay $30 for what essentially turns into an expensive bathroom clock? You can get one with a radio for $5 that won&#x27;t fall all the time!  * cheap construction of the mirror itself. The fogless part stops working and there isn&#x27;t much you can do to make the shiny plastic material work the way it did that first week.  * the razor holders are BARELY big enough to hold one. The razors dangle like Democles sword, waiting for you to make that one wrong move.   * it&#x27;s actually not nearly as the picture  So, in conclusion. If you like to waste money I would strongly suggest this product. Nothing says \\&quot;I wipe me @$$ with dollar bills\\&quot; like this (relatively) expensive piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I have struggled to find a mirror that stays fogless for a long time.  Generally they go bad after a 5-6 months.  We will see with this one.  I purchased it in hopes it would.  So far (a few days), it has been great.    It looks really nice.  Nothing about it looks cheap.  It is very lite.  You have room for hanging 2 shavers and even putting shaving cream on top of it.  Clock is a nice touch and easy to operate.    On the con side, I got one where the LED light does not work.  No big deal, but it would have been nice.  It uses three batteries to operate.  You have a choice of setting it up with tape and/or suction cups.  Suction cups were useless, tape worked well but I had to add more from my own reserves.    Overall, nice looking, relatively easy to setup.</li>
            <li> A decent product, with a great, bright light, but it does fog up a bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately nobody else makes one like this.&lt;br /&gt;I love having a shower mirror, somewhere to hang my razor AND a light (I&#x27;ve only used it when the power&#x27;s out, but this does happen..)&lt;br /&gt;Against my better judgement, I purchased a second one of these after looking all over for a different replacement and the second one broke too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience with these two, the light is the first thing to go - usually only lasts a couple months before the moisture gets to it. No surprise there.&lt;br /&gt;Next, the anti-fogging coating breaks down, the mirror fogs up &amp; water spots develop on the mirror.  I&#x27;ve been able to prolong its usefulness by cleaning with limeaway or other scale remover.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the suction cups will harden &amp; the mirror will barely stick to the wall..crashing to the ground over &amp; over. This doesn&#x27;t help matters, as eventually parts will start breaking off..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the only reason it gets two stars is because I haven&#x27;t seen any others as useful. If you know of one, please leave a comment.</li>
            <li> I had this mirror for about 2 years.  Worked great for the first couple weeks, then slowly went downhill from there.  It would fog up instantly, had hard water stains on it that made it difficult to see to shave.  I still used it for the 2 years but I had to splash water on it several times while shaving to see what I was doing.  Recently moved and through that sucker in the garbage.  Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and it does not work as advertised.  I would rate it a one star, but I&#x27;ll give it two because the mirror itself is one of the better ones on the market as far as distortion.  It is a better mirror than others, but that&#x27;s the only positive.    First off, it is not fogless.  Give it a few days and you&#x27;ll have to constantly be spraying water on it to see.  The razor \\&quot;holders\\&quot; are a joke - you have to almost balance them on there, and then if you bump it at all, they&#x27;ll fall - more than likely popping your blade off or breaking it all together (which happened to me).  The light works, but it&#x27;s almost blinding and not useful.  It&#x27;s not water proof, so the clock stopped working after the first shower because water got in it.  That was one of the main reasons I bought this mirror was so I could always see what time it was.  That did me no good.  Lastly, even though it&#x27;s plastic, it still found ways to leave a funky mold substance around the edge and behind it; even with chemical cleaners you couldn&#x27;t get it off.    Overall, stay clear of this product.  There are my more on the market to choose from that might not be fogless, but at least they&#x27;re a smaller profile and less protruding.  Yes, it&#x27;s big too.    I&#x27;m giving the ToiletTree mirror a shot - you might do that too.</li>
            <li> My husband always shaves in the shower with a mirror and all of his mirrors fall off after a couple of years.  This one won&#x27;t do that.  He loves it and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for him.  The price was worth it.  It is very convenient and has a place to hold the razor, which is a plus.  I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s husband shaves while showering, which, of course, is the best way to shave.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shaving mirror remained so for only 30 days.  It now fogs even before I step in the shower.  An even larger problem is that the tiny amount of double-stick tape provided with the mirror became detached from the mirror&#x27;s mounting bracket within three days.  (Fortunately I had attached a safety strap for just such a situation.)  I sanded the back of the mounting plate, covered it totally with 3M double-sided tape and remounted the mirror.  The good news is that the mirror remains on the shower wall.  The bad news is that it is in no way \\&quot;fogless.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This shaving mirror is not perfect by far but it is the best in-shower lighted shaving mirror on the market.</li>
            <li> You know those products you order online and find that they are even way better than you expect?  This is not one of those.  It is the opposite.  Cheap plastic.  The light stays on and cannot be shut off until it decides to go off itself.  I just got this as a gift and some of the lines on the digital clock display don&#x27;t work.  I gave it two stars because I did not (nor will I because it&#x27;s going right back) get a chance to try the mirror itself to test if it is really fog free (for an extended period of time).  It may be ok so I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Companies should not be allowed to get away with selling products of this low quality for this price.  The product says &#x27;patents pending&#x27; on the back.  The only pleasure I got from this product is laughing at that one...what patents?  Are you trying to get a patent on cheapo plastic junk?  Sorry, already been in existence since about the 1980s on 60 million other things.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror 2 years ago as a Christmas gift for my husband.  All I can say is that it&#x27;s a great mirror that he still uses!  It&#x27;s the perfect mirror to use while shaving!</li>
            <li> After browsing similar products for a few days, I decided on this product, without any prior experiences or expectations.    Let&#x27;s start with the pros:   - Decent sized mirror.   - 3 mounting options.   - The light and clock are nice touches.    And now for the cons:   - The razor holders (at least for my Mach3) are quite insufficient. The razor CAN balance on them, but the slightest bump would knock it off - not a lovely shower scenario. The prongs that cradle the razor should come out and up more to cradle the entire blade, but this is not the case.   - None of the 3 included mounting options work for me (hanging lanyard, suction cups, double-sided tape). The lanyard was out because of our shower head position. We have tiled walls that are approximately 3\\&quot;x3\\&quot;. The suction cups are laid out on the back of the mirror in a triangular pattern, one center top and two on bottom. I had no way to position them where one of the three was not over the grout, which would subsequently cause the suction cups not to work. So lastly I tried the double-sided tape, which looked like a solid solution at first. Not 24 hours later, the mirror had fallen off the wall.    Which leads me to my last pro:   - It survived the fall and if I can find a way to hang it or mount it, it looks like it will work nicely.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Z&#x27;Fogless at Costco about 5 years ago and was very happy with it till I recently sprayed it with CLR tile and tub cleaner, which severely spotted the mirror.  This new one is similar.  Pricey, and the light is not useful to me (I have a well lit bathroom), but nothing matches the convenience of a fogless mirror to shave by, and this one is large enough to actually use as compared to the cheap ones in Walgreens.  The razor holder barely holds my razor, but is serviceable.  Very sturdy - my old one once came off the wall and broke the grouted ceramic soap tray built into my shower in half, but the mirror suffered nary a scratch.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fog-Free\\&quot; mirror is cheap plastic, and the \\&quot;fog-proofing\\&quot; wore off quickly, so now it is a cheap, plastic, foggy mirror in my shower. Also, the light stays on way too long, draining the expensive batteries. It would have been nice to have more control on it so I could turn it off when I am done. Instead, I get out of the shower, dry off, brush my teeth, and the light is still on! The little shelves for the razors are worthless, they simply balance on it, and the slightest brush against them causes the razors to fall off. They need to be stronger, where you can \\&quot;clip\\&quot; the razors to the thing so they don&#x27;t simply fall off. In a small, confines space such as my shower, it is hard to avoid doing so, so I don&#x27;t even use them anymore. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk! It doesn&#x27;t do anything it&#x27;s supposed to do. I think this company spent more time making the ad look good than they did on the product itself. Your better off using a shiny piece of metal or a hubcap to shave.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product!  My wife got me this for Christmas and I have used it multiple times and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It does fog a little but not much and it wipes down easily.  For those of you wondering - the light automatically goes off after 5 minutes, there&#x27;s only an ON switch and then it&#x27;s on for 5 minutes.  I love the built in clock when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.  The razor holders work well even for large razors and the suction cups are very strong!  Awesome product - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> mirror was great for about 2 days... after that the mirror fogs after about a minute of running the water in shower, suction cups are not as strong as they could be.. i recommend using 3M double sided tape</li>
            <li> Everything about this mirror is great, except that the suction cups don&#x27;t keep it to the wall.  It&#x27;s too heavy for the support provided, especially if you hang razors on it.  The light is pretty cool though.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is a joke, and the razor holders don&#x27;t do the job.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This product looks nice, and everything looks pretty in the package. But beware, it really doesnt matter if the razor holders work or not (by the way, the are pretty bad for my gillete fussion), it doesnt matter if the light works well (it doesnt , it lit straight to your eyes and blind you), It doesnt matter if the holding option works (the tape didnt, the suction buddies, work out fine).... the main issue here is... its NOT fogless, after 45 days mine completely got fogged. So what is the piont. And it acummulates a lot of water stains, that of course when you try to clean it, makes things worst by scartching the mirror (that actually isnt a mirror) surface.    This is simple, I could not rate it with negative stars, because I couldnt. But dont be fooled, this mirror sucks.    If you ever get a hold of a good one, let me know.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on products like this before I decided to buy this item. At $44.99 I was really hesitant, it&#x27;s just a mirror; but I broke down and bought it.   The item itself is really light and feels kinda cheap, but you can&#x27;t go by the feel.  The mirror is not a real mirror, it is a highly polished metal alloy so it is difficult to break.  The razor holders are fine. Some reviews state that the razors fall off the holders, well they won&#x27;t fall off on their own, only if you bump them... this is to be expected. The holder does a nice job of balancing my Mach 3 Turbo.  The light is just OK. It is a strange shade of white... Almost blue-ish but what can you expect from LEDs? The light does help with getting pesky neck hairs.   The clock is nice, keeps me on time. Finally, the \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; This mirror does fog, in very very high steam conditions. So if like me you like a very very hot shower, you may want to splash some hot water on the surface of the mirror every once in a while to keep the fog off.   There are 3 ways to attach this and we have 12x12 tile so the suction cups work great, hasn&#x27;t fallen off yet! Plus, you can use more than one method; if you are worried about the suction cups, you can also hang it on the shower head with the cord included as insurance.  All in all, this is a good product. For the future, maybe improve the light.</li>
            <li> i have to vote with the cons. my clock didn&#x27;t last long, the lights are good for shaving your neck but nothing else.  it was only fogless for a few days but then found out if you buy the special spray solution at $4.99 a small bottle it will not fog that session.  my water temp is 98 degrees so the amount of steam doesn&#x27;t make a big difference.  i would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I am only into my first week using this product, but the mirror and light works great! The light has two small LEDs, but they are just bright enough to illuminate under my neck which is the part that is normally hard to see using overhead lighting only. I also like the timer on the light so I can turn it on and forget about it.    The three suction cups are high enough quality that they hold the mirror to my glass shower enclosure just fine.    The clock is keeping good time.    The mirror has performed flawlessly so far. Absolutely no fogging to this point even on cool mornings when I could not see anything with my old shower mirror.     I don&#x27;t know how long the unit will last, but I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> These guys are/were the kings of fogless mirrors, but the design of this one is a big faux pas.  If you have, what is probably one of the most common types of shower, ceramic tile.  There is no way to mount this mirror.  Supposedly, it comes with three mounting choices.  There are three suction cups that fit on the back.  Unless you have a 12\\&quot; x 12\\&quot; grout free area, there is no way to use them.  The second method is double stick tape, except the protrusions that would hold the suction cups stick out past the thickness of the tape.  So the tape doesn&#x27;t make contact.  The third method is a lovely rope to enable you to hang it from a hook.  The only problem is that there is no way to attach the rope to the mirror.  Also, the mirror itself is not very clear, certainly not as clear as other Zadro mirrors I have owned.  They say that there is a protective film on the mirror, but for the life of me, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would peel off...and I&#x27;m not a guy who doesn&#x27;t know how to do things.</li>
            <li> The suction cups stopped working after a while and the anti-fog feature wore out as well, so although we loved this mirror in the beginning, in about 2 months time it bacame useless - the clock stopped working, the light would either not turn off for hours, ro wouldnt come on. The little holders for the razor are useless.    We have purchased this one in 2008, maybe Zadro came out with an improved solution since then?!? This particular model is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was, in my opinion not what it was portrayed to be. Mirror is small, light shines in your eyes when on and really doesn&#x27;t light up mirror and the razor holders only hold disposable size razor. I have since seen better ones for less money and bought one of those.</li>
            <li> its ok the suction cups don&#x27;t always stick to tile</li>
            <li> 1. no longer fogless after 2 weeks  2. clock no longer works after 2 weeks  3. razor holder almost entirely useless, barely holds any razor  4. light is useless... unless maybe you are wanting to shave your chest.  5. mounting.... cannot use lanyard, suction cups are useless due to position, I expect the tape to give out any day.</li>
            <li> I love it It does not fog up.  It has on board lighting.It has time and date.  This helps when your brain is fogy.  It is a great product..</li>
            <li> The mirror has been problematic staying attached. I may return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap piece of plastic don&#x27;t be mislead by the promo pic.  The razor barely hangs on, the light is ridiculously blinding and stays on for 5 min. The mirror itself is just mirror like plastic stuck to more cheap plastic.  The whole thing seem like it&#x27;s going to fall apart any second.  It does have 3 mounting options but i&#x27;d only trust the suction cups.  It&#x27;s too expensive for the quality of product. Go with a more name brand product that will give you better results.</li>
            <li> I have a steam/shower bath. The product did not hold in the wall, felt down and broke in pieces, I put it together and last a few days. Finally I took the mirror piece and stick it to the wall every time I want to use it. VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A SIMPLE MIRROR. NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> NOT fogless, only took 2 showers for it to start fogging, now I keep a washcloth nearby to wipe it off if I&#x27;m using it, and even that doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li> The mirror was not fogless after a couple weeks of use.  The suction cups failed to suction after a few months.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money any buy the Zadro LED surround lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror distorts my face and the light is from the bottom so it&#x27;s almost like shaving in the dark.</li>
            <li> The suction cups do work, mirror falls off the wall when shower is not used, out of town, need someone to tell me how to make it work</li>
            <li> Unit came with no mirror. Rather serious defect.</li>
            <li> 5 days of use - foggy mirror.  suction cups aren&#x27;t sufficient to keep this up on a clean glass surface.  razor holder is a joke.</li>
            <li> Wou not stick to the wall I returned</li>
    </ol>
