            <li>but it lays nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Warm refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Allthough it is very light and sporty, it shows presence and people will always ask you what you are wearing.</li>
            <li>I spray in the air and walk through because I think it&#x27;s kind of strong.</li>

            <li>It is definitley a favorite scent</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love the light scent....</li>
            <li>It is light, refreshing, longlasting and doesn&#x27;t bother smell-sensitive people.</li>
            <li>Since this is no longer available in stores, I love tjat</li>
            <li>Definitely a bright lively smell that I love to flaunt during the spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Smelled strong initally from the bottle</li>
            <li>when it was no longer available in the stores i turned to the internet to purchase.</li>
            <li>Lovely Perfume, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It seems be an anytime fragrance that is floral and light.  </li>
            <li>I love how it stays on all day and leaves you  smelling sweet and fresh</li>
            <li>I love this scent, it has been very hard to find in a department store, the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>It is great for winter, summer, spring and fall, elegant outings and everyday working.</li>
            <li>and with such good price.</li>
            <li>I like sweet fragrances</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this fresh perfume--as with most perfumes, only a dab will do!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When Isaw the price and the fast delivery available there was no doubt about ordering.</li>
            <li>Scent is fresh, long-lasting and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Met my expectation, perfumes best kept secret.</li>
            <li>It strangely doesn&#x27;t even smell girly, rather manly in my own view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great and you only need a couple of sprays to last all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing scent and the constant compliments and comments I receive.</li>
            <li>I bought this without smelling it first because my sister said it smells like Aveda products.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled it, a man was wearing it.</li>
            <li>This was my only time ordering this one off of Amazon .I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>such a clean, like fresh soapy, just got out of shower but yet feminine scent....</li>
            <li>But this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Vera and amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This scent is one of those that lasts the whole day through.  </li>
            <li>I originally received this as a gift and use that to the last drop.</li>
            <li>This parfume is a very nice soft scent, if you have bad allergies like I do its not too strong.</li>
            <li>I showed him my new perfume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for new fragrances and decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>It is not over powering at all but has a very seductive, floral, lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Completely underrated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the scent of a mature woman.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t compliment my natural scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>But it is a little strong, so 11/2 spray will be enough.</li>
            <li>bottle seems to be a large amount that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is hard for me to wear perfumes because my body chemistry is unique.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long and slightly lighter in color than the original.</li>
            <li>Not mature as in old.  </li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s no longer carried by regular stores because it&#x27;s a limited edition.</li>
            <li> I got two times the amount of the product for only five extra dollars compared to other sellers on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn other perfumes but always go back to LOOK because of</li>
            <li> I will wear this as a backup and when I am running low on other frangrances.  </li>
            <li> It came later than the estimated date and was shipped a few days after I had placed the order on a Monday.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Was shipped to the wrong address, but not the fault of the shipper, they sent to the right address.</li>
            <li> It seems to be diluted and not like out previous purchases.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is not a sweet smell but a woodsy, musk, orient scent something I did not think</li>
            <li> Each one as equally disappointing as the first.  </li>
            <li> I wear it year round and never tire of it.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I&#x27;ve never gotten tired of.</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have bought a big size because I am so tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> Not an everyday smell</li>
            <li> but I KILLED her bottle.  </li>
            <li> Discovered this when a coworker walked past me....</li>
            <li> If there was a half star I would seriously consider giving it.</li>
            <li> Tough lesson learned.  </li>
            <li> Sad to admit</li>
            <li> Not happy about the purchase at all!!  </li>
            <li> Eagerly awaited the arrival of not one, but five, yes five, blind fragrance purchases.</li>
            <li> To the requested point, unable to describe nor consider them even passable.</li>
            <li> Wife is unhappy and that means life is unhappy now.  </li>
            <li> And when life is unhappy we have an unhappy house.  </li>
            <li> My mom wanted this bad.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the smell :(</li>
            <li> Must be a bad bottle!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchaseðŸŒŸâœ¨ðŸ’«</li>
            <li> Excellent product and will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> My mom wanted this bad. So I bought it for her Birthday. She loved it but it is not one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent for several years now. when it was no longer available in the stores i turned to the internet to purchase. the price i pay online is about 1/3 the cost of retail. i love the light scent.... i can no longer smell it on myself but i always receive compliments about how wonderful i smell from others. it is fragrant w/out being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend and it was a great gift. The only problem was the amount of time it took for it to come. It came later than the estimated date and was shipped a few days after I had placed the order on a Monday.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you just how many people ask me what is the perfume I am wearing. I get so many compliments on it. I believe that you are not finished dressing till you finish with a scent. Each person has a signature scent that they are known for even if you are the type of person who wears different scents regularly. There is truly one that you always go back to because others notice the fragrance on you. This one is definitely me. It is not over powering at all but has a very seductive, floral, lasting scent. I absolutely love it. Smelled strong initally from the bottle but once on you, it blends with your own chemistry wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing and I always receive compliments when wearing it. Scent is fresh, long-lasting and not overpowering. I wear it year round and never tire of it. I&#x27;ve worn other perfumes but always go back to LOOK because of it&#x27;s refreshing scent and the constant compliments and comments I receive. Both men and women comment on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell of this, my husband asked if my mom had stopped by. I said no why he said it smells like she was here. I showed him my new perfume he oh no that&#x27;s the smell :(</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Great light smell. Purchase price was great. I got two times the amount of the product for only five extra dollars compared to other sellers on here. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This parfume is a very nice soft scent, if you have bad allergies like I do its not too strong. My problem was that I NEVER received the merchandise, after almost a month I finally just requested a refund.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of Look&amp;#34;. Keep in mind, it depends on your body chemistry as to how it will smell on you! I always get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li> The best, clean and refreshing scent ever. Discovered this when a coworker walked past me....such a clean, like fresh soapy, just got out of shower but yet feminine scent.... Love it</li>
            <li> Great light scent. very elegant, i get so many compliments when i wear this, and it is a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> A bit hesitant to buy this perfume nline because of all the fakes out there. But this is the real thing. I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and last all day. Several compliments and I work in a hospital. Patients never complain. Warm refreshing fragrance. It&#x27;s a must have. Thanks again Vera and amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this without smelling it first because my sister said it smells like Aveda products. It&#x27;s somewhat similar. I spray in the air and walk through because I think it&#x27;s kind of strong. If nothing else, I will use as air freshener in my home/car.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and it is a fragrance that last along time during the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this, because I didn&#x27;t find the Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere for this  I love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real original fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long and slightly lighter in color than the original.</li>
            <li> I recommend this parfume to any lady that wants to be noticed by her great smell.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume. I use it when I go out together with the lotion and I smell like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> Love this fresh perfume--as with most perfumes, only a dab will do!&lt;br /&gt;This bottle seems to be a large amount that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. But it&#x27;s no longer carried by regular stores because it&#x27;s a limited edition. I am very happy that I can still get one now and with such good price.</li>
            <li> One can never get enough of it!&lt;br /&gt;This EDP is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It is light, refreshing, longlasting and doesn&#x27;t bother smell-sensitive people. My husband gets headaches with many colognes and EDPs, but not with this one at all. Allthough it is very light and sporty, it shows presence and people will always ask you what you are wearing. It is great for winter, summer, spring and fall, elegant outings and everyday working. It does specially good with leather. This is the only scent I&#x27;ve never gotten tired of.</li>
            <li> Met my expectation, perfumes best kept secret. Completely underrated and you&#x27;ll love it I guarantee. You wouldn&#x27;t regret it. Coco</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have bought a big size because I am so tired of the smell. It strangely doesn&#x27;t even smell girly, rather manly in my own view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a smaller size and I think it was over-hyped.</li>
            <li> I really like it. But it is a little strong, so 11/2 spray will be enough. Not an everyday smell it&#x27;s more for a night out.</li>
            <li> Vera Wang Look is one of my favorite scents...I love how it stays on all day and leaves you  smelling sweet and fresh</li>
            <li> I placed my order on the 14th of June, they were shipped on the 15th and arrived on the 17th. So all in all a good experience.  The packaging was good.  The boxes that the perfumes came in weren&#x27;t smooshed or anything. Some of the perfumes were gifts so if I wanted to wrap them (which I didnt) I could&#x27;ve. I will definitely shop from them again when they need to be replaced.  Ad for the product itself.  The scent is so great! One of my favourites.  My cousin came to visit and this was the perfume she used.  Sad to admit but I KILLED her bottle.  Always said I&#x27;d get one for myself after she left but the stores were always sold out so I decided to get it online.  Smells awesome.  I&#x27;d say the scent of a mature woman.  Not mature as in old.  But I picture a woman who has her life together,  career on the rise,  successful and sensual.  All in all I love it. Happy customer here.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected. I love this scent, it has been very hard to find in a department store, the price was excellent. I have ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this fragrance. It is hard for me to wear perfumes because my body chemistry is unique. I like sweet fragrances but they don&#x27;t last on me and they don&#x27;t compliment my natural scent.This fragrance is not a sweet smell but a woodsy, musk, orient scent something I did not think I would ever like but it lays nicely. It literally last all day and has lingered until the following day. Definitely a bright lively smell that I love to flaunt during the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Must be a bad bottle!  The fragrance does not last at all.  We are not running a marathon or anything.  It seems to be diluted and not like out previous purchases.  Wife is unhappy and that means life is unhappy now.  And when life is unhappy we have an unhappy house.  Not happy about the purchase at all!!  If there was a half star I would seriously consider giving it.</li>
            <li> This scent is one of those that lasts the whole day through.  No matter what I go through at the end of the day this scent is still there.</li>
            <li> Lovely Perfume, fresh scent. I always get compliments on it and people want to know the name of it and where they can get it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Look by Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> I understand this product contains a hint of watermelon.  Absolutely love it!  Every time I wear this, people tell me I smell amazing!</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled it, a man was wearing it. I looked all over for it and, of course, I found it on Amazon!! It smells great and you only need a couple of sprays to last all day. It&#x27;s worth the money and it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my second choice fragrance. I originally received this as a gift and use that to the last drop. When Isaw the price and the fast delivery available there was no doubt about ordering.</li>
            <li> Since this is no longer available in stores, I love tjat I can purchase it on line and twice as pleased with the price. It is definitley a favorite scent</li>
            <li> I love it. This was my only time ordering this one off of Amazon .I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Eagerly awaited the arrival of not one, but five, yes five, blind fragrance purchases. Each one as equally disappointing as the first.  Went by trusted names, and of course, the allure of great prices.  Tough lesson learned.  To the requested point, unable to describe nor consider them even passable.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Was shipped to the wrong address, but not the fault of the shipper, they sent to the right address.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for new fragrances and decided to try something new.  It seems be an anytime fragrance that is floral and light.  I will wear this as a backup and when I am running low on other frangrances.  Also, shipping and packaging were great.</li>
