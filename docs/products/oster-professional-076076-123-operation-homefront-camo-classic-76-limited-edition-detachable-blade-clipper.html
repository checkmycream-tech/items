            <li>Cord length was good for bathroom use.</li>
            <li>the money on a really good one and never have to buy one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say its still going strong!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used the cheaper trimmers and there is a HUGE difference between them and this product!!  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers!</li>
            <li>This is a must buy for someone who doesnt mind shaving his own head with a quality product.</li>
            <li>Awesome clippers cleans super easy</li>
            <li>The weight is perfect, the operation is very easy and the finished haircut looks professional.</li>
            <li>Best clippers by far.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best.</li>
            <li>so I went with the Osters (pretty scientific, huh? lol).</li>
            <li>Graduating the hair from neck to top was made very easy by using the many attachments that are provided for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Way more than I could afford</li>
            <li>sure to grease it and keep it lubed.</li>
            <li>I use the optional guide combs for the lengthier top of my head</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it so many damn times, and eventually I went to buy</li>
            <li>bought the plastic comb set as well, they work, but the metal guides work so much better.</li>
            <li>Love the toggle switch too.</li>
            <li>They are replacing Oster Fast Feeds, which were great, but they started to catch in my eldest&#x27;s hair as it got more and more wiry over the years.</li>
            <li>I did love these clippers</li>
            <li>it worked much better - and does seem to be \\&quot;sturdier\\&quot; than some of the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use Oster blades for it.</li>
            <li>I have used the Oster A5 clippers for many, many years</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I busted this baby out and was impressed by the overall quality of it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Oster!!!!</li>
            <li>I can even cut a pretty good skin fade with these, on myself!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They do get warm, fairly quickly...</li>
            <li>Light weight, quiet, speed change blades, and speed clip attachments make this the best clipper ever.</li>
            <li>Each are awesome in their own right, and the performance advantage would have to go to the metal AgION blades, as the thinner space between the teeth tend to bring hair to the blade more efficiently than the wide canals within the combs.</li>
            <li>The Camo Classic is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>forget about other clippers this is the best one out there.</li>
            <li>Had it for about a year now and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Yes .... the blade was checked to make sure it was clean, oiled and free of hair.  </li>
            <li>We tried this once before with another product that shall remain unnamed and that product rattled from the first moment we turned it on and it required many, many swipes to get all of the hair clipped in any one area of the head.</li>
            <li>a formed foam tray, so it&#x27;ll need to be cherished to maintain a mint condition, otherwise it does just fine.</li>
            <li>and it was a great hair cut with no long hairs.</li>
            <li>Super fast cut compared to the over the counter brands, in fact, gonna have to practice a bit to get good with it.</li>
            <li>And this was the very first time this product had ever been used!  </li>
            <li>Periodic maintenance is straightforward and easy to perform while switching out blades or attaching the optional guide combs is a breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking forward to make more purchases to keep a smile on my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any strays, but because the motor is slower, it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth silhouette.</li>
            <li>Great especially since I use it every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Clippers cut hair great and has a quiet motor when in use.  </li>
            <li>Great clippers.. save big money.. and because they are camo..</li>
            <li>i like the nice clean cut i put the 00000 blade on it and get a real close cut....</li>
            <li>Ok, but the older model clipper was better, and easier to use.</li>
            <li>I normally cut my own hair (bald or as close</li>
            <li>taking a break from my cart for this newbie amazon guy to do my first review from one of my favorite batch of things.</li>
            <li>Go for the maroon colored original version.</li>
            <li>The only area for improvement would be an ergonomic design for better grip and a more comfortable fit in hand.  </li>
            <li>And this one is more than decent - it kicks a$$!</li>
            <li>Cuts great,easy to use looks good also,very quiet not heavy at all love these clippers will never get the cheap clippers again</li>
            <li>fun and keep those heads clean</li>
            <li>They cut evenly and quickly with just one pass.</li>
            <li>The main thing that I have to say that I love about these clippers are the fact that they are not noisy at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks for adding this special model!</li>
            <li>Great for the everyday barber or the novice.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased (after one cut).</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t useful for this.</li>
            <li>heavy&lt;br /&gt;3.Very powerful</li>
            <li>Its a bit pricier than what you&#x27;ll find at Walmart, but its worth it.  </li>
            <li>please reply, because my biggest concern is that the manufacturer will cheapen the model I&#x27;m praising (the maroon original Classic 76).</li>
            <li>These are extremely quiet, the fan does a great job managing the heat distribution so the clippers maintains a low temp (even after prolonged use),</li>
            <li>We just loved this limited edition Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76 clipper.  </li>
            <li>This thing is a beast, I have been cutting my own hair lately, saving money is nice, but saving time from having to wait my turn at the barber shop is priceless!</li>
            <li>However, when I saw these, I ordered them from  Amazon because they were slightly more affordable and since they qualified for super saver shipping, I had nothing to loose and $5 to gain.</li>
            <li>Not uncomfortable, just noticable.</li>
            <li>The blade got uncomfortably hot after 35 to 40 minutes of continuous use  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blazing hot... to the point where it was hurting my skin.</li>
            <li>One pass will cut your hair to the exact level you choose.</li>
            <li>Male clients love the cameo design.</li>
            <li>The camo version has a slower motor, and the power cord is much skinnier than the original Classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>these large clippers adn the delivery box</li>
            <li>last but sure not least the price that Amazon is offering these at is a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I typically use the metal blades for clean, precise trimming and fading along the sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last set of clippers was a cheap off the shelf one</li>
            <li>But who really needs that.</li>
            <li>Thanks Oster, for building a quality product.</li>
            <li>These clippers are so much easier to use than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>Get the extra blades if you need them and not the cheap plastic guides.</li>
            <li>The motor will get very overworked after about 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>The metal ones are about 20-25 a pop, so a set aint cheap, but trust, your abilities will be so much better with the model 76 that the extra loot for metal guides is well spent.</li>
            <li>Now the new Clipper case in Desert Camo adds just another sweet dimension to an already STELLAR product.&lt;br /&gt;Being a former Military member these will be a must have for me and the Military members that I proudly cut.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Not only is it unique but it stands up to the quality of the Oster name.</li>
            <li>and I found myself going over the same spots over and over and digging into my skin to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Clean up was simple with the detachable blades.</li>
            <li>The motor is not the same as the original Classic 76.</li>
            <li>the only prob is little heavy for doing your own hair and they get pretty warm after 3-5 min</li>
            <li>The Operation Homefront Limited Edition is also quite special in sporting its unique star logo on the face plate and desert camouflage on the unit body; I think the actual unit looks much cooler than what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and sharp and I anticipate it being the last trimmer I will ever own.</li>
            <li>They all had decent reviews, So I went to barbers and I got a haircut</li>
            <li>I owned the Classic 76 for over a decade.</li>
            <li>I have cut hair at least every week for the last 15 years and this is a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone on any skill level.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any home barber or business as far as that goes!!</li>
            <li>but then again I cut quite a few more heads in a shop.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of different barbers and I noticed that the ones that used this particular clipper got the gob done very fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every couple years I was buying a new clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Spend</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I am a very busy barber</li>
            <li>would be my personal first</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t believe they were still selling the same exact model...</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews from products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t go back over to correct, because short hair doesn&#x27;t cut as clean as longer</li>
            <li>They do an alright job when new, but when I add of replacement cost of time, i decided to get a pair of professional grade clippers.</li>
            <li>I can cut 5 people back to back and the part that gets hot is the very tip, so keep it away from their necks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The heavy duty, USA made clippers are remarkably superior to my previous clipper set.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend the Classic 76 to anyone who takes pride in their personal grooming.</li>
            <li>The Oster Professional Clipper 076076-123 is vibrationless.  </li>
            <li>Been shopping a while for a professional clipper.</li>
            <li>Used the 000 blade with a couple of blade guides for 8 year old son and a 00000 for me.</li>
            <li>When I use this I feel like I have been a professional barber all of my life.</li>
            <li>and I would consider these a necessity early on since they cover lengths beyond what the largest of the AgION attachments provides.</li>
            <li>a snap to change out blades, and provides a professional cut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Professional Barber now for over 14 years now</li>
            <li>Yes they are plastic but also made very sturdy and will last for a longtime.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I was looking at the blade and the head was not vibrating like the old one.  </li>
            <li>Gives a professional quality cut for me and my son.</li>
            <li>We have only owned this a few months and we have already saved more than the cost of the item.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut clean, it leaves and uneven buzz.</li>
            <li>low fades, high fades, you name it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting this unless you only cut hair once every 3 months.</li>
            <li>Being new, I haven&#x27;t done it yet, but probably will later in summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pissed off at the horrid quality of this product and the only way to make me feel redeemed is by informing others who want actual Barber Shop quality.</li>
            <li>so let the buyer beware, the detachable blade units for the old series of Oster Professiional Clippers, such as for the old Milwaukee Model 22, can in no wise be made to fit into the newer models such as the 076076-123, even though the two clipper models look almost exactly the same from the outside!</li>
            <li>I figured it was cheaper because apparently some of the proceeds go towards the army...</li>
            <li>This thing barely required any maintenance.</li>
            <li>The Oster Professional Clipper has been around for a long time</li>
            <li>The quality build of this set is apparent and the functionality is second to none.</li>
            <li>I switched it on and it was not nearly as loud as our old ones.  </li>
            <li>When comparing the closeness of cut of various detachable blades (the whole units, consisting of an upper and lower blade), for example, the ooo size with the closer cutting oooo size, be sure to check that for each individual blade unit, the upper and lower blades are properly aligned.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great for the everyday barber or the novice.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased (after one cut).</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t useful for this.</li>
            <li> heavy&lt;br /&gt;3.Very powerful</li>
            <li> Its a bit pricier than what you&#x27;ll find at Walmart, but its worth it.  </li>
            <li> please reply, because my biggest concern is that the manufacturer will cheapen the model I&#x27;m praising (the maroon original Classic 76).</li>
            <li> These are extremely quiet, the fan does a great job managing the heat distribution so the clippers maintains a low temp (even after prolonged use),</li>
            <li> We just loved this limited edition Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76 clipper.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a beast, I have been cutting my own hair lately, saving money is nice, but saving time from having to wait my turn at the barber shop is priceless!</li>
            <li> However, when I saw these, I ordered them from  Amazon because they were slightly more affordable and since they qualified for super saver shipping, I had nothing to loose and $5 to gain.</li>
            <li> Not uncomfortable, just noticable.</li>
            <li> The blade got uncomfortably hot after 35 to 40 minutes of continuous use  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blazing hot... to the point where it was hurting my skin.</li>
            <li> One pass will cut your hair to the exact level you choose.</li>
            <li> Male clients love the cameo design.</li>
            <li> The camo version has a slower motor, and the power cord is much skinnier than the original Classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> these large clippers adn the delivery box</li>
            <li> last but sure not least the price that Amazon is offering these at is a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically use the metal blades for clean, precise trimming and fading along the sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last set of clippers was a cheap off the shelf one</li>
            <li> But who really needs that.</li>
            <li> Thanks Oster, for building a quality product.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so much easier to use than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Get the extra blades if you need them and not the cheap plastic guides.</li>
            <li> The motor will get very overworked after about 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> The metal ones are about 20-25 a pop, so a set aint cheap, but trust, your abilities will be so much better with the model 76 that the extra loot for metal guides is well spent.</li>
            <li> Now the new Clipper case in Desert Camo adds just another sweet dimension to an already STELLAR product.&lt;br /&gt;Being a former Military member these will be a must have for me and the Military members that I proudly cut.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Not only is it unique but it stands up to the quality of the Oster name.</li>
            <li> and I found myself going over the same spots over and over and digging into my skin to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Clean up was simple with the detachable blades.</li>
            <li> The motor is not the same as the original Classic 76.</li>
            <li> the only prob is little heavy for doing your own hair and they get pretty warm after 3-5 min</li>
            <li> The Operation Homefront Limited Edition is also quite special in sporting its unique star logo on the face plate and desert camouflage on the unit body; I think the actual unit looks much cooler than what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and sharp and I anticipate it being the last trimmer I will ever own.</li>
            <li> They all had decent reviews, So I went to barbers and I got a haircut</li>
            <li> I owned the Classic 76 for over a decade.</li>
            <li> I have cut hair at least every week for the last 15 years and this is a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone on any skill level.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any home barber or business as far as that goes!!</li>
            <li> but then again I cut quite a few more heads in a shop.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of different barbers and I noticed that the ones that used this particular clipper got the gob done very fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every couple years I was buying a new clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Spend</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I am a very busy barber</li>
            <li> would be my personal first</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe they were still selling the same exact model...</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews from products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t go back over to correct, because short hair doesn&#x27;t cut as clean as longer</li>
            <li> They do an alright job when new, but when I add of replacement cost of time, i decided to get a pair of professional grade clippers.</li>
            <li> I can cut 5 people back to back and the part that gets hot is the very tip, so keep it away from their necks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The heavy duty, USA made clippers are remarkably superior to my previous clipper set.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend the Classic 76 to anyone who takes pride in their personal grooming.</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Clipper 076076-123 is vibrationless.  </li>
            <li> Been shopping a while for a professional clipper.</li>
            <li> Used the 000 blade with a couple of blade guides for 8 year old son and a 00000 for me.</li>
            <li> When I use this I feel like I have been a professional barber all of my life.</li>
            <li> and I would consider these a necessity early on since they cover lengths beyond what the largest of the AgION attachments provides.</li>
            <li> a snap to change out blades, and provides a professional cut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Professional Barber now for over 14 years now</li>
            <li> Yes they are plastic but also made very sturdy and will last for a longtime.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I was looking at the blade and the head was not vibrating like the old one.  </li>
            <li> Gives a professional quality cut for me and my son.</li>
            <li> We have only owned this a few months and we have already saved more than the cost of the item.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut clean, it leaves and uneven buzz.</li>
            <li> low fades, high fades, you name it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting this unless you only cut hair once every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Being new, I haven&#x27;t done it yet, but probably will later in summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pissed off at the horrid quality of this product and the only way to make me feel redeemed is by informing others who want actual Barber Shop quality.</li>
            <li> so let the buyer beware, the detachable blade units for the old series of Oster Professiional Clippers, such as for the old Milwaukee Model 22, can in no wise be made to fit into the newer models such as the 076076-123, even though the two clipper models look almost exactly the same from the outside!</li>
            <li> I figured it was cheaper because apparently some of the proceeds go towards the army...</li>
            <li> This thing barely required any maintenance.</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Clipper has been around for a long time</li>
            <li> The quality build of this set is apparent and the functionality is second to none.</li>
            <li> I switched it on and it was not nearly as loud as our old ones.  </li>
            <li> When comparing the closeness of cut of various detachable blades (the whole units, consisting of an upper and lower blade), for example, the ooo size with the closer cutting oooo size, be sure to check that for each individual blade unit, the upper and lower blades are properly aligned.  </li>
            <li> These right here, the engine sounds a little rough, I wanted to see if you&#x27;d exchange them</li>
            <li> The original box is thin cardboard housing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which blade my dog wants yet.</li>
            <li> So long as I keep up with proper maintenance, I can see using these clippers for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The upper and lower blades of each unit can be realigned by loosening the two screws on the bottom of the lower blade and repositioning the upper and lower blades with respect to each other.  </li>
            <li> I little loud, but i feel like I am doing something manly.</li>
            <li> and I must say that you can&#x27;t buy a better Clipper for cutting hair than the Oster 76.</li>
            <li> It will be a long time before we visit the inside of a barbershop again.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer with a 1 inch guide to shave my long haired cat in the summer.</li>
            <li> She is not a professional groomer, but she loves this product.</li>
            <li> We had a cheap clipper that was loud and vibrated which made him very uncomfortable when it came time to cut his hair.  </li>
            <li> Now that we have given each other several haircuts I can say with all honesty; why haven&#x27;t I done this before?</li>
            <li> I have a little 4.5 lb Yorkie - very tiny - with fairly short hair.  </li>
            <li> With proper maintenance, these have out lasted all the other brands.</li>
            <li> Makes short work of the hair and keeps the amount of cat hair down in my house</li>
            <li> Days later after the unit cooled down and I cleaned and re-oiled it again</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 pair of these clippers over the past 10 years; the 2 previous pair eventually developed hardware issues i.e. a short in the cord and the screw hole that holds the clipper while vibrating over time didn&#x27;t hold the screw in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (buzz cut) off and on for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> Another indicator of the weak motor is the amount of air it pushes out, the lightness, the skinnier cord, it&#x27;s a much cheaper</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> But that would be a plus, its not really needed because the quality of these clippers are tops.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few buzzers since my teen years</li>
            <li> These replaced my Andi&#x27;s pro that went for about $100 and never really did the job.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly (no pulling) in one pass, it doesn&#x27;t bog down, and feels like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 other clippers; all discarded because of a lack of horsepower.    </li>
            <li> Other than that, I do think that they are a bit overpriced for not coming with a blade set</li>
            <li> The Classic 76&#x27;s detachable blade clippers make short work of cutting hair in one effortless pass.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought myself one of these</li>
            <li> I sat him down and in three minutes we were finished.  </li>
            <li> This pair seems to run louder and rougher than the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> We save so much money with the convenience of cutting the guys&#x27; hair at home.  </li>
            <li> but they are just a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that you will not be disappointed with the Oster line of products!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Oster Cutting guides.  </li>
            <li> I was experting with different cutting patterns and also let run while I did other things.</li>
            <li> With these clippers one swipe usually does the trick and there are fewer stragglers to search for and trim after you have finished.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for professional quality hair cutting products, Oster is the name to go with.  </li>
            <li> I use my clipper daily to shave as well as cutting my hair about once a week or so.</li>
            <li> Yes, it still makes noise but it is not that loud annoying humming that I have found which our cheaper clippers.  </li>
            <li> The styrofoam is weak.</li>
            <li> and I had to get other ones because they stopped working :(</li>
            <li> Before I got half way through cutting her hair the unit was binding and/or pulling hair rather than cutting the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my kids&#x27; hair since they were born, and I should have bought these 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I guess buying a pair ever 2-3 years isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Get the guards, unless all your cutting is close, cause these clippers give no ground and will cut without prejudice!</li>
            <li> get it, and what a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> no one can see when I am cutting hair without a barbers license !!</li>
            <li> I tested it on myself - and the hair pulling was awful!  </li>

            <li> The Oster Professional Clipper 076076-123 is vibrationless.  When comparing the closeness of cut of various detachable blades (the whole units, consisting of an upper and lower blade), for example, the ooo size with the closer cutting oooo size, be sure to check that for each individual blade unit, the upper and lower blades are properly aligned.  The upper and lower blades of each unit can be realigned by loosening the two screws on the bottom of the lower blade and repositioning the upper and lower blades with respect to each other.  The Oster Professional Clipper has been around for a long time so let the buyer beware, the detachable blade units for the old series of Oster Professiional Clippers, such as for the old Milwaukee Model 22, can in no wise be made to fit into the newer models such as the 076076-123, even though the two clipper models look almost exactly the same from the outside!</li>
            <li> I got this to shave my head with.  My last set of clippers was a cheap off the shelf one and I found myself going over the same spots over and over and digging into my skin to get a clean shave.  These clippers, get it one pass.</li>
            <li> Been shopping a while for a professional clipper. I normally cut my own hair (bald or as close I can get with store bought clippers - wahl, andis, cost about 20 bucks or so. They do an alright job when new, but when I add of replacement cost of time, i decided to get a pair of professional grade clippers. Looked at Andis Improved Masters, Wahl Seniors and the 76.  They all had decent reviews, So I went to barbers and I got a haircut and he used Andis and Wahl. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the closeness or comfort so I went with the Osters (pretty scientific, huh? lol). I have seen plenty of shops with the Oster Brand. So far I am pleased (after one cut). Good power and blade speed. I little loud, but i feel like I am doing something manly. They do get warm, fairly quickly...continuous use for 20 minutes or so. Not uncomfortable, just noticable. The blade got uncomfortably hot after 35 to 40 minutes of continuous use  I was experting with different cutting patterns and also let run while I did other things. You could still use it, but I could see kids complaining. Used the 000 blade with a couple of blade guides for 8 year old son and a 00000 for me. Super fast cut compared to the over the counter brands, in fact, gonna have to practice a bit to get good with it. Cord length was good for bathroom use. Clean up was simple with the detachable blades. Storage a bit of a problem with these large clippers adn the delivery box isn&#x27;t useful for this. The styrofoam is weak. Get the guards, unless all your cutting is close, cause these clippers give no ground and will cut without prejudice!</li>
            <li> Best clippers by far. My barber has used these for over 20 years and I recently got myself a clippers to do touch ups and for those times you cant make it into the barber. Highly recommend for anyone on any skill level. Great for the everyday barber or the novice. (I have no formal training and turned this thing on with a #2 blade on and 10 mins later had a #2 buzz cut) This is great and I cant recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a month for my husband and son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every couple years I was buying a new clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Spend the money on a really good one and never have to buy one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1.Fast&lt;br /&gt;2.No heavy&lt;br /&gt;3.Very powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons</li>
            <li> taking a break from my cart for this newbie amazon guy to do my first review from one of my favorite batch of things. This version home front of the 76. Way more than I could afford but when I saw these neutral colors on it I new I had to have it over the andis.&lt;br /&gt;The blades actually detach&lt;br /&gt;You can use andis ceramic edge clipper blades&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use andis guard combs&lt;br /&gt;All parts can be found to replace here on amazon&lt;br /&gt;The only thing the andis has on it is cordless and multi speed. But who really needs that. Maybe for work.&lt;br /&gt;This would be my personal first choice.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to grease it and keep it lubed. I suggest cleaning it with a steam cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the 000 blade but I&#x27;m waiting on my 1a blade which is a bit longer. I&#x27;m not sure which blade my dog wants yet.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased a pair of these years ago. At the tip of the spear in every facet of engineering. Thanks Oster, for building a quality product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of this product.  The clippers are perfect and they work great!!!  Would do business with again</li>
            <li> I waited until we had used this product several times before reviewing it. Now that we have given each other several haircuts I can say with all honesty; why haven&#x27;t I done this before? When I use this I feel like I have been a professional barber all of my life. The weight is perfect, the operation is very easy and the finished haircut looks professional. We tried this once before with another product that shall remain unnamed and that product rattled from the first moment we turned it on and it required many, many swipes to get all of the hair clipped in any one area of the head. With these clippers one swipe usually does the trick and there are fewer stragglers to search for and trim after you have finished. Graduating the hair from neck to top was made very easy by using the many attachments that are provided for that purpose. It will be a long time before we visit the inside of a barbershop again. We have only owned this a few months and we have already saved more than the cost of the item. We rate it as one of the Best Values we have ever purchased at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 pair of these clippers over the past 10 years; the 2 previous pair eventually developed hardware issues i.e. a short in the cord and the screw hole that holds the clipper while vibrating over time didn&#x27;t hold the screw in.  This pair seems to run louder and rougher than the previous ones.  For the price, I guess buying a pair ever 2-3 years isn&#x27;t bad.  BTW.  I use my clipper daily to shave as well as cutting my hair about once a week or so.</li>
            <li> The quality build of this set is apparent and the functionality is second to none. The Classic 76&#x27;s detachable blade clippers make short work of cutting hair in one effortless pass. Periodic maintenance is straightforward and easy to perform while switching out blades or attaching the optional guide combs is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heavy duty, USA made clippers are remarkably superior to my previous clipper set.  The Operation Homefront Limited Edition is also quite special in sporting its unique star logo on the face plate and desert camouflage on the unit body; I think the actual unit looks much cooler than what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased five of the AgION blade attachments in addition to the guide combs. Each are awesome in their own right, and the performance advantage would have to go to the metal AgION blades, as the thinner space between the teeth tend to bring hair to the blade more efficiently than the wide canals within the combs. I use the optional guide combs for the lengthier top of my head and I would consider these a necessity early on since they cover lengths beyond what the largest of the AgION attachments provides. I typically use the metal blades for clean, precise trimming and fading along the sides and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord and components are rugged. The original box is thin cardboard housing a formed foam tray, so it&#x27;ll need to be cherished to maintain a mint condition, otherwise it does just fine. So long as I keep up with proper maintenance, I can see using these clippers for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Classic 76 to anyone who takes pride in their personal grooming. I love these clippers!</li>
            <li> Husband is a barber and he loves the clippers....very affordable as well.  Once again great job!  Looking forward to make more purchases to keep a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so much easier to use than the cheaper ones. They cut evenly and quickly with just one pass. Get the extra blades if you need them and not the cheap plastic guides. Besides the 000 blades that come with it I got a 3 1/2 and a 2. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer with a 1 inch guide to shave my long haired cat in the summer. Makes short work of the hair and keeps the amount of cat hair down in my house</li>
            <li> I owned the Classic 76 for over a decade. I&#x27;ve dropped it so many damn times, and eventually I went to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe they were still selling the same exact model... but then I saw this camo version and it was cheaper. I figured it was cheaper because apparently some of the proceeds go towards the army... and/or it looks to funky to use in a barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get it, and what a piece of crap. Now, keep in mind... if you&#x27;re buying clippers to simply shave your head or do a simple haircut, go ahead and buy. As for me, I do fades... low fades, high fades, you name it. This is NOT quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things:&lt;br /&gt;1. The motor is not the same as the original Classic 76. The camo version has a slower motor, and the power cord is much skinnier than the original Classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;2. Because the motor is slower when you try to fade, it rips has out from the root.&lt;br /&gt;3. The motor will get very overworked after about 20 minutes of use. It&#x27;s blazing hot... to the point where it was hurting my skin. (yes I did oil)&lt;br /&gt;4. Another indicator of the weak motor is the amount of air it pushes out, the lightness, the skinnier cord, it&#x27;s a much cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;5. Even if you were to buy this to do a simple head shave, say at a 1/4\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t cut clean, it leaves and uneven buzz. I didn&#x27;t get any strays, but because the motor is slower, it doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth silhouette. And you can&#x27;t go back over to correct, because short hair doesn&#x27;t cut as clean as longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pissed off at the horrid quality of this product and the only way to make me feel redeemed is by informing others who want actual Barber Shop quality. This is NOT the model you want. Go for the maroon colored original version. Don&#x27;t buy any variants of this, stick with the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can provide another clipper please reply, because my biggest concern is that the manufacturer will cheapen the model I&#x27;m praising (the maroon original Classic 76).</li>
            <li> This thing is a beast, I have been cutting my own hair lately, saving money is nice, but saving time from having to wait my turn at the barber shop is priceless! This model will cut like a pro. One pass will cut your hair to the exact level you choose. I can even cut a pretty good skin fade with these, on myself!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the plastic comb set as well, they work, but the metal guides work so much better. The metal ones are about 20-25 a pop, so a set aint cheap, but trust, your abilities will be so much better with the model 76 that the extra loot for metal guides is well spent. Oh yeah, buying on amazon saves you about $100 over retail for non pros at a beauty supply!</li>
            <li> These are an excellent clipper.  I have always used Oster 76 clippers in my barber shop.  The Camo Classic is the absolute best!  Thanks for adding this special model!</li>
            <li> What is not to like?  These are extremely quiet, the fan does a great job managing the heat distribution so the clippers maintains a low temp (even after prolonged use), a snap to change out blades, and provides a professional cut.  The only area for improvement would be an ergonomic design for better grip and a more comfortable fit in hand.  But that would be a plus, its not really needed because the quality of these clippers are tops.  I&#x27;ll never buy or use another type.</li>
            <li> Great clipper.  Its a bit pricier than what you&#x27;ll find at Walmart, but its worth it.  It cuts well and is quite.  Love the toggle switch too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my kids&#x27; hair since they were born, and I should have bought these 7 years ago.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 other clippers; all discarded because of a lack of horsepower.    These are the quietest and best of all of them.  They are replacing Oster Fast Feeds, which were great, but they started to catch in my eldest&#x27;s hair as it got more and more wiry over the years.</li>
            <li> Ok, but the older model clipper was better, and easier to use. It was sharper and worked for 30 years.</li>
            <li> I did love these clippers but I am a very busy barber and I got these almost a year ago and I had to get other ones because they stopped working :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few buzzers since my teen years and I&#x27;m now in my mid 30s. These replaced my Andi&#x27;s pro that went for about $100 and never really did the job. This thing barely required any maintenance. Just clip hair and oil it every now and then. Had it for about a year now and still going strong. Great especially since I use it every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Professional Barber now for over 14 years now and I must say that you can&#x27;t buy a better Clipper for cutting hair than the Oster 76. The power and smoothness are unmatched in the industry.  Now the new Clipper case in Desert Camo adds just another sweet dimension to an already STELLAR product.&lt;br /&gt;Being a former Military member these will be a must have for me and the Military members that I proudly cut.&lt;br /&gt;And last but sure not least the price that Amazon is offering these at is a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add for the Home Hair cutter I would highly recommend the Oster Cutting guides.  Yes they are plastic but also made very sturdy and will last for a longtime.&lt;br /&gt;I use the metal blades but then again I cut quite a few more heads in a shop.&lt;br /&gt;You can also goto Oster website and purchase videos that will explain the Pro manner of Clipper cuts to make your styles look even better.&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and keep those heads clean</li>
            <li> hello, its a great product, I bought it for my son as I already owend one for myself!! I highly recommend for any home barber or business as far as that goes!! great clippers!</li>
            <li> I have a little 4.5 lb Yorkie - very tiny - with fairly short hair.  Before I got half way through cutting her hair the unit was binding and/or pulling hair rather than cutting the hair.  Not knowing why she was struggling to get away I tested it on myself - and the hair pulling was awful!  Yes .... the blade was checked to make sure it was clean, oiled and free of hair.  And this was the very first time this product had ever been used!  The unit also got rather hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2013 Update:  Days later after the unit cooled down and I cleaned and re-oiled it again it worked much better - and does seem to be \\&quot;sturdier\\&quot; than some of the cheaper brands.  However I remain uncertain if I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (buzz cut) off and on for the past 7 years. I started with some cheapo wahl clippers that took 4-6 passes to cut all my hair. I have very thick straight hair. I tried a bunch of different barbers and I noticed that the ones that used this particular clipper got the gob done very fast and it was a great hair cut with no long hairs. I broke down and bought myself one of these and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It cuts cleanly (no pulling) in one pass, it doesn&#x27;t bog down, and feels like it will last forever. Make sure you use Oster blades for it.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oster A5 clippers for many, many years and I purchased this one for my daughter who has three Poodles that we have given them.  She is not a professional groomer, but she loves this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually about to use this again, probably the 20th time I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;m impressed by how nicely it shaves every time I use it. This is a must buy for someone who doesnt mind shaving his own head with a quality product. Beware this thing does not come with adjustable heads, etc... You must purchase them seperately.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews from products that I have purchased.  This product definitely deserves one.  My son hates getting his hair cut so I do it at home.  We had a cheap clipper that was loud and vibrated which made him very uncomfortable when it came time to cut his hair.  It also pulled hair hair when I was trying to cut it.  After reading the reviews on this product I bit the bullet and bought it.  So glad I did.  I busted this baby out and was impressed by the overall quality of it.  I switched it on and it was not nearly as loud as our old ones.  Yes, it still makes noise but it is not that loud annoying humming that I have found which our cheaper clippers.  Then I was looking at the blade and the head was not vibrating like the old one.  I sat him down and in three minutes we were finished.  Wow!  It took the stress out of a stressful situation.  Thanks Oster!!!!</li>
            <li> The main thing that I have to say that I love about these clippers are the fact that they are not noisy at all. Other than that, I do think that they are a bit overpriced for not coming with a blade set</li>
            <li> Clippers cut hair great and has a quiet motor when in use.  The design is different.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 3 years ago because i was tired of buying cheap ones from walmart. I&#x27;m happy to say its still going strong!</li>
            <li> cut great and have all the power you need but they are just a bit heavy. i like the nice clean cut i put the 00000 blade on it and get a real close cut....</li>
            <li> my last one i used in the salon for 8 years, it still worked but was making alot of noise. forget about other clippers this is the best one out there.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for professional quality hair cutting products, Oster is the name to go with.  We just loved this limited edition Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76 clipper.  Not only is it unique but it stands up to the quality of the Oster name. We purchased it along with the comb attachments to make home hair-cutting effortless.  We save so much money with the convenience of cutting the guys&#x27; hair at home.  I can honestly say that you will not be disappointed with the Oster line of products!!</li>
            <li> And this one is more than decent - it kicks a$$! It&#x27;s fast and sharp and I anticipate it being the last trimmer I will ever own. This of course assumes following the recommended service and maintenance required which includes greasing some gears with the provided grease. Being new, I haven&#x27;t done it yet, but probably will later in summer. Gives a professional quality cut for me and my son. Now I just need to get the trimmer too.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers cleans super easy the only prob is little heavy for doing your own hair and they get pretty warm after 3-5 min</li>
            <li> Great clippers.. save big money.. and because they are camo.. no one can see when I am cutting hair without a barbers license !! lol</li>
            <li> These right here, the engine sounds a little rough, I wanted to see if you&#x27;d exchange them but I don&#x27;t have another set of clippers for school.&#x27;....wa wa wa</li>
            <li> Cuts great,easy to use looks good also,very quiet not heavy at all love these clippers will never get the cheap clippers again</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of clippers in my salon. These are by far the best. With proper maintenance, these have out lasted all the other brands. Light weight, quiet, speed change blades, and speed clip attachments make this the best clipper ever. Male clients love the cameo design. I go to the hair annual hair show every year. However, when I saw these, I ordered them from  Amazon because they were slightly more affordable and since they qualified for super saver shipping, I had nothing to loose and $5 to gain.</li>
            <li> I have cut hair at least every week for the last 15 years and this is a great trimmer.  It flies through hair and never hangs up.  I can cut 5 people back to back and the part that gets hot is the very tip, so keep it away from their necks.  I have used the cheaper trimmers and there is a HUGE difference between them and this product!!  I would highly recommend getting this unless you only cut hair once every 3 months. The weight is also not an issue - don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
