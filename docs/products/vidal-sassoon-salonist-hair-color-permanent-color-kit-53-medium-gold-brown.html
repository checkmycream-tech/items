            <li>The conditioner smells great</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the results were amazing and my haircolor was beautiful!</li>
            <li>I was getting the best coloring product available for the at-home market.</li>
            <li>Some have been good while others have been equivalent to nightmares.</li>
            <li>my daughter commented on how good it smelled, and it did.  </li>
            <li>It felt so good.  </li>
            <li>but I loved it and will not hesitate to use it again.</li>
            <li>I even got compliments from a hairstylist I know who asked what I used on my hair because it looked so good.</li>
            <li>Great color and easy to do by myself at home!</li>
            <li>Even though I did not like using the two-step process on myself, I am more than happy to purchase this again to use on my two daughters.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li>It is the perfect hair color for me and it is not ridiculously expensive like salon treatments.</li>
            <li>the quality is nice plus there are always coupons for it in the paper</li>
            <li>I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color from the brand for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be nice if the package includes 2 pairs of gloves.  </li>
            <li>The dye itself was thicker &amp; very easy to put on &amp; the brush &amp; bowl that came with the kit</li>
            <li>made it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair coloring system for free through Bzz Agent!</li>
            <li>My nose, which is bipolar, can&#x27;t handle anything too strong, but it holds its own while I&#x27;m using VS products.</li>
            <li>I received a free Sample of this and was so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of being able to afford a salon color every 4 weeks</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and immediately made my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>You do need to use a colour safe shampoo, which is NOT provided in the kit.</li>
            <li>By the time I put it on the roots, most of my hair had dye on it.  </li>
            <li>This dye washed out better &amp; faster than any</li>
            <li>and I used most of the product.</li>
            <li>I would say that anyone with hair below the shoulders get more than one kit.</li>
            <li>When we unboxed the kit I was pleasantly surprised to see good quality gloves, a mixing tray, application brush, the developer, color, VS serum and a good sized conditioner tube.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from Vidal Sassoon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to have Vidal Sassoon himself color your hair, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color is a combination of all and more.</li>
            <li>and I love the two step treatment.</li>
            <li>It was refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I was for sure they forgot the dye in my bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft &amp; the color is beautiful with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I love the results it was easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>The product was super easy to apply and washed out nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have found a favorite brand, and I can tell a huge difference between this and others.  </li>
            <li>I posted a more detailed review on my blog at [...] ...</li>
            <li>The product was easy to apply with the brush, and a spot check by my daughter confirmed that I was able to cover all the roots this way.</li>
            <li>It was easy and kind of fun to use the brush.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon Salonist is a little more work than one step hair colors so may not be best for a beginner</li>
            <li>It was an easy, relaxing process.    </li>
            <li>VS has easy to follow instructions for how to apply the color correctly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use, and everything you need is right there conveniently in the box for you.</li>
            <li>Being able to mix the product and spread it on with a brush makes a huge difference as opposed to squirting color on top of your hair and hoping you&#x27;ve hit all of the right places.</li>
            <li>I also am a huge fan of the after color conditioner they give you.</li>
            <li>I received this product free through BzzAgent and Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product free to test out for the company.  </li>
            <li>I received this free from Vidal Sassoon to test and review.  </li>
            <li>I also got this dye for free with a coupon the company sent to those who signed up...</li>
            <li>I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist to try for free from Vidal Sassoon.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample.</li>
            <li>I did actually enjoy the 2 step process for this hair dye.</li>
            <li>I am a Bzzagent and received this product free from Vidal Sassoon, but I will not let that affect the quality of my review.  </li>
            <li>I will start with that I recieved this product as a free sample from Vidal Sassoon Salonist.</li>
            <li>I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist 5/3 Medium Gold Brown permanent hair color to review the product free from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>so I am comfortable using these types of products.</li>
            <li>I received this product Free to try from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>It was such an easy process and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>I never could get the nice even color that I wanted with normal at home hair color</li>
            <li>The end results are healthy looking hair that is the same color from root to end while still showing many dimensions and having tons of shine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used their hair colour before, so I was excited to put it to the test.</li>
            <li>The colour was rich and my hair was all one shade again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their kit is unique, it comes with a colorist brush and has a two-step process for coloring.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, that rarely ever happens!</li>
            <li>Also, the scent of the product is fairly friendly.</li>
            <li>I opened up the box and found all that I needed including a bowl for mixing, a brush, color activation lotion, gloves, rich color creme, VS serum, and a generous tube of color preserving conditioner.</li>
            <li>your hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>The only plus side was it had a somewhat pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>so this is the perfect solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;The whole process only took about 45 minutes and was explained very well.</li>
            <li>My greys are really resistant to most hair colouring kits.</li>
            <li>really love how much hair colour is provided in this kit.</li>
            <li>Whole box used for my just below shoulder length hair..if your hair is longer I suggest 2 boxes :)</li>
            <li>My color looked so saturated and full of depth.  </li>
            <li>and I probaby will take a shortcut next time but results were good.</li>
            <li>Also, it really was an enjoyable process.    </li>
            <li>I can say my hair did feel good afterward, so I may try one of the VS one step colors in the future.</li>
            <li>and I found it pretty easy to mix the tube and bottle and apply to my crown.</li>
            <li>hair colour was pretty easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that the smell was pleasant &amp; not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was a bit put off by the odor, but the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li>That was a huge plus who wants to smell chemical for 35/45 min.</li>
            <li>The process was simple to do on your own and everything you need was included.  </li>
            <li>Natural and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I have colored my own hair at home several times.  </li>
            <li>Just used this and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>The product did a much better job of coloring my greys and my hair was so soft after coloring, not like the competition.  </li>
            <li>But after brushing my roots, I felt much more secure in what I was doing, even though it seemed an extra step.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon Salonist turned my gray into shiny brown  highlights, and the rest of my hair is a yummy golden brown.  </li>
            <li>Received the Vidal Sassoon permanent hair color complimentary to try and review.</li>
            <li>After rinsing out my hair felt noticeably soft more than normal!!!</li>
            <li>I knew right away</li>
            <li>This product is amazing The application mix is bit different but the coverage is so much better than regular hair dye.</li>
            <li>I believe that if I had left the dye in longer it probably would have been more effective, but there were no instructions in the box stating that if you had a different color dye already in your hair to leave it in longer.</li>
            <li>and it tingles a little (in a good, fresh way).</li>
            <li>the two step process from Vidal Sassoon was simple and easy to follow love my new hair color.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 step process for roots &amp; ends because it left my hair with a good, even color from top to bottom and none of the normal &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; I usually have.</li>
            <li>although there are more steps than other at home kits, the directions were pretty easy to follow.</li>
            <li>With the special conditioner, my hair felt super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Weeks later &amp; the color is still very nice &amp; I still have lots of shine left.</li>
            <li>It makes so much more sense to treat the ends differently than you would the roots, especially if your roots are mostly gray like mine are.</li>
            <li>It was a two step process, you do your roots first, then the rest of your head like a salon.</li>
            <li>This box had more than enough for me.</li>
            <li>We followed the directions and colored first her roots, then the rest of her hair, waited the required time, used the serum, and then waited again.</li>
            <li>First I applied the product to my roots and let it set.</li>
            <li>I got it all on and followed the instructions exactly, but the two-step process resulted in two-tone hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, no matter how many times you run your fingers through your hair, you can still miss a clump or section of hair and have to redo the entire color again (which stresses damaged hair).</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a 2-step hair color.</li>
            <li>The result is a great color with little smell and very soft hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the conditioner was nice &amp; left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been coloring my own hair for years, and I was curious and a little excited to hear about the unique two-step process, I thought I would create a more polished, professional result.</li>
            <li>This is more than worth the money since it barely cost more than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; home hair color and much less than a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>This kit does have you shampoo after coloring, which I found unusual, but I much prefer it!  </li>
            <li>It is a two step-process because you do as a real salonist does and first treat the roots</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box the number of items felt a little intimidating but after reading the directions I became more confident I could manage the brush and bowl, which is premarked for ease of use because you have to save some of your first mixture to make the second mixture.</li>
            <li>I used the medium golden brown by Vidal Sasson and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would have provided this.  </li>
            <li>prouting out (my hair grows fast).</li>
            <li>I am always a fan of companies that give back to us consumers and can offer free products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Color!  </li>
            <li>I also really like that they make you shampoo after coloring.</li>
            <li>When I went to rinse it out, I became very worried.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who colors there hair.</li>
            <li>I also learned that the formula would be mixed in a bowl like in the salon, which kind of scared me because of the potential of it being messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used hair coloring products for years to change my look and more lately to cover some gray and I honestly think this is far better in its results than any brand I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Even though it may cost a bit more than other at home kits</li>
            <li>It takes a little more time and work than cheaper brands but the results are worthy it and your hair will look like a professional handled it.</li>
            <li>, I have a head of grey, fine hair at 37, almost 38.</li>
            <li>These products have to meet certain criteria to make it into the shopping cart: since I have several allergies, I always have to watch out for those allergens first, as well as being aware of scents--and then there&#x27;s the longevity of the product.</li>
            <li>or you hadn&#x27;t dyed it in a long time, but neither of those fit my situation.    </li>
            <li>I usually go to a salon supply store and get my own stuff.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a Salonist Permanent Haircolor Kit courtesy of Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind though, as you&#x27;re most likely not a professional, you may not have straight lines when parting sections of your hair to get to the roots.</li>
            <li>my shoulders now so I would highly suggest 2 boxes of hair color</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The 2 step simple process gave me Salon quality coverage and deep, rich color!  </li>
            <li>It takes a little more effort than the standard bottle, but I found it was worth it.</li>
            <li>love the results of this hair color and long lasting power.</li>
            <li>When it dried, I was really pleased.</li>
            <li>those boxed hair dyes normally do.</li>
            <li>The gloves are way nicer than what you normally get in hair color</li>
            <li>The second step was easy enough as well, applying the product with my hands throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>When purchasing hair color I look for proper coverage, the right shade of color, and safety for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Mixing the product was easy, the smell was a little strong but by no means extreme or lingering.</li>
            <li>and I was up for trying something new.</li>
            <li>The directions were very clear.  </li>
            <li>The step-by-step instructions were very clear.</li>
            <li>I found that while it did take a little extra time, it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a plus that they give you enough to last for up to 6 more applications too.</li>
            <li>mixing was pretty simple</li>
            <li>I usually do not like box colors.</li>
            <li>There were instructions to check out the website for different directions if it&#x27;s your first time dying your hair</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of hair color in the past.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use a special extra conditioning agent after dying and that saves on the overall cost of DIY coloring.</li>
            <li>Mainly, I&#x27;m happy because it blended my roots which were beginning to look pretty bad.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try it as I had my hair a color I really enjoyed (dark red)</li>
            <li>I used medium intense red and that is exactly what i got all my hair took the red not just roots like alot of dyes do.</li>
            <li>The only greys that were showing are the new ones sprouting out (my hair grows fast).</li>
            <li>Only difference was, unlike a salon, my hair came out soft, smooth, and shiny rather than dry, damaged and crunchy.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t make a mess next time :)</li>
            <li>I just need to work on my application technique so I don&#x27;t make a mess next time :)</li>
            <li>But it certainly is enhanced from the VS basic coloring kit.</li>
            <li>more dull.  </li>
            <li>This by far exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, my skepticism was completely unfounded.  </li>
            <li>It made it look so natural.  </li>
            <li>Professional kit and colour lasts longer.</li>
            <li>But this one is lasting and has moisturized my hair so much.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks it has still felt soft and the color has kept.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m that sensitive), but not Vidal Sassoon Salonist.  </li>
            <li>and I really appreciate there&#x27;s enough for 6 weekly treatments</li>
            <li>I chose medium golden brown and the brown outshines the golden (which usually turns my hair a funky red).</li>
            <li>When it came time to rinse, it was also a nice surprise that it did so easily, not like other products that take forever to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I was not sure about the 2-step process, but it is just fine.  </li>
            <li>First of all it is easier to use than you think it will be, second you get the same color from root to tip</li>
            <li>Lots of low and high lights in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new dye job as I had roots showing from my last dye job and greys around my temple.</li>
            <li>I am usually very sensitive &amp; can tell even days later that I dyed my hair, but not with this.  </li>
            <li>It is an easy - to - follow process in the same amount of time as the usual color at home kits.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with a few splatter spots on the floor and walls, so make sure to be really careful when applying and have some wet cloths ready to wipe up any drips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looked shiny and felt so soft and manageable like it does after the salon jobs I have had in the last.</li>
            <li>I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair to try and bring her bleached hair and roots back to her natural color.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about doing the coloring in two parts: first the roots, and then the shaft of the hair, but</li>
            <li>and sometimes I barely have enough to cover my hair.</li>
            <li>It was not a single color but layers of different shades.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The color itself looks great!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color I have used in years!</li>
            <li> The color covered wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> This does not work for me, and I started hunting for the best at home coloring product.</li>
            <li> like I said, everything turned out wonderfully.</li>
            <li> One of the best parts of this coloring experience is that the color on the box just about matched the color on my head.</li>
            <li> I got the #VidalSassoon #Salonist hair coloring in Medium Gold Brown and achieved excellent salon coloring results.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Because I was so impressed with Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> Now that was impressive.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair color 5/3 was perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for YEARS and as store bought colors go, this was a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> It smelled very good when applied.</li>
            <li> The results were incredible.  </li>
            <li> i used this in order to achieve an Ombre effect and it worked like a charm I absolutely loved the shine and the colors blended perfectly</li>
            <li> All in all, we are very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing and conditioning, my hair felt great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This was a great experience from start to finish.</li>
            <li> Haircolor is great.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my hair even though it didn&#x27;t turn out the color it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m extremely happy with the result and process.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the results were amazing and my haircolor was beautiful!</li>
            <li> I was getting the best coloring product available for the at-home market.</li>
            <li> Some have been good while others have been equivalent to nightmares.</li>
            <li> my daughter commented on how good it smelled, and it did.  </li>
            <li> It felt so good.  </li>
            <li> but I loved it and will not hesitate to use it again.</li>
            <li> I even got compliments from a hairstylist I know who asked what I used on my hair because it looked so good.</li>
            <li> Great color and easy to do by myself at home!</li>
            <li> Even though I did not like using the two-step process on myself, I am more than happy to purchase this again to use on my two daughters.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect hair color for me and it is not ridiculously expensive like salon treatments.</li>
            <li> the quality is nice plus there are always coupons for it in the paper</li>
            <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color from the brand for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be nice if the package includes 2 pairs of gloves.  </li>
            <li> The dye itself was thicker &amp; very easy to put on &amp; the brush &amp; bowl that came with the kit</li>
            <li> made it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair coloring system for free through Bzz Agent!</li>
            <li> My nose, which is bipolar, can&#x27;t handle anything too strong, but it holds its own while I&#x27;m using VS products.</li>
            <li> I received a free Sample of this and was so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of being able to afford a salon color every 4 weeks</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and immediately made my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> You do need to use a colour safe shampoo, which is NOT provided in the kit.</li>
            <li> By the time I put it on the roots, most of my hair had dye on it.  </li>
            <li> This dye washed out better &amp; faster than any</li>
            <li> and I used most of the product.</li>
            <li> I would say that anyone with hair below the shoulders get more than one kit.</li>
            <li> When we unboxed the kit I was pleasantly surprised to see good quality gloves, a mixing tray, application brush, the developer, color, VS serum and a good sized conditioner tube.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Vidal Sassoon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to have Vidal Sassoon himself color your hair, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color is a combination of all and more.</li>
            <li> and I love the two step treatment.</li>
            <li> It was refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I was for sure they forgot the dye in my bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft &amp; the color is beautiful with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I love the results it was easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li> The product was super easy to apply and washed out nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have found a favorite brand, and I can tell a huge difference between this and others.  </li>
            <li> I posted a more detailed review on my blog at [...] ...</li>
            <li> The product was easy to apply with the brush, and a spot check by my daughter confirmed that I was able to cover all the roots this way.</li>
            <li> It was easy and kind of fun to use the brush.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist is a little more work than one step hair colors so may not be best for a beginner</li>
            <li> It was an easy, relaxing process.    </li>
            <li> VS has easy to follow instructions for how to apply the color correctly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to use, and everything you need is right there conveniently in the box for you.</li>
            <li> Being able to mix the product and spread it on with a brush makes a huge difference as opposed to squirting color on top of your hair and hoping you&#x27;ve hit all of the right places.</li>
            <li> I also am a huge fan of the after color conditioner they give you.</li>
            <li> I received this product free through BzzAgent and Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product free to test out for the company.  </li>
            <li> I received this free from Vidal Sassoon to test and review.  </li>
            <li> I also got this dye for free with a coupon the company sent to those who signed up...</li>
            <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist to try for free from Vidal Sassoon.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample.</li>
            <li> I did actually enjoy the 2 step process for this hair dye.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzzagent and received this product free from Vidal Sassoon, but I will not let that affect the quality of my review.  </li>
            <li> I will start with that I recieved this product as a free sample from Vidal Sassoon Salonist.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist 5/3 Medium Gold Brown permanent hair color to review the product free from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> so I am comfortable using these types of products.</li>
            <li> I received this product Free to try from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It was such an easy process and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I never could get the nice even color that I wanted with normal at home hair color</li>
            <li> The end results are healthy looking hair that is the same color from root to end while still showing many dimensions and having tons of shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used their hair colour before, so I was excited to put it to the test.</li>
            <li> The colour was rich and my hair was all one shade again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their kit is unique, it comes with a colorist brush and has a two-step process for coloring.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, that rarely ever happens!</li>
            <li> Also, the scent of the product is fairly friendly.</li>
            <li> I opened up the box and found all that I needed including a bowl for mixing, a brush, color activation lotion, gloves, rich color creme, VS serum, and a generous tube of color preserving conditioner.</li>
            <li> your hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> The only plus side was it had a somewhat pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> so this is the perfect solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;The whole process only took about 45 minutes and was explained very well.</li>
            <li> My greys are really resistant to most hair colouring kits.</li>
            <li> really love how much hair colour is provided in this kit.</li>
            <li> Whole box used for my just below shoulder length hair..if your hair is longer I suggest 2 boxes :)</li>
            <li> My color looked so saturated and full of depth.  </li>
            <li> and I probaby will take a shortcut next time but results were good.</li>
            <li> Also, it really was an enjoyable process.    </li>
            <li> I can say my hair did feel good afterward, so I may try one of the VS one step colors in the future.</li>
            <li> and I found it pretty easy to mix the tube and bottle and apply to my crown.</li>
            <li> hair colour was pretty easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that the smell was pleasant &amp; not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit put off by the odor, but the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li> That was a huge plus who wants to smell chemical for 35/45 min.</li>
            <li> The process was simple to do on your own and everything you need was included.  </li>
            <li> Natural and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have colored my own hair at home several times.  </li>
            <li> Just used this and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> The product did a much better job of coloring my greys and my hair was so soft after coloring, not like the competition.  </li>
            <li> But after brushing my roots, I felt much more secure in what I was doing, even though it seemed an extra step.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Salonist turned my gray into shiny brown  highlights, and the rest of my hair is a yummy golden brown.  </li>
            <li> Received the Vidal Sassoon permanent hair color complimentary to try and review.</li>
            <li> After rinsing out my hair felt noticeably soft more than normal!!!</li>
            <li> I knew right away</li>
            <li> This product is amazing The application mix is bit different but the coverage is so much better than regular hair dye.</li>
            <li> I believe that if I had left the dye in longer it probably would have been more effective, but there were no instructions in the box stating that if you had a different color dye already in your hair to leave it in longer.</li>
            <li> and it tingles a little (in a good, fresh way).</li>
            <li> the two step process from Vidal Sassoon was simple and easy to follow love my new hair color.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 step process for roots &amp; ends because it left my hair with a good, even color from top to bottom and none of the normal &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; I usually have.</li>
            <li> although there are more steps than other at home kits, the directions were pretty easy to follow.</li>
            <li> With the special conditioner, my hair felt super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Weeks later &amp; the color is still very nice &amp; I still have lots of shine left.</li>
            <li> It makes so much more sense to treat the ends differently than you would the roots, especially if your roots are mostly gray like mine are.</li>
            <li> It was a two step process, you do your roots first, then the rest of your head like a salon.</li>
            <li> This box had more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions and colored first her roots, then the rest of her hair, waited the required time, used the serum, and then waited again.</li>
            <li> First I applied the product to my roots and let it set.</li>
            <li> I got it all on and followed the instructions exactly, but the two-step process resulted in two-tone hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, no matter how many times you run your fingers through your hair, you can still miss a clump or section of hair and have to redo the entire color again (which stresses damaged hair).</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a 2-step hair color.</li>
            <li> The result is a great color with little smell and very soft hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the conditioner was nice &amp; left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my own hair for years, and I was curious and a little excited to hear about the unique two-step process, I thought I would create a more polished, professional result.</li>
            <li> This is more than worth the money since it barely cost more than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; home hair color and much less than a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> This kit does have you shampoo after coloring, which I found unusual, but I much prefer it!  </li>
            <li> It is a two step-process because you do as a real salonist does and first treat the roots</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box the number of items felt a little intimidating but after reading the directions I became more confident I could manage the brush and bowl, which is premarked for ease of use because you have to save some of your first mixture to make the second mixture.</li>
            <li> I used the medium golden brown by Vidal Sasson and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would have provided this.  </li>
            <li> prouting out (my hair grows fast).</li>
            <li> I am always a fan of companies that give back to us consumers and can offer free products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Color!  </li>
            <li> I also really like that they make you shampoo after coloring.</li>
            <li> When I went to rinse it out, I became very worried.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who colors there hair.</li>
            <li> I also learned that the formula would be mixed in a bowl like in the salon, which kind of scared me because of the potential of it being messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used hair coloring products for years to change my look and more lately to cover some gray and I honestly think this is far better in its results than any brand I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Even though it may cost a bit more than other at home kits</li>
            <li> It takes a little more time and work than cheaper brands but the results are worthy it and your hair will look like a professional handled it.</li>
            <li> , I have a head of grey, fine hair at 37, almost 38.</li>
            <li> These products have to meet certain criteria to make it into the shopping cart: since I have several allergies, I always have to watch out for those allergens first, as well as being aware of scents--and then there&#x27;s the longevity of the product.</li>
            <li> or you hadn&#x27;t dyed it in a long time, but neither of those fit my situation.    </li>
            <li> I usually go to a salon supply store and get my own stuff.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a Salonist Permanent Haircolor Kit courtesy of Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though, as you&#x27;re most likely not a professional, you may not have straight lines when parting sections of your hair to get to the roots.</li>
            <li> my shoulders now so I would highly suggest 2 boxes of hair color</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The 2 step simple process gave me Salon quality coverage and deep, rich color!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little more effort than the standard bottle, but I found it was worth it.</li>
            <li> love the results of this hair color and long lasting power.</li>
            <li> When it dried, I was really pleased.</li>
            <li> those boxed hair dyes normally do.</li>
            <li> The gloves are way nicer than what you normally get in hair color</li>
            <li> The second step was easy enough as well, applying the product with my hands throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> When purchasing hair color I look for proper coverage, the right shade of color, and safety for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Mixing the product was easy, the smell was a little strong but by no means extreme or lingering.</li>
            <li> and I was up for trying something new.</li>
            <li> The directions were very clear.  </li>
            <li> The step-by-step instructions were very clear.</li>
            <li> I found that while it did take a little extra time, it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a plus that they give you enough to last for up to 6 more applications too.</li>
            <li> mixing was pretty simple</li>
            <li> I usually do not like box colors.</li>
            <li> There were instructions to check out the website for different directions if it&#x27;s your first time dying your hair</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of hair color in the past.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use a special extra conditioning agent after dying and that saves on the overall cost of DIY coloring.</li>
            <li> Mainly, I&#x27;m happy because it blended my roots which were beginning to look pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try it as I had my hair a color I really enjoyed (dark red)</li>
            <li> I used medium intense red and that is exactly what i got all my hair took the red not just roots like alot of dyes do.</li>
            <li> The only greys that were showing are the new ones sprouting out (my hair grows fast).</li>
            <li> Only difference was, unlike a salon, my hair came out soft, smooth, and shiny rather than dry, damaged and crunchy.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t make a mess next time :)</li>
            <li> I just need to work on my application technique so I don&#x27;t make a mess next time :)</li>
            <li> But it certainly is enhanced from the VS basic coloring kit.</li>
            <li> more dull.  </li>
            <li> This by far exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, my skepticism was completely unfounded.  </li>
            <li> It made it look so natural.  </li>
            <li> Professional kit and colour lasts longer.</li>
            <li> But this one is lasting and has moisturized my hair so much.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks it has still felt soft and the color has kept.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m that sensitive), but not Vidal Sassoon Salonist.  </li>
            <li> and I really appreciate there&#x27;s enough for 6 weekly treatments</li>
            <li> I chose medium golden brown and the brown outshines the golden (which usually turns my hair a funky red).</li>
            <li> When it came time to rinse, it was also a nice surprise that it did so easily, not like other products that take forever to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about the 2-step process, but it is just fine.  </li>
            <li> First of all it is easier to use than you think it will be, second you get the same color from root to tip</li>
            <li> Lots of low and high lights in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new dye job as I had roots showing from my last dye job and greys around my temple.</li>
            <li> I am usually very sensitive &amp; can tell even days later that I dyed my hair, but not with this.  </li>
            <li> It is an easy - to - follow process in the same amount of time as the usual color at home kits.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a few splatter spots on the floor and walls, so make sure to be really careful when applying and have some wet cloths ready to wipe up any drips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looked shiny and felt so soft and manageable like it does after the salon jobs I have had in the last.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair to try and bring her bleached hair and roots back to her natural color.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about doing the coloring in two parts: first the roots, and then the shaft of the hair, but</li>
            <li> and sometimes I barely have enough to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> It was not a single color but layers of different shades.  </li>
            <li> The only minor downside I would see is that I do have fairly short (a reverse bob) hair</li>
            <li> The color is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> My color was flat and not really natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be messier this way, but in fact, I found that I was touching up &amp;#34;out-of-the-line&amp;#34; messes far less while applying.</li>
            <li> It also covered my grey roots without a problem.</li>
            <li> Since I have been trying to cover grey hair since I was 18</li>
            <li> The one question I do have for the manufacturer is how long to leave the color on for resistant greys.</li>
            <li> It did not cover all of my grey either.</li>
            <li> The process is different from other at home coloring products.  </li>
            <li> She likes that it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair with an orangish tint like other brands of the same color do.  </li>
            <li> (I started showing grey hair at 14!)</li>
            <li> I do plan in the future on trying their other one-step hair dye products on myself.  </li>
            <li> I use two mirrors set up in my bathroom to see the back of my head and after only a few minutes using the brush to part and apply colorant to the roots became easier as I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I began using Vidal Sassoon box coloring on my hair because I had been using a cheaper at home system and it did not stay in my hair for the full length of time, plus it faded pretty badly before the 28 days was up.</li>
            <li> Applying the first step with the brush was way too difficult, even with my short hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean we are talking gloves, a bowl, a brush and the hair coloring products which were clearly marked.</li>
            <li> Mixing the product was not easy, it did not want to mix well and took a lot of time to get it incorperated properly.</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair you may need an extra box though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the second process was a little runny so be careful of that.</li>
            <li> I usually use  revlon colorsilk because of the price point and specific color I have been using since well</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if the results would be different from my usual brand.</li>
            <li> I received this through BzzAgent and was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for a few years to cover the grey.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> No funny dye marks on my head.  </li>
            <li> was a little intimidated about trying this since I usually just use the standard one step hair color</li>
            <li> When I first mixed it up the chemical smell was bad like every hair dye, but it didn&#x27;t stick around.  </li>
            <li> Usually hair dye will only cover them for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with the only negative:  </li>
            <li> Where was the dark color all over the shower walls?  </li>
            <li> IF you have thick hair or longer than shoulder length for proper coverage.</li>
            <li> It did take longer than your typical boxed hair dye</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not sure the color will last, I usually don&#x27;t buy it, but</li>
            <li> I thought it would have helped to have a friend do the back of my head, it was a little complicated to do the roots application in back.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was it seemed like an unnecessary step as my hair is so short!  </li>
            <li> And cleaning the color off your skin afterwards is a snap, unlike other coloring products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I did not have any trouble understanding anything.  </li>
            <li> Then I got out and dried my hair with a towel.  </li>
            <li> I found the mixture to be a little too runny, messy and hard to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean typical hair dye tingle/burn.  </li>
            <li> I figured that at the worst, it&#x27;ll just be a shade of brown that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with</li>
            <li> After all, it&#x27;s the end result that matters, not the alien spaceship in-between times.</li>
            <li> Every hair dye in the past has burned my scalp and my eyes</li>
            <li> It evened out past hair dye boo boos, and made my hair look twenty years healthier.  </li>
            <li> I feel the two-step process was rather arduous and produced less favorable results than an easier, one-step color.</li>
            <li> The brush was hard to use and I had to get help with it.</li>
            <li> I mean tingle like peppermint and menthol tingle.  </li>
            <li> For this reason I was a little skeptical trying Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Color.  </li>
            <li> I have never really had a bad experience</li>
            <li> When I washed out the dye and used the conditioner provided in the box, my hair did feel a little straw-like but wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with this product.</li>
            <li> I found the 2 step application to be difficult to do and understand.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>

            <li> I received a free Sample of this and was so glad I did!  The 2 step simple process gave me Salon quality coverage and deep, rich color!  The process was simple to do on your own and everything you need was included.  Definitely a product I would use again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#VidalSassoon, #Salonist, #GotItFree #Sponsored</li>
            <li> This by far exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;I was a little intimidated about trying this since I usually just use the standard one step hair color but I am so glad I did! It was such an easy process and the results are amazing! I love the 2 step process for roots &amp; ends because it left my hair with a good, even color from top to bottom and none of the normal &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; I usually have. It makes so much more sense to treat the ends differently than you would the roots, especially if your roots are mostly gray like mine are. I never could get the nice even color that I wanted with normal at home hair color and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of being able to afford a salon color every 4 weeks so this is the perfect solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;The whole process only took about 45 minutes and was explained very well. The end results are healthy looking hair that is the same color from root to end while still showing many dimensions and having tons of shine! It looks and feels wonderful. I also am a huge fan of the after color conditioner they give you. It smells amazing and immediately made my hair feel silky smooth. Definitely a plus that they give you enough to last for up to 6 more applications too. This is more than worth the money since it barely cost more than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; home hair color and much less than a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> I received this product free through BzzAgent and Vidal Sassoon. It was a two step process, you do your roots first, then the rest of your head like a salon. Only difference was, unlike a salon, my hair came out soft, smooth, and shiny rather than dry, damaged and crunchy. I love this product</li>
            <li> love the results of this hair color and long lasting power.</li>
            <li> I usually use  revlon colorsilk because of the price point and specific color I have been using since well FOREVER. I used the medium golden brown by Vidal Sasson and was pleasantly surprised. It smelled very good when applied. That was a huge plus who wants to smell chemical for 35/45 min. After rinsing out my hair felt noticeably soft more than normal!!! Another plus. However my hair was at mid chin to&lt;br /&gt;Shoulder length and has grown to&lt;br /&gt;Below my shoulders now so I would highly suggest 2 boxes of hair color IF you have thick hair or longer than shoulder length for proper coverage. I did receive this product free to test out for the company.  I would definitely give this product another try to see if it&#x27;s a keeper or not. Even though it may cost a bit more than other at home kits the quality is nice plus there are always coupons for it in the paper and you don&#x27;t have to use a special extra conditioning agent after dying and that saves on the overall cost of DIY coloring.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist from Vidal Sassoon to try out. I&#x27;ve never used their hair colour before, so I was excited to put it to the test. I was in need of a new dye job as I had roots showing from my last dye job and greys around my temple. My greys are really resistant to most hair colouring kits. Usually hair dye will only cover them for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I learned that this hair colour was the same formula that was used in salons, I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if the results would be different from my usual brand. I also learned that the formula would be mixed in a bowl like in the salon, which kind of scared me because of the potential of it being messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixing was pretty simple and I found it pretty easy to mix the tube and bottle and apply to my crown. After 20 minutes, it is time to add a serum packed to your mixture to apply all over. I found the mixture to be a little too runny, messy and hard to apply without making a mess. I ended up with a few splatter spots on the floor and walls, so make sure to be really careful when applying and have some wet cloths ready to wipe up any drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how much hair colour is provided in this kit. I have longer hair and sometimes I barely have enough to cover my hair. This box had more than enough for me. If you have long, thick hair you may need an extra box though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair colour was pretty easy to rinse out. You do need to use a colour safe shampoo, which is NOT provided in the kit. I really wish they would have provided this.  They did provide a colour preserving conditioner though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and conditioning, my hair felt great. When it dried, I was really pleased. My hair looked shiny and felt so soft and manageable like it does after the salon jobs I have had in the last. The colour was rich and my hair was all one shade again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks, my greys were still covered. The only greys that were showing are the new ones sprouting out (my hair grows fast). This hair colour is a keeper. I would highly recommend the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour. I will be buying this again in the future. I just need to work on my application technique so I don&#x27;t make a mess next time :)prouting out (my hair grows fast). This hair colour is a keeper. I would highly recommend the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair colour. I will be buying this again in the future. I just need to work on my application technique so I don&#x27;t make a mess next time :)</li>
            <li> I received this free from Vidal Sassoon to test and review.  I really thought the two step system would be too much trouble.  I found that while it did take a little extra time, it was very easy to use.  My only complaint was it seemed like an unnecessary step as my hair is so short!  By the time I put it on the roots, most of my hair had dye on it.  The dye itself was thicker &amp; very easy to put on &amp; the brush &amp; bowl that came with the kit made it very easy to use.  I was very surprised that the smell was pleasant &amp; not harsh at all.  This dye washed out better &amp; faster than any I have ever used.  I had no residual run off days later &amp; no &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; smell after the initial application.  I am usually very sensitive &amp; can tell even days later that I dyed my hair, but not with this.  The smell of the conditioner was nice &amp; left my hair very soft.  Weeks later &amp; the color is still very nice &amp; I still have lots of shine left.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a Salonist Permanent Haircolor Kit courtesy of Vidal Sassoon. Their kit is unique, it comes with a colorist brush and has a two-step process for coloring. I felt like,although there are more steps than other at home kits, the directions were pretty easy to follow. I was afraid it would be messier this way, but in fact, I found that I was touching up &amp;#34;out-of-the-line&amp;#34; messes far less while applying. It takes a little more effort than the standard bottle, but I found it was worth it. The product was easy to apply with the brush, and a spot check by my daughter confirmed that I was able to cover all the roots this way. The second step was easy enough as well, applying the product with my hands throughout my hair. When it came time to rinse, it was also a nice surprise that it did so easily, not like other products that take forever to rinse out. With the special conditioner, my hair felt super soft afterwards. The color itself looks great! Natural and healthy looking. It also covered my grey roots without a problem. This product is definitely something I would purchase and use again. The only minor downside I would see is that I do have fairly short (a reverse bob) hair and I used most of the product. I would say that anyone with hair below the shoulders get more than one kit.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring with various dyes for years and none of the others compare to this one..I used medium intense red and that is exactly what i got all my hair took the red not just roots like alot of dyes do. I also got this dye for free with a coupon the company sent to those who signed up...I am always a fan of companies that give back to us consumers and can offer free products. Whole box used for my just below shoulder length hair..if your hair is longer I suggest 2 boxes :)</li>
            <li> This is hair color is different than any brand on the market!! First of all it is easier to use than you think it will be, second you get the same color from root to tip and Third your hair will be softer and silkier than it was before you colored your hair! This is the best hair color I have used in years!</li>
            <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist to try for free from Vidal Sassoon.  The product was super easy to apply and washed out nicely.  I will use this product again.  The color covered wonderfully.  My hair is shinier too.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing The application mix is bit different but the coverage is so much better than regular hair dye.</li>
            <li> I have colored my own hair at home several times.  I have never really had a bad experience but it never looked like I had it done at the salon.  My color was flat and not really natural looking.  For this reason I was a little skeptical trying Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Color.  However, my skepticism was completely unfounded.  This was a great experience from start to finish. The directions were very clear.  I did not have any trouble understanding anything.  The process is different from other at home coloring products.  You color your hair in 2 different applications, just like a salon would.    The results were incredible.  My color looked so saturated and full of depth.  It was not a single color but layers of different shades.  It made it look so natural.  I highly recommend Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Color!  I received a free sample.</li>
            <li> Professional kit and colour lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Haircolor is great.  The process is a bit painstaking and I probaby will take a shortcut next time but results were good.</li>
            <li> Just used this and so far I love it. It was easy and kind of fun to use the brush. The only thing I wish they&#x27;d consider is including two sets of gloves. Having to take used gloves off and then put them back on is a pain. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all and it tingles a little (in a good, fresh way). I also really like that they make you shampoo after coloring. This way you know the colorant is gone and your hair feels clean. I&#x27;ll definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> Great color and easy to do by myself at home!</li>
            <li> I received this box of hair coloring from Vidal Sassoon through BzzAgent. I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair to try and bring her bleached hair and roots back to her natural color. When we unboxed the kit I was pleasantly surprised to see good quality gloves, a mixing tray, application brush, the developer, color, VS serum and a good sized conditioner tube. We followed the directions and colored first her roots, then the rest of her hair, waited the required time, used the serum, and then waited again. When she rinsed, shampooed, and conditioned her hair we were ecstatic with the results! Her color was back, her hair was shiny and silky and didn&#x27;t stink. All in all, we are very pleased with the results! I will be using this again. Thank you Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent!!</li>
            <li> My mother loves this hair color.  She likes that it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair with an orangish tint like other brands of the same color do.  The color is long lasting.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received this through BzzAgent and was skeptical at first. This product exceeded my expectations.  At first, I was a bit put off by the odor, but the results are worth it!  It is an easy - to - follow process in the same amount of time as the usual color at home kits.  The product did a much better job of coloring my greys and my hair was so soft after coloring, not like the competition.  This kit does have you shampoo after coloring, which I found unusual, but I much prefer it!  I WILL be purchasing Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Color in the future. It is now my go-to!</li>
            <li> I received this product from the brand VS. I LOVE IT!!! I usually do not like box colors. I usually go to a salon supply store and get my own stuff. But this one is lasting and has moisturized my hair so much. It felt like I went and got it done at the salon. After 4 weeks it has still felt soft and the color has kept. I will be getting this product again. Finally something that works!</li>
            <li> When I used Vidal Sassoon Salonist I was hesitant to try it as I had my hair a color I really enjoyed (dark red) but my roots were growing out and I was up for trying something new. The color I was trying is Medium Gold Brown. I figured that at the worst, it&#x27;ll just be a shade of brown that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with and I&#x27;d have to dye my hair back to red.    I did actually enjoy the 2 step process for this hair dye. I believe it&#x27;s why my roots blended so well. First I applied the product to my roots and let it set. Then I applied it to the rest of my hair. I did everything in the timings stated in the instructions. It did take longer than your typical boxed hair dye but it also didn&#x27;t burn my eyes like those boxed hair dyes normally do. It was an easy, relaxing process.    When I washed out the dye and used the conditioner provided in the box, my hair did feel a little straw-like but wasn&#x27;t bad. Also, I discovered that it did not actually take out all the red that had been in my hair. It just changed the tone of red. I believe that if I had left the dye in longer it probably would have been more effective, but there were no instructions in the box stating that if you had a different color dye already in your hair to leave it in longer. There were instructions to check out the website for different directions if it&#x27;s your first time dying your hair or you hadn&#x27;t dyed it in a long time, but neither of those fit my situation.    All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my hair even though it didn&#x27;t turn out the color it was supposed to. Mainly, I&#x27;m happy because it blended my roots which were beginning to look pretty bad. Also, it really was an enjoyable process.    I received this product for free from Vidal Sassoon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my own hair for years, and I was curious and a little excited to hear about the unique two-step process, I thought I would create a more polished, professional result. Instead, after receiving the product and using it, my opinion changed. I thought it would have helped to have a friend do the back of my head, it was a little complicated to do the roots application in back. I got it all on and followed the instructions exactly, but the two-step process resulted in two-tone hair. I feel the two-step process was rather arduous and produced less favorable results than an easier, one-step color. I can say my hair did feel good afterward, so I may try one of the VS one step colors in the future. However, I would not use this product again. I am a Bzzagent and received this product free from Vidal Sassoon, but I will not let that affect the quality of my review.  #BzzAgent #VidalSassoon, #Salonist, #Sponsored #GotItFree</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I began using Vidal Sassoon box coloring on my hair because I had been using a cheaper at home system and it did not stay in my hair for the full length of time, plus it faded pretty badly before the 28 days was up. Since I have been trying to cover grey hair since I was 18 (I started showing grey hair at 14!), I have a head of grey, fine hair at 37, almost 38. This does not work for me, and I started hunting for the best at home coloring product. These products have to meet certain criteria to make it into the shopping cart: since I have several allergies, I always have to watch out for those allergens first, as well as being aware of scents--and then there&#x27;s the longevity of the product. So I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try the Vidal Sassoon Salonist hair coloring system for free through Bzz Agent! I knew right away I was getting the best coloring product available for the at-home market. But it certainly is enhanced from the VS basic coloring kit. Being able to mix the product and spread it on with a brush makes a huge difference as opposed to squirting color on top of your hair and hoping you&#x27;ve hit all of the right places. Sometimes, no matter how many times you run your fingers through your hair, you can still miss a clump or section of hair and have to redo the entire color again (which stresses damaged hair). But after brushing my roots, I felt much more secure in what I was doing, even though it seemed an extra step. By the time I added the second part of the color, I knew every hair on my head had been touched by the color! VS has easy to follow instructions for how to apply the color correctly. Keep in mind though, as you&#x27;re most likely not a professional, you may not have straight lines when parting sections of your hair to get to the roots. It&#x27;s ok! After all, it&#x27;s the end result that matters, not the alien spaceship in-between times. (I used that time to scare the children I was around!) ;)  I was a little nervous about doing the coloring in two parts: first the roots, and then the shaft of the hair, but like I said, everything turned out wonderfully. One of the best parts of this coloring experience is that the color on the box just about matched the color on my head. Let me tell you, that rarely ever happens! I chose medium golden brown and the brown outshines the golden (which usually turns my hair a funky red). The one question I do have for the manufacturer is how long to leave the color on for resistant greys. This is my biggest issue, and the reason I color. If I&#x27;m not sure the color will last, I usually don&#x27;t buy it, but like I said, I trust VS to last. :) Also, the scent of the product is fairly friendly. My nose, which is bipolar, can&#x27;t handle anything too strong, but it holds its own while I&#x27;m using VS products. And cleaning the color off your skin afterwards is a snap, unlike other coloring products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. i used this in order to achieve an Ombre effect and it worked like a charm I absolutely loved the shine and the colors blended perfectly</li>
            <li> I got the #VidalSassoon #Salonist hair coloring in Medium Gold Brown and achieved excellent salon coloring results. I opened up the box and found all that I needed including a bowl for mixing, a brush, color activation lotion, gloves, rich color creme, VS serum, and a generous tube of color preserving conditioner. It is a salon in a box and contained everything to turn my hair into a work of art. The step-by-step instructions were very clear. It is a two step-process because you do as a real salonist does and first treat the roots and then separately do the lengths. After you rinse it out, you shampoo and use the color preserving conditioner. It takes a little more time and work than cheaper brands but the results are worthy it and your hair will look like a professional handled it. If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to have Vidal Sassoon himself color your hair, this is the next best thing. I have used hair coloring products for years to change my look and more lately to cover some gray and I honestly think this is far better in its results than any brand I have used in the past.  #Sponsored #GotItFree from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color from the brand for my honest review and opinion. I have used many brands of hair color in the past. Some have been good while others have been equivalent to nightmares. When purchasing hair color I look for proper coverage, the right shade of color, and safety for my hair and scalp. Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent Hair Color is a combination of all and more. It gave my roots and hair the type of coverage I was looking for and I love the two step treatment. It is the perfect hair color for me and it is not ridiculously expensive like salon treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for a few years to cover the grey.  This product is excellent.  I was not sure about the 2-step process, but it is just fine.  The result is a great color with little smell and very soft hair.  I&#x27;d be nice if the package includes 2 pairs of gloves.  Other than that, I&#x27;m extremely happy with the result and process.</li>
            <li> I posted a more detailed review on my blog at [...] ...I&#x27;ll start off with the only negative:  I didn&#x27;t like the two-step process.  Applying the first step with the brush was way too difficult, even with my short hair.  If I had a helper it would have been easier.  When I first mixed it up the chemical smell was bad like every hair dye, but it didn&#x27;t stick around.  As I walked through the house my daughter commented on how good it smelled, and it did.  But here&#x27;s the kicker, and whoever thought of this is a genius -it tingled.  I don&#x27;t mean typical hair dye tingle/burn.  I mean tingle like peppermint and menthol tingle.  It felt so good.  Every hair dye in the past has burned my scalp and my eyes (I&#x27;m that sensitive), but not Vidal Sassoon Salonist.  It was refreshing.  When I went to rinse it out, I became very worried.  Where was the dark color all over the shower walls?  It wasn&#x27;t there.  Did it work?  Then I got out and dried my hair with a towel.  Where was the dye on the towel?  I was for sure they forgot the dye in my bottle.  That was until I looked in the mirror and blow-dried my hair.  Then I was saying, \\&quot;Where&#x27;s all the gray?\\&quot;  Vidal Sassoon Salonist turned my gray into shiny brown  highlights, and the rest of my hair is a yummy golden brown.  It evened out past hair dye boo boos, and made my hair look twenty years healthier.  I have never before used a hair dye that created such depth of color -no more dull.  Even though I did not like using the two-step process on myself, I am more than happy to purchase this again to use on my two daughters. Because I was so impressed with Vidal Sassoon I do plan in the future on trying their other one-step hair dye products on myself.  I have found a favorite brand, and I can tell a huge difference between this and others.  Oh ya, how did they make the hair dye stick so well to my hair, but it didn&#x27;t stick to my skin?  No funny dye marks on my head.  Now that was impressive. #VidalSassoon #Salonist #Sponsoredive. #VidalSassoon #Salonist #Sponsored</li>

Received the Vidal Sassoon permanent hair color complimentary to try and review. I recommend this product to others. overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will start with that I recieved this product as a free sample from Vidal Sassoon Salonist. I was not impressed at all with this product. I found the 2 step application to be difficult to do and understand. Mixing the product was not easy, it did not want to mix well and took a lot of time to get it incorperated properly. The brush was hard to use and I had to get help with it. It did not cover all of my grey either. The only plus side was it had a somewhat pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a 2-step hair color. I received a box of Vidal Sassoon Salonist 5/3 Medium Gold Brown permanent hair color to review the product free from Vidal Sassoon. I&#x27;ve been using different  hair coloring products for 20 years so I am comfortable using these types of products. When I first opened the box the number of items felt a little intimidating but after reading the directions I became more confident I could manage the brush and bowl, which is premarked for ease of use because you have to save some of your first mixture to make the second mixture. Mixing the product was easy, the smell was a little strong but by no means extreme or lingering. I use two mirrors set up in my bathroom to see the back of my head and after only a few minutes using the brush to part and apply colorant to the roots became easier as I got the hang of it. The gloves are way nicer than what you normally get in hair color but when the directions said take them off &amp; set aside to use again in step 2, I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to happen. I did have to get another pair of gloves to finish up. The conditioner smells great and I really appreciate there&#x27;s enough for 6 weekly treatments, that gets you to your next coloring! I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It&#x27;s soft &amp; the color is beautiful with a healthy shine. Lots of low and high lights in my hair. Vidal Sassoon Salonist is a little more work than one step hair colors so may not be best for a beginner but I loved it and will not hesitate to use it again.</li>
            <li> I received this product Free to try from BzzAgent. I have been coloring my hair for YEARS and as store bought colors go, this was a great product!!! I found it very easy to use, and everything you need is right there conveniently in the box for you. I mean we are talking gloves, a bowl, a brush and the hair coloring products which were clearly marked. My only complaint was that the second process was a little runny so be careful of that. Otherwise, the results were amazing and my haircolor was beautiful! I even got compliments from a hairstylist I know who asked what I used on my hair because it looked so good. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who colors there hair. If you want salon results without the salon price, this is the product for you!!!</li>
