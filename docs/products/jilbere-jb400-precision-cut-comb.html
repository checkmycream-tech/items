            <li>I use this to cut my mother&#x27;s hair and it does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for adding layers Andy extending time between salon visits.</li>

            <li>This is great because I can use this at home as I need it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome :)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how good the product is because it never got here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>this razor/thinner was amazing.</li>
            <li>so when I cut my bangs with this, it looks nice</li>
            <li>I threw it away and bought a decent pair of shears, which work perfectly.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is a good value for the money paid for it!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>With the price, you can&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>There are many razors on Ebay with replaceable razors.</li>
            <li>I like this for the most part.</li>
            <li>Love this comb, I won&#x27;t be getting haircuts so often now.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with how easy it makes putting some soft layers into my hair.</li>
            <li>makes thinning out your hair incredibly easy.</li>
            <li>Does a great job with personal hair cuts but is not resharpenable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also designed with smooth edges so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin the way others have.</li>
            <li>company is more interested in how the reviews look rather than fix any</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to control and cuts right through.</li>
            <li>I have very bulky hair, which means I need to visit the hair stylsts more often just to get my hair trimmed every 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>but I love this product so much I wanted to write an amazon review for it.</li>
            <li>I can keep my sides, bangs, and neck nice and short and pixied.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>cut my hair with just this ;D</li>
            <li>I first saw this comb at my daughter&#x27;s house, I tried it</li>
            <li>the fine-tooth comb on the handle is great for combing out any cut hairs, and as long as you don&#x27;t push too hard against your hair you&#x27;re reasonably safe from chopping it all off accidentally.</li>
            <li>They are very nice, however, do not stay sharp long, but I like</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the reminder because now I have it, I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>Easy use of a razor without any sharp objects to harm anyone!</li>
            <li>So far NOTHING!</li>
            <li>I bought several to keep them on hand when they start to pull too much.  </li>
            <li>I use to evenly cut the hair on the back on my head and places I cant really see with a mirror.</li>
            <li>I can get both smooth cuts and choppy layered looks too with this comb.</li>
            <li>She has straight Asian hair and wears it in a pixie cut.</li>
            <li>But the first one I had lasted several years so I expect the same of this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise testing it out first on less visible hair, you&#x27;d be surprised by how efficient it can be with a bit of pressure.</li>
            <li>I have no training as a hair stylist, but this comb actually yields professional looking results.</li>
            <li>and you can really shave off a lot of hair if you aren&#x27;t careful, but it works in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Just use slowly and gently to avoid taking out too much hair at once.</li>

            <li> Then I got an email from NewvoBeauty on the 14th of Aug. 2011, saying they would send me a new one at no cost if I took down my review</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit well over the contours of my head, weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist or anything</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair in a pixie cut and this would barely cut my hair at all.</li>

            <li> First, I got the wrong item.</li>
            <li> I also use this on myself between salon visits because my hair grows faster on one side my head than the other.</li>
            <li> Since you cannot replace the razor blade, I will definitely buy another one, when the blades start to dull.</li>
            <li> So I took it down.</li>
            <li> it was very sharp and even came with step by step on how to cut your hair</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still sharp and I&#x27;ve used it at least 5 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order another one just to keep on hand when this one becomes dull.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you may end up with weird uneven layers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for over a year and a half now, this comb is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Others I have tried catch and pull my hair rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the price is right.  I would buy this again without question.  If y</li>
            <li> I have very bulky hair, which means I need to visit the hair stylsts more often just to get my hair trimmed every 4-6 weeks.  With this tool, I can reduce my visits to the hair salons by thinning my hair at home in between haircuts.  I really like it.  It is a disapoble one. With the price, you can&#x27;t ask for more.  There are many razors on Ebay with replaceable razors. I just ordered one but havn&#x27;t used yet.  Overal, it is a valuable product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job with personal hair cuts but is not resharpenable.  It is a throw away after about 8 or 10 uses.  I bought several to keep them on hand when they start to pull too much.  I still like them.</li>
            <li> Well. Where do I start? First, I got the wrong item. Said so in a review. Then I got an email from NewvoBeauty on the 14th of Aug. 2011, saying they would send me a new one at no cost if I took down my review, I would also get a refund. So I took it down. So far NOTHING! It&#x27;s the 30th of Aug. today.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how good the product is because it never got here.&lt;br /&gt;The company, LIES!!!&lt;br /&gt;This company is more interested in how the reviews look rather than fix any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If NewvoBeauty reads this: Did you think I was just going to forget? You had to know when you lied to me I was going to post a neg. review (that will be staying) about this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for adding layers Andy extending time between salon visits.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a store but I love this product so much I wanted to write an amazon review for it. I&#x27;ve had mine since January or so and it&#x27;s May now. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for over a year and a half now, this comb is a life saver. I use to evenly cut the hair on the back on my head and places I cant really see with a mirror. I can get both smooth cuts and choppy layered looks too with this comb. It&#x27;s so simple. There is a little bit of a learning curve but once you figure out how you want to use it the sky is the limit (:</li>
            <li> Not the longest-lasting razor, but inexpensive and I&#x27;m happy with how easy it makes putting some soft layers into my hair. Just use slowly and gently to avoid taking out too much hair at once.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my mother&#x27;s hair and it does a beautiful job. She has straight Asian hair and wears it in a pixie cut. I have no training as a hair stylist, but this comb actually yields professional looking results. I also use this on myself between salon visits because my hair grows faster on one side my head than the other. My hair is coarse and wavy. Since you cannot replace the razor blade, I will definitely buy another one, when the blades start to dull.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair in a pixie cut and this would barely cut my hair at all. It didn&#x27;t fit well over the contours of my head, weird, I know. I threw it away and bought a decent pair of shears, which work perfectly.</li>
            <li> if you have a lion&#x27;s mane of hair like me, you&#x27;ll be wondering where this tool has been all your life. makes thinning out your hair incredibly easy. the fine-tooth comb on the handle is great for combing out any cut hairs, and as long as you don&#x27;t push too hard against your hair you&#x27;re reasonably safe from chopping it all off accidentally. I&#x27;d advise testing it out first on less visible hair, you&#x27;d be surprised by how efficient it can be with a bit of pressure.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Do yourself a favor and watch a youtube video on the look you are trying to achieve before you use it. Otherwise you may end up with weird uneven layers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Pulls hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, I use it on my dog !!!!</li>
            <li> I like this for the most part. It doesn&#x27;t do the job a stylist would do obviously and you can really shave off a lot of hair if you aren&#x27;t careful, but it works in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist or anything so when I cut my bangs with this, it looks nice but when it grows out, it&#x27;s not growing in the way I would like it to.     great product though! It&#x27;s still sharp and I&#x27;ve used it at least 5 times. Easy use of a razor without any sharp objects to harm anyone!</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and am so happy to find it again. Others I have tried catch and pull my hair rather than cutting it. This one is easy to control and cuts right through. It&#x27;s also designed with smooth edges so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin the way others have. Only wish the blades could be replaced. But the first one I had lasted several years so I expect the same of this one.</li>
            <li> Love this comb, I won&#x27;t be getting haircuts so often now.  I have a short, pixie hairdo and this is just what the doctor ordered.  I can keep my sides, bangs, and neck nice and short and pixied.  I&#x27;ll order another one just to keep on hand when this one becomes dull.  I use it almost every day and I look like I just stepped out of the salon.  This is great because I can use this at home as I need it and I won&#x27;t have to make appointments and wait for haircuts.  This is a Godsend!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It works very well and is a good value for the money paid for it!</li>
            <li> Husband uses it and has not been to a barber in over a year.......if you are careful; you can save money and get a professional looking haircut.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Like having two blade choices in one comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome xD&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair with just this ;D it&#x27;s awesome :)&lt;br /&gt;I get friends who even ask me to do their hair ^*^</li>
            <li> PRACTICE MAKES USING THIS TOOL WELL WORTH LEARNING THE TECHNIQUES.  SAVE AT THE SALON IN BETWEEN VISITS!  TRY ONE, YOU&#x27;LL AGREE.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this comb for quite a while. I first saw this comb at my daughter&#x27;s house, I tried it and I loved it. I finally got around to purchasing it after having it in my cart for a couple of weeks. Thanks for the reminder because now I have it, I&#x27;ve used it and I still love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are very nice, however, do not stay sharp long, but I like&lt;br /&gt;them anyway</li>
            <li> this razor/thinner was amazing. it was very sharp and even came with step by step on how to cut your hair</li>
