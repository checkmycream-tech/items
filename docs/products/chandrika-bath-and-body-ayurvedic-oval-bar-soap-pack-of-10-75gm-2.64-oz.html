            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Everyone of my family and many of my friends and their family now also swear by this fragrant, ayurvedic soap.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling soap but has a more masculine aroma.</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance, vegan and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li>i love this product my husband turned me on to it, my skin feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping, great price all around.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first order of this soap, I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not always that easy to find.</li>
            <li>I make a point to rinse it off my face very quickly to limit the drying there.</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>Strong but not overpowering patchouli scent.</li>
            <li>although it is plant based, i do not recommend for kiddos, it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave too strong a smell on your skin, so</li>
            <li>Tried and true; fantastic soap!</li>
            <li>The soap, just as a soap, without wanting a scent, is fine.</li>
            <li>Huge difference in quality and smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased here, at Amazon, from this seller, is the genuine item I have purchased in person at retail stores.</li>
            <li>Buy in bulk to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>has a great lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Its smell is just wonderful, fresh, green, yet somehow slightly exotic.</li>
            <li>A ten pack is a great way to buy.</li>
            <li>It has been cheapened: Too many crappy ingredients; not enough of the good oils it used to have.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the real deal, or else it is the best knock-off of anything I have seen.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic (my bathroom is nearly always scented with Chandrika), the lather is wonderful, soft, and full while also rinsing off easily.</li>
            <li>and I really like the nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>With poor water pressure there (and most of the time, bucket baths), Chandrika was wonderful because it rinsed off so easily.</li>
            <li>leaves the skin feeling fresh and is PH balanced!</li>
            <li>I add that to a 5 gallon bucket with 1/2 cup borax powder, 1 cup of washing powder, and fill it to the top with hot tap water.</li>
            <li>Small bars, but excellent.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy service!</li>
            <li>and I like the clean scent.</li>
            <li>this soap is drying, however it leaves you clean and smelling yummy.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this soap to anybody who loves to smell clean to purchase this.</li>
            <li>It leaves you clean without being overly drying.</li>
            <li>jasmine scented and smells so clean.  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell which stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair smelled amazing and soft.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and leaves a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, sort of like an outdoor pine-type scent.</li>
            <li>I especially love to have it now when I travel to areas with hard water because its great lather is not affected like other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the spicy exotic scent, but be warned that it is very strong, and not necessarily to the tastes of people who normally use &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and leaves me feeling cleaner than any other soap I have used.</li>
            <li>Rather, it is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t go wrong if you like wonderful, exotic, aromatic scents.</li>
            <li>QUICK, TIMELY DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>How many times will a company keep changing the formula to a lesser quality and charge more $?</li>
            <li>Just a quick bath will make you feel like a guru.</li>
            <li>I first met this lovely soap for the first time in India and really do like it lots as it leaves my skin clean and smooth without chemicals.</li>
            <li>you very much for this product!</li>
            <li>It does have a rather strong scent; the whole bathroom smells like it whenever there is a bar in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for boys, give it a try.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap we will use from now own.  </li>
            <li>Someone more knowledgeable than me will likely be able to explain why this is, as the soap has a very distinctive odor, but one that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin beyond the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was pricey with shipping and handling but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite soap of all time....</li>
            <li>Its nice to find it at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>My skin does not typically &amp;#34;hold the scent&amp;#34; of most soaps for longer than an hour or so, but that&#x27;s not the case when using Chandrika.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the original.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on other reviews being so good.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this soap just has a very mild fragrance, and although not unpleasant, nothing like the strong fragrance that I loved.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter has eczema and this soap is mild enough for her.  </li>
            <li>The first picture shows the soap I wanted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every liquid and bar soap available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure what I got wasn&#x27;t the same soap.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I am ordering a 10 pack because my husband and I just love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I am most likely going to return it.</li>
            <li>From simple Wal-Mart type to boutique soaps that were nearly ten dollars per bar, I could not find one that I loved.</li>
            <li>Other than the smell, it did seem to clean well and was pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li>I do go through Chandrika bars pretty quickly, but at such a reasonable price, to me it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a clean feeling like no other soap without drying the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is truly a fantastic soap of which I cannot say enough.</li>
            <li>My wife made me throw out the whole lot.  </li>
            <li>have also used it in my homemade laundry detergent and it works really well for that, as well.</li>
            <li>Excellents, high quality product!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a film like most other soaps, really cleans the skin.</li>
            <li>It controls the oil on my face better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased this soap from the local health food store, and loved the strong incense-like smell (I don&#x27;t know what the actual fragrance is called).  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap because of the raving review and they are well deserved, I love the soap, the scent is very relaxing and it cleans very well but not by stripping you raw.</li>
            <li>Small bar, but lasts a considerably long time, lots of lather and great price.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly</li>
            <li>Suggestion however, it will get soft and melt away easy if you dont put it in a draining type of soap dish to let it dry between showers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the only soap I use</li>
            <li>Then not too long ago I decided to see if I could possibly find the old soap that I liked and it was still around and apparently had been all along.</li>
            <li>It is mosquito season where I live</li>
            <li>If the ingredients are not translated in English, you might not notice that along with a lot of wonderful essential oils, the major ingredient is caustic soda (lye).</li>
            <li>Only drawback is its proneness to leave residue in bathtub which rinses clean easily enough</li>
            <li>This soap is my ultimate favorite but the price goes up and down like a yoyo.</li>
            <li>My husband turned me on to it about 10 years ago when we were dating and now it&#x27;s the only soap my (adult) son uses, he&#x27;s got a mild to medium case of eczema and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has bad eczema and this alleviated most of his issues.  </li>
            <li>My teenage boys really like to shower with this soap.</li>
            <li>Ingredients: Sodium cocoate, water, sodium palmate, glycerine, talc, paraffin, wax, perfume, orange oil, patchouli oil, palmarosa oil, cinnamon leaf oil, wild ginger oil, lime peel oil, colour.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients are non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>Basically, so far I haven&#x27;t discovered any negatives about Chandrika.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>price/ quick shipping/ not readily available where I live.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t go to waste as I can use it as sachets and give as gifts since each bar is in a nice little box.</li>
            <li>i am completely addicted to this soap and buy it in bulk from amazon &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I can now use this soap to wash my face (have always used expensive facial cleansers because I have sensitive skin and break out easily), also, I have had to use a feminine wash for the last 30 years because all soaps I have tried make my skin bleed in my feminine area, but this is the first soap I have tried that does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li>I tried this soap for the first time a few years ago after developing a rash using a different soap.  </li>

            <li> Wonderful fragrance, vegan and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> i love this product my husband turned me on to it, my skin feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping, great price all around.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first order of this soap, I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not always that easy to find.</li>
            <li> I make a point to rinse it off my face very quickly to limit the drying there.</li>
            <li> Strong smell</li>
            <li> Strong but not overpowering patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> although it is plant based, i do not recommend for kiddos, it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave too strong a smell on your skin, so</li>
            <li> Tried and true; fantastic soap!</li>
            <li> The soap, just as a soap, without wanting a scent, is fine.</li>
            <li> Huge difference in quality and smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased here, at Amazon, from this seller, is the genuine item I have purchased in person at retail stores.</li>
            <li> Buy in bulk to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> has a great lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Its smell is just wonderful, fresh, green, yet somehow slightly exotic.</li>
            <li> A ten pack is a great way to buy.</li>
            <li> It has been cheapened: Too many crappy ingredients; not enough of the good oils it used to have.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real deal, or else it is the best knock-off of anything I have seen.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic (my bathroom is nearly always scented with Chandrika), the lather is wonderful, soft, and full while also rinsing off easily.</li>
            <li> and I really like the nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> With poor water pressure there (and most of the time, bucket baths), Chandrika was wonderful because it rinsed off so easily.</li>
            <li> leaves the skin feeling fresh and is PH balanced!</li>
            <li> I add that to a 5 gallon bucket with 1/2 cup borax powder, 1 cup of washing powder, and fill it to the top with hot tap water.</li>
            <li> Small bars, but excellent.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy service!</li>
            <li> and I like the clean scent.</li>
            <li> this soap is drying, however it leaves you clean and smelling yummy.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap to anybody who loves to smell clean to purchase this.</li>
            <li> It leaves you clean without being overly drying.</li>
            <li> jasmine scented and smells so clean.  </li>
            <li> Very nice smell which stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair smelled amazing and soft.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and leaves a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, sort of like an outdoor pine-type scent.</li>
            <li> I especially love to have it now when I travel to areas with hard water because its great lather is not affected like other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the spicy exotic scent, but be warned that it is very strong, and not necessarily to the tastes of people who normally use &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and leaves me feeling cleaner than any other soap I have used.</li>
            <li> Rather, it is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong if you like wonderful, exotic, aromatic scents.</li>
            <li> QUICK, TIMELY DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> How many times will a company keep changing the formula to a lesser quality and charge more $?</li>
            <li> Just a quick bath will make you feel like a guru.</li>
            <li> I first met this lovely soap for the first time in India and really do like it lots as it leaves my skin clean and smooth without chemicals.</li>
            <li> you very much for this product!</li>
            <li> It does have a rather strong scent; the whole bathroom smells like it whenever there is a bar in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for boys, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap we will use from now own.  </li>
            <li> Someone more knowledgeable than me will likely be able to explain why this is, as the soap has a very distinctive odor, but one that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin beyond the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was pricey with shipping and handling but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite soap of all time....</li>
            <li> Its nice to find it at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> My skin does not typically &amp;#34;hold the scent&amp;#34; of most soaps for longer than an hour or so, but that&#x27;s not the case when using Chandrika.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the original.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews being so good.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this soap just has a very mild fragrance, and although not unpleasant, nothing like the strong fragrance that I loved.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter has eczema and this soap is mild enough for her.  </li>
            <li> The first picture shows the soap I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every liquid and bar soap available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure what I got wasn&#x27;t the same soap.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am ordering a 10 pack because my husband and I just love this soap.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I am most likely going to return it.</li>
            <li> From simple Wal-Mart type to boutique soaps that were nearly ten dollars per bar, I could not find one that I loved.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell, it did seem to clean well and was pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li> I do go through Chandrika bars pretty quickly, but at such a reasonable price, to me it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a clean feeling like no other soap without drying the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is truly a fantastic soap of which I cannot say enough.</li>
            <li> My wife made me throw out the whole lot.  </li>
            <li> have also used it in my homemade laundry detergent and it works really well for that, as well.</li>
            <li> Excellents, high quality product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a film like most other soaps, really cleans the skin.</li>
            <li> It controls the oil on my face better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased this soap from the local health food store, and loved the strong incense-like smell (I don&#x27;t know what the actual fragrance is called).  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap because of the raving review and they are well deserved, I love the soap, the scent is very relaxing and it cleans very well but not by stripping you raw.</li>
            <li> Small bar, but lasts a considerably long time, lots of lather and great price.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly</li>
            <li> Suggestion however, it will get soft and melt away easy if you dont put it in a draining type of soap dish to let it dry between showers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only soap I use</li>
            <li> Then not too long ago I decided to see if I could possibly find the old soap that I liked and it was still around and apparently had been all along.</li>
            <li> It is mosquito season where I live</li>
            <li> If the ingredients are not translated in English, you might not notice that along with a lot of wonderful essential oils, the major ingredient is caustic soda (lye).</li>
            <li> Only drawback is its proneness to leave residue in bathtub which rinses clean easily enough</li>
            <li> This soap is my ultimate favorite but the price goes up and down like a yoyo.</li>
            <li> My husband turned me on to it about 10 years ago when we were dating and now it&#x27;s the only soap my (adult) son uses, he&#x27;s got a mild to medium case of eczema and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has bad eczema and this alleviated most of his issues.  </li>
            <li> My teenage boys really like to shower with this soap.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Sodium cocoate, water, sodium palmate, glycerine, talc, paraffin, wax, perfume, orange oil, patchouli oil, palmarosa oil, cinnamon leaf oil, wild ginger oil, lime peel oil, colour.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients are non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> Basically, so far I haven&#x27;t discovered any negatives about Chandrika.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> price/ quick shipping/ not readily available where I live.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t go to waste as I can use it as sachets and give as gifts since each bar is in a nice little box.</li>
            <li> i am completely addicted to this soap and buy it in bulk from amazon &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I can now use this soap to wash my face (have always used expensive facial cleansers because I have sensitive skin and break out easily), also, I have had to use a feminine wash for the last 30 years because all soaps I have tried make my skin bleed in my feminine area, but this is the first soap I have tried that does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time a few years ago after developing a rash using a different soap.  </li>
            <li> Well, at least not unless you put it right under your nose.</li>
            <li> Not a strong, perfume-type scent, but a gentle, herbal-type scent.  </li>
            <li> the only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it on face regularly as it can dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this for $7 a bar from a local new age shop of 40 years.</li>
            <li> Only thing I can say bad about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other soap bars that you can buy and is more expensive than many regular soaps.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, lye is a strong base and can help balance the pH of skin.</li>
            <li> Wish it made me smell like it all day long.</li>
            <li> As other one-star reviewers have noted, this is not the same soap that it used to be.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I have found is that even though my skin is slightly on the oily side of the scale, long term use can dry my skin out in some settings.</li>
            <li> My excema has been under control ever since I started using this as well, which previously had been a constant issue for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any indication that they&#x27;re different than what I&#x27;ve normally purchased, so I&#x27;d recommend this seller over others, since some have been shady in the past.</li>
            <li> Package left the boxes slightly crushed and they were slightly moist, but hey, it&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and wonder if that is part of the problem since it doesn&#x27;t seem to rinse completely.  </li>
            <li> The box, green, marble-esque color, square-shape, lather, scent and lasting scent on your skin are identical to me.</li>
            <li> I spent a year of college in India and used Chandrika soap while I lived there.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the soap looks (green bar with sharp corners) and works the same.</li>
            <li> They produce a  ton of suds when used with a wash clothe, yet seem to last at least as long if not longer than any &#x27;hand made&#x27; or specialty soaps.</li>
            <li> I live in such a small conservative town which makes it very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Pity!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my skin is softer and clearer than with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bar is small so between my husband and myself sharing, it only lasts about 10 days.</li>
            <li> This soap is not the same as the one I&#x27;ve purchased in the past at stores.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging was crushed on half the boxes, and the date of manufacture on them was 2010.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it dries my already dry skin too much (4 stars) and leaves it feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t like them well enough to continue using them for longer than a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smell slightly of citrus, and ginger, with slight hints of sandalwood, all day.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a typical soap then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I dilute it half and half with water before use.)</li>
            <li> It has half or less of the scent it had 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Slightly drying</li>
            <li> but it has a slight odor that is reminscent of moth balls?</li>
            <li> I guess I could have investigated a little</li>
            <li> It also keeps eczema outbreaks at bay and dries them up within a few days rather than weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with skin irritation.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I heard they removed the sandalwood,  </li>
            <li> I am pissed I wasted $ on 8 bars of this.</li>
            <li> Its not filled with crap and the smell is all natural from essential oils.</li>
            <li> Both flavors of this soap, although small in size, are really firm and do not turn into mush.</li>
            <li> mosquito bites were less irritating and fewer mosquitoes have been biting me.&lt;br /&gt;An average of 3-4 bites per day...down from 15+ bites per day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why or how...</li>
            <li> Now I hardly smell anything.</li>
            <li> Let it sit at least overnight before use.</li>
            <li> However, it was difficult to turn down 10 bars for $14.</li>
            <li> It lathers up so ridiculously bubbly.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try Amazon since it was much less expensive.</li>
            <li> At least this way there is no need for a separate odor eliminator!</li>
            <li> I figured they changed the recipe (for the worse) and I gave up on the product.</li>
            <li> I personally hate soaps that have been made to last forever</li>
            <li> Also, these little bars lather like crazy!  </li>
            <li> I am prone to athlete&#x27;s foot (and other nasty fungal infestations)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just a tad &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; but still has that definitive scent of India.  Fragrant soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  Recommend seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 10 years.  It&#x27;s great for my skin and I like the clean scent.</li>
            <li> Amazon search led me to believe this was a neem oil product.  It is not.</li>
            <li> What i received is the original s.v. products chandrika rectangular cake soap that works and smells so good</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Even if it were not an amazing soap, (which it is), it smells so clean and fresh just sitting in the soap dish that it is a great room freshener.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As other one-star reviewers have noted, this is not the same soap that it used to be. It has been cheapened: Too many crappy ingredients; not enough of the good oils it used to have. The great smell is gone and it leaves your skin itchy. If you are looking for an ayurvedic soap, get something else.</li>
            <li> Tried and true; fantastic soap! My local market stopped selling it...super fast shipping, great price all around.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first order of this soap, I love it!  My grand daughter has eczema and this soap is mild enough for her.  It smells great and it was shipped fast, thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for skin that reacts to chemicals. I will re-buy it.</li>
            <li> My teenage boys really like to shower with this soap. It definitely wipes out that &amp;#34;sweaty boy smell&amp;#34; and it helps with teenage acne as well. It does have a rather strong scent; the whole bathroom smells like it whenever there is a bar in the shower. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, sort of like an outdoor pine-type scent. At least this way there is no need for a separate odor eliminator! It&#x27;s worth it for boys, give it a try.</li>
            <li> The first picture shows the soap I wanted but when I checked out I saw the sandal soap picture. The sandal soap was what was delivered and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the original. Warning to anyone wanting this it is the sandal soap and I don&#x27;t believe it is the same chandrika</li>
            <li> I have always liked the smell and feel of this lovely soap! Great price/ quick shipping/ not readily available where I live.</li>
            <li> this soap is drying, however it leaves you clean and smelling yummy.  the smell lasts.  there are no artifcle scents.  I love this product![[ASIN:B003NZFMCK Chandrika Bath Soap Ayurvedic - 75 Grams, 10 Pack]]</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap is to die for! It is the nicest smell in the world! I have been googling Chandrika perfume wondering does it come as a perfume but can find nothing.  Pity!  I buy this soap every time I come on it, it&#x27;s not always that easy to find. Only thing I can say bad about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other soap bars that you can buy and is more expensive than many regular soaps.  I don&#x27;t know why all manufacturers don&#x27;t make soap that smells like this.  Mmmmmmmmmmm!!</li>
            <li> Yes I really love this soap.This is one of my favorit purchases.I would recommend this soap to anybody who loves to smell clean to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever, especially during summer. It is great for skin problems and smells awesome. I would not recommend using it on face regularly as it can dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Great service and great product!</li>
            <li> Our favorite soap. Wonderful fragrance, vegan and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> i am completely addicted to this soap and buy it in bulk from amazon &#x3D;)  you can&#x27;t go wrong if you like wonderful, exotic, aromatic scents.</li>
            <li> NOT the soap pictured! Huge difference in quality and smell. Bummed.</li>
            <li> Not as described. I was expecting the item that was advertised but received the newer version of this soap. Not square shaped one but the oval shaped bar. Ingredients: Sodium cocoate, water, sodium palmate, glycerine, talc, paraffin, wax, perfume, orange oil, patchouli oil, palmarosa oil, cinnamon leaf oil, wild ginger oil, lime peel oil, colour.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap!  Very pleasant smell, even makes the bathroom smell nice.  Natural ingredients are non-irritating.  I can now use this soap to wash my face (have always used expensive facial cleansers because I have sensitive skin and break out easily), also, I have had to use a feminine wash for the last 30 years because all soaps I have tried make my skin bleed in my feminine area, but this is the first soap I have tried that does not irritate at all.  Now I have two extra areas in my shower!  Small bar, but lasts a considerably long time, lots of lather and great price.  This is the only soap we will use from now own.  I am reviewing the soap pictured, some people gave this soap a 1 star because they received a different soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap at a great price! Recommend highly</li>
            <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used! Doesn&#x27;t leave a film like most other soaps, really cleans the skin. I won&#x27;t use any other soap.</li>
            <li> This is my immediate family&#x27;s favorite soap, and it has spread to grandma&#x27;s household after she tried it at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of us like, or tolerate well, perfumed soaps, so there is something about the ingredients of this soap that doesn&#x27;t trigger that response in any of us, nor does it trigger the allergies of one of our dear friends who, for health reasons, can&#x27;t be around perfumes. Someone more knowledgeable than me will likely be able to explain why this is, as the soap has a very distinctive odor, but one that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin beyond the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I purchased here, at Amazon, from this seller, is the genuine item I have purchased in person at retail stores. I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it here again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on an Indiana Jones-esque search for the perfect soap for nearly ten years. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every liquid and bar soap available. From simple Wal-Mart type to boutique soaps that were nearly ten dollars per bar, I could not find one that I loved. For various reasons, whether it was skin feel, or lather amount, or scent, or lack there of, I didn&#x27;t like any of them. At least I didn&#x27;t like them well enough to continue using them for longer than a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chandrika is amazing. The scent is fantastic (my bathroom is nearly always scented with Chandrika), the lather is wonderful, soft, and full while also rinsing off easily. My skin does not typically &amp;#34;hold the scent&amp;#34; of most soaps for longer than an hour or so, but that&#x27;s not the case when using Chandrika. I smell slightly of citrus, and ginger, with slight hints of sandalwood, all day. It&#x27;s not perfume-like. Rather, it is fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve also noticed my skin is softer and clearer than with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a fantastic soap of which I cannot say enough.</li>
            <li> This a very traditional soap. Strong smell and it doesn&#x27;t have a moisturizer, so if you&#x27;re looking for a typical soap then this is not for you. My husband loves this soap for what it is.</li>
            <li> Purchased July of 2015&lt;br /&gt;New packaging, and smells like paint remover. Very disappointed. I&#x27;m sure what I got wasn&#x27;t the same soap.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am ordering a 10 pack because my husband and I just love this soap.  Its not filled with crap and the smell is all natural from essential oils.</li>
            <li> My wife made me throw out the whole lot.  She said it makes me smell like a hippie.  I kinda have to agree.  Other than the smell, it did seem to clean well and was pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Gentle on the skin and leaves a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real deal, or else it is the best knock-off of anything I have seen. The box, green, marble-esque color, square-shape, lather, scent and lasting scent on your skin are identical to me. I usually buy this for $7 a bar from a local new age shop of 40 years. However, it was difficult to turn down 10 bars for $14. I am going to start giving these away to everyone willing to experience what I consider the best soap around. You can immediately feel your pores shrinking upon rinsing off and the smell is superb. It also keeps eczema outbreaks at bay and dries them up within a few days rather than weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for this product!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great service, great price.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As advertised. Package left the boxes slightly crushed and they were slightly moist, but hey, it&#x27;s soap. I don&#x27;t see any indication that they&#x27;re different than what I&#x27;ve normally purchased, so I&#x27;d recommend this seller over others, since some have been shady in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap thinking it was a neem oil soap. It is mosquito season where I live and I heard that neem oil has insect repellant properties and has beneficial health properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this isn&#x27;t a neem oil soap, it worked as I intended.&lt;br /&gt;My mosquito bites were less irritating and fewer mosquitoes have been biting me.&lt;br /&gt;An average of 3-4 bites per day...down from 15+ bites per day.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Buy in bulk to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap! Smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on the skin.</li>
            <li> best soap ever.  it lathers a lot, so the only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  has a great lasting smell.</li>
            <li> The soap is wonderful and was very fresh. It&#x27;s a joy to know I can order it from Amazon..</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING SOAP. HEALTHY. FRAGRANCE. QUICK, TIMELY DELIVERY. I WANT TO HUG THE SELLER AND THE MAKER.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Smells amazing!  Cleans well with great lather.  Bar is small so between my husband and myself sharing, it only lasts about 10 days. 12 pack is convenient to have a supply on hand.  Fast, easy service!</li>
            <li> leaves the skin feeling fresh and is PH balanced!</li>
            <li> great product, smells nice......but that&#x27;s a subjective thing</li>
            <li> Smells different, but it lathers great and makes your skin feel, oh so good!</li>
            <li> Great soap! I ordered the soap and thought it would be the same as what&#x27;s pictured but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Strong but not overpowering patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  And the service is the best!!!</li>
            <li> i love this product my husband turned me on to it, my skin feels fabulous. although it is plant based, i do not recommend for kiddos, it is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews being so good.  The soap is of wonderful quality, lovely fragrance and lathers well. It is very refreshing to bathe with. Unfortunately, it dries my already dry skin too much (4 stars) and leaves it feeling tight.  I have hard water and wonder if that is part of the problem since it doesn&#x27;t seem to rinse completely.  It won&#x27;t go to waste as I can use it as sachets and give as gifts since each bar is in a nice little box.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. It lathers up so ridiculously bubbly. My son&#x27;s use it for their hair, it lathers that well. It smells amazing. It leaves you clean without being overly drying. I buy this soap again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it in my homemade laundry detergent and it works really well for that, as well. (I grate 2 bars of soap and melt it in boiling water. I add that to a 5 gallon bucket with 1/2 cup borax powder, 1 cup of washing powder, and fill it to the top with hot tap water. Let it sit at least overnight before use. I dilute it half and half with water before use.)</li>
            <li> My favorite soap--great to find online!</li>
            <li> This soap is my ultimate favorite but the price goes up and down like a yoyo. Believe me it&#x27;s almost double the price on amazon vs another merchant. I still order it on here when I have a gift card. Excellent product for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I have used it for years. Very refreshing and effective.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided to try it.  Love the scent.  Leaves my shower smelling great too</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap and don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to get good lather</li>
            <li> Both flavors of this soap, although small in size, are really firm and do not turn into mush. They produce a  ton of suds when used with a wash clothe, yet seem to last at least as long if not longer than any &#x27;hand made&#x27; or specialty soaps. Plus it leaves a pleasant scent on the hands or face.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, and I find the sandalwood healing.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap in the world since the seventies.  And still so cheap!  Its smell is just wonderful, fresh, green, yet somehow slightly exotic.</li>
            <li> Really good soap, no animal products, foams great and awesome smell . Only drawback is its proneness to leave residue in bathtub which rinses clean easily enough</li>
            <li> Best Ayurvedic soap in the market so far. Very nice smell which stays for a long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! ...The formula has changed and it smells like chemical s***....my favorite soap is ruined...RIP Chandrika</li>
            <li> This soap smells heavenly.  The service was A+.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chandrika a lot but then I ordered some (a different item, not this one) and it was a completely different soap than I had always gotten. I figured they changed the recipe (for the worse) and I gave up on the product. I guess I could have investigated a little but , hey, its just soap... Then not too long ago I decided to see if I could possibly find the old soap that I liked and it was still around and apparently had been all along. I ordered this and it was indeed the soap that I am used to and have been using for 15 years. I like the smell though it is definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This soap is not the same as the one I&#x27;ve purchased in the past at stores. It doesn&#x27;t have them same smell. Well, at least not unless you put it right under your nose. Also, the packaging was crushed on half the boxes, and the date of manufacture on them was 2010. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why the smell was gone or what. The soap, just as a soap, without wanting a scent, is fine. But just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because of the raving review and they are well deserved, I love the soap, the scent is very relaxing and it cleans very well but not by stripping you raw. You get a lot of soap for the price. I will definitely buy it again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap, for blemishes, my teenage kids swear by it for acne. Plus it smells great...</li>
            <li> My family loves this soap. My husband turned me on to it about 10 years ago when we were dating and now it&#x27;s the only soap my (adult) son uses, he&#x27;s got a mild to medium case of eczema and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin. Of course, I like it as a facial soap too. I buy them 20 or so at a time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been showering with this soap for a year now. It leaves a clean feeling like no other soap without drying the skin. It smells wonderful, even my boyfriend is hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Found this soap in a store on a visit to Hornby Island, in Canada.  Love the spicy exotic scent, but be warned that it is very strong, and not necessarily to the tastes of people who normally use &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. A ten pack is a great way to buy. I was having trouble with skin irritation. This soap solved it. Smells great also.</li>
            <li> How many times will a company keep changing the formula to a lesser quality and charge more $? A few years ago I heard they removed the sandalwood,  now they lessened the amount of essential oils. It has half or less of the scent it had 2 years ago. The smell would linger on the skin and freshen the bathroom. Now I hardly smell anything. I am pissed I wasted $ on 8 bars of this.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time a few years ago after developing a rash using a different soap.  Oh. My. Word.  There is nothing about this soap that isn&#x27;t PERFECT for me!  I LOVE the scent.  Not a strong, perfume-type scent, but a gentle, herbal-type scent.  It doesn&#x27;t leave too strong a smell on your skin, so if you like to wear perfume, it won&#x27;t interfere.  If you don&#x27;t wear a fragrance, however, the gentle scent it does leave on the skin is very pleasant for both men and women.  I feel this soap is perfect for every member of the family.  Also, these little bars lather like crazy!  I personally hate soaps that have been made to last forever and, therefore, don&#x27;t lather well.  I do go through Chandrika bars pretty quickly, but at such a reasonable price, to me it is well worth it.  My excema has been under control ever since I started using this as well, which previously had been a constant issue for me.  Basically, so far I haven&#x27;t discovered any negatives about Chandrika.  I always try to keep plenty on hand in our home.  I encourage you to try it if you haven&#x27;t.  It may be that you&#x27;ll switch for good like I did!</li>
            <li> This soap is so fragrant I use it in all my bathrooms as a &#x27;freshener&#x27; -- jasmine scented and smells so clean.  It&#x27;s great for baths and I&#x27;ll always keep a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> One of my fav soaps. A bit drying but cleans well</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap because it cleans well and rinses well, I love it because it leaves him smelling so good</li>
            <li> Love the smell great lather and makes a great head to toe soap. My hair smelled amazing and soft.</li>
            <li> My husband has bad eczema and this alleviated most of his issues.  The soap has a nice herbally smell and is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Love it! Was pricey with shipping and handling but it was worth it. They smell is nice amd leave skin smelling nice too. It leaves my skin soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - this stuff cleans and conditions your skin. It controls the oil on my face better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance! Wish it made me smell like it all day long.</li>
            <li> Excellents, high quality product!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite soap of all time....great smell and lathers great!</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised: neatly packaged 10 pack of the best smelling soap on the planet!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling soap but has a more masculine aroma. I still love it. Slightly drying but then I apply lotion anyway.</li>
            <li> The scent of the soap has changed. I am not sure why or how...but it has a slight odor that is reminscent of moth balls? I don&#x27;t know, but I am most likely going to return it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Reminds me of the place I stayed in in Hawaii that had this soap.  It&#x27;s pretty much the only soap I use</li>
            <li> We discovered this soap while vacationing in India in 2006 and have used it since.</li>
            <li> Small bars, but excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years. Its nice to find it at such an affordable price. I live in such a small conservative town which makes it very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I spent a year of college in India and used Chandrika soap while I lived there. With poor water pressure there (and most of the time, bucket baths), Chandrika was wonderful because it rinsed off so easily. It has a great scent and leaves me feeling cleaner than any other soap I have used. I especially love to have it now when I travel to areas with hard water because its great lather is not affected like other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this soap! The only drawback I have found is that even though my skin is slightly on the oily side of the scale, long term use can dry my skin out in some settings. If the ingredients are not translated in English, you might not notice that along with a lot of wonderful essential oils, the major ingredient is caustic soda (lye). I make a point to rinse it off my face very quickly to limit the drying there. On the positive side, lye is a strong base and can help balance the pH of skin. I am prone to athlete&#x27;s foot (and other nasty fungal infestations) and I have found that they are easier to control and treat when I am using Chandrika regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells great and leaves me feeling clean. Because of the associations I have with a wonderful time in my life, it takes me to my happy place when I use it. I recommend it to everyone. Even if you don&#x27;t like it in your shower, you can leave it unwrapped in a dish and take advantage of its great scent in place of incense.</li>
            <li> Just a quick bath will make you feel like a guru.</li>
            <li> Wonderful all around soap.  Everyone of my family and many of my friends and their family now also swear by this fragrant, ayurvedic soap.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased this soap from the local health food store, and loved the strong incense-like smell (I don&#x27;t know what the actual fragrance is called).  I thought I would try Amazon since it was much less expensive. Unfortunately, this soap just has a very mild fragrance, and although not unpleasant, nothing like the strong fragrance that I loved. Otherwise, the soap looks (green bar with sharp corners) and works the same.</li>
            <li> Perfect way to stock up.</li>
            <li> Great value and I really like the nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I first met this lovely soap for the first time in India and really do like it lots as it leaves my skin clean and smooth without chemicals. Suggestion however, it will get soft and melt away easy if you dont put it in a draining type of soap dish to let it dry between showers. not a deal breaker because it is so good just a heads up. My husband likes it too and it just smells wonderful like a rich incense</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> Mu husband smells delicious!</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great smelling soap!</li>
