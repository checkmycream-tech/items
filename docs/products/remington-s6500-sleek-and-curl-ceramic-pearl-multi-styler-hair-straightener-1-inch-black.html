            <li>It came quick and the quality is great!</li>
            <li>It looks great and didn&#x27;t frizz up for the rest of the evening (although I did spray it with an anti-frizz spray to be safe).</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very satisfied</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased by its results.</li>
            <li>My best friend has a Remington straightener which I used at her house, and it worked great, so I kept it in mind when I was looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>To sum up - for the price, it is a great product and works quickly and easily to straighten my hair so very beautifully.</li>
            <li>My hair was sleek, beautiful, and smooth.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>the versatility is amazing and the price for all the benefits is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Happy the US version is available, now I&#x27;m buying that one</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li>It should be great for travelling and has a light, professional-looking design.</li>
            <li>The floating plates are nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my own fault though because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the plate overlap.</li>
            <li>For me this is a 5 STAR product, but I honestly cannot say how it would do on straightening curly hair, so I will just give it 4 stars</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice ao</li>
            <li>your hair gets stuck in it &amp; the curl isn&#x27;t as nice as the \\&quot;Conair\\</li>
            <li>But I just bought some heat protectant (TRESemme /cheap and works well), and the Remington Sleek &amp; Curl comes with a nice, handy DVD.</li>
            <li>Seriously, great job to Remington for creating the best flat iron at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>It works great and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats-up in no time and is very easy to use;</li>
            <li>and you can control the heat very easily with the dial.  </li>
            <li>The Remington made very quick work of straightening, under five minutes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is exactly what I was looking for and am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>This morning my girlfriend exclaimed after using this for two months, &amp;#34;2rd best birthday gift ever, after the Coach sunglasses last year!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>course, your love is #1...</li>
            <li>and you can fall in love with her hair again.</li>
            <li>I love this straigther.</li>
            <li>LOVE....</li>
            <li>when I use it I always get so many compliments</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have one and love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It flattens much better than my friend&#x27;s irons.  </li>
            <li>It straightens really well, and if you know how, it also gives great curls too.</li>
            <li>I have never accidentally shut this off mid-curl or mid-straighten, and I just really love the design of this straightener.</li>
            <li>And she was the one that wanted to get the cheap $10 one!</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to all.  </li>
            <li>I love the Remington \\&quot;Sleek &amp; Curl\\&quot; flat-iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for more than 2 years now, maybe even longer</li>
            <li>and I find it&#x27;s even better than most straighteners because it is curved in order to curl your hair with it.</li>
            <li>: I am still using this and love it.</li>
            <li>I  love it.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing straightener!!!</li>
            <li>I love the the straightner.</li>
            <li>For my purpose, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Since this didn&#x27;t have many reviews but was comparable to the 2\\&quot; straightener from this line (the pearl ceramic thingy), I decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li>I make sure I spray my hair with a heat-protectant spray like TreSemme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to do it too many times because I am quite paranoid about frying my hair.    </li>
            <li>I love this straightner.</li>
            <li>The shipping was reasonable and it got here in great timing.</li>
            <li>It is better than any hair stlying product I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a free replacement!</li>
            <li>Love thus straightener.</li>
            <li>Well...I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and I do love the way that it makes my hair sleek.</li>
            <li>If they had a hook where it can be hanged it would be even better</li>
            <li>I was able to get it for 25 bucks.</li>
            <li>So much love for this product.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely say that these have worked the best.</li>
            <li>Its the best Flat iron i have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I tried sooo many straighteners hoping to find one that was easy to use, actually worked well and wasn&#x27;t too pricey, and this one was perfect.</li>
            <li>Remington S6500 is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
            <li>her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it straightens her naturally wavy hair and makes it sleek, doesn&#x27;t look like trash sitting on the bathroom counter, gets her out the door faster, and makes her happy and</li>
            <li>Also, the price is amazing and it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, whenever I&#x27;m done using it, my hair is FILLED with static, regardless of the season.  </li>
            <li>good design &amp; very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It heats up really fast, and straightens my hair in about 15 minutes, which is good for before school.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly which is convenient.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to travel with (you can lock it shut with a turn of the side knob).</li>
            <li>It heats up in around 20 seconds and the temperature locks in one easy touch of a button.</li>
            <li>We could do with some practice - but they seemed quite easy.</li>
            <li>Bought this straightener about two years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I use it once in 10 days on an average, and it works perfectly for me, without doing any damage to my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I was straightening my hair and it was just fine</li>
            <li>I always used the lowest setting to 300-350 which was perfectly fine for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am for the most part pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>even if you&#x27;re only interested in straightening your hair I think this is perfect for that.</li>
            <li>I have relatively fine hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy--I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting much, but I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and can give the result very fast.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and didn&#x27;t pull my hair out, which is something I MUST have in a straightener.</li>
            <li>it glides so smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is quite light and</li>
            <li>I bought my dual-voltage version in Europe which for my purposes is fantastic because I travel quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a U.S. version was available - the one listed appears NOT to be dual-voltage.</li>
            <li>curls in the same amount of time, the lock feature is great, the locked-close feature is great, and the hold-temp feature isn&#x27;t necessary</li>
            <li>long-enough cord, smooth</li>
            <li>The straightener is light</li>
            <li>My friends and I tried curling some strands after watching the free CD.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a while, but then it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li>I liked the price, but thought that since it was so much lower that the competitor brands,</li>
            <li>so its best to hold the straightener carefully and right at the end (where it&#x27;s supposed to be held).The</li>
            <li>I am sure any other heat protectant spray will work great with this iron.</li>
            <li>Now I get excited and WANT to curl my hair whenever I go out.</li>
            <li>(: At first, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about getting one because of the fear of frying my hair and of not knowing how to use it.</li>
            <li>I have used other products which I&#x27;ve spent like $100s for and this DOES the job perfectly and on a good budget.</li>
            <li>They smooth hair quickly and hair feels silky.</li>
            <li>The sleek and curl is easy to use, very sleek and goes through my hair easily.</li>
            <li>First, the plates are long so you can do those beautiful curls and waves, no problem.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good, affordable straightener that doubles as a curler (although I&#x27;m looking into buying a separate curling iron now from</li>
            <li>Cute product, heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty easy to put curls in my hair</li>
            <li>I am done so quickly</li>
            <li>Luckily I had a warranty on it</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and make  my hair sleek and just how I want it.</li>
            <li>then i really liked the super straight result from using flat irons, so i thought \\&quot;well i should just give this one a try...\\&quot; since it&#x27;s got such great reviews and fairly cheap.  </li>
            <li>heats fast and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am guessing this one&#x27;s for serious hair-straightener users, and it would work great on curly hair (please read the reviews for more).    </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to find another one before buying a new one.</li>
            <li>not super great quality but does the job and its functional</li>
            <li>My hair is left silky and shiny, just soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Today instead of straightening I decided to work with curly and used the Remington to define curls - with much success.</li>
            <li>Rarely some hairs get caught by the edges and cut.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t still own it is because my mother took it</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly and I set the temperature to the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>and so refused to buy a flat iron since i honestly didn&#x27;t want to rip out all my hair on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without steam, a flat iron wouldn&#x27;t be effective.</li>
            <li>you have to get the right ammount of hair inside</li>
            <li>The controls are easy and at the highest temperature it can get pretty HOT - so much that my hair smoked a bit (</li>
            <li>Overall, amazing straightener that provides soft and sleek straight as well as curled hair :)</li>
            <li>The only con I have with this iron is that the plates get very hot on the sides so when your twisting it, make sure you don&#x27;t touch it otherwise</li>
            <li>So this is my first flat iron, and I payed with my own money.</li>
            <li>Nice long cord!</li>
            <li>The cheap one didn&#x27;t really work!&lt;br /&gt;After a new bold hairstyle with a lot of layers I realized I HAD to buy a flatiron</li>
            <li>So easy to move it, twist it, not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hair straightener that has really straightened my wife&#x27;s very curly hair so that the hairstyle looked excellent and preserved for a long time until the next hair washing.</li>
            <li>I use it to curl my super straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She loves it because it is slightly wider than most and high quality ceramic instead of cheap aluminum, so it gets the job done better and isn&#x27;t so much</li>
            <li>I decided to try this particular one, purely because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>Now I can have very straight and also curly hair, its up to me.</li>
            <li>Also the idea of including the CD with tutorials was very appreciated by her.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, glides smoothly through my fine hair without snagging, is adjustable (although I have never used it above 420 degrees), and has lasted me over 6 months now without any functionality issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so she can look pretty for her friends</li>
            <li>FIRST NOTE:</li>
            <li>I touched it to see if it was hot</li>
            <li>I found this one (the European version) and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Woo thanks for saving me!</li>
            <li>but i noticed it was more my fault for not positioning my hair properly.  </li>
            <li>The plastic barrel around the plates get REALLY HOT.  </li>
            <li>- The plastic barrel around the plates get REALLY HOT.  </li>
            <li>The end is not as hot</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Fahrenheit though the exact temperature is not known using U.S. voltage.</li>
            <li>no pulls, and the plate is an inch longer than standard to accommodate more hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>so if you have thicker hair, you may have to use a higher temperature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s served me really well!</li>
            <li>I love the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been really skeptical about using any hardware on my hair, but this straightener is awesome.</li>
            <li>My hair is as soft and smooth as ever, even though I use this say 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li>I love using this product to not only straighten but also curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I guess an actual curling iron may do a better job.  </li>
            <li>The plates do get hot, and so does the outer body around the plates -</li>
            <li>This is my first iron</li>
            <li>and you can also try many different styles,</li>
            <li>This works better than my former Chi did.</li>
            <li>I love the locking mechanism for storage, and the digital temp readout.  </li>
            <li>yet- mostly because my hair isn&#x27;t all that long right now.   </li>
            <li>This flat iron is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>The smoothness of this flat iron when it glides through hair is lovely.</li>
            <li>but i find this to be top notch flat iron material!  </li>
            <li>but i find this to be top notch flat iron material!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After hours and hours of research and sneaky questioning, I surprised her with this bargain priced salon quality iron to replace her cheap POS that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>but what good is that when it quits only 3 months later!</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday for the first time before work and my hair was straight the FIRST time I went over my hair.</li>
            <li>my friend&#x27;s older flat irons, this one allows my hair to glide through super easily with almost no snagging.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Since it gets really hot, you can&#x27;t really get this iron too close to your roots/ears/skin etc.  </li>
            <li>- Since it gets really hot, you can&#x27;t really get this iron too close to your roots/ears/skin etc.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I used it for the first time!</li>
            <li>the size of it is perfect for my quite thin asian hair - allows much better control for me than the heavier and larger ones i&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These babies work wonders and I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry or fry my hair because I can control the temperature setting.</li>
            <li>I was planning on spending quite a bit on each, but first i decided to try a cheap flat iron that both curls and straightens.</li>
            <li>its actually a pretty decent straightener.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used many flatiron before but of the three i&#x27;ve tried (two of which were very old and borrowed from friends), this one definitely trumps the cake.  </li>
            <li>ALSO, the heat adjusts really easy and the flat iron HEATS up in under two minutes,</li>
            <li>my Hair is so silky and straight.</li>
            <li>It straigthens my real hair and my extensions.</li>
            <li>It heats up FAST.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair already by</li>
            <li>it beeps when it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>The blue light display is a plus for this straightener.</li>
            <li>I have very curly front hair which doesn&#x27;t adorn my face at all.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The travel case is very helpful, too.</li>
            <li>heat up is really fast</li>
            <li>a fantastic product especially for what it&#x27;s designed to do.  </li>
            <li>It heats up rapidly and it indicates that is heating up with a blinking indicator and that stop blinking once it is ready</li>
            <li>The dvd is also very informative.</li>
            <li>The plates are rounded and gentle on my hair -</li>
            <li>This straightener works very well even at the lowest heat.</li>
            <li>It heats up very well</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and works well with every hair type.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this can heat all the way up to 410 (F) degrees in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think it would probably work better if you didn&#x27;t have such thick hair.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have to go over it again.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to spend too much time to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>So I have straight hair</li>
            <li>It heats up in about 30 seconds and really gets your hair straight.</li>
            <li>the video that comes with the product is very helpful too!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more expensive brands have fried my hair to the point where I experienced some extensive breakage</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so easy to use it, I have really long hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute    Other-  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low cost, performs well, and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up really quickly, and it has a little beeping sound to let you know when it has reached the desired temperature (which goes up to 450).</li>
            <li>I tried it the next day and even at 450 degrees, it was as cool as it is off.</li>
            <li>I say this because the best way to straighten your hair is to actually pull it at an angle and curve your hair a little, rather than pulling straight down.</li>
            <li>Went to Wal-mart, saw the Remington Digital Pearl flat iron, loved the color of it, but the digital aspect is what sold me on it.</li>
            <li>It worked okay but broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li>Gets warm fast, gets cold fast, I can straighten and curl my hair easily with it in no time.</li>
            <li>I debated between getting this more expensive Remington straightener and a cheaper $10 one, and I&#x27;m really glad I chose</li>
            <li>The heat is better on the Conair, and the curl is tight</li>
            <li>suppose to be all ceramic), and the highly rated HSI here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, my expectations weren&#x27;t high at all.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t appear to be damaged at all by the high heat.    </li>
            <li>highly recommend for creating shine, waves, and curling hair under at the ends.</li>
            <li>I have very fine asian hair, and noticed that even on the lowest setting 310, it&#x27;s borderline a little too hot for my hair.  </li>
            <li>; She assured me with a big smile and kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s just normal for that to happen</li>
            <li>I had done some research and prefer a tool with temp control due to my damaged fine hair.</li>
            <li>Plus, the Remington is at a fair price--not expensive like most other irons.</li>
            <li>Plus it is designed well: easy to hold and lay down,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes probably a little over 5 minutes in the morning for me to use this on my straight hair to smooth and curl my ends under.</li>
            <li>I can live without these folks.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking to buy a new straightener because the straightener/curling iron I had before</li>
            <li>Unlike the previous flat irons that I have tried, the cord-swivel feature comes in handy and keeps the power cord tangle-free.</li>
            <li>One or two passes is enough to make my hair really straight, also i noticed i can pass it through my hair quite fast too.  </li>
            <li>overall a fantastic product especially for what it&#x27;s designed to do.  </li>
            <li>My hair usually has ok days</li>
            <li>Okay so I purchased this item over a year ago and felt the need to write a review since I was on amazon viewing past purchases.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as comparing to chi, ghd, or any of the other popular brands available, I am unable to do that being as this is my first, but I won&#x27;t have to try any others because this straightener has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>But with Remington S6500, it literally takes me 15 minutes to style my whole hair (I have medium to long hair straight hair).</li>
            <li>First let me say I&#x27;m not frugal when it comes to ceramic flat irons.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re willing to pay $30 for 3 months of use get this flat iron!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to run such a large plated straightener through my hair.</li>
            <li>I totally would recomend this for any young girls that wants to do both straighten and curl.</li>
            <li>It did a terrific job and made my hair straight,probably a bit too much for my liking (I like the natural look).</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give the Remington a try and WOW.</li>
            <li>After much research, I finally decided to purchase the Remington Sleek and Curl.</li>
            <li>and i like that the buttons are completely out of the way</li>
            <li>I get far too paranoid</li>
            <li>therefore i haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my bans, and i&#x27;m far too scared to get it anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li>I get far too paranoid</li>
            <li>therefore i haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my bans, and i&#x27;m far too scared to get it anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li>all I could think was \\&quot;Wow, that was easy!\\&quot; And it made my hair shinier and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I bought this when my old straighter fried.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to cool down, which I prefer to do before clamping it shut and keeping it away.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly/kinky hair almost completely natural and these flat irons work amazing.</li>
            <li>Amika didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, the Chi made it really flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li>it even straightens my SUPER thick natural hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>but in my experience this is because the temperature is high enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I have long and straight hair and this flat-iron</li>
            <li>In comparison, I have bought, used, and RETURNED Chi flat irons because they don&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I got this out I expected to have to play with it a while to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I guess this is normal especially since I had my heat-protectant spray on.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be replacing it with a new Remington.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this to any woman that wants a quality straightner that also has a limited time to do her hair.</li>
            <li>That was the major factor for me - to find a product that would work well without ruining my hair.</li>
            <li>only thing that you must be cautious of is, (just like ANY other styling tool that gets hot) PROTECT YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li>All I know is that it does a great job, heats up in very little time, takes 8 minutes for my thick hair at two settings below the maximum (I have twice as much hair as the average girl), it straightens/</li>
            <li>When I cut my super long hair last year, I found my new short hair actually more unmanageable because, after air-drying, it would fall in weird directions</li>
            <li>I have not tried many hair straighteners in my life, maybe I don&#x27;t know what I am missing in other products, but this one fulfills all my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick hair, but I get it cut to were</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and this flat iron works magic on my hair.</li>
            <li>You definitely get HIGH quality results for a low price.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about it, but I am acutally like it better then my last one that I spent $100 on</li>
            <li>I made a mistake by reviewing this flat iron too early!</li>
            <li>As far as straighteners go, it definitely does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>I think I was more tired of that trash than</li>
            <li>The whole reason I bought another flat iron is because my Ion from Sally constantly pulled my hair when flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>It curled my uncurlable hair perfectly, never left any creases in my hair and it left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was straight, shinny and NOT frizzy like my other straighter left my hair.</li>
            <li>was pretty much broken and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it worked better than other hair straighteners I had.</li>
            <li>The other products I&#x27;ve used in the past broke too easily, while the remington is well made.</li>
            <li>and it looked like a hot mess!</li>
            <li>The T-studio was heavy and had large plates</li>
    </ol>

            <li> She&#x27;s very satisfied</li>
            <li> and she was very pleased by its results.</li>
            <li> My best friend has a Remington straightener which I used at her house, and it worked great, so I kept it in mind when I was looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> To sum up - for the price, it is a great product and works quickly and easily to straighten my hair so very beautifully.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> the versatility is amazing and the price for all the benefits is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Happy the US version is available, now I&#x27;m buying that one</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li> It should be great for travelling and has a light, professional-looking design.</li>
            <li> The floating plates are nice.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my own fault though because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the plate overlap.</li>
            <li> For me this is a 5 STAR product, but I honestly cannot say how it would do on straightening curly hair, so I will just give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice ao</li>
            <li> your hair gets stuck in it &amp; the curl isn&#x27;t as nice as the \\&quot;Conair\\</li>
            <li> But I just bought some heat protectant (TRESemme /cheap and works well), and the Remington Sleek &amp; Curl comes with a nice, handy DVD.</li>
            <li> Seriously, great job to Remington for creating the best flat iron at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> It works great and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats-up in no time and is very easy to use;</li>
            <li> and you can control the heat very easily with the dial.  </li>
            <li> The Remington made very quick work of straightening, under five minutes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is exactly what I was looking for and am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This morning my girlfriend exclaimed after using this for two months, &amp;#34;2rd best birthday gift ever, after the Coach sunglasses last year!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> course, your love is #1...</li>
            <li> and you can fall in love with her hair again.</li>
            <li> I love this straigther.</li>
            <li> LOVE....</li>
            <li> when I use it I always get so many compliments</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have one and love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It flattens much better than my friend&#x27;s irons.  </li>
            <li> It straightens really well, and if you know how, it also gives great curls too.</li>
            <li> I have never accidentally shut this off mid-curl or mid-straighten, and I just really love the design of this straightener.</li>
            <li> And she was the one that wanted to get the cheap $10 one!</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it to all.  </li>
            <li> I love the Remington \\&quot;Sleek &amp; Curl\\&quot; flat-iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for more than 2 years now, maybe even longer</li>
            <li> and I find it&#x27;s even better than most straighteners because it is curved in order to curl your hair with it.</li>
            <li> : I am still using this and love it.</li>
            <li> I  love it.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing straightener!!!</li>
            <li> I love the the straightner.</li>
            <li> For my purpose, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Since this didn&#x27;t have many reviews but was comparable to the 2\\&quot; straightener from this line (the pearl ceramic thingy), I decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li> I make sure I spray my hair with a heat-protectant spray like TreSemme&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to do it too many times because I am quite paranoid about frying my hair.    </li>
            <li> I love this straightner.</li>
            <li> The shipping was reasonable and it got here in great timing.</li>
            <li> It is better than any hair stlying product I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a free replacement!</li>
            <li> Love thus straightener.</li>
            <li> Well...I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> and I do love the way that it makes my hair sleek.</li>
            <li> If they had a hook where it can be hanged it would be even better</li>
            <li> I was able to get it for 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> So much love for this product.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely say that these have worked the best.</li>
            <li> Its the best Flat iron i have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I tried sooo many straighteners hoping to find one that was easy to use, actually worked well and wasn&#x27;t too pricey, and this one was perfect.</li>
            <li> Remington S6500 is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
            <li> her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it straightens her naturally wavy hair and makes it sleek, doesn&#x27;t look like trash sitting on the bathroom counter, gets her out the door faster, and makes her happy and</li>
            <li> Also, the price is amazing and it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, whenever I&#x27;m done using it, my hair is FILLED with static, regardless of the season.  </li>
            <li> good design &amp; very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> It heats up really fast, and straightens my hair in about 15 minutes, which is good for before school.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly which is convenient.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to travel with (you can lock it shut with a turn of the side knob).</li>
            <li> It heats up in around 20 seconds and the temperature locks in one easy touch of a button.</li>
            <li> We could do with some practice - but they seemed quite easy.</li>
            <li> Bought this straightener about two years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I use it once in 10 days on an average, and it works perfectly for me, without doing any damage to my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was straightening my hair and it was just fine</li>
            <li> I always used the lowest setting to 300-350 which was perfectly fine for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am for the most part pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> even if you&#x27;re only interested in straightening your hair I think this is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> I have relatively fine hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy--I love it.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting much, but I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and can give the result very fast.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and didn&#x27;t pull my hair out, which is something I MUST have in a straightener.</li>
            <li> it glides so smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is quite light and</li>
            <li> I bought my dual-voltage version in Europe which for my purposes is fantastic because I travel quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a U.S. version was available - the one listed appears NOT to be dual-voltage.</li>
            <li> curls in the same amount of time, the lock feature is great, the locked-close feature is great, and the hold-temp feature isn&#x27;t necessary</li>
            <li> long-enough cord, smooth</li>
            <li> The straightener is light</li>
            <li> My friends and I tried curling some strands after watching the free CD.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a while, but then it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> I liked the price, but thought that since it was so much lower that the competitor brands,</li>
            <li> so its best to hold the straightener carefully and right at the end (where it&#x27;s supposed to be held).The</li>
            <li> I am sure any other heat protectant spray will work great with this iron.</li>
            <li> Now I get excited and WANT to curl my hair whenever I go out.</li>
            <li> (: At first, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about getting one because of the fear of frying my hair and of not knowing how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used other products which I&#x27;ve spent like $100s for and this DOES the job perfectly and on a good budget.</li>
            <li> They smooth hair quickly and hair feels silky.</li>
            <li> The sleek and curl is easy to use, very sleek and goes through my hair easily.</li>
            <li> First, the plates are long so you can do those beautiful curls and waves, no problem.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good, affordable straightener that doubles as a curler (although I&#x27;m looking into buying a separate curling iron now from</li>
            <li> Cute product, heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty easy to put curls in my hair</li>
            <li> I am done so quickly</li>
            <li> Luckily I had a warranty on it</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and make  my hair sleek and just how I want it.</li>
            <li> then i really liked the super straight result from using flat irons, so i thought \\&quot;well i should just give this one a try...\\&quot; since it&#x27;s got such great reviews and fairly cheap.  </li>
            <li> heats fast and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am guessing this one&#x27;s for serious hair-straightener users, and it would work great on curly hair (please read the reviews for more).    </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to find another one before buying a new one.</li>
            <li> not super great quality but does the job and its functional</li>
            <li> My hair is left silky and shiny, just soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Today instead of straightening I decided to work with curly and used the Remington to define curls - with much success.</li>
            <li> Rarely some hairs get caught by the edges and cut.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t still own it is because my mother took it</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly and I set the temperature to the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> and so refused to buy a flat iron since i honestly didn&#x27;t want to rip out all my hair on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without steam, a flat iron wouldn&#x27;t be effective.</li>
            <li> you have to get the right ammount of hair inside</li>
            <li> The controls are easy and at the highest temperature it can get pretty HOT - so much that my hair smoked a bit (</li>
            <li> Overall, amazing straightener that provides soft and sleek straight as well as curled hair :)</li>
            <li> The only con I have with this iron is that the plates get very hot on the sides so when your twisting it, make sure you don&#x27;t touch it otherwise</li>
            <li> So this is my first flat iron, and I payed with my own money.</li>
            <li> Nice long cord!</li>
            <li> The cheap one didn&#x27;t really work!&lt;br /&gt;After a new bold hairstyle with a lot of layers I realized I HAD to buy a flatiron</li>
            <li> So easy to move it, twist it, not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> This is the first hair straightener that has really straightened my wife&#x27;s very curly hair so that the hairstyle looked excellent and preserved for a long time until the next hair washing.</li>
            <li> I use it to curl my super straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She loves it because it is slightly wider than most and high quality ceramic instead of cheap aluminum, so it gets the job done better and isn&#x27;t so much</li>
            <li> I decided to try this particular one, purely because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> Now I can have very straight and also curly hair, its up to me.</li>
            <li> Also the idea of including the CD with tutorials was very appreciated by her.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight, glides smoothly through my fine hair without snagging, is adjustable (although I have never used it above 420 degrees), and has lasted me over 6 months now without any functionality issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so she can look pretty for her friends</li>
            <li> FIRST NOTE:</li>
            <li> I touched it to see if it was hot</li>
            <li> I found this one (the European version) and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Woo thanks for saving me!</li>
            <li> but i noticed it was more my fault for not positioning my hair properly.  </li>
            <li> The plastic barrel around the plates get REALLY HOT.  </li>
            <li> - The plastic barrel around the plates get REALLY HOT.  </li>
            <li> The end is not as hot</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Fahrenheit though the exact temperature is not known using U.S. voltage.</li>
            <li> no pulls, and the plate is an inch longer than standard to accommodate more hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> so if you have thicker hair, you may have to use a higher temperature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s served me really well!</li>
            <li> I love the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really skeptical about using any hardware on my hair, but this straightener is awesome.</li>
            <li> My hair is as soft and smooth as ever, even though I use this say 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> I love using this product to not only straighten but also curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I guess an actual curling iron may do a better job.  </li>
            <li> The plates do get hot, and so does the outer body around the plates -</li>
            <li> This is my first iron</li>
            <li> and you can also try many different styles,</li>
            <li> This works better than my former Chi did.</li>
            <li> I love the locking mechanism for storage, and the digital temp readout.  </li>
            <li> yet- mostly because my hair isn&#x27;t all that long right now.   </li>
            <li> This flat iron is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> The smoothness of this flat iron when it glides through hair is lovely.</li>
            <li> but i find this to be top notch flat iron material!  </li>
            <li> but i find this to be top notch flat iron material!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After hours and hours of research and sneaky questioning, I surprised her with this bargain priced salon quality iron to replace her cheap POS that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> but what good is that when it quits only 3 months later!</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday for the first time before work and my hair was straight the FIRST time I went over my hair.</li>
            <li> my friend&#x27;s older flat irons, this one allows my hair to glide through super easily with almost no snagging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Since it gets really hot, you can&#x27;t really get this iron too close to your roots/ears/skin etc.  </li>
            <li> - Since it gets really hot, you can&#x27;t really get this iron too close to your roots/ears/skin etc.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I used it for the first time!</li>
            <li> the size of it is perfect for my quite thin asian hair - allows much better control for me than the heavier and larger ones i&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These babies work wonders and I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry or fry my hair because I can control the temperature setting.</li>
            <li> I was planning on spending quite a bit on each, but first i decided to try a cheap flat iron that both curls and straightens.</li>
            <li> its actually a pretty decent straightener.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used many flatiron before but of the three i&#x27;ve tried (two of which were very old and borrowed from friends), this one definitely trumps the cake.  </li>
            <li> ALSO, the heat adjusts really easy and the flat iron HEATS up in under two minutes,</li>
            <li> my Hair is so silky and straight.</li>
            <li> It straigthens my real hair and my extensions.</li>
            <li> It heats up FAST.  </li>
            <li> I have straight hair already by</li>
            <li> it beeps when it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> The blue light display is a plus for this straightener.</li>
            <li> I have very curly front hair which doesn&#x27;t adorn my face at all.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The travel case is very helpful, too.</li>
            <li> heat up is really fast</li>
            <li> a fantastic product especially for what it&#x27;s designed to do.  </li>
            <li> It heats up rapidly and it indicates that is heating up with a blinking indicator and that stop blinking once it is ready</li>
            <li> The dvd is also very informative.</li>
            <li> The plates are rounded and gentle on my hair -</li>
            <li> This straightener works very well even at the lowest heat.</li>
            <li> It heats up very well</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and works well with every hair type.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this can heat all the way up to 410 (F) degrees in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think it would probably work better if you didn&#x27;t have such thick hair.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have to go over it again.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to spend too much time to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> So I have straight hair</li>
            <li> It heats up in about 30 seconds and really gets your hair straight.</li>
            <li> the video that comes with the product is very helpful too!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more expensive brands have fried my hair to the point where I experienced some extensive breakage</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so easy to use it, I have really long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute    Other-  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low cost, performs well, and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up really quickly, and it has a little beeping sound to let you know when it has reached the desired temperature (which goes up to 450).</li>
            <li> I tried it the next day and even at 450 degrees, it was as cool as it is off.</li>
            <li> I say this because the best way to straighten your hair is to actually pull it at an angle and curve your hair a little, rather than pulling straight down.</li>
            <li> Went to Wal-mart, saw the Remington Digital Pearl flat iron, loved the color of it, but the digital aspect is what sold me on it.</li>
            <li> It worked okay but broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Gets warm fast, gets cold fast, I can straighten and curl my hair easily with it in no time.</li>
            <li> I debated between getting this more expensive Remington straightener and a cheaper $10 one, and I&#x27;m really glad I chose</li>
            <li> The heat is better on the Conair, and the curl is tight</li>
            <li> suppose to be all ceramic), and the highly rated HSI here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , my expectations weren&#x27;t high at all.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t appear to be damaged at all by the high heat.    </li>
            <li> highly recommend for creating shine, waves, and curling hair under at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have very fine asian hair, and noticed that even on the lowest setting 310, it&#x27;s borderline a little too hot for my hair.  </li>
            <li> ; She assured me with a big smile and kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s just normal for that to happen</li>
            <li> I had done some research and prefer a tool with temp control due to my damaged fine hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, the Remington is at a fair price--not expensive like most other irons.</li>
            <li> Plus it is designed well: easy to hold and lay down,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes probably a little over 5 minutes in the morning for me to use this on my straight hair to smooth and curl my ends under.</li>
            <li> I can live without these folks.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking to buy a new straightener because the straightener/curling iron I had before</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous flat irons that I have tried, the cord-swivel feature comes in handy and keeps the power cord tangle-free.</li>
            <li> One or two passes is enough to make my hair really straight, also i noticed i can pass it through my hair quite fast too.  </li>
            <li> overall a fantastic product especially for what it&#x27;s designed to do.  </li>
            <li> My hair usually has ok days</li>
            <li> Okay so I purchased this item over a year ago and felt the need to write a review since I was on amazon viewing past purchases.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as comparing to chi, ghd, or any of the other popular brands available, I am unable to do that being as this is my first, but I won&#x27;t have to try any others because this straightener has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> But with Remington S6500, it literally takes me 15 minutes to style my whole hair (I have medium to long hair straight hair).</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;m not frugal when it comes to ceramic flat irons.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re willing to pay $30 for 3 months of use get this flat iron!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to run such a large plated straightener through my hair.</li>
            <li> I totally would recomend this for any young girls that wants to do both straighten and curl.</li>
            <li> It did a terrific job and made my hair straight,probably a bit too much for my liking (I like the natural look).</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give the Remington a try and WOW.</li>
            <li> After much research, I finally decided to purchase the Remington Sleek and Curl.</li>
            <li> and i like that the buttons are completely out of the way</li>
            <li> I get far too paranoid</li>
            <li> therefore i haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my bans, and i&#x27;m far too scared to get it anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li> I get far too paranoid</li>
            <li> therefore i haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my bans, and i&#x27;m far too scared to get it anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li> all I could think was \\&quot;Wow, that was easy!\\&quot; And it made my hair shinier and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my old straighter fried.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to cool down, which I prefer to do before clamping it shut and keeping it away.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/kinky hair almost completely natural and these flat irons work amazing.</li>
            <li> Amika didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, the Chi made it really flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> it even straightens my SUPER thick natural hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> but in my experience this is because the temperature is high enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have long and straight hair and this flat-iron</li>
            <li> In comparison, I have bought, used, and RETURNED Chi flat irons because they don&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I got this out I expected to have to play with it a while to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I guess this is normal especially since I had my heat-protectant spray on.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be replacing it with a new Remington.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to any woman that wants a quality straightner that also has a limited time to do her hair.</li>
            <li> That was the major factor for me - to find a product that would work well without ruining my hair.</li>
            <li> only thing that you must be cautious of is, (just like ANY other styling tool that gets hot) PROTECT YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li> All I know is that it does a great job, heats up in very little time, takes 8 minutes for my thick hair at two settings below the maximum (I have twice as much hair as the average girl), it straightens/</li>
            <li> When I cut my super long hair last year, I found my new short hair actually more unmanageable because, after air-drying, it would fall in weird directions</li>
            <li> I have not tried many hair straighteners in my life, maybe I don&#x27;t know what I am missing in other products, but this one fulfills all my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick hair, but I get it cut to were</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this flat iron works magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> You definitely get HIGH quality results for a low price.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about it, but I am acutally like it better then my last one that I spent $100 on</li>
            <li> I made a mistake by reviewing this flat iron too early!</li>
            <li> As far as straighteners go, it definitely does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> I think I was more tired of that trash than</li>
            <li> The whole reason I bought another flat iron is because my Ion from Sally constantly pulled my hair when flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> It curled my uncurlable hair perfectly, never left any creases in my hair and it left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was straight, shinny and NOT frizzy like my other straighter left my hair.</li>
            <li> was pretty much broken and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it worked better than other hair straighteners I had.</li>
            <li> The other products I&#x27;ve used in the past broke too easily, while the remington is well made.</li>
            <li> and it looked like a hot mess!</li>
            <li> The T-studio was heavy and had large plates</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of flat irons even the most expensive brands</li>
            <li> I am still currently using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> On this flat iron floating plates is where the bottom portion of the plates do not touch- just the bottom.</li>
            <li> I never had a flat iron with floating plates</li>
            <li> and I decided to go to the grocery store to buy (any) flat iron</li>
            <li> It has the swivel cord and the flat iron is weightless...</li>
            <li> I combed it through and seperated it, sprayed in some Suave Heat protectent all over and flat</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeee this flat</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron with TRESemme&#x27;s Thermal Creations Spray to protect my hair with the heat.</li>
            <li> little did I know it was going to stop working completely after only 3 months of use!</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s what helps this flat iron to NOT PULL HAIR!</li>
            <li> I had very minor hair snagging before I dropped my straightener, but now I do occasionally pull a hair out.  </li>
            <li> Since I had never used a straightener with bigger plates, I also bought the [[ASIN:B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4\\&quot; Wide Plates]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those girls who never blow dries her hair, has never dyed it, cuts it like once every couple of years courtesy of a friend who&#x27;s \\&quot;experimenting\\&quot; or \\&quot;learning\\&quot;, and generally doesn&#x27;t like to use any product other than shampoo, conditioner, and brush.</li>
            <li> The older ones that i borrowed usually resulted in me yanking out my hair as i try to pass my hair between the blades.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re only out $30 rather than $100-$250 for other flat irons.</li>
            <li> I know i won&#x27;t be salivating after a CHI or one of those $200 irons as long as I have this!Sort of</li>
            <li> What this means is if you have very thick and hard to manage hair, you won&#x27;t be able to use your hand to help the flat iron to be flatter by holding the end close.  </li>

            <li> I typically don&#x27;t curl my hair because my hair gets flat and straight after an hour or so and because it usually takes me about an hour to style it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different straighteners, an Amika, some cheapo one from Wal-mart, and my stylist uses a Chi Digital on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I put my hair up wet to go run an errand, it dried a little and was really curly.</li>
            <li> i have used it on hair near my crown tho, but usually i couldn&#x27;t force myself to place it too close to scalp...</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s one con, and I only have one other: you must be careful not to drop this straightener and make scratches on the sides of the ceramic plates or your hair will start to snag.  </li>
            <li> But for those with normal to thick hair, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t curl your hair properly with any plain old straightener, even expensive ones like the CHI straighteners.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel too comfortable to use(I have small hands, and thin hair)</li>
            <li> My hair type: fragile, shoulder length, half wavy,half pin-</li>
            <li> or there will be too much or less and wont heat properly.</li>
            <li> There is a tiny bit of room at the end to hold with your fingers while styling, so you don&#x27;t burn yourself but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was a little wider.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just walked out of the salon and spent over 300dollars on my hair.</li>
            <li> Works like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on chi, KOR (at the mall,</li>
            <li> it looks thin and wavy to straight hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to straighten my hair often as I feel I am damaging it (paranoia again!), but for those few times that I do, this straightener totally transforms my hair.</li>
            <li> usually it takes me a while to pass a flat iron through, but not with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I don&#x27;t use them very much, just let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Now I see why people spend at least 100 on a flat iron because they actually last!</li>
            <li> It still was not nearly as smooth as this flat iron is on the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has gotten caught a few times but that is prob on me and not on the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag, pull, tangle or burn like all the other ones did.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use the converter, keep the other for travel.  </li>
            <li> I usually have that part treated in hair salons but can&#x27;t do so recently.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said-</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m tired of going through flat iron after flat iron.</li>
            <li> The default temp is like 370 and it always starts up at that temp, so every time i put it on i have to immediately change the temp down to 310 or it&#x27;ll fry my hair.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to clamp down ALL the way on your hair-</li>
            <li> I think or maybe less</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slightly wavy after washing.</li>
            <li> When both the products arrived, I tried one on each half of my segmented hair.</li>
            <li> I had it for about a year and a half and used about once every 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> the Curling aspect of it seems incredibly difficult to do, particularly since you can&#x27;t touch the barrel.  </li>

            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s me or the straightener...</li>

            <li> It also pinched my hair a lot, and the on/off button was placed in a poor location.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and found bad reviews for the expensive flat irons that had 1 year or no warranty.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t accidentally press anything (i have a curling iron that unfortunately keep changing temp whenever i try to use it).  </li>

            <li> This morning my girlfriend exclaimed after using this for two months, &amp;#34;2rd best birthday gift ever, after the Coach sunglasses last year!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What about my love?&amp;#34; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Of course, your love is #1...&amp;#34; She assured me with a big smile and kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;After hours and hours of research and sneaky questioning, I surprised her with this bargain priced salon quality iron to replace her cheap POS that didn&#x27;t do much. I think I was more tired of that trash than her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it straightens her naturally wavy hair and makes it sleek, doesn&#x27;t look like trash sitting on the bathroom counter, gets her out the door faster, and makes her happy and confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it because it is slightly wider than most and high quality ceramic instead of cheap aluminum, so it gets the job done better and isn&#x27;t so much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, get this for your lady so she can look pretty for her friends and you can fall in love with her hair again. Plus, she will think of you every time she uses it. Genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single Women, this will get you halfway to a man and impress your friends.</li>
            <li> Well I am African American (I wear extensions!). Ive been trying to find the perfect straighter for my hair for years. Ive went through Chi&#x27;s, and the most expensive brands out there. However, I decided to give the Remington a try and WOW. my Hair is so silky and straight. It straigthens my real hair and my extensions. I feel like I just walked out of the salon and spent over 300dollars on my hair. I love this straigther. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> FIRST NOTE: I did NOT buy this from Amazon. I purchases this from my local Wal-Mart.  This flat iron is phenomenal.  It heats up to 450 degree.  It has a swivel chord.  It heats up FAST.  It has a lock mechanism.  It has floating plates (see pictures)  The smoothness of this flat iron when it glides through hair is lovely. The whole reason I bought another flat iron is because my Ion from Sally constantly pulled my hair when flat ironing.  I have straight hair already by usually it takes me a while to pass a flat iron through, but not with this flat iron. I am done so quickly it&#x27;s unreal.  In comparison, I have bought, used, and RETURNED Chi flat irons because they don&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair. They also PULLED!  I have also bought and used a Maxius Maxiglide from HSN. It worked okay but broke in less than a year. It still was not nearly as smooth as this flat iron is on the hair.  The floating plates are nice. On this flat iron floating plates is where the bottom portion of the plates do not touch- just the bottom. I never had a flat iron with floating plates but I think that&#x27;s what helps this flat iron to NOT PULL HAIR! It still straightens from the heat that the plates emit because the plate still touches the hair, it just doesn&#x27;t SQUEEZE the hair.  My Advice: TRY IT!  You have 30-days to figure out if you like it. Keep the packaging (which you should do for everything you buy until the warranty/return period is up) and if you don&#x27;t like it RETURN IT! You&#x27;re only out $30 rather than $100-$250 for other flat irons.</li>
            <li> Would have given this a 5, but after having it a year, one of the plates won&#x27;t heat up. I haven&#x27;t dropped it, I use it every few days so it&#x27;s not constantly left on... don&#x27;t know why it broke but it did.  Otherwise, it was great. It was smooth and didn&#x27;t pull my hair out, which is something I MUST have in a straightener.</li>
            <li> not super great quality but does the job and its functional</li>
            <li> two words. LOVE.... IT! it glides so smoothly. it heats up in like 5 seconds. it beeps when it&#x27;s ready. it even straightens my SUPER thick natural hair bone straight. awesome product! I am going to buy the curling wand, and the blow dryer too.</li>
            <li> Works like I expected it to. The blue light display is a plus for this straightener. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> After much research, I finally decided to purchase the Remington Sleek and Curl. I received it just yesterday and decided to try it out immediately, after my hair had been in a bun all day. I have very thick shoulder length wavy hair that almost resembles a bird&#x27;s nest after having been tied up. The Remington made very quick work of straightening, under five minutes! I didn&#x27;t even need to set it to the highest heat setting. Today instead of straightening I decided to work with curly and used the Remington to define curls - with much success. The cd makes curling look a lot easier than it is but with practice all is well. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with any hair type - the versatility is amazing and the price for all the benefits is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightner for not even a year and it just stopped working. I was straightening my hair and it was just fine and I realized it wasn&#x27;t doing what it was suppose to do all of a sudden. I touched it to see if it was hot and it wasn&#x27;t. I tried it the next day and even at 450 degrees, it was as cool as it is off. And yes, I even had it plugged in and on!!!! I would NOT recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;m not frugal when it comes to ceramic flat irons.  I have spent a lot of money on chi, KOR (at the mall, suppose to be all ceramic), and the highly rated HSI here on Amazon.  Nothing has amazed me, they all pulled my hair and burned it.  Needless to say I don&#x27;t use them very much, just let my hair air dry and I&#x27;m done. I can live without these folks.  My hair usually has ok days but I found myself in Milan for work and I had to walk a lot in the mist and rain. My hair had been through a lot and it was showing, I looked like a frizzy lion.  A group of us were going out for dinner and I decided to go to the grocery store to buy (any) flat iron, my expectations weren&#x27;t high at all.  I found this one (the European version) and fell in love.  The price was about 40 euros I think or maybe less but I still paid a lot less than any of the name brand products that couldn&#x27;t deliver half what this did!!   First, the plates are long so you can do those beautiful curls and waves, no problem.  I always used the lowest setting to 300-350 which was perfectly fine for my hair.  It has the swivel cord and the flat iron is weightless...So easy to move it, twist it, not heavy at all.  BEST of all, the plates don&#x27;t fully clamp so it glides beautifully!! It doesn&#x27;t snag, pull, tangle or burn like all the other ones did. My hair is left silky and shiny, just soft and beautiful. I also noticed when it&#x27;s time to wash my hair it doesn&#x27;t look fried or dull.  The only con I have with this iron is that the plates get very hot on the sides so when your twisting it, make sure you don&#x27;t touch it otherwise you&#x27;ll get burn fingers (happened to me once). Happy the US version is available, now I&#x27;m buying that one so I don&#x27;t have to use the converter, keep the other for travel.  Seriously, great job to Remington for creating the best flat iron at an affordable price! To think I almost bought the GHD.. Woo thanks for saving me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different straighteners, an Amika, some cheapo one from Wal-mart, and my stylist uses a Chi Digital on me.&lt;br /&gt;The Amika didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, the Chi made it really flat and lifeless. The cheap one didn&#x27;t really work!&lt;br /&gt;After a new bold hairstyle with a lot of layers I realized I HAD to buy a flatiron and finally caved in. Went to Wal-mart, saw the Remington Digital Pearl flat iron, loved the color of it, but the digital aspect is what sold me on it. It has a 4 yr warranty on it also!&lt;br /&gt;Today I put my hair up wet to go run an errand, it dried a little and was really curly. I came home, put my hair down, blow dried it and it looked like a hot mess! It was all over the place! I combed it through and seperated it, sprayed in some Suave Heat protectent all over and flat ironed it with the Remington. My hair was sleek, beautiful, and smooth. My hair has tons of shine and body! I loveeeeeeee this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The best part for me is knowing I have a warranty and it covers it in case it breaks. ALSO, the heat adjusts really easy and the flat iron HEATS up in under two minutes, BEEPS to let me know its hot!!&lt;br /&gt;The cord swivels! Nice long cord!</li>
            <li> I have very curly front hair which doesn&#x27;t adorn my face at all. I usually have that part treated in hair salons but can&#x27;t do so recently. The rest of my hair is a bit wavy so making them wavier could be a good idea. In conclusion, what I need is dual-purpose heat styler. I had done some research and prefer a tool with temp control due to my damaged fine hair. The lowest temp does my hair well. The price is reasonable. I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have this!!!</li>
            <li> I have not tried many hair straighteners in my life, maybe I don&#x27;t know what I am missing in other products, but this one fulfills all my expectations. Gets warm fast, gets cold fast, I can straighten and curl my hair easily with it in no time. I use it once in 10 days on an average, and it works perfectly for me, without doing any damage to my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake by reviewing this flat iron too early! little did I know it was going to stop working completely after only 3 months of use! It worked wonderfully when it was working but what good is that when it quits only 3 months later! I am not one to spend a lot of money on things if I don&#x27;t have to but I&#x27;m tired of going through flat iron after flat iron. Now I see why people spend at least 100 on a flat iron because they actually last! So if you&#x27;re willing to pay $30 for 3 months of use get this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and found bad reviews for the expensive flat irons that had 1 year or no warranty.  I bought this one for about $40 and it has a 4 year warranty.  UPDATE:  I have now owned this iron for almost 2 years and it occasionally stops working. Sometimes I turn it on and it doesn&#x27;t heat up, or automatically turns off before it heats up.  I&#x27;m considering returning it and getting a different one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this iron for almost 3 months now, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve had a lot of curling irons but none of them worked like this one, my hair looks ahmazing!!! when I use it I always get so many compliments, I&#x27;ve even been asked if I&#x27;m wearing hair extension, that&#x27;s how great my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s so easy to use it, I have really long hair and it only takes like 15 mins to curl it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s working only on 110 Volt.</li>
            <li> its actually a pretty decent straightener. I use it to curl my hair and the curls come out great. love it.</li>
            <li> works great!  heats fast and is super easy to use. terrific choice for the money!  i&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have one and love them. They smooth hair quickly and hair feels silky. The travel case is very helpful, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used many flatiron before but of the three i&#x27;ve tried (two of which were very old and borrowed from friends), this one definitely trumps the cake.  And for only $30!  The older ones that i borrowed usually resulted in me yanking out my hair as i try to pass my hair between the blades.  I thought it&#x27;s just normal for that to happen and so refused to buy a flat iron since i honestly didn&#x27;t want to rip out all my hair on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but then i really liked the super straight result from using flat irons, so i thought \\&quot;well i should just give this one a try...\\&quot; since it&#x27;s got such great reviews and fairly cheap.  I&#x27;m SO happy that I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unlike my friend&#x27;s older flat irons, this one allows my hair to glide through super easily with almost no snagging.  Every once in a while it does happen, but i noticed it was more my fault for not positioning my hair properly.  It is quite light and the size of it is perfect for my quite thin asian hair - allows much better control for me than the heavier and larger ones i&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat up is really fast and i like that the buttons are completely out of the way so I don&#x27;t accidentally press anything (i have a curling iron that unfortunately keep changing temp whenever i try to use it).  Very happy also that you can change the temp as well.  I have very fine asian hair, and noticed that even on the lowest setting 310, it&#x27;s borderline a little too hot for my hair.  So i sort of wish it can go a bit lower on the temperature!  But for those with normal to thick hair, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It flattens much better than my friend&#x27;s irons.  One or two passes is enough to make my hair really straight, also i noticed i can pass it through my hair quite fast too.  So my morning routine time was shortened by a lot with this iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The default temp is like 370 and it always starts up at that temp, so every time i put it on i have to immediately change the temp down to 310 or it&#x27;ll fry my hair.  Sort of wish it would just remember the last setting instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The plastic barrel around the plates get REALLY HOT.  the handle doesn&#x27;t, but the barrel does, and it&#x27;s so bad that one time i accidentally touched either the side or potentially an edge close to the plate, and developed a mini blister on my thumb.  What this means is if you have very thick and hard to manage hair, you won&#x27;t be able to use your hand to help the flat iron to be flatter by holding the end close.  that could potentially make it difficult for those with very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Since it gets really hot, you can&#x27;t really get this iron too close to your roots/ears/skin etc.  I get far too paranoid i&#x27;m gonna burn my ears or face lol.  therefore i haven&#x27;t tried to use this on my bans, and i&#x27;m far too scared to get it anywhere near my face.  i have used it on hair near my crown tho, but usually i couldn&#x27;t force myself to place it too close to scalp...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the Curling aspect of it seems incredibly difficult to do, particularly since you can&#x27;t touch the barrel.  i tried to use it to curl once and that&#x27;s how i got my blister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall a fantastic product especially for what it&#x27;s designed to do.  Don&#x27;t count on using this to curl (removing a star for that) but i find this to be top notch flat iron material!  I know i won&#x27;t be salivating after a CHI or one of those $200 irons as long as I have this!Sort of wish it would just remember the last setting instead.    - The plastic barrel around the plates get REALLY HOT.  the handle doesn&#x27;t, but the barrel does, and it&#x27;s so bad that one time i accidentally touched either the side or potentially an edge close to the plate, and developed a mini blister on my thumb.

            <li> I went to target and I was looking to buy a new straightener because the straightener/curling iron I had before was pretty much broken and didn&#x27;t get hot enough. It also pinched my hair a lot, and the on/off button was placed in a poor location. My best friend has a Remington straightener which I used at her house, and it worked great, so I kept it in mind when I was looking for a new one. I debated between getting this more expensive Remington straightener and a cheaper $10 one, and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up really quickly, and it has a little beeping sound to let you know when it has reached the desired temperature (which goes up to 450). The end is not as hot so you can hold it and you won&#x27;t burn yourself (I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and haven&#x27;t had any burns). It straightens really well, and if you know how, it also gives great curls too. I have never accidentally shut this off mid-curl or mid-straighten, and I just really love the design of this straightener. I would definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good, affordable straightener that doubles as a curler (although I&#x27;m looking into buying a separate curling iron now from Remington!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that my mom constantly steals my straightener in the mornings. ;) And she was the one that wanted to get the cheap $10 one!</li>
            <li> Its the best Flat iron i have ever owned.  My hair has gotten caught a few times but that is prob on me and not on the flat iron.  It heats up rapidly and it indicates that is heating up with a blinking indicator and that stop blinking once it is ready (this is beside the temp gauage that is digital).  I love it and recommend it to all.  The curls tend to be easier made by doing a barrel rather than the ribbon twist as suggested by the dvd.  The dvd is also very informative.</li>
            <li> I bought my dual-voltage version in Europe which for my purposes is fantastic because I travel quite a bit. I didn&#x27;t know a U.S. version was available - the one listed appears NOT to be dual-voltage. The one I bought was approx. $80 (in April 2011), which for me was a bargain for what it did. Mine goes up to 230 degrees Centigrade, which should be 446 degrees Fahrenheit though the exact temperature is not known using U.S. voltage. All I know is that it does a great job, heats up in very little time, takes 8 minutes for my thick hair at two settings below the maximum (I have twice as much hair as the average girl), it straightens/curls in the same amount of time, the lock feature is great, the locked-close feature is great, and the hold-temp feature isn&#x27;t necessary but I use it just in case. I see steam coming off of it but in my experience this is because the temperature is high enough for my hair type. Without steam, a flat iron wouldn&#x27;t be effective. The plates are rounded and gentle on my hair - no pulls, and the plate is an inch longer than standard to accommodate more hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t appear to be damaged at all by the high heat.    I&#x27;m super happy with this model and for the price offered here, a steal!</li>
            <li> CONS-  Like other reviews have said- it doesn&#x27;t seem to clamp down ALL the way on your hair- but it still seems to get the job done.     PROS-  Auto Off  Adjustable heat settings  It&#x27;s cute    Other-  I haven&#x27;t tried to curl my hair with it yet- mostly because my hair isn&#x27;t all that long right now.   I am for the most part pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love the Remington \\&quot;Sleek &amp; Curl\\&quot; flat-iron.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  I have long and straight hair and this flat-iron helps me to achieve a smooth &amp; polished look and also for when I want to add some body &amp; curl; it&#x27;s perfect.  It heats-up in no time and is very easy to use; good design &amp; very lightweight.  It&#x27;s so quick and easy--I love it.  The DVD tutorial is very nice also!</li>
            <li> This straightener works very well even at the lowest heat. I have fairly thin hair so if you have thicker hair, you may have to use a higher temperature. It heats up very quickly which is convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for more than 2 years now, maybe even longer but I can&#x27;t recall.  It&#x27;s served me really well! As far as straighteners go, it definitely does it&#x27;s job and I find it&#x27;s even better than most straighteners because it is curved in order to curl your hair with it. I say this because the best way to straighten your hair is to actually pull it at an angle and curve your hair a little, rather than pulling straight down. This leverage and tension against your hair along with the heat makes a big difference in how your hair turns out, so even if you&#x27;re only interested in straightening your hair I think this is perfect for that. The plates go onto the edge, which is awesome for straightening as well as curling.  You really can&#x27;t curl your hair properly with any plain old straightener, even expensive ones like the CHI straighteners. It has to be properly built for it or else you get random bends in your hair. It heats up very well and you can control the heat very easily with the dial.  There is a tiny bit of room at the end to hold with your fingers while styling, so you don&#x27;t burn yourself but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was a little wider. That&#x27;s one con, and I only have one other: you must be careful not to drop this straightener and make scratches on the sides of the ceramic plates or your hair will start to snag.  I had very minor hair snagging before I dropped my straightener, but now I do occasionally pull a hair out.  That&#x27;s my own fault though because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the plate overlap. Lightweight and easy to travel with (you can lock it shut with a turn of the side knob). Overall, amazing straightener that provides soft and sleek straight as well as curled hair :)</li>
            <li> The first time I got this out I expected to have to play with it a while to get used to it. But I did my hair and all I could think was \\&quot;Wow, that was easy!\\&quot; And it made my hair shinier and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS LINE IS AN UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER: I am still using this and love it. No problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes probably a little over 5 minutes in the morning for me to use this on my straight hair to smooth and curl my ends under. I have also created waves with it but this was just while playing, so I didn&#x27;t do all my hair, but it was going well. For me this is a 5 STAR product, but I honestly cannot say how it would do on straightening curly hair, so I will just give it 4 stars overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not snag my hair and it heats up super-fast. Plus it is designed well: easy to hold and lay down, long-enough cord, smooth look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for creating shine, waves, and curling hair under at the ends.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It is very affordable and works well with every hair type. I typically don&#x27;t curl my hair because my hair gets flat and straight after an hour or so and because it usually takes me about an hour to style it. But with Remington S6500, it literally takes me 15 minutes to style my whole hair (I have medium to long hair straight hair). Now I get excited and WANT to curl my hair whenever I go out. Remington S6500 is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener ever made. I  love it. I have really thick hair and this flat iron works magic on my hair. I love the different temperature settings.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with electricty adjustment. I made the purchase outside the US. So, the product specs are not matching voltage in my country. I&#x27;m still searching for adaptor/ transformer device so that I can use the product properly. I wished this could have been explained to overseas customers before placing the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s me or the straightener... This straightener doesn&#x27;t give a curl on the ends as it claims -- at least, I couldn&#x27;t get it to do so.  Also, whenever I&#x27;m done using it, my hair is FILLED with static, regardless of the season.  Never had this happen with another straightener.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing straightener!!! I tried sooo many straighteners hoping to find one that was easy to use, actually worked well and wasn&#x27;t too pricey, and this one was perfect. It heats up really fast, and straightens my hair in about 15 minutes, which is good for before school. Unfortunately, it stopped heating, and I have no idea why!! Definitely will be replacing it with a new Remington.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is perfect for my needs. I was not expecting much, but I have been using it for about a year now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those girls who never blow dries her hair, has never dyed it, cuts it like once every couple of years courtesy of a friend who&#x27;s \\&quot;experimenting\\&quot; or \\&quot;learning\\&quot;, and generally doesn&#x27;t like to use any product other than shampoo, conditioner, and brush. When I cut my super long hair last year, I found my new short hair actually more unmanageable because, after air-drying, it would fall in weird directions and I&#x27;d look like I rolled out of bed at any given moment of the day. I&#x27;ve always been really skeptical about using any hardware on my hair, but this straightener is awesome. My hair is as soft and smooth as ever, even though I use this say 4-5 times a week. That was the major factor for me - to find a product that would work well without ruining my hair. Well, I found it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s very easy to use and can give the result very fast. Now I can have very straight and also curly hair, its up to me. The result in both cases is as the salon effect. I recommend to buy it!</li>
            <li> Bought this straightener about two years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I love using this product to not only straighten but also curl my hair.  Great straightener for the price!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is amazing. I purchased this item back in 2011. I am still currently using this flat iron. I really like the fact that this can heat all the way up to 410 (F) degrees in a matter of seconds. Unlike the previous flat irons that I have tried, the cord-swivel feature comes in handy and keeps the power cord tangle-free. Also, the price is amazing and it is worth it. I would definitely recommend this product to all of my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I use this flat iron with TRESemme&#x27;s Thermal Creations Spray to protect my hair with the heat. I am sure any other heat protectant spray will work great with this iron.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it worked better than other hair straighteners I had. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny like some of the reviews had had. Honestly, I think it would probably work better if you didn&#x27;t have such thick hair. Also, I find it helpful that it came with a DVD that shows you. Couple of hairdoes that you can do using the hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I love the the straightner. It also does the curl too. I totally would recomend this for any young girls that wants to do both straighten and curl. The shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice ao i gave it 4stars. It sleek and gives off great heat. I like the lock button (2 lock hold both buttons). The con was... your hair gets stuck in it &amp; the curl isn&#x27;t as nice as the \\&quot;Conair\\&quot; my daughter just got. The heat is better on the Conair, and the curl is tight 4dayz! @whoknew</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying this straightener beats the $60 one I got at Sally Beauty Supply. I used it yesterday for the first time before work and my hair was straight the FIRST time I went over my hair. I didn&#x27;t really have to go over it again. I have fine, thick hair, but I get it cut to were it looks thin and wavy to straight hair. I love this straighter!! My hair was straight, shinny and NOT frizzy like my other straighter left my hair. I set the temperature on 330 and my hair ahh omg, it doesn&#x27;t look frizzy in the front ends of my hair. I love it!! I&#x27;m 150% satisfied with this straightener!!! You definitely get HIGH quality results for a low price. OH and my package arrived the very next day as I wanted.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly and I set the temperature to the lowest setting.  I have relatively fine hair so I don&#x27;t need to spend too much time to straighten my hair.  It&#x27;s also pretty easy to put curls in my hair but I guess an actual curling iron may do a better job.  For my purpose, I love this product.</li>
            <li> So I have straight hair but it&#x27;s slightly wavy after washing. I like the sleek look when I&#x27;m going somewhere fancy so I decided to buy this straightener after a LOT of research. Since this didn&#x27;t have many reviews but was comparable to the 2\\&quot; straightener from this line (the pearl ceramic thingy), I decided to go for this one. Since I had never used a straightener with bigger plates, I also bought the [[ASIN:B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4\\&quot; Wide Plates]] (It&#x27;s got some great reviews).    When both the products arrived, I tried one on each half of my segmented hair. Here are the reviews:    The T-studio was heavy and had large plates so I personally found it a bit uncomfortable when I wanted to work on my bangs. It did a terrific job and made my hair straight,probably a bit too much for my liking (I like the natural look). It didn&#x27;t feel too comfortable to use(I have small hands, and thin hair) and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to run such a large plated straightener through my hair. I am guessing this one&#x27;s for serious hair-straightener users, and it would work great on curly hair (please read the reviews for more).    The sleek and curl is easy to use, very sleek and goes through my hair easily. I make sure I spray my hair with a heat-protectant spray like TreSemme&#x27;s. The straightener is light and I can finish my hair up in 5 minutes (I have hair well past my shoulders). It looks great and didn&#x27;t frizz up for the rest of the evening (although I did spray it with an anti-frizz spray to be safe). The controls are easy and at the highest temperature it can get pretty HOT - so much that my hair smoked a bit (which is why I gave it 4 stars). I guess this is normal especially since I had my heat-protectant spray on. It heats up in around 20 seconds and the temperature locks in one easy touch of a button. The plates do get hot, and so does the outer body around the plates - so its best to hold the straightener carefully and right at the end (where it&#x27;s supposed to be held).The controls are placed away on the side so you cannot press them by mistake. It takes a while to cool down, which I prefer to do before clamping it shut and keeping it away. My friends and I tried curling some strands after watching the free CD. We could do with some practice - but they seemed quite easy. I didn&#x27;t want to do it too many times because I am quite paranoid about frying my hair.    To sum up - for the price, it is a great product and works quickly and easily to straighten my hair so very beautifully.It should be great for travelling and has a light, professional-looking design. I don&#x27;t like to straighten my hair often as I feel I am damaging it (paranoia again!), but for those few times that I do, this straightener totally transforms my hair. I will recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this straightner. It heats up in about 30 seconds and really gets your hair straight. I would recomend this to any woman that wants a quality straightner that also has a limited time to do her hair. It straightens and also curls-gives the sexiest curls.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this item! The shipping was reasonable and it got here in great timing. The product itself is awesome and works better than I ever imagined. It is better than any hair stlying product I&#x27;ve ever owned. It was only about $30 including shipping. I would recommend this to ANYONE!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a while, but then it suddenly stopped working. There was no visible damage to it. I had it for about a year and a half and used about once every 2 weeks or so. Luckily I had a warranty on it and they sent me a free replacement!</li>
            <li> Bought this product several months ago after my last one broke. I use it often but not as often as I would like. It works great and heats up quickly. I love it!!</li>
            <li> My hair type: fragile, shoulder length, half wavy,half pin-straight(just enough to make it fluffy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for curling irons and straighteners for weeks, and had been doing my homework on just about every brand out there. I was planning on spending quite a bit on each, but first i decided to try a cheap flat iron that both curls and straightens. I decided to try this particular one, purely because it was so cheap i figured it wouldn&#x27;t be so traumatic if I didn&#x27;t like it, or if it didn&#x27;t work on my hair. wow. I am so impressed with this product! It is a wonderful straightener and my hair takes a fraction of the time to curl and it looks b-e-a-utiful! The heat control is very nice too. Granted, i had to watch quite a few youtube tutorials to really get the hang of how to become a pro at the curling aspect (the video that comes with the product is very helpful too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that you must be cautious of is, (just like ANY other styling tool that gets hot) PROTECT YOUR HAIR! I delayed getting a heat tamer spray until using this product almost everyday for over a year...not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I was looking for and am very pleased with my purchase! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love thus straightener. Works so well.</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome. Straightens and curls! It came quick and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> So this is my first flat iron, and I payed with my own money. Well...I LOVE IT(: At first, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about getting one because of the fear of frying my hair and of not knowing how to use it. But I just bought some heat protectant (TRESemme /cheap and works well), and the Remington Sleek &amp; Curl comes with a nice, handy DVD. So all is well. Also, I didn&#x27;t want to get something that didn&#x27;t work. No worries: it works finee. Plus, the Remington is at a fair price--not expensive like most other irons. I am happy with it, and you would be too if you get it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a lot of reviews on multiple different brands of straightners. I liked the price, but thought that since it was so much lower that the competitor brands, that it would be sub-par in ability. I was very surprised when I used it for the first time! It is very lightweight, glides smoothly through my fine hair without snagging, is adjustable (although I have never used it above 420 degrees), and has lasted me over 6 months now without any functionality issues.&lt;br /&gt;As far as comparing to chi, ghd, or any of the other popular brands available, I am unable to do that being as this is my first, but I won&#x27;t have to try any others because this straightener has exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s low cost, performs well, and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is my first iron and I do love the way that it makes my hair sleek. The only problem with this iron is the edges of the plates. Rarely some hairs get caught by the edges and cut.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair straightener that has really straightened my wife&#x27;s very curly hair so that the hairstyle looked excellent and preserved for a long time until the next hair washing. Also the idea of including the CD with tutorials was very appreciated by her. She&#x27;s very satisfied and so am i.</li>
            <li> I use it to curl my super straight hair. I have used other products which I&#x27;ve spent like $100s for and this DOES the job perfectly and on a good budget. The other products I&#x27;ve used in the past broke too easily, while the remington is well made. My friend recommended this to me and while I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, I found it on amazon. :D</li>
            <li> I bought this when my old straighter fried.  I was a little nervous about it, but I am acutally like it better then my last one that I spent $100 on</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for Mother Day and she was very pleased by its results. She recommends it for all those mothers out their searching  for a great look .</li>
            <li> you have to get the right ammount of hair inside or there will be too much or less and wont heat properly. If they had a hook where it can be hanged it would be even better</li>
            <li> perfect item for a quick retouch for going out almost perfectly, it doesnt ruin your hair or anything and you can also try many different styles, its awesome i love it!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a Christmas gift for my daughter. Until now, one year my daughter use it with no problems!</li>
            <li> This works better than my former Chi did. Worth the money. Easy to use and works great. Heats up quickly and make  my hair sleek and just how I want it.</li>
            <li> When I got this straightener I was able to get it for 25 bucks. I have literally no complaints about this straightener. It curled my uncurlable hair perfectly, never left any creases in my hair and it left my hair shiny and soft. The only reason I don&#x27;t still own it is because my mother took it and I wasn&#x27;t able to find another one before buying a new one. So much love for this product.</li>
            <li> Got this a month ago and have only used it three times.  I love the locking mechanism for storage, and the digital temp readout.  My daughter has this model and recommended it.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> Cute product, heats up fast.  However the ends of the ceramic pull hair out.  Wish I knew that before I purchased it. I may just use it for travel no big loss.</li>
            <li> Okay so I purchased this item over a year ago and felt the need to write a review since I was on amazon viewing past purchases. I have thick curly/kinky hair almost completely natural and these flat irons work amazing. I set the temperature to about 350 and apply an oil of my choice to my hair and straighten my hair as I please. These babies work wonders and I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry or fry my hair because I can control the temperature setting. I have tried alot of flat irons even the most expensive brands and I can definitely say that these have worked the best. The more expensive brands have fried my hair to the point where I experienced some extensive breakage but I have not had a problem with these. i would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
