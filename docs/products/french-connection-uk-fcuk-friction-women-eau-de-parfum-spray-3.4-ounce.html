            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This Parfum has a GREAT SCENT and I feel that a man could also wear this too!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful bottle, great smell, great price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so warm and perfect!</li>
            <li>It was a great price for this size bottle.</li>
            <li>Price is amazing!</li>
            <li>Lasts a while, projection is good.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been in love with a perfume like this in a while!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the top to spritz some fragrance, the spritz</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it, either.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes me feel tropical.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Smell reminds of lets say an Exotic grassy field on strong breezy cloud cover day before the storm in a Mountain Town :)</li>
            <li>i think on someone elses chemistry, it could be lovely and youthful, but on me, it smelled cheap and synthetic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as some of the others.</li>
            <li>Wasnt blown away at first smell but kept smelling wrist throughout the day it settles on nicely.</li>
            <li>I smell the pineapple, but the musk smells cheap to me.</li>
            <li>Such a great scent and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great smell.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use or for special occasions...</li>
            <li>Great fresh fragrance, vanilla and coconut notes, very discrete, great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li>Right price, on time.</li>
            <li>It smells all right.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very strong but there is a definite coconut smell to it</li>
            <li>thingy(broke the first day).</li>
            <li>At times, I&#x27;ll get a whiff of coconut, but mostly it just smells like a watered-down perfume that&#x27;s been sitting in the closet for too long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, and relatively inexpensive, compared to those ridiculously-priced designer perfumes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something light and pretty subtle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.</li>
            <li>But honestly, once i had it on, i could hardly wait to get it off.</li>
            <li>and it at first it reminds me of just a generic smelling perfume.  </li>
            <li>I confess, this is not my go-to perfume, but it&#x27;s a fun smell, maybe a slightly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; or \\&quot;young\\&quot; fragrance but worth putting in one of those little purse-sized atomizers to carry around in case of emergency.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a really sweet vanilla, kinda fruity smell, less floral than I was expecting but can&#x27;t complain... especially for the size of the bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle sweet smell.</li>

            <li> I smell the pineapple, but the musk smells cheap to me. Lasts a while, projection is good. But honestly, once i had it on, i could hardly wait to get it off. The muskyness was a bit grating and synthetic on me. i think on someone elses chemistry, it could be lovely and youthful, but on me, it smelled cheap and synthetic.</li>
            <li> Great fresh fragrance, vanilla and coconut notes, very discrete, great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been in love with a perfume like this in a while!  Perfect for everyday use or for special occasions...LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I accidentally broke my last bottle&#x27;s dispensing mechanism, so I had to order a replacement! I get compliments on the scent everywhere! It&#x27;s so warm and perfect!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle, great smell, great price! The coconut vanilla scent is perfect for summer and winter. This will be my signature scent!</li>
            <li> Right price, on time. I&#x27;ll be a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;Right price, on time. I&#x27;ll be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Such a great scent and not too overpowering.  I&#x27;ve purchased this before and always get what I&#x27;m looking for. Price is amazing!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of summer lotions on the beach, this is as close to it as you can get in a perfume. It&#x27;s not too strong, and relatively inexpensive, compared to those ridiculously-priced designer perfumes. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle sweet smell.It doesn&#x27;t have an over powering smell. My recommendation is if you haven&#x27;t smelled it stop by a local perfume store or macy&#x27;s.  It was a great price for this size bottle. perfumania wanted to charge me 35.99.</li>
            <li> It smells all right.  I guess that&#x27;s what I get for doing a blind-buy with perfume.  At times, I&#x27;ll get a whiff of coconut, but mostly it just smells like a watered-down perfume that&#x27;s been sitting in the closet for too long.</li>
            <li> I like it. It isn&#x27;t very strong but there is a definite coconut smell to it I just wish it were stronger.</li>
            <li> I confess, this is not my go-to perfume, but it&#x27;s a fun smell, maybe a slightly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; or \\&quot;young\\&quot; fragrance but worth putting in one of those little purse-sized atomizers to carry around in case of emergency.  It&#x27;s got a really sweet vanilla, kinda fruity smell, less floral than I was expecting but can&#x27;t complain... especially for the size of the bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Wasnt blown away at first smell but kept smelling wrist throughout the day it settles on nicely.Smell reminds of lets say an Exotic grassy field on strong breezy cloud cover day before the storm in a Mountain Town :)</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the top to spritz some fragrance, the spritz thingy(broke the first day). Im assuming it was broken from the beginning. Now I just apply it like lotion. Overall, great smell. Won&#x27;t be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Received in timely manner.  I know it&#x27;s a chance buying perfume blind, but reading the reviews I figured I wouldn&#x27;t hate it.  And I definitely don&#x27;t... but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it, either.  It&#x27;s pretty light and it at first it reminds me of just a generic smelling perfume.  Every once in awhile I&#x27;ll get whiffs of coconut, but nothing like I was hoping for.  If you&#x27;re looking for something light and pretty subtle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.</li>
            <li> I orderd this on a Monday and received it the next day!!!  This Parfum has a GREAT SCENT and I feel that a man could also wear this too!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as some of the others. Just a hint of flavor and scent. I love how it makes me feel tropical.</li>
            <li> Got this for my granddaughter because she used all of mine.  Love it</li>
