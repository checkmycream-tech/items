            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite nail polishes.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>Looks 100x better in person :-)</li>
            <li>i love it as can wear it alone</li>
            <li>and it sure sparkly to get u noticed.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>I got a pedicure yesterday and just couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my toes because the color looks like bits of rainbow and doesn&#x27;t chip off easily.</li>
            <li>It also has a fairly smooth surface.</li>
            <li>It is very eye&#x27;catching.</li>
            <li>It is very glittery and has many, many colors, and sizes of glitter.</li>
            <li>Got it really quick and its super cute.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, seems better if i wear over another color of polish.</li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and sparkly and can be worn over other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s Happy Birthday is the best but expensive; Milani has one in the Jewel FX line; Rainbow Connection by OPI is so great and considered &#x27;THE&#x27; one; even Wet N Wild&#x27;s Party Of 5 Glitters is ALMOST there.</li>
            <li>The sparkling effect is really cool.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>Luckily there are plenty</li>
            <li>Luckily, a friend of mine told me about this color.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost an exact dupe of Rainbow Connection, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of glitter polish and this, by far, is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Fun to layer or wear alone.  </li>
            <li>Use it for an accent finger, or a gradient, even as all your fingers for new years or something you want a bold sparkly look for!  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the brush either, but looking past my normal complaints, this is a great polish.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to grab at least one more bottle.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it is a wonderfully fun polish and I highly recommend it for ever polish wearer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and sparkly and lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t come off so easily with nail polish remover</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It coats very well in just two coats.</li>
            <li>it is so much prettier than the picture.</li>
            <li>Double layer it and add a clear polish on top</li>
            <li>Nothing worked, and normally my nails hold nail polish miraculously!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally spend $7 on a bottle of nail polish but &#x27;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to dab around excessively to get an even coat on my nails, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It tends to get thick very quickly.</li>
            <li>Connection\\&quot; being slightly older (not to mention significantly more expensive).</li>
            <li>its a multi colored coarse glitter and clear tone mix</li>
            <li>I adored the OPI Muppet&#x27;s \\&quot;Rainbow Connection\\&quot; and was disappointed to learn it was part of a special collection and only available at a massive mark-up.</li>

            <li> Wanted to like this, but it clumps the glitter up. Looks great on Google images.</li>
            <li> I hate the Kardashians but i love this polish! It&#x27;s so pretty and sparkly and lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t come off so easily with nail polish remover but I guess that&#x27;s the point. Double layer it and add a clear polish on top and it lasts longer and looks better.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping. Excellent packaging considering it&#x27;s a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Got it really quick and its super cute. You just need a lot of coats to get the best glittery effect.</li>
            <li> Loved it . thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It is beautiful and sparkly and can be worn over other nail polishes. I got a pedicure yesterday and just couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my toes because the color looks like bits of rainbow and doesn&#x27;t chip off easily. One of my favorite nail polishes. I bought a bottle for my friend as well.</li>
            <li> beautiful nail polish !! if you are debating on this, stop now, and get it. I highly recommend it. Stays on great too.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of sparkle in this polish. It tends to get thick very quickly. It is pretty, seems better if i wear over another color of polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of glitter polish and this, by far, is my favorite. It dries quickly and I don&#x27;t need 2-3 coats to get coverage. By the way, Fergie brand looks great in the bottle but there is very little glitter - I was very disappointed and went back to Nicole.</li>
            <li> I got Rainbow In The S-kylie as a replacement for defunct company Confetti&#x27;s Tasmanian Devil, my former fave rainbow hex glitter. Luckily there are plenty Tasmanian near-dupes (err... Tas is a near-dupe of the others, rather). Basically: Rainbow, hex glitter in multiple sizes in a clear base. Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s Happy Birthday is the best but expensive; Milani has one in the Jewel FX line; Rainbow Connection by OPI is so great and considered &#x27;THE&#x27; one; even Wet N Wild&#x27;s Party Of 5 Glitters is ALMOST there. There are a thousand more.&lt;br /&gt;I chose at random and ended up with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of Nicole by OPI&#x27;s weird, deformed elephant foot shaped bottle and I don&#x27;t like the brush either, but looking past my normal complaints, this is a great polish. It&#x27;s almost an exact dupe of Rainbow Connection, too! It has great coverage and most importantly, EVEN coverage. I don&#x27;t have to dab around excessively to get an even coat on my nails, which is a huge plus. I would say it lasts an average length of time (but since I base coat, then color coat, then glitter coat, then top coat - it&#x27;s hard to tell how well it really performs by itself). I&#x27;m definitely not feeling the burn from finishing up my Tasmanian Devil after using this replacement.</li>
            <li> It is a very good quality nail polish. The sparkling effect is really cool. It looks good on top of any color.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. It is very glittery and has many, many colors, and sizes of glitter. It also has a fairly smooth surface. Overall I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color. Fun to layer or wear alone.  I will be sure to grab at least one more bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail polish and took it with me to get a pedi.  Everyone in the salon loved the color and it lasts forever.  When I went to change the polish, nail polish remover didn&#x27;t work and needed to be filed off.  This is definitely 1 of my top 5 favorite polishes!</li>
            <li> Look no further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the OPI Muppets collection rainbow glitter color is no longer made, so everywhere you find it the stuff costs over twenty dollars! Luckily, a friend of mine told me about this color. They are the same! ! !  Five dollars vs twenty? You tell me which you&#x27;d rather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rainbow in the s-kylie color is great! Use it for an accent finger, or a gradient, even as all your fingers for new years or something you want a bold sparkly look for!  It coats very well in just two coats.</li>
            <li> Looks 100x better in person :-) its a multi colored coarse glitter and clear tone mix every color imaginable will match any outfit u own:-) great quality nail color I don&#x27;t normally spend $7 on a bottle of nail polish but &#x27;well worth it!</li>
            <li> super glitter perfect for parties . i love it as can wear it alone and it sure sparkly to get u noticed.</li>
            <li> I love this polish. It is very eye&#x27;catching. I&#x27;ve used it as an all over color or to do a french manicure. Or you can put it on top of any base color. he only downside is it is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> it is so much prettier than the picture. it stays on your nails for a long time. only thing is it is a little hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this nail polish in store (With another base color included). It was on clearance for only $7.00, so I figured why not?! It&#x27;s gorgeous(:! Low and behold... It sucked. It peeled off maybe an hour after? I tried everything from adding different base coats, clear coats, multiple coats. Nothing worked, and normally my nails hold nail polish miraculously! I returned it after trying all the tricks in the book. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I adored the OPI Muppet&#x27;s \\&quot;Rainbow Connection\\&quot; and was disappointed to learn it was part of a special collection and only available at a massive mark-up. When my Nicole (still by OPI) Kardashian Kolor \\&quot;Rainbow in the S-kylie\\&quot; arrived I immediately did a polish-to-polish comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I actually preferred the \\&quot;Rainbow in the S-kylie.\\&quot; I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;m not sure there is even an actual difference, other than the \\&quot;Rainbow Connection\\&quot; being slightly older (not to mention significantly more expensive). Regardless, it is a wonderfully fun polish and I highly recommend it for ever polish wearer.</li>
