            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but the website is pretty good at helping sort them out.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of them and they&#x27;re perfect for doing my make up for drag and theatre.</li>
            <li>other than that, great purchase!</li>
            <li>Adhesive between fibers and stem seem strong and no loosening is feel between the two when held.</li>
            <li>The smell of the package was quite strong but if locked away somewhere</li>
            <li>Loved my new set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Cleaned them and they are fine now.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, holds plenty of pigment,</li>
            <li>They are smooth and helps me do what I want with the make up.</li>
            <li>bought them primarily for the vegan and eco-friendly factor and the extensiveness of the kinds of brushes.</li>
            <li>Great gift for any female in ur life</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft &amp; nice but the package they come in has a strong plastic smell that lasts a week or so...</li>
            <li>Such a great price and my brushes are soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing, the bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are great got them faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>That said the brushes themselves are okay, they do have an intense odor upon opening and some bristles come off upon face application like the foundation</li>
            <li>So inexpensive compared to my other brushes, but still great quality</li>
            <li>They are very soft and come with every brush you will need: They had a funny spell when I first received them, kind of a strong paint smell.</li>
            <li>I told them exactly where to go and told them to remember the name-Karity Cosmetics!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and look really nice in a short case on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I received them quick and they came packaged pretty well.</li>
            <li>do not get the whole &#x27;Vegan&#x27; thing because synthetic is more appropriate, but hey, if a single word helps sell something, go for it!</li>
            <li>Love my Karity brushes, really soft bristles and does its job really well.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular set of 32 brushes about a month from now on a friendâ€™s suggestion and I am indeed reaping the seeds of that!!...</li>
            <li>This set has been even  better than my Mac set so far , I would highly recommend ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li>Really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>when the package first came but that disappeared within a couple weeks</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quality and the amount of brushes for the low price.</li>
            <li>They did smell funny when I first bought them however after using brush wash that smell went away</li>
            <li>Loved these and ended up buying for a few close friends.</li>
            <li>There really are more brushes than I ever need for daily makeup, but for the price you really can&#x27;t be the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is the brush organizer case has a strong order</li>
            <li>They are super soft and the handles are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>They must have forgotten one, but there are so many others, I&#x27;m not really concerned.</li>
            <li>though these are fantastic especially for the price.</li>
            <li>is the icing on the cake for travel and fast clean-up.</li>
            <li>They shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This package arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>Item delivered fast and well packed.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really have a smell like</li>
            <li>They came in a day earlier than expected all 32 brushes arrived and they are really good quality.</li>
            <li>But the shipping was fast and the brushes seem of high quality.</li>
            <li>I really like my new brushes.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use the others for blush or products like that because I mainly bought them for eyeshadow use.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re unsure, get them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting such an amazing product since the other brush sets I looked at were around $75-$100.</li>
            <li>The hairs are so soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>everything i expected and more for a very low price.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and no bristles fall off.  </li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>feels very professional.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft!</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and functional!</li>
            <li>I LOVED how each brush has its own plastic cover which I&#x27;m keeping on them so that the makeup won&#x27;t dirty the bag-love!!</li>
            <li>With everyday use no hairs have fallen out and they are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>i was not going to like the brissels because the photo of them look hard, but once i got them, I am in love with them.</li>
            <li>I needed a new extra back up set of brushes for a very large wedding party I was doing a make up job for.</li>
            <li>So far she loves them.</li>
            <li>They are soft and do not fall apart.</li>
            <li>zero irritation on everyone from young to old.</li>
            <li>The brush kit came complete and comprehensive, with every brush you could want for your makeup.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and so far do not shed.</li>
            <li>the feel it&#x27;s like the professional sets.</li>
            <li>but the are soft</li>
            <li>Completely deterred me from buying this product.</li>
            <li>The bag the come with is cheesy, but the brushes are good.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>The brushes had a slight smell right out of the package, but one wash removed the smell completely!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how good it is since I don&#x27;t usually put on make up.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes to add to my brush collection, but after using them, I haven&#x27;t gone back to any of my old brushes.</li>
            <li>I was at first a bit cynical about this product since I had used such types of brushes earlier but none of the experiences were good enough but this one is indeed different!!</li>
            <li>I was at first a bit cynical about this product since I had used such types of brushes earlier but none of the experiences were good enough but this one is indeed different!!</li>
            <li>and it even has a few extra pockets so that I was able to add a few of my existing brushes to the collection &amp; the bag</li>
            <li>they came in on Thursday like expected I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes</li>
            <li>There were several of the brushes that were similar in size and shape so there could have been a little more variety for different uses, but that&#x27;s my only complaint so far.</li>

            <li> I told them exactly where to go and told them to remember the name-Karity Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and easy to clean.  </li>

            <li> Loved these and ended up buying for a few close friends.</li>
            <li> There really are more brushes than I ever need for daily makeup, but for the price you really can&#x27;t be the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the brush organizer case has a strong order</li>

            <li> They must have forgotten one, but there are so many others, I&#x27;m not really concerned.</li>

            <li> But the shipping was fast and the brushes seem of high quality.</li>
            <li> I really like my new brushes.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re unsure, get them.</li>

            <li> everything i expected and more for a very low price.</li>

            <li> I LOVED how each brush has its own plastic cover which I&#x27;m keeping on them so that the makeup won&#x27;t dirty the bag-love!!</li>
            <li> With everyday use no hairs have fallen out and they are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> i was not going to like the brissels because the photo of them look hard, but once i got them, I am in love with them.</li>
            <li> I needed a new extra back up set of brushes for a very large wedding party I was doing a make up job for.</li>
            <li> So far she loves them.</li>
            <li> They are soft and do not fall apart.</li>
            <li> zero irritation on everyone from young to old.</li>
            <li> The brush kit came complete and comprehensive, with every brush you could want for your makeup.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and so far do not shed.</li>
            <li> the feel it&#x27;s like the professional sets.</li>
            <li> but the are soft</li>
            <li> Completely deterred me from buying this product.</li>
            <li> The bag the come with is cheesy, but the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> The brushes had a slight smell right out of the package, but one wash removed the smell completely!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how good it is since I don&#x27;t usually put on make up.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes to add to my brush collection, but after using them, I haven&#x27;t gone back to any of my old brushes.</li>
            <li> I was at first a bit cynical about this product since I had used such types of brushes earlier but none of the experiences were good enough but this one is indeed different!!</li>
            <li> I was at first a bit cynical about this product since I had used such types of brushes earlier but none of the experiences were good enough but this one is indeed different!!</li>
            <li> and it even has a few extra pockets so that I was able to add a few of my existing brushes to the collection &amp; the bag</li>
            <li> they came in on Thursday like expected I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes</li>
            <li> There were several of the brushes that were similar in size and shape so there could have been a little more variety for different uses, but that&#x27;s my only complaint so far.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> They are fluffy and soft .</li>
            <li> only bad thing I have to say about them is the packaging smells really strongly of paint but leave them out 2 air out</li>
            <li> Only issue is when folded the case creases a few bushes</li>
            <li> so u have to store carefully</li>
            <li> A few are even duplicates - comments are verbatim yet from different &amp;#34;users&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other type.</li>
            <li> use them everyday.</li>
            <li> The only issue is they had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> a lot of brush sets I found have very stiff brushes, these aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not good quality, the bristles are not strong but gets the job done, I would grade it 76%</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is that the pouch they come in has a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very sad that after reading all 13 reviews it appears that only 1 is legitimate.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was using the wrong one or something because it wasn&#x27;t holding it on there</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> Brought brush from makeup company before and have been disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Really like these brushes! They are very soft and come with every brush you will need: They had a funny spell when I first received them, kind of a strong paint smell. Cleaned them and they are fine now. Also my set only had 31 brushes. They must have forgotten one, but there are so many others, I&#x27;m not really concerned. other than that, great purchase! Especially for the money!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, my wife is happy with it,i recommend it</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! use them everyday. They&#x27;re so soft! The case kinda smelled like paint but the brushes are perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about a month now and I just love them! The hairs are so soft and gentle on my skin. With everyday use no hairs have fallen out and they are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I didn&#x27;t like the smell (paint thinner) when the package first came but that disappeared within a couple weeks so it&#x27;s fine now. Another con is the brushes don&#x27;t have the brush names on them (I&#x27;m not a professional so I don&#x27;t know all the different names and uses for each brush). I wish they would label the brushes. They do include a link to there website where you can identify the brushes and I just used a sharpie to label them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though these are fantastic especially for the price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting such an amazing product since the other brush sets I looked at were around $75-$100. Definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Using these brushes for a production of  &amp;#34;Into The Woods&amp;#34; and the cast LOVES these brushes!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft &amp; nice but the package they come in has a strong plastic smell that lasts a week or so... The brushes hold eyeshadow nicely but some do not. Maybe I was using the wrong one or something because it wasn&#x27;t holding it on there &amp; also it was going below my eye too.  I have yet to use the others for blush or products like that because I mainly bought them for eyeshadow use. I have to say they work fairly well for that &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the quantity or the price!</li>
            <li> Loved my new set of brushes. Good quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for a friend so I&#x27;m not sure how good it is since I don&#x27;t usually put on make up. But the shipping was fast and the brushes seem of high quality.</li>
            <li> I love it. Happy I ordered</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these bushes!!</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for, it does the job for the price. Many variety of brushes but it&#x27;s not good quality, the bristles are not strong but gets the job done, I would grade it 76%</li>
            <li> Brought brush from makeup company before and have been disappointed. But these were very nice. Each brush seems substantial went being in use. Adhesive between fibers and stem seem strong and no loosening is feel between the two when held. Im a makeup artist so it nice to have a, nice set that didnt cost a lot of money. Would buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> everything i expected and more for a very low price. i am so impressed with these brushes and how soft they are. if you are on the fence about buying theseâ€” get them. you wont regret it.</li>

            <li> This brush set is so perfect!! It has all the brushes I need and it even has a few extra pockets so that I was able to add a few of my existing brushes to the collection &amp; the bag is the icing on the cake for travel and fast clean-up.

            <li> The best makeup brushes I have bought. They don&#x27;t shed plus they&#x27;re vegan which is always awesome!</li>
            <li> They shipped really fast. The quality is amazing, the bristles are extremely soft. The brushes had a slight smell right out of the package, but one wash removed the smell completely!</li>
            <li> Perfect, every brush that you need, good quality too</li>
            <li> If you love doing make up or are adding to your pro collection these are it!! I really like my new brushes. Great price, quantity and quality. The only downfall is the brush organizer case has a strong order so I left it out to air for a while before rolling it up and storing it</li>
            <li> This was a good buy. I was pleased with the quality and the amount of brushes for the low price. I needed a new extra back up set of brushes for a very large wedding party I was doing a make up job for. And I needed them asap. I received them quick and they came packaged pretty well. Each brush individually wrapped. There were several of the brushes that were similar in size and shape so there could have been a little more variety for different uses, but that&#x27;s my only complaint so far. Like I said, great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition.  The brushes are very soft and easy to clean.  I loved it.</li>

            <li> I bought these as a gift for one of my daughters. So far she loves them.</li>
            <li> Good quality. The bag the come with is cheesy, but the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> This set has been even  better than my Mac set so far , I would highly recommend ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes to add to my brush collection, but after using them, I haven&#x27;t gone back to any of my old brushes. These are a great variety for all my makeup needs. So inexpensive compared to my other brushes, but still great quality</li>
            <li> impressed by the packaging, love the variety</li>
            <li> Amazing quality brushes! They are super soft and the handles are very sturdy. the only complaint I have is that the pouch they come in has a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are soft and do not fall apart. I just did about a dozen girl&#x27;s makeup for prom and they worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have seen these brushes bring smiles and great times to a bunch of people now, she uses them for face painting. Easy to clean, holds plenty of pigment, zero irritation on everyone from young to old. Honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for much better for faces.&lt;br /&gt;I do not get the whole &#x27;Vegan&#x27; thing because synthetic is more appropriate, but hey, if a single word helps sell something, go for it!</li>
            <li> My Wife LOVES these brushes!!! Great quality at a great price! Thanks</li>
            <li> There great fir a starter set</li>

            <li> Love the brushes!!! I have already told several people about them and even had them feel them. I told them exactly where to go and told them to remember the name-Karity Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> Loved these and ended up buying for a few close friends. No shedding. Only issue is when folded the case creases a few bushes so u have to store carefully</li>

            <li> I love these brushes. They are fluffy and soft . a lot of brush sets I found have very stiff brushes, these aren&#x27;t. They are perfect !</li>
            <li> The brush kit came complete and comprehensive, with every brush you could want for your makeup. That said the brushes themselves are okay, they do have an intense odor upon opening and some bristles come off upon face application like the foundation brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them primarily for the vegan and eco-friendly factor and the extensiveness of the kinds of brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great. I bought them months ago and they are still in tact. They did smell funny when I first bought them however after using brush wash that smell went away</li>
            <li> This package arrived really fast. The smell of the package was quite strong but if locked away somewhere it&#x27;s not so bad. The brushes were great and it&#x27;s really cool how many there are!</li>
            <li> I am in loooove with my brushes!!! They came in a day earlier than expected all 32 brushes arrived and they are really good quality. I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re unsure, get them. You won&#x27;t regret it I promise..only bad thing I have to say about them is the packaging smells really strongly of paint but leave them out 2 air out and they r fine! Will def. order from them again!</li>
            <li> Item delivered fast and well packed. The case smelt like plastic (it is plastic) but went away after a couple of days. Brushes are soft and so far do not shed. Great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and functional! Love them!</li>
            <li> Product comes packaged really nicely. There really are more brushes than I ever need for daily makeup, but for the price you really can&#x27;t be the quality of these brushes. Great quality and very affordable!</li>

            <li> Granddaughter is trying theatrical make up says it was just what she needed</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried i was not going to like the brissels because the photo of them look hard, but once i got them, I am in love with them. I will never buy any other type.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. I wish each one had a number on it but the website is pretty good at helping sort them out. I already have my favorites. They don&#x27;t shed and look really nice in a short case on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I like the fact that it has its own case. Will buy from them again. Everything is as described. Very professional.</li>
