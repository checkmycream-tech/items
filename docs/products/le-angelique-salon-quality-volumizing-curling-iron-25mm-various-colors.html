            <li>and i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this clipless curling iron!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling wand!</li>
            <li>It makes a much better curl than the tapered ones do!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It works great and produces beautiful, fast curls.</li>
            <li>The Price was absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quicky and gives nicely defined waves.</li>
            <li>5 seconds contact is all it takes to get a nice curl or wave</li>
            <li>My burn is healing nicely.  </li>
            <li>The heat resitant glove is very useful and good good at insulating heat.</li>
            <li>so this puts this product on par with many popular curling irons.</li>
            <li>but if it does, it&#x27;s worth the war wound for a great looking head of hair.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly and the curls last for more than a day!</li>
            <li>Overall great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely, positively in LOVE with the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair look wavy, effortless, and sexy.</li>
            <li>I really, really love this product.</li>
            <li>My wife love it and still using it..</li>
            <li>There are so many curling irons on the market and Amazon, but I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the gloves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light but don&#x27;t mistake it for cheap material because i fell in love with the curls i got out of it.</li>
            <li>My fine, flat hair curls into beautiful curls and waves that remind me of the hair styles you see on the new popular TV shows!  </li>
            <li>I have fine textured, dense, hair.</li>
            <li>it has stayed through out the entire day and it is super wavy and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the try :)</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and the cord allows you so much extra room while you&#x27;re getting ready.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight and this helps my curls hold for 2 days or more.</li>
            <li>When you set the wand on the counter the hot end stays up and does not tilt towards the counter top.  </li>
            <li>I am a hair fanatic and love high end hair applicances to get the best results.</li>
            <li>super cheapy</li>
            <li>But other than that I completely love it!!</li>
            <li>This wand gets super hot!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t take too many stars off because my hair is pretty much un-curlable</li>
            <li>was hoping this hotter curling iron would be able to curl my hair, but it barely put a kink in it, and I held it in there for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was right and it came well packaged with two clips and a pair of gloves.</li>
            <li>Would recommend but it does help when you have the right product for curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price though because this strikes me as a very average curling iron.</li>
            <li>This keeps your hair from crimping at the end and leaves a nice, natural, soft look.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to style with it.</li>
            <li>when i first opened it i was really really disapointed!</li>
            <li>BE SURE TO USE THE GLOVE AND WEAR A SLEEVE ON THE SAME ARM!  </li>
            <li>The rod heats up within a couple minutes and it can get really, really hot.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>just so you know exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li>This curling iron right here is very affordable and yet curls so well.</li>
            <li>Just be careful as I&#x27;m sure you know this thing gets HOT!</li>
            <li>I have medium to long, thick hair and this curling iron works perfectly.</li>
            <li>suppose if you have similar hair to mine and have bought several other curling irons without being able to get a good all over curl, then you might not bother with this one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who likes loose sexy curls.</li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I really prefer this iron compared to one with a clamp.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and holds the curl.</li>
            <li>It heats up so fast and curls so well.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish that the barrel was a liiiittle bit bigger so that I could get a more relaxed &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look, but that&#x27;s more my fault for not knowing and picking this barrel size instead of a larger one.</li>
            <li>one came and the barrel was much slicker than my friend&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Holds curls very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with the glove</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do that it really really hurts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I paid $30 oppose to buying one at the mall or other sites for $100+</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to my friends, especially if they love to curl their hair and be very girly all the time.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is it cuts the curling time in half.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Love that it prevents dead ends or split ends from happenig because you don&#x27;t curl the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li>I love all the different styles I can achieve with it; from loose curls to thighter curls.</li>
            <li>This curling iron helps me achieve very natural waves.</li>
            <li>My friend has a 13-25mm tapered Le Angelique and the small barrel size works much better.  </li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair so the clip less works so much better for me</li>
            <li>It gives you the really pretty loose curl look and the beach waves too.</li>
            <li>I am not very good at doing my hair and I even found this curling iron to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly straight, very long, and there&#x27;s a lot of it on my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very thin and straight and curls never lasted for more than a couple of hours...</li>
            <li>The curls are very voluminous and can be large or small depending in the way you curl it.</li>
            <li>the wand barely touched my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had recently purchased the Remington pink pearl tapered wand and was looking for a straight wand instead.</li>
            <li>i have super thick hair</li>

            <li> keep my hair from easily slipping off.  </li>
            <li> Usually I just curl a piece of hair and then pull it straight down for a couple of seconds while it cools to give a less tight curl.</li>

            <li> I say this because usually my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls too well.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d saved my money :\</li>
            <li> Too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I selected the Zebra style bug got the black, which was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it was very difficult</li>
            <li> After getting over the learning curve of using a clipless curling iron (and badly burning myself a couple of times, ouch!)</li>
            <li> but I have a nasty burn on my arm and</li>

            <li> I was very surprised with this product! when i first opened it i was really really disapointed! it was way bigger than i thought and it felt super cheapy i didnt want to return it though because of how big of a hassle it would be so i tried it again this morning and i absolutely love it! i have super thick hair and it took me 12 minutes this morning to curl my hair! it has stayed through out the entire day and it is super wavy and gorgeous! GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely, positively in LOVE with the curling iron. I have long hair so the clip less works so much better for me and it curls it just the way I like it. I would definitely recommend this to my friends, especially if they love to curl their hair and be very girly all the time.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron. It gives you the really pretty loose curl look and the beach waves too. It is great. I love how it makes my hair look wavy, effortless, and sexy. It is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to style with it. I would recommend to anyone who likes loose sexy curls. And also my curls last! When i use this I haven&#x27;t yet put any holding spray on it and they last for hours. I say this because usually my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls too well. Great Buy. Look it up for styling on youtube.</li>

(I don&#x27;t often care to have my hair curled, but for occasional events it might be fun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you have similar hair to mine and have bought several other curling irons without being able to get a good all over curl, then you might not bother with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this clipless curling iron! My hair literally never can stay curled the entire day or two, but with this iron it does! Shipping was extremely fast and it works perfectly. Heats up fast and holds the curl. Overall great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. The size is perfect and the cord allows you so much extra room while you&#x27;re getting ready. It heats up so fast and curls so well. The curls are very voluminous and can be large or small depending in the way you curl it. This is an excellent deal and I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon it!</li>
            <li> I like this curling wand especially for the price. I selected the Zebra style bug got the black, which was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling wand! I had recently purchased the Remington pink pearl tapered wand and was looking for a straight wand instead. I came across this one and read all of the reivews on it and decided to go with it! I&#x27;m very glad I did too! It makes a much better curl than the tapered ones do! I was very happy with it! Just be careful as I&#x27;m sure you know this thing gets HOT! It&#x27;s so easy to burn yourself. There are no heat controls on this tool which is probably it&#x27;s only downfall. But other than that I completely love it!!</li>
            <li> After getting over the learning curve of using a clipless curling iron (and badly burning myself a couple of times, ouch!) I really, really love this product. It heats up quicky and gives nicely defined waves. I&#x27;ve had this for a year and it&#x27;s still working great. The only thing is I wish that the barrel was a liiiittle bit bigger so that I could get a more relaxed &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look, but that&#x27;s more my fault for not knowing and picking this barrel size instead of a larger one. Usually I just curl a piece of hair and then pull it straight down for a couple of seconds while it cools to give a less tight curl.</li>
            <li> Curls were ugly and fell out quickly. Wish I&#x27;d saved my money :\</li>
            <li> My wife love it and still using it.. Works great</li>
            <li> I have medium to long, thick hair and this curling iron works perfectly. With some hairspray my curls easily last two days. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had an Angelique curling iron like this and I wanted one just like it!&lt;br /&gt;This one came and the barrel was much slicker than my friend&#x27;s and it was very difficult&lt;br /&gt;to keep my hair from easily slipping off.  Too hard to use.  I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> Perfect size- gives wavy curls, not spirals</li>
            <li> I went to the mall and had someone at a NuMe kiosk curl my daughter&#x27;s hair with their wand and this didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  My friend has a 13-25mm tapered Le Angelique and the small barrel size works much better.  I am returning this and getting the smaller size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my curling wand twice which is all it took to learn how to get the look I wanted.  My fine, flat hair curls into beautiful curls and waves that remind me of the hair styles you see on the new popular TV shows!  The swivel cord is long, moves with you and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.  When you set the wand on the counter the hot end stays up and does not tilt towards the counter top.  This wand comes with a glove and 2 hair clips to use when separating your hair into sections.  BE SURE TO USE THE GLOVE AND WEAR A SLEEVE ON THE SAME ARM!  This wand gets super hot! 5 seconds contact is all it takes to get a nice curl or wave but I have a nasty burn on my arm and the wand barely touched my skin.  This is a great product and I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my friends.  I call it a wand instead of curling iron because there is no clip.  This keeps your hair from crimping at the end and leaves a nice, natural, soft look.  And FYI, I only burned myself because my husband was distracting me during curling.  My burn is healing nicely.  I don&#x27;t think it will scar but if it does, it&#x27;s worth the war wound for a great looking head of hair.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I would recommend it to all women! It works perfectly and the curls last for more than a day! My hair is very thin and straight and curls never lasted for more than a couple of hours... Now with This curling iron I can make them last for 2 days!!! It&#x27;s definitely worth the try :)</li>
            <li> Holds curls very well. Heated and ready to use in just a few minutes. Although its easy to burn yourself so use the glove they give you!!</li>
            <li> I am a hair fanatic and love high end hair applicances to get the best results. This curling iron right here is very affordable and yet curls so well. It is extremely light but don&#x27;t mistake it for cheap material because i fell in love with the curls i got out of it. The shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li> There are so many curling irons on the market and Amazon, but I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one. The price was right and it came well packaged with two clips and a pair of gloves. The rod heats up within a couple minutes and it can get really, really hot. Make sure you use the gloves. The curls it gives me lasts all day and sometimes I don&#x27;t even use hairspray!</li>
            <li> I bought this for Prom, assuming it would ship in the stated 2-3 weeks and it would arrive just in time. But instead it arrived in just days! The Price was absolutely amazing and I almost couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of the curling Iron when it arrived! It&#x27;s absolutely great and comes with clips to section out hair, and a heat resistant glove to protect your hand. Definitely a stupendous item and a must have!</li>
            <li> I have used the curling iron a couple of times and it works awesome! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it! I love all the different styles I can achieve with it; from loose curls to thighter curls. My favorite part is it cuts the curling time in half.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gives you those beachy waves. Love that it prevents dead ends or split ends from happenig because you don&#x27;t curl the ends of your hair. Would recommend but it does help when you have the right product for curls</li>
            <li> It gets really hot so you have get great curls in literally seconds.  Totally awesome.  I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with the glove and I do wear it because I have a tendency to burn myself.  Don&#x27;t do that it really really hurts (I got my shoulder, basically don&#x27;t curl topless).</li>
            <li> This is a great iron. I am not very good at doing my hair and I even found this curling iron to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this curling iron specifically because the description states that it is teflon coated. The product I received is not. The one in the picture is not the one that they send you, so if you are looking for that specific curling iron, don&#x27;t buy this one. I will say, however that I have no problem with the one they sent me. It works great and produces beautiful, fast curls. I decided to just keep the one they sent because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back and trying to find another one. The item number of the wand they send is [...] just so you know exactly what you are getting. Again for the record, I really like the one I received; I was simply disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I had expected.</li>
