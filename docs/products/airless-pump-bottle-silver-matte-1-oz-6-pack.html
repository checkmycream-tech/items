            <li>This is a great item.</li>
            <li>Great bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great how the bottom comes up pushing your product up to give you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottles themselves work great and are a good size for portability in a purse.  </li>
            <li>Really nice for traveling, doesn&#x27;t spill at all!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>

            <li>Good price without having to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still happy. :)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very pleased!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love these bottles!</li>
            <li>They also look really cute as well!</li>
            <li>I use these bottles for my homemade pre-shave oil and they are a handy size for massage oil too.</li>
            <li>I make my own moisturizer and at times give a bottle to friends and family</li>
            <li>Plus the bottle looks nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and intact and are A great value.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my freelance kit and love them.</li>
            <li>The ones that worked sucked the disc at the bottom up within 10-12 pumps, but the defective ones did not do so, even after more than 30 pumps (yes, I ensured the seal was air-tight for all of them).  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for my foundations that come with an open top bottle.  </li>
            <li>Size is great and really organized my carry on.</li>
            <li>Great pump bottle - very high-grade materials, cut well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>So now I have to unscrew the top and shake out the contents.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get 95% of the product in the bottles.</li>
            <li>The vacuum pump works great!</li>
            <li>They are ideal for use in air travel as they are only 1 ounce</li>
            <li>It works well for more liquidy serums AND for light cream formulations.</li>
            <li>(so they didn&#x27;t rub/scratch each other) and perfectly packed them.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li>Foundation now has a pump and will stay clean and germ free!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even bother, they stay together fine</li>
            <li>they work well and are very pretty to look at!  </li>
            <li>I painted the bottles as well in case of product light sensitivity.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous bottles-</li>
            <li>Since Vitamin C serums need to be protected from light exposure, I keep the bottles wrapped in foil between uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also really attractive, very sturdy, and pump really well.</li>
            <li>I have only used two of these, but I am happy to have the other 4 because I am a bit of a beauty product addict and they would also be great for travel bottles.</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited about using these bottles for my massages as they didn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on so many POSITIVE reviews.  </li>
            <li>That being the case know that this is a true report from my experience.  </li>
            <li>They work really well and are much better than using dropper bottles.  </li>
            <li>It really bothered me that a couple of my favorite foundations did not come with pumps</li>
            <li>I would assume some super glue would fix the problem.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these!</li>
            <li>The one thing I have to knock off the rating here is of course the apparent defective rate, but since Amazon was able to make up for that, I&#x27;ll give the full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Arbonne consultant and prefer to do my own travel bottle than spending extra $$$ for a travel kit that I can&#x27;t refill.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>They look nice and now I don&#x27;t just have several foundation bottles on my  vanity.  </li>
            <li>Good quality plastic, and the mechanism works as expected.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with a funnel or something that makes it easier to fill it up, but it&#x27;s worth the effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>So, once filled, the first several pumps are removing the air pocket at the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The glue isn&#x27;t very strong and the silver portion comes off without the white plastic cap when you want to take it off.</li>
            <li>This time, I was able to get at least 6 working bottles, as I had originally ordered, so I&#x27;m happy (though even the second order had some defective bottles).  </li>
            <li>These are awesome and my second round of purchasing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked these bottles so much, I ordered a second set after seeing the quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping cost was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping considering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware now after seeing on TV that some may be fraudulent.  </li>
            <li>Makes it sooo much easier to dispense my creams!</li>
            <li>The dispensing is very controlled too!</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the first set arrived 3 days after submitting my order and the second set in 2 days!!!</li>
            <li>I used a self-stick label and it worked okay, but would have been better if it came with some small ones.</li>
            <li>These bottles look very high end.</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my foundations,excellent product and fast shipping , thank you</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>I really like that they are reusable too.</li>
            <li>The original 6 pack I got seemed to have several defective bottles.  </li>
            <li>nearly naked, revlon colorstay, loreal true match.</li>
            <li>The main problem was the cap.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, a bit of super glue should fix it.</li>
            <li>High quality bottles.  </li>
            <li>I just scoop out all the lotion in the original container when it&#x27;s convenient for me, and then I can consolidate it in one of the these airless bottles for easy use anywhere (without having to wrestle the last bits out of a tube when I really need it), all while minimizing wasted product!  </li>
            <li>This is normal</li>
            <li>Once your product is used, and the bottom of  the bottle is now at the top of the container, you use something (like a chopstick) to press the bottom back down and voila, you are ready to wash and refill.</li>
            <li>These are great for putting my liquid make-up in + I can add a little hyaluronic acid in and a little boost of retinol!</li>
            <li>so I have 5 complete bottles and one without the pump to get the product out!</li>
            <li>However, I much prefer the quality of these pumps and the &amp;#34;squirt control.&amp;#34; I simply opt to use them for ointments, lotions, etc that I can squeeze or pour into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would purchase them again because of their reasonable cost and use the bottle for travel purposes only.  </li>
            <li>I can have all 4 products mixed together and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still slightly messy but effective enough to fill the bottle neatly enough to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to finally work on going through my large collection of lotions of various sizes, from store-bought bottles to small trial tubes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m going to go with opaque next time, though, as the clear acrylic can expose ingredients to light, which can cause them to break down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m afraid the air exposure of product transfer might have ruined any benefit to putting it into this kind of bottle in the first</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>Keeps foundation fresh since it is air tight, and prevents contamination.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used these for my homemade Vitamin C serums.  </li>
            <li>I just talked to my friends who I gifted this product too and everyone of them said there&#x27;s have broken or stopped pumping.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other airless pumps and at first I was concerned about the smaller refill-opening of these because of the difficulty of filling the pump with heavier creams.</li>
            <li>This little bottle is an invention of pure genius!  </li>
            <li>It apparently is a plastic white piece glued to a silver matte cover.</li>
            <li>You do have to pump it quite a few times to get the product to come out the first time.  </li>
            <li>The product is worthless as you can&#x27;t put the plastic piece back on to secure the top to prevent leaking.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are awesome and my second round of purchasing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other airless pumps and at first I was concerned about the smaller refill-opening of these because of the difficulty of filling the pump with heavier creams. However, I much prefer the quality of these pumps and the &amp;#34;squirt control.&amp;#34; I simply opt to use them for ointments, lotions, etc that I can squeeze or pour into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles came damaged. The plastic piece that is supposed to be glued to the metal cap was separated when I opened the pump. I looked inside and it was poorly glued together..</li>
            <li> Bought these for my freelance kit and love them. Keeps foundation fresh since it is air tight, and prevents contamination. They are refillable too so a great value.</li>
            <li> The original 6 pack I got seemed to have several defective bottles.  The ones that worked sucked the disc at the bottom up within 10-12 pumps, but the defective ones did not do so, even after more than 30 pumps (yes, I ensured the seal was air-tight for all of them).  I contacted Amazon about this to get an exchange, but instead, they ended up giving me a refund, which I used toward the purchase of another set.  This time, I was able to get at least 6 working bottles, as I had originally ordered, so I&#x27;m happy (though even the second order had some defective bottles).  The bottles themselves work great and are a good size for portability in a purse.  I always carry one with lotion so my hands aren&#x27;t left dehydrated after washing with harsh soaps in public restrooms.  However, these bottles seem to for basically any thick liquid, including make-up, hair products, etc.  I&#x27;ve been able to finally work on going through my large collection of lotions of various sizes, from store-bought bottles to small trial tubes.  I just scoop out all the lotion in the original container when it&#x27;s convenient for me, and then I can consolidate it in one of the these airless bottles for easy use anywhere (without having to wrestle the last bits out of a tube when I really need it), all while minimizing wasted product!  The one thing I have to knock off the rating here is of course the apparent defective rate, but since Amazon was able to make up for that, I&#x27;ll give the full 5 stars.  EDIT: So I guess Amazon takes it upon itself to take some random text from my review to use at the review title if I don&#x27;t provide a title.  I&#x27;ll leave the one it chose here, if only for its randomness and hilarity.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is an invention of pure genius!  It is perfect for my foundations that come with an open top bottle.  Side note...why do companies even use those bottles anyway?!  These bottles are the perfect solution to the problem though.  They are plastic, but they are sturdy.  You do have to pump it quite a few times to get the product to come out the first time.  This is normal so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not working...just be patient and keep pumping.  I have only used two of these, but I am happy to have the other 4 because I am a bit of a beauty product addict and they would also be great for travel bottles.</li>
            <li> These were great for storing/decanting cosmetics and samples. I took a star off because some of the lids inside tops would separate from the silver covering, which was an annoyance.</li>
            <li> My only experience with a refillable airless pump bottle. I chose airless over the regular pump bottles because it&#x27;s reassuring to know that my face products aren&#x27;t being exposed to air and I&#x27;ve read it does not have a lot of product waste. I painted the bottles as well in case of product light sensitivity. Easy to fill and use. Larger than I would like, but I suppose that&#x27;s the nature of the product. Fits in my liquid bag. Seems durable, but I have only had it for a few weeks. I will update when I use up the product and try to refill it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for transferring my liquid beauty products and lotions for convenient travel or to give foundation that came in pumpless bottles and upgrade. They arrived quickly and intact and are A great value.</li>
            <li> Inconvenient to fill, but works better than I thought it would. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m going to go with opaque next time, though, as the clear acrylic can expose ingredients to light, which can cause them to break down.</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited about using these bottles for my massages as they didn&#x27;t leak.  However, I had two bottles that didn&#x27;t have the hole for using the pump and after filling the bottle every month the decorative cap broke.  The product is worthless as you can&#x27;t put the plastic piece back on to secure the top to prevent leaking.  It is priced low enough if you want to use it as a travel bottle using it seldom.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use.  UPDATE:  I just talked to my friends who I gifted this product too and everyone of them said there&#x27;s have broken or stopped pumping.  I purchased this based on so many POSITIVE reviews.  I&#x27;m aware now after seeing on TV that some may be fraudulent.  That being the case know that this is a true report from my experience.  I would purchase them again because of their reasonable cost and use the bottle for travel purposes only.  I do not recommend them for daily use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the container itself, it&#x27;s actually great! The main problem was the cap. It apparently is a plastic white piece glued to a silver matte cover. The glue isn&#x27;t very strong and the silver portion comes off without the white plastic cap when you want to take it off. It gets annoying, but at least everything else is still functional. I would assume some super glue would fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Many expensive cosmetics come in containers that allow contamination and let in air (jars, plastic tubes, etc).  By transferring your products to these bottles, you keep out the air and can dispense just what you need.  Some people do not grasp the function:  the bottom of the container is drawn up with each pump.  So, once filled, the first several pumps are removing the air pocket at the top of the bottle.  Once your product is used, and the bottom of  the bottle is now at the top of the container, you use something (like a chopstick) to press the bottom back down and voila, you are ready to wash and refill.</li>
            <li> I use these for foundations that don&#x27;t come with pumps. Works great.</li>
            <li> I used these to downsize my face care system for travel, and they are perfect. Size is great and really organized my carry on.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, perfect &amp; convenient for my needs &amp; travel! Makes it sooo much easier to dispense my creams! I love this product! The only issue I had was getting product inside the bottles neatly enough since the hole is a bit small but I solved that problem by using a children&#x27;s medicine syringe to pump product inside the bottles. Still slightly messy but effective enough to fill the bottle neatly enough to use.  Just a minor inconvenience. I&#x27;m still happy. :)</li>
            <li> These are great for putting my liquid make-up in + I can add a little hyaluronic acid in and a little boost of retinol! I have also mixed another mixture that I use before I use my derma roller. I can have all 4 products mixed together and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also really attractive, very sturdy, and pump really well. Such a deal!</li>
            <li> These are fabulous bottles- they work well and are very pretty to look at!  I purchased mine from CosChemSupply and they bubble wrapped each individual bottle (so they didn&#x27;t rub/scratch each other) and perfectly packed them.  Shipping cost was very reasonable.  Also, fast shipping.  This is an excellent seller and product!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I use these bottles for my homemade pre-shave oil and they are a handy size for massage oil too. The best part about them is that they DO NOT LEAK! They are ideal for use in air travel as they are only 1 ounce and they are not glass. They are a very clear hard plastic. I do believe the polished chrome part is metal. The vacuum pump works great! The dispensing is very controlled too! I liked these bottles so much, I ordered a second set after seeing the quality. On top of all that, the first set arrived 3 days after submitting my order and the second set in 2 days!!! Very fast shipping considering it was USPS. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these little bottles!!</li>
            <li> They are great and the pumps work perfect. Looks so chic. I use it for my foundations,excellent product and fast shipping , thank you</li>
            <li> I use these for traveling, or to decant tub products into a pump. It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s held up on my travels. One of the tube tops had the silver cover came off-- the glue adhesive wore off. But it&#x27;s a non-issue because I can still open the pump. The only thing is that for carry-on travel, these tubes take up quite a bit of space.</li>
            <li> I love these bottles! For once my stuff didn&#x27;t leak while travelling! These were not hard to fill with liquids, but might be difficult with creams. The only thing I wish they had was a place to label what&#x27;s in them. I used a self-stick label and it worked okay, but would have been better if it came with some small ones. I definitely would buy these again and have recommended them to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. It pumps out my really thick creams and even hold my liquid products without them leaking! They also look really cute as well! I will definitely be purchasing more of these!</li>
            <li> You can get these through Alibaba for far less, but in a pinch Amazon works well.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Just what I need. Using it now.</li>
            <li> Great pump bottle - very high-grade materials, cut well. Wouldn&#x27;t be out of place holding designer makeup in Sephora. Hard to use because the opening&#x27;s so small -- took a lot of spatula-ing to get my gel lotion (Clinique Moisture Surge, which comes in a jar) into the bottle! - and I&#x27;m afraid the air exposure of product transfer might have ruined any benefit to putting it into this kind of bottle in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I hate that I couldn&#x27;t just buy 1 thru Prime as an add-on, rather than 6... I needed it immediately and bought the six-pack for Prime shipping. I have no idea what to do with the others.</li>
            <li> Great bottles. They work really well.</li>
            <li> Product works well and looks just like the picture. I only gave it 4 stars because one of the bottles came without the pump so I have 5 complete bottles and one without the pump to get the product out!</li>
            <li> Really nice for traveling, doesn&#x27;t spill at all!</li>
            <li> These bottles look very high end. I put Maybelline Superstay in these, some rimmell foundation, and a lotion. I tested them all by filling them with rubbing alcohol and each pumped. It&#x27;s great how the bottom comes up pushing your product up to give you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used these for my homemade Vitamin C serums.  They work really well and are much better than using dropper bottles.  Since Vitamin C serums need to be protected from light exposure, I keep the bottles wrapped in foil between uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Arbonne consultant and prefer to do my own travel bottle than spending extra $$$ for a travel kit that I can&#x27;t refill.&lt;br /&gt;And I refill the cream I want to use, not stuck with products I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably ordered 2 dozen by now. I make my own moisturizer and at times give a bottle to friends and family and they all content on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use for my face lotions while traveling.  Unfortunately, they do not work.  I pump and pump but nothing comes out.  So now I have to unscrew the top and shake out the contents.  Obviously I won&#x27;t use them again once they&#x27;re empty. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought these bottles to store my liquid foundation that came with no top. I.E revlon nearly naked, revlon colorstay, loreal true match. These bottles were perfect. I was able to get 95% of the product in the bottles. They are a hard plastic not glass. They look nice and now I don&#x27;t just have several foundation bottles on my  vanity.  I can&#x27;t wait to travel with them to see how they hold up. I will reorder from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a germ-a-phobe. It really bothered me that a couple of my favorite foundations did not come with pumps (I&#x27;m looking at you Revlon Colorstay!) Problem solved with these great airless pumps! I simply transfer my bottle of foundation into this airless pump, slap on a label and voila! Foundation now has a pump and will stay clean and germ free! Plus the bottle looks nice on my vanity. Highly recommend and will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> They look great-I got a price for them.  High quality bottles.  I have not used them yet, plan to soon-will leave an update.</li>
            <li> These are awesome bottles. Just sanitize them and they&#x27;re good to go. I&#x27;ve used them for custom liquid foundation and moisturizers</li>
            <li> Good price without having to buy in bulk. Good quality plastic, and the mechanism works as expected. As someone else mentioned, the silver cap sometimes does come separated from the white plastic cap. This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, a bit of super glue should fix it. I don&#x27;t even bother, they stay together fine once I manually put them back together.</li>
            <li> I like putting stuff all over my face (I plan on not aging, hah!) and I bought these to transfer each of my 5 billion steps to my skincare routine. It works well for more liquidy serums AND for light cream formulations. Works perfect and keeps my creams cleaner, since I don&#x27;t need to stick my fingers into the jars anymore. I wish it came with a funnel or something that makes it easier to fill it up, but it&#x27;s worth the effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these are airless pumps, I don&#x27;t think they would be refillable. At this price, it&#x27;s all good. (Please don&#x27;t stop making them, though.)</li>
            <li> They do the job. I really like that they are reusable too.</li>
