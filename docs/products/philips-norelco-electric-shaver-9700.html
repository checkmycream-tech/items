            <li>At this point I was already convince that this was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever used.&lt;br</li>

            <li>My husband was very happy with it.</li>

            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver did a great job while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>great shaver.</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>It should shave and give happy ending for that price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Quite honestly now, after using it, I know and feel that it is the perfect weight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shaver didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin, which was great, but it also didn&#x27;t do a great job shaving for me.</li>
            <li>and that is a great feature for travelers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it took some time, but I&#x27;m extremely happy with this Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this shaver.</li>

            <li>He is so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am completely happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>the Braun and Panasonic have great built in cutters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great irritant of the Norelco is the position of the power</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It looks very nice in the bathroom but does take up a lot of space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The shaver comes with a very nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>the fact that it cleans itself is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator is a very nice feature.  </li>
            <li>I am going to return it and get the best shave/with a BUILT in sideburn trimmer, and I&#x27;ve used norelco customer since i was able to shave.</li>
            <li>This is the 4th Norelco electric shaver I have had and easily the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Amazing shaver and a great shave.</li>
            <li>Good, my boyfriend likes it.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, save your money.</li>
            <li>It turns out you can use a good amount of pressure without stalling the blades at all.</li>
            <li>Norelco S9721 was well packaged and included a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fairly regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It should shave as good as any product you can buy.</li>
            <li>The shave was good in about 50% of the areas--especially well on the neck area</li>

            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: It has been a month using the product, and it is still performing as good as it did out of the box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: It has been a month using the product, and it is still performing as good as it did out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I called Philips and received good service and they will replace the cleaning device and FedEx it to me</li>
            <li>you are wise, go to the dollar store and get theirs.</li>
            <li>shave isn&#x27;t as good as a Gillette blade</li>
            <li>think both are good choices</li>
            <li>think both are good choices though.</li>
            <li>This seems to strike a good balance between convenience and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shaved so good</li>
            <li>This seems like a good idea and a means of insuring continued quality shaves.</li>
            <li>I found a couple of areas the shaver wasn&#x27;t getting as good, but learned how to improve the performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have to spend a good chunk of cash anyway to start shaving again, I&#x27;m going to give the Braun 7 series</li>
            <li>Good Shaver.  </li>
            <li>So to be fair</li>
            <li>I thought originally since the hair on your face grows in all directions that moving in a circular motion would have the best benefits, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one time I used a shaving gel I found that it didn&#x27;t clean quite as well, despite having rinsed it beforehand, however it works perfectly otherwise.</li>

            <li>So I was very interested in trying out the best of the Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>Great close shave, love the cleaning system as well.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied .</li>
            <li>( I LOVE AMAZON HAPPY FACE DANCE).</li>
            <li>and I was pleased and  happy with it  </li>
            <li>Great product, but would be better if the trimmer was not a separate piece.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: it is a nice razor with a lot of good features.</li>
            <li>This cleaning process is easy and works great.  </li>
            <li>great close smooth shave..</li>
            <li>This one just shaves amazingly.  </li>
            <li>this is an amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is nice to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-it has a nice and convenient cleaning</li>
            <li>did not like the XL model either but have liked all others and wore them out ( used for years).</li>
            <li>shaver is great on the jawline and chin, as far as fitting the contours and molding to it perfectly.</li>
            <li>in all, I do think it is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>in all, I do think it is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>so here is the review in his own words:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels lightweight and balances nicely in hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver also comes with a travel bag, which is nice.</li>
            <li>9721 is a nice piece of kit.</li>
            <li>The feature is handy when traveling to prevent the shaver from inadvertently turning on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t even notices the size - being so thrilled with the self-cleaning aspect of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high-end electric razor which really will shave as close as a blade, this is your \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; device.very impressed.</li>
            <li>I really liked it and thought it was a closer shave.</li>
            <li>No longer a choice as to what kind of wash.</li>
            <li>The travel lock is a nice feature too.</li>
            <li>No visible way to know the charging or cleaning status, if you have nice lighting&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel lock is a nice feature too.</li>
            <li>No visible way to know the charging or cleaning status, if you have nice lighting&lt;br</li>
            <li>have the kind of face</li>
            <li>Great purchase and Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s a gadget to clean it too.</li>
            <li>, u can time this very easily.</li>
            <li>shaver charges unbelievably fast, which is very handy for my husband who often forgets to charge it!&lt;br /&gt;-It holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very interesting item that will make the man of the house feel just like he is very special.  </li>
            <li>own and use many shavers - collecting them is a hobby.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I am biased towards these types of razors - having used them for so many years.</li>
            <li>With the professed greater travel and angles of this I hoped it would be more effective, since I really liked the 3 head design they&#x27;ve had for a while and the one I ended up returning</li>
            <li>It is by far the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It was nice to see a company not try to get you to use it more often so they can make more money on the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So the way I see it using the auto clean system is a good way to abuse and prematurely wear out the battery.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about it is it&#x27;s intelligent:</li>
            <li>PHILPS razor is also very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love the fast, clean, non-irritating shave, and am impressed by the improvements over the 8000 series.</li>
            <li>I love the fast, clean, non-irritating shave, and am impressed by the improvements over the 8000 series.</li>
            <li>The shave was very smooth again, and after accidentally cumping the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; button - he found out it works even better at a faster speed.  </li>
            <li>Gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;-I have to re-shave everywhere with my Norelco Arcitec, which I love, and it has a sideburn trimmer built-in to flip up when you like</li>
            <li>outstanding close shave.</li>
            <li>So much better then the Norelco</li>
            <li>if it can be equipped with one,it is better.</li>
            <li>Love my shaver9700</li>
            <li>Based on the feel alone, I would have guessed it cost $75 at most.</li>
            <li>While the Norelco is no slouch, the Braun just fits my hand better and is easier to grip.</li>
            <li>This 9700 series shaver was interesting because we also tried the 9300 series.</li>
            <li>rounded heads move in more directions</li>
            <li>packaging isn&#x27;t Amazon Frustration Free!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Philips Norelco can do better than this one ?</li>
            <li>I will say that the more I use it, the better i like the results, so there may be some truth to their claims.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did work better after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many limitations and mediocrities for a product that is priced in the &#x27;elite&#x27; category.will have to stop and rinse</li>
            <li>Many limitations and mediocrities for a product that is priced in the &#x27;elite&#x27; category.</li>
            <li>We especially liked that it has different speeds and comfort levels.</li>
            <li>My husband enjoyed (yes, he actually &#x27;enjoyed&#x27;) reading the manual.</li>
            <li>Much more so than the one</li>
            <li>It was the top of the line, and I never tried a rotary shaver before, so I went for</li>
            <li>I realized that unlike Panasonic, you have to use a circular motion to get the best shave, and with foam you can actually move the shaver quicker against your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have many comments regarding the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>If you have the patience for the initial period, you might find this to be the best shaver ever.</li>
            <li>I am deducting 1 point for breaking too soon and 1 point for warranty hassles, because if you ever have to deal with warranty, it is going to be a nightmare for you.he patience for the initial period, you might find this to be the best shaver ever.</li>
            <li>The shaver is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The directions say it’s OK for the shower.</li>
            <li>Love the way it contours my face giving the cleanest shave yet with the shortest duration.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best shaver</li>
            <li>It pulls the hairs out most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is much better than my Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to Panasonic (or most foil-type).&lt;br /&gt;Philips is better at:&lt;br /&gt;noise</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic is better at:&lt;br /&gt;closeness of shave&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic is better at:&lt;br /&gt;closeness of shave&lt;</li>
            <li>use the same shave cream that I use with my Merkur safety razor with the 9721, a brand called Prorasso, with excellent results.</li>
            <li>The cleaning is automated and is a more thorough cleaning than rinsing the razor heads under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or more like the lack thereof.</li>
            <li>On days I have an important meeting or event and need a tidy look I&#x27;ll stick with my Merkur safety</li>

            <li>On days I have an important meeting or event and need a tidy look I&#x27;ll stick with my Merkur safety</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure yet</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t quite the best I&#x27;ve used, but it does work well enough and its convenience can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure yet</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t quite the best I&#x27;ve used, but it does work well enough and its convenience can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s backed by a 2 year warranty, which shows they are equally confident of their product.</li>
            <li>Outstanding electric shaver</li>
            <li>:  Those that are thinking of this razor better think twice now.  </li>
            <li>I love the automatic cleaning system on this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Braun electric shaver user for many years.</li>
            <li>This is OK, but if you&#x27;ve gone on a trip and forgot the attachment, you&#x27;ll be out of luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And while I like the Norelco&#x27;s design for home use, the Braun is a bit more compact for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li>Always the top of the line.</li>
            <li>so I got the top of the line Braun at the time (series7).</li>
            <li>Best Buy matched, so I went that way as I might have wanted to return, if necessary, to brick and mortar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best shave possible</li>
            <li>If it holds up, it&#x27;s better than sliced</li>
            <li>Best shave possible</li>
            <li>If it holds up, it&#x27;s better than sliced</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is also significantly more thorough than my Braun was.</li>
            <li>I just take the razor top off and rinse that assembly from inside.</li>
            <li>my needs are more than just \\&quot;does well on the neck and jawline.\\</li>
            <li>love cleaning systems,</li>
            <li>It just seems that it keeps my razors and the blades working better, longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for something better.  </li>
            <li>I figured I should test it on my face, since that&#x27;s where probably 95% or more people will be using this razor.  </li>
            <li>The re-designed the shaving head which makes it much more flexible, easier to manuever around your face and providing a smoother cut.  </li>
            <li>I wondered what could possibly be so much better in this shaver</li>
            <li>In addition, the Braun cleaner is faster and more hygienic than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>Unlike my Arctec, the top blade assembly comes off on to facilitate cleaning.  </li>
            <li>very smooth close shave  ,, for someone still interested with Philips Norelco Good luck ,,</li>
            <li>Shaver is just superb - but the Smart Clean device stopped working - the pump that fills the top of the basin to clean the shaver head ceased functioning.</li>
            <li>As for the price... I am still not convinced that ANY razor is worth 350 bucks, but it is a great gift and a nice splurge on yourself, if you don&#x27;t mind spending that much.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It comes with a trimming/ shape up blade as well that works pretty good.</li>
            <li>The feeling of menthol-laden lather and a blade sliding on your face is just as good as a hot shower to start</li>
            <li>u can travel very easily with this machine, the cleaner is pretty good, it leaves the machine, perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the machine is also easy manually, just pop the top with the blades and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>best environment for an e-razor is a dry face with no moisture.</li>

            <li>And it was actually a nice razor, but it just didn&#x27;t do a great job, especially on my head.  </li>
            <li>The thing is amazing and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Given those faults, I think 4 stars is more accurate, and could even make a case for 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>So far fastest is working great.</li>
            <li>And this one is just so much more comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work any better than cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very nice-looking, with its sleek design, and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>It is the best at conforming than any other razor I have tried.</li>
            <li>It automatically cleans with a solution, drys the head, and charges the battery to full strength!  </li>
            <li>shaver head comes apart easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to switch between the shaver and trimmer head, but highlighting the alignment tab on both head and shaver would make it easier to see and align for assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>it seems to charge very quickly.</li>
            <li>(Although that did tell me that the speed buttons are easy to bump.)  </li>
            <li>head of the shaver pops off easily and can be replaced with the included trimmer.</li>
            <li>head of the shaver pops off easily and can be replaced with the included trimmer.</li>
            <li>Years ago when I was in the Navy one of the shipmates had an electric razor and I can recall being envious of his being able to keep clean shaven without leaving the locker room.  </li>
            <li>In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products.</li>
            <li>have learned that people have some really strong feelings about shaving gear.  </li>
            <li>They feel good on the skin too, they glide, and do not get hot, even when using it for the full hour.</li>
            <li>Braun changed the way they manufactured their replacement blades on this particular razor and consequently ruined what was good about it.</li>
            <li>particular electric razor is almost as good as a bladed one.</li>
            <li>Norelco sets a new high in terms of rotary shaver performance with a device that provides for a truly wonderful shave.</li>
            <li>It is a good razor, but I don&#x27;t know why it is priced so high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver delivers a high quality shave, particulalry good for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>That remains true after using this shaver (the 9700), but it&#x27;s not because of the shave quality - this shaver gives a slightly better shave than the Series 7.</li>
            <li>The Norelco looks and feels cheap; the Braun looks more stylish and certainly feels better made.</li>
            <li>To get the best shave with the norelco, trim your beard slightly to get it within 1-3 days growth, then shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To get the best shave with the norelco, trim your beard slightly to get it within 1-3 days growth, then shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are three speeds available and the shaver is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Shaves are good, but not as close as a blade, a tad better than the series 7 braun which for me the neck is a bare, but lots of money now for a shave and one has to think of the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for 17 years (ever since I started shaving), buying the latest one that comes out each time, and have been pretty satisfied until now.</li>
            <li>It cleans fine though.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer, if you can find it in the drawer, works fine.</li>
            <li>For me there is a fine line between a close shave and the feeling that I&#x27;ve just run the fine side of a box grater over my neck.</li>
            <li>love it very much!</li>
            <li>but I was satisfied the very first</li>
            <li>You can also easily clean the shaver with water since it is waterproof, but the cleaning solution works a bit better; the solution lasts for 3 months and refills are about $5.50 a cartridge - but again note this is OPTIONAL, you can just use water to clean this waterproof razor if you&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they take up a lot of space on a sink, so unless you have a large vanity/bathroom, you might not be happy with the large size of the charging dock.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth, close shave with it, it is easy to clean and the heads are easily interchangable.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap beard trimmer years ago and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Performance-wise, it shaves a bit better than the $100ish razor I purchased for Christmas years ago, but at a pretty steep price!</li>
            <li>but the shaver surely got wet and worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never spent more than $150 for a unit, but I am very pleased that I had an opportunity to get this unit.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The Norelco looks cheap, sounds cheap, takes forever</li>
            <li>The Norelco looks cheap, sounds cheap, takes forever</li>
            <li>and you do not feel anything except the smooth glide across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each of the 3 blades move independently, allowing for great contours.</li>
            <li>I am happy that Norelco&#x27;s system is back on track after I had 2 below par shavers from them about 5 years ago and went elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>They are available in a 2-pack from the Philips website for $11.99 which includes free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Shaves my legs and armpits clean and easy with water on level two</li>
            <li>I think that is how it&#x27;s supposed to sound</li>
            <li>smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is quite a snazzy shaver with lots of nice features to</li>
            <li>Victor tried this Phillips Norelco electric razor he would have had to spend a lot more than he did for Remington, but it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li>The follicle then retreats below the skin line for a close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery power is fantastic...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery power is fantastic...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I will find two slower settings to be useful since I don&#x27;t want to stretch out my shaving time any longer, and my skin is so insensitive :)  </li>
            <li>The cartridges sell on Philips&#x27; website for $17 for a 3 pack, with free shipping, and they recommend replacement every three months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too light.</li>
            <li>If you like gels, I would wash after each shave, My face feels completely smooth.</li>

            <li>Close smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>; See how smooth my face feels?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>It took me 8 or 10 passes to get it to feel smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps the blades free of debris and skin oils.</li>
            <li>is its one and only great advantage</li>
            <li>the norelco did a good job at clearing most of my beard however, the spots it shaved well, it left irritated.</li>
            <li>We opened the box, which is very well packaged with plenty of cardboard to keep it safe in transit, and then he enjoyed putting it together and charging it.</li>
            <li>The directions say it may take 3 weeks of daily use to get a really close perfect shave</li>
            <li>But, so far so good...</li>
            <li>The rotary heads of the 9721 are far superior in my opinion to the foil shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rotary heads of the 9721 are far superior in my opinion to the foil shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am once again using my five-year-old Braun shaver and getting a far superior</li>
            <li>Its ok if you have just  super quick shave to do,</li>
            <li>Its ok if you have just  super quick shave to do,</li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first, the 9721 is most definitely superior to my old Braun foil shaver.</li>
            <li>Head popped off easy for quick cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.  </li>
            <li>They are clean, easy, and quickly get the job done.</li>
            <li>The shaver is attractive; coated in a piano-black polished plastic housing with a sturdy black rubber backing where your hand makes the most contact.</li>
            <li>Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster.</li>
            <li>~ You&#x27;re Worth It!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user for almost 40 years and am a fan of the original &amp;#34;triple</li>
            <li>Now, you can no longer buy the original replacement blades for it and</li>
            <li>The instructions were straightforward.</li>
            <li>In normal circumstances I would agree with it, but the root cause of the blades no longer working is THEIR OWN CLEANING</li>
            <li>It seemed the triple heads were better designed for concave surfaces like you&#x27;d get on the face or neck, but it didn&#x27;t do so great on the convex surface of my skull, so I returned it and went back to a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Use shaving cream, get a really smooth shave, and clean up that razor in a jiffy with the special cleaning device that comes with the outfit.  </li>
            <li>Cuts close, quick, and comfortably.</li>
            <li>It does not do a clean shave</li>
            <li>With the exception of this one, they all had the flaw of not providing a clean shave in all the areas of my face</li>
            <li>When you finish shaving, it reminds you to clean it with a blinking indicator that looks like a faucet, so you do not forget.</li>
            <li>Bear in mind that your device will be physically clean, but not disinfected.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to replace the cleaning cartridge every three months, but I suppose that would depend on the environment the cartridge is in and how often you clean the shaver with it.</li>
            <li>alcohol and heat to completely clean out the razor.</li>
            <li>The best I could come up with for deep cleaning my old cutter heads and foils was to detach the head and separate all the pieces and repeatedly pour boiling water over them and soak them.</li>
            <li>While the cleaning station is a nuisance to store in a crowded bathroom, and could be costly to maintain, depending on how often you use it--it definitely gives a nice cleaning and refreshing to your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I clean the shaver every 4th or 5th use, although it says do it every time.</li>
            <li>And since the liquid is part of the cartridge, there&#x27;s no water reservoir to have to fill and clean out sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the auto clean function.</li>
            <li>a detachable beard trimmer - pulling off the main heads and attaching the beard trimmer is very easy.  </li>

            <li>most electric razors I have used, this one charges up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a manual razor, but I&#x27;m extremely surprise and impressed by how close it really is.</li>
            <li>The Norelco people have made this item special in every way.  </li>
            <li>the liquid in the special device for cleaning needs to be replaced every three (3) months.  </li>
            <li>The 9721 has a nice, sturdy weight that strikes a good balance between feeling significant but not heavy enough to tire your hand while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is easy to clean and can be done with hot water.  </li>
            <li>White LEDs that are not too bright are on the read-out.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaver I have had that actually does a great job on my neck and on all of the curves of my face.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a bigger area that the shaving blades are in, so it can be tricky to do that and get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Otherwise there is a full two-year warranty.</li>
            <li>There are many complexities with this shaver, but once you learn what everything means, it really is an easy-to-use and helpful appliance.</li>

            <li>nice thing as far as charging, is that you can use it on 100v - 240v outlets and the cord automatically uses whichever voltage is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice thing as far as charging, is that you can use it on 100v - 240v outlets and the cord automatically uses whichever voltage is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Like most modern electric razors of the high-end variety, this one has a sizeable charging station with a cleaning function.</li>
            <li>At a full charge, I can get four shavings out of it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested the cleaner yet for obvious reason, but I expect it to be good if not excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the full review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had avoided Philips rotary shavers since I tried them 15 years ago and they chewed up my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d shave with nothing but the 9721 for a full 3-weeks to fully acclimate my skin and shaving routine to the electric shaver.</li>
            <li>A full charge takes about an hour and that will translate into about 50-minutes of continuous shaving time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quiet while it runs, which is good just in case you need to shave while your spouse is still sleeping.</li>
            <li>This lasts 10 minutes, before a 4 hour drying cycle begins, and during the full time your shaver is also being charged.</li>
            <li>Unlike my arctec, you have a better feel for how much charge you have.  </li>
            <li>My husband wanted one with an indicator in front to tell you when the charge is full.</li>
            <li>a quick aside to those who are new to electric shavers and are wondering if you have to pay this much to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>all it can be easily cleaned with hot water.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, quick, gentle and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Smooth, quick, gentle and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>But given the price, I think they should have done a better job with the overall build quality, and certainly a MUCH better job with the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>But given the price, I think they should have done a better job with the overall build quality, and certainly a MUCH better job with the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a need to use that too often, but as I use it more I can come back and update the review with more on that accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charges quickly</li>
            <li>, I wish it was built in like the older models.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price I am glad I bought this razor and hope to get another 15 years out of it.</li>
            <li>The unit charges quickly and provides a glowing LCD panel which displays the remaining percentage of charge.</li>
            <li>Technology is nice but it is not an answer for a shaver that has to shave smooth and deep.</li>
            <li>Awesome shaver -- I have never been able to use Norelco before as it always caught my hairs wrong.  </li>
            <li>The shave is super close with no razor burn.</li>
            <li>I was waiting more for the high price that I paid</li>
            <li>I never knew any other shavers, but I seemed to get a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>I believe if they offered the same shaver with and without the system, they might sell more of this shaver and certainly have more satisfied customers that are getting exactly what they need.  </li>
            <li>then this is a very nice shaver that gets really, really close to replicating a traditional razor</li>
            <li>then this is a very nice shaver that gets really, really close to replicating a traditional razor</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a pretty smooth  and close shave and there hasn&#x27;t been any irritation while using it.</li>
            <li>The numbers are large (½ inch tall) and easy to see.</li>
            <li>It says to give it 3 weeks because your skin/hair needs to adapt to the new system and it states you will have better luck, closer shaves, etc as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Smart Clean System works well to clean and lubricate shaver.  </li>
            <li>After each use, you clean it by popping off the heads and holding the shaver and heads under hot running water, and then air drying.</li>
            <li>The shaver was quiet, very light to hold and very flexible - able to maneuver in and out of crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Higher cost does not mean better</li>
            <li>it takes about a week for the skin to get used to ithe new blades, the main cutter now has a z pattern, but it works just as nice as the old cutters, but it seams to grab more stuble, and more hair in each revolution, so in effect the machine is a little faster than the old one, messing around with the speed of the blades also helps depending on your skin, so great idea norelco...</li>
            <li>The 9700 is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>even though there was a LOT of shaving to do - he ended up with a very close, smooth shave and the shaver still had 83% percent power.  </li>
            <li>If the price point is something you can handle, I really don&#x27;t think you are going to find another shaving system that will outperform this one.t keeps the blades free of debris and skin oils.</li>
            <li>Braun wins the build quality metric by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is pretty useful and cool....</li>
            <li>The kind you can&#x27;t see, but you can definitely feel.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t find it all that useful as of</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t find it all that useful as of</li>
            <li>this one is negligible.e of such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like $100 less would be a more fair and realistic price.</li>
            <li>It feels solid, buttons are responsive, and the display is nice and bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was true for about the first month.</li>
            <li>The old Philips shavers are much better.</li>
            <li>It was definitely the closest shave I ever had and felt smooth most of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when things keep using the same power plugs, since that makes it easier to keep my bathroom neat.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning systems that comes with the razor is innovative but it takes up considerable space in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>, Panasonic delivered the most close shave I have ever experienced with any other shaver on my entire  life , no irritation</li>
            <li>Still, the cleaning fluid and associated stand provides a nice way to thoroughly clean the shaver every few weeks, which is sufficient if you&#x27;ve been good about washing it out each day or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my testing, I find this believable, and found this new unit leaves me clean shaven a minute or two faster than my older shaver.</li>
            <li>I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>It fits your hand in the right places and is lightweight.</li>

            <li>and it cleaned it right up.  </li>
            <li>and I think the manual says the razor may not work right for a week or two if you do this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s right where my thumb rests during</li>
            <li>The head unit is made of cheap material, not as good as the #12 heads of the previous system and boy do they cost a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning solution does seem to be more effective than boiling water, though it would probably take a few runs through the system to get them clean as new.</li>
            <li>If you have the funds, the man in your life will really enjoy this high end razor.  </li>

            <li>I have previously been very happy with their products, but this experience has me made reluctant to purchase from the company in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, the Norelco 9700 has finally caught up with and in my opinion surpassed straight razors in terms of closeness of shave, and it does so while offering a more comfortable shaving experience.  </li>

            <li>This has by far been my favorite, most reliable, and longest lasting shaver till now.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, but the one step down</li>
            <li>The second day I started with &#x27;medium&#x27; and found it worked much better, but still not quite good enough, so halfway through I switched to &#x27;high&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The heads glide amazingly well across my face, far better than any other rotary I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With less bright lights it is readable.</li>
            <li>This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor for my husband since he loved his previous Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>i went back to my last norelco triple header shaver and am happy again.</li>
            <li>That seems reasonable for the preventative care and maintenance of such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>9700 model boasts that it cuts 20% more hair in a single pass, making for a faster, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Its surprisingly quiet and very comfortable.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving is very straight forward with the 9721.</li>
            <li>It did a fantastic job on my head, better than any other razor I had tried.  </li>
            <li>If you forget, or just do not want to clean it regularly and the heads get too clogged up, an indicator light will tell you so.</li>
            <li>and I could empty the whiskers easily before needing to rinse, the heads on this unit do not come apart easily and the trimmer head is a separate head</li>
            <li>I found the best results shaving with my face dry before getting into the shower as that provides an even shave as I missed less spots than using a disposable razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those looking to upgade their electric shave.  </li>
            <li>far - this shaver is a huge hit.  </li>
            <li>I really like and prefer Norelco Shavers, generally, and have used them for many years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has a &#x27;choice&#x27; of 3 speeds, which you can try but set once, most likely.</li>
            <li>So, I must shave twice, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended to rinse it under hot running water after each shave which I do.</li>
            <li>but they could just produce a better trimmer that attaches to the same unit.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada.</li>
            <li>There really was NO comparison!</li>
            <li>First time use was with 5 days growth.</li>
            <li>sound:&lt;br /&gt;While neither are what I would call noisy, the Norelco is certainly more quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve used that beats the Braun 7 in shave quality.</li>

            <li>My skin thanks you!</li>
            <li>I have tried several electric shavers over the years, but have never been satisfied with one.</li>
            <li>first thought was, &amp;</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that the blade moves independently of the silver ring around the blade - so that ring moves to accommodate you</li>
            <li>instruction booklet says to not be discouraged by lack of close shave or if you do have irritations at first.</li>
            <li>There is a great digital display from 0-100 which shows how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li>, does not take any longer to shave than the higher speeds.  </li>
            <li>Manual cleaning the shaver between shaves lets the system do a better job and extends the fluid and filter life.  </li>
            <li>This razor never irritated my skin and gave me consistent, zero stubble shaves for over 7 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Travel Lock and Carrying Case: I somehow accidentally pressed the travel lock while shaving the first time.</li>
            <li>This is the first Norelco I have owned, and the first razor I have owned with the triple rotary shaving heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying it for about 3 weeks now and find after I do my first pass of shaving I have to another pass</li>
            <li>Panasonic is only slightly better than Braun (foil-type shaver) for my face in terms of closeness of shave.</li>
            <li>When the shaver is first turned on the default power setting is on the &#x27;medium&#x27; setting and can be adjusted with the &#x27;+/-&#x27;</li>
            <li>my first week of using the 9721 I&#x27;ve carved out a schedule of daily rinsing the razor and then using the SmartClean for a more thorough wash once a week.</li>
            <li>at least that&#x27;s what I experienced during my 21-day challenge.rently $46 on Amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li>at least that&#x27;s what I experienced during my 21-day challenge.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really big - providing even more clutter on our bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>To put in another words, for the first time in over fifty years, I have not used a blade and shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving daily in excess of fifty years, mostly with blades and shaving gel.</li>
            <li>First of all, in the one that I received the website is improperly cited.  </li>
            <li>I have predominantly preferred electric shavers over razors for the last 15 or more years.</li>
            <li>Though I was very satisfied with my old model, this is definitely an improvement, and if experience is any indicator, Philips makes dependable, long-lasting products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Look at the reviews of the razor heads first before anyone buys....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied with the Braun as I feel the shave isn&#x27;t quite close enough.</li>
            <li>The only difficulty I encountered is that the rotary blades don&#x27;t quite reach the area of my top lip just underneath my nose.</li>
            <li>At Norelco customer service&#x27;s request, I tried scrubbing with the brush that comes with Norelco razors, running under hot water and scrubbing, and soaking in boiling hot water until the water cooled - with the razors and foils removed).</li>
            <li>My first razor was a Braun.</li>
            <li>First were two ring, then three blades emerged.</li>
            <li>pretty scene.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty scene.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Norelco S9784 provides a shave that truly is as close as a blade, The cleaning system&#x27;s fluid is based on some soap-type substance rather than alcohol, and I think works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I may not have bought even though I was interested.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Panasonic razors back in 2011 when I got an ES8249S.  </li>
            <li>That was when I tried my first triple headed Philips, the Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D.  </li>
            <li>I currently use a Panasonic ES-LA93K which I reviewed here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s been my favorite razor ever.  </li>
            <li>I love the design of it, the feel, the motion sensor that shows you the battery life as soon as you pick it up, and how quiet it is.  </li>
            <li>They are signficantly improved and delvier a close and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw the product listing for the Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that had three speed settings.</li>
            <li>Norelco has a cutter that you must remove the shaver head first and snap it on.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good with heavy beards i.e. medium-to-long growth.</li>

            <li>You have to press down on the very  top  of the stand and it will spring up to allow fr room to get the shaver in place</li>
            <li>You have to press down on the very  top  of the stand and it will spring up to allow fr room to get the shaver in place</li>
            <li>Many cool diodes spell out different sorts of information such as the extent of the battery charge, whether you should use the cleaning module (Yes, pretty much always, because those proprietary replacement cartridges generate a nice profit even though they&#x27;re pretty much alcohol and oil mixed in water), and whether tonight is a full moon in case you&#x27;re going to turn into a wolfman at midnight and want to pack your Norelco 9700 shaver before you leave for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just never got those circular motions right compared to the straight motions for shavers without rotating heads.  </li>
            <li>I expected a lot from a 350 dollar shaver and my husband says it was smooth and felt good, as well as did a great job on what it is supposed to do -- cutting whiskers.</li>
            <li>&#x27; buttons within easy reach to the right and left sides.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cartridge keeps the shaver very clean but if the cleaning cycle is run daily it lasts one month; with the 3-pack that would be about $5.50 per month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m struggling with a rating since the shave quality of this Norelco is so, so nice that it would be a shame to give it anything other than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m struggling with a rating since the shave quality of this Norelco is so, so nice that it would be a shame to give it anything other than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12</li>
            <li>You definitely get a really great shaver with this one, which should be expected with the price of it.</li>
            <li>initially thought a comparison between this, the Braun 7 and the former top-of-the-line Norelco (the SensoTouch 3D) would be a good way to explore the features.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a snap with regular tap rinses and more thorough cleaning with the SmartClean system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a snap with regular tap rinses and more thorough cleaning with the SmartClean system.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Panasonic is not loud, but it&#x27;s a higher, more persistent pitch that does penetrate walls and doors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with the Panasonic and I&#x27;m glad my testing period is finally over, because it was taking so much longer to shave...</li>
            <li>The SmartClean will display a &#x27;ready&#x27; light indicator once cleaning and drying is complete and once the razor is fully charged and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the batteries are great, they won&#x27;t die because u charged them mid charge or anything.... but to capitalize on the batteries design, remember, u can make this machine last a few years by giving it full charge and discharge cycles, given that the display will show accurate percentage read out</li>
            <li>Starting with cheap, low-end Braun or Wahl foil shavers, with the vibrating cutter heads, more recently I &amp;#34;jumped up&amp;#34; in the quality and price range of shavers, by purchasing the Philips Norelco 8175 Speed XL.</li>
            <li>This is the latest in a long chain of electric razors I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provide an OK shave, but not near as close as the Braun 7 Series.</li>
            <li>And for me, it pretty much was a repeat.  </li>
            <li>Do the reverse the Braun on the first day will show straight hairs about 1/8th of an inch.</li>
            <li>best for sharp looking face, I do not recommend for round shaped faces</li>
            <li>but honestly after use it as wet shaving method  with gel it gives close shave but hold on !!</li>
            <li>One minor gripe is that I seem to be more prone to getting ingrown hairs with purely electric shaves or</li>

            <li>For a more thorough cleaning you can open up the shaving heads and take out each set of blades and clean them individually.</li>
            <li>Usually an electric will not do good on my beard, but this one does very well.</li>
            <li>The side I shaved with this just did not feel as good as the side I shaved with my Panasonic, and it took over twice as long to do the same amount of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Not by a lot, but the edge certainly goes to Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not by a lot, but the edge certainly goes to Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the cleaning/resting station is rather large and bulky, so if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space on your bathroom vanity, this could be a drawback.</li>
            <li>Kiam, who later owned the New England Patriots became famous as a CEO pitchman with a series of commercials about an electric razor whose tagline was \\&quot;It</li>
            <li>, can&#x27;t decide which was better as they both were just great,, I spent the extra money as I was tired of using a straight razor after my electric didn&#x27;t get close enough, good bye straight razor.</li>
            <li>display for battery is very useful as it gives you exact feedback on how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li>You can buy this in specially devised containers at the major stores in your neighborhood, price is $24.50 for 3 of them.  </li>

            <li>The net result is that although my face isn&#x27;t razor smooth I am getting a nice close shave in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor, but pretty darn close and without the burn I used to get with the older electric razors.</li>
            <li>Speaking of which, this razor does a pretty decent job of shaving my face.</li>
            <li>Again, greatest shaver I ever owned and continue to recommend it!ing head should be lightly brushed when dry to remove the cleaning process collect very small fine pieces of cut hair on it; not a problem if you&#x27;re not too fussy; does not interfere with the shaving.</li>
            <li>Not perfect by any means, but very good.  </li>
            <li>- the Norelco heads have more flexibility than the Braun, and did a better job around my Adam&#x27;s apple (always a tough spot for shaving).</li>
            <li>It left a satisfying, quick, clean shave, with little to no shaver irritation.</li>
            <li>My husband is quite happy to use it and we got rid of the older shaver that was a few years old in favor of this new one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought at first this would be an even higher speed than the old model, but it seems the top speed is the same as the old one.</li>
            <li>Much like the one I tried a year ago, I was amazed at the low sound levels this puts out.  </li>
            <li>This was a great buy -- expensive, but well worth it in my experience.</li>
            <li>If anyone wants suggestions post a comment</li>
            <li>It has a very plastic look and feel to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very hushed operating</li>
            <li>(the drying cycle is four hours), is a fingerprint and water spot magnet, and takes up too much counter</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really pressing the shaver too much on my skin because I thought it would make the blades stop working as well.</li>

            <li>I got routinely close shaves with these however, they caused much irritation when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2015, I purchased this for Christmas.</li>
            <li>9700 also comes with a cleaning system/charging station that is very convenient despite it being a bit bulky.</li>

            <li>Shaves very close.</li>
            <li>The entire head of the shaver can and should be replaced periodically and the indicator will light up when the unit needs replacement.</li>

            <li>Replacements are, as of this review, not available on Amazon.com, but are available through Philips&#x27; website for $12 a pair with free shipping, which I find extremely reasonable.</li>

            <li>The cutting heads on the 9700 are more flexible and exposed than the older model, and glide even more easily across the contours of your neck.</li>
            <li>I am ready to go with</li>

            <li>I really like the user interface on the shaver.</li>
            <li>If the price point is something you can handle, I really don&#x27;t think you are going to find another shaving system that will outperform this one.</li>
            <li>-- I couldn&#x27;t believe how much was in there when I changed it out after about 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This model is much quieter, cuts closer and recharges much quicker.  </li>
            <li>It was better than expected.</li>
            <li>You should not have to press and go over a spot on your face multiple times in order to clear it---the more you pass over your skin</li>
            <li>Even the user manual says you have to keep shaving &amp;#34;solely&amp;#34; with this shaver for at least 21 days before getting a good shave.</li>
            <li>I contacted Philips Norelco, and apparently there are known issues with the cleaning system so they offered to send me a new cleaning system for free.</li>
            <li>It gives better results than any other, so far and I am hopeful that it can only keep getting better.</li>

            <li>The Panasonic has to sit facing directly to the right</li>
            <li>Since my old shaver wouldn&#x27;t fit in the cleaning system, I nevertheless disassembled my old shaving head and just put the cutters in there to see how well it removed older, heavier accumulation.</li>
            <li>Likewise, spending extra money on cleaning fluid cartridges isn&#x27;t very economical when you can just use the running faucet to clean it, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An added plus is the &amp;#34;Smart Clean&amp;#34; feature which keeps the shaver very clean, allegedly keeps the blades sharper and lubricated - we&#x27;ll have to see on that.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco S9721/84 is my first rotary electric shaver and only my third (or so) electric shaver period; my others being a Braun 3 and 7-series foil-shavers that I used sporadically for many years.</li>
            <li>cleaning station is obviously one of the biggest reasons for the significant markup in price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is lighter, quieter and more responsive than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It takes about three or four passes to get a smooth shave, which is not quite as quick as my last electric shaver, however it&#x27;s so much smoother that it simply doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>cannot access the blades, to thoroughly clean them or move them to a different position.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the S9721, he had to repeatedly go over the same areas and still did not receive a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>The key seems to be in the pressure more than anything else, with possibly a slight advantage to a light shave cream that wont clog in the blades.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to do but takes about an hour to wash and 4 hours to dry.</li>
            <li>This is in simple terms a separate cradle that the 9721 electric razor pairs with to both charge and clean the razor.</li>
            <li>And oddly enough, the Philips website for this razor has videos, and one of them has the speaker specifically mentioning how to clean by hand, since you can do that all the time, and maybe once every 3 to 4 weeks run it through the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>Nothing breaking the clean lines of the unit on the outside.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I peeked about 6 or 8 minutes later it was almost up to 30%, so it certainly seems to charge quickly.  </li>
            <li>Because of the high cost, I can&#x27;t readily recommend this razor to others.</li>
            <li>...then put the shaving head back onto the body of the razor and place it into the special holder.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the liquid in the special device for cleaning needs to be replaced every three (3) months.  </li>
            <li>As is, since it is a loose part it may get lost easily - so I put it in the included shaver case to ensure it does not get</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know that I can dry shave without having skin irritation or red</li>
            <li>Wet shaving with the 9721 in my opinion is superior to a dry shave in terms of closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s backed by a 2 year warranty, which shows they are equally confident of their product.e after separating the top portion of the shaver should be adequate for daily cleaning, and the more open design of the shaving heads seems to leave fewer &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; for shaving accumulation to dirty up your shaver.</li>
            <li>If u were to charge the machine every day and u don&#x27;t care, then the machine will last u roughly a year to two years max, ur going through the chemicals too quickly, but with full discharge and charge cycles u can get 4 to 5 years, and since it&#x27;s such a cool machine, i think it&#x27;s worth it....</li>
            <li>Power increments are low - medium - full power and displayed on a graduated scale.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty sensitive to both foil and rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>The angles seem to be a little better on this one for the convex curves on the skull.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to shave very often due to sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>This makes a difference because I&#x27;m -- as you probably know if you&#x27;ve read many of my previous reviews -- a deodorant model.  </li>
            <li>So I began tweaking my methods... using more or less shaving cream, using none at all, etc.</li>
            <li>With more pressure, I noticed less or no stubble at all in some areas.</li>
            <li>After testing it, I can say that it does about 40-50% better than norelco razors that I have used that were 70$ or less.</li>

            <li>There&#x27;s nothing it&#x27;s been unable to do, it&#x27;s been irritation free, and is a quick razor that&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can easily shave at night and someone even in the bedroom connected to the bathroom wouldn&#x27;t hear it if the door were closed.  </li>
            <li>particularly the contours of the jaw and throat.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>But it is a wider attachment than in older models.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can see the results in ads in many recent fashion magazines such as Elle and Seventeen and Deodorant</li>
            <li>If I only shaved with the grain I did not get a adequate shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves it spotless afterward however, the cartridges will evaporate quickly, which means you will be buying cleaning cartridges regularly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the box the shaver comes with enough power for a quick shave</li>
            <li>It is much more complicated to put the razor in it, and better suited for an engineer.</li>
            <li>The head comes off much easier than last time, and since you need the feature for beard trimming, it&#x27;s a worth while trade.</li>
            <li>This one also fit much better in the corner behind the sink.  </li>
            <li>I like that the cleaner actually displays how far into each stage it is - not just one light for cleaning, one for drying, and one for charging.  </li>
            <li>I tried cleaning it every other day after the first month and the shaver appears just as clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the single broad razor still does a better job on my face.</li>
            <li>knowing exactly how much charge you have left on board is very helpful.</li>
            <li>However, the convenience factor of electric shaving is quite high.</li>
            <li>However, the convenience factor of electric shaving is quite high.</li>
            <li>I had unusually high hopes for this Philips Norelco shaver from the start.</li>
            <li>cost of this Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver is on the high side, even at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>cost of this Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver is on the high side, even at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but it is as&lt;br /&gt;good or easy as other older models.</li>
            <li>While it is very nice to keep track of battery life in the digital readout, we determined that the upgrade isn&#x27;t necessary as the shaver is essentially the same as the 9300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Norelco has added some unusual tricks to that old classic.  </li>
            <li>am Caucasian and have full growth (no beard) but it is fine and straight, not heavy and thick or curly.</li>
            <li>I always clean my razors manually after a shave, then leave them to dry.  </li>
            <li>It was a powerful machine, but soon I realized it takes me twice the time to use it every day than my regular Gillette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below the LCD screen a few more icons can be displayed that provide a range of information.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The rotating heads require yearly replacement, assuming normal use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning my old model was definitely the most hassle, beyond the daily shaking out of stubble and rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li>shaver is only three months old, but it has to be within 45 days to get a full replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver can be cleaned with water, an improvement over the Braun, so you&#x27;ll likely find that you don&#x27;t need to use the full cleaning cycle particularly frequently.</li>
            <li>At first was seems kind of uncomfortable on my face but after 3 times shave, i must say still my first choice in any brand for shaving.</li>
            <li>If my face is dry, the Norelco is used as it does the best job; if my face is wet, I use a traditional razor as the Norelco does not shave as closely when my face is wet.  </li>

            <li>The primary differences are that I experience a much closer shave with less skin irritation with the 9721 than I ever did with my Braun.</li>
            <li>that made it 3 or 4 times more expensive than other good quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned (including others from Norelco).</li>
            <li>For this review I tested both, shaving cream on the left and none on the right, since I&#x27;m right-handed, for three shaves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;****uch as to celebrity art gallery openings and royal galas with only the right side of your face</li>
            <li>The shaves are quick, easy, complete and do not irritate the skin (at least not mine).  </li>
            <li>Norelco gets long hairs laying flat much better than the Braun and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found dry shaving is actually not so bad with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I liked all the bells and whistles on this shaver and because those extras were only available on this shaver which only comes with this bulky Jet Cleaning System, I was forced to buy it this way.</li>
            <li>This 9000 series shaver is manufactured with the new RQ12+ head.</li>
            <li>I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels brand new each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks and feels brand new each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in favor of this new one.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>That is the reason in 2007, I went ahead and got a new Panasonic ES shaver with all the bells and whistles and the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>seems like a &amp;#34;REFURBISHED&amp;#34;, even though it&#x27;s listed as NEW.</li>
            <li>else is new?</li>
            <li>A new feature is the adjustable speed (3 settings).</li>
            <li>I asked if I could get store credit to purchase new razor heads in lieu of a new cleaning system (which I&#x27;m not going to use anyway now</li>
            <li>About 4-6 years ago the new Norelco was called ?</li>
            <li>The razor worked but I started reading about the advances the new one has so...........</li>
            <li>this new one.</li>
            <li>We are moving and the new bathroom has softer lights</li>
            <li>He is like a kid with a new toy.</li>
            <li>and there he is using his new shaver...</li>
            <li>Within 2 hours the area under the nose and the jawline appear to need another shave.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with the Braun Series 7 790cc or the new 799cc</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin baby smooth and without the occasional scrape a regular blade gave me.  </li>
            <li>I like a vry close, smooth shave which seems to only come from a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li>Blade shavers may want to consider this option as well particularly if they frequently miss parts of their shave.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is not a difficult daily growth to shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does so pretty quietly....</li>
            <li>the shaver is pretty quiet!</li>
            <li>I wash the shaver under hot water before putting it back on the cradle anyway, so it is just another peace of</li>
            <li>The cartridges are supposed to last 2-3 months, but they&#x27;re not expensive.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll likely want to charge the device first.</li>
            <li>It incorporates the principles of the original dual bladed razor, the Trac II, by using one blade to pull on the whisker and the other to snip it off.</li>
            <li>But by the same token, I like it anyway since it gives it a bit more functionality than the other cleaning systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ideally I will be shaving first with the Panasonic (my current favorite)&lt;br /&gt;then switching to the Norelco for finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, yet, if I will need to purchase new shaving heads as frequently on this new type of electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think a faucet rinse after separating the top portion of the shaver should be adequate for daily cleaning, and the more open design of the shaving heads seems to leave fewer &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; for shaving accumulation to dirty up your shaver.</li>
            <li>It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  </li>
            <li>But the razor I purchased a year ago for $100 less still outperforms this by a huge margin, so for this price, I just can&#x27;t see the value.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to mention, just shaving the one side of my head to a less than smooth result took 9 percent of the charge.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed having a few extra minutes each morning that are normally dedicated to shaving.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed having a few extra minutes each morning that are normally dedicated to shaving.</li>
            <li>With his setting, I found the shaver to be at its best, doing a lot of cutting with a single pass.</li>
            <li>At one point I used shaving gel and found it glided across my skin better, however the extra time it takes to apply the gel is part of what I&#x27;d like to avoid by switching to an electric razor, so I went back to dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whether my beard is coarse and dense (after a weekend at the lake), or short and stubbly, it just takes a few quick passes to get the close smooth feel</li>
            <li>first starting out shaving, the Gillette Mach 3 (or any similar department store razors) was my main razor.</li>
            <li>The Braun&#x27;s display is clear, but is no match for this in terms of size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once the shaver is locked in place, the cleaning system will clean the shaver heads for ten minutes, and then dry them for four hours.</li>
            <li>opening it, I still was unsure as to this hefty price tag, especially considering how the razor felt in my hand - sort of hollow and light.</li>
            <li>It is lighter than the Sensotouch and clearly cheaper looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Costco&#x27;s price was $144 for this whole system, regular $174.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s motion sensitive - when you pick up the razor</li>
            <li>(I believe it&#x27;s advertised as 8 different directions) and gives a much closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A helpful reminder for busy people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can also see how much battery you have left and what speed you&#x27;re using, if the shavers are blocked, when its locked for travel and when you need to replace the shaver</li>
            <li>You can also see how much battery you have left and what speed you&#x27;re using, if the shavers are blocked, when its locked for travel and when you need to replace the shaver</li>
            <li>I think norelco has gone too far in electric shaver tech.</li>
            <li>9700 is much quieter than any shaver I&#x27;ve used and is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charges fast and last a while.</li>
            <li>how much batter power is left.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a while, but Panasonic was like that too and as loud or even louder.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that I really didn&#x27;t want the cleaning unit, but you have to pay for it to get the razor.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>There are also buttons on the shaver to set the shave speed in three settings - low, medium, fast.  </li>
            <li>While this razor does include a ~$22 year maintenance cost in changing the optional cleaning fluid, this is not required and you can just use water if to clean the razor - moreso $22/year is a lot less than you would be spending on straight razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

            <li>If I use medium or fast, my skin turns red.</li>
            <li>SmartClean operates in two phases - a cleaning cycle that takes about 10 minutes to complete and a drying cycle that takes about 4 hours to complete.</li>
            <li>but so far - I&#x27;ve heard nothing but raves.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, efficient, fast, sell-cleaning?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There haven&#x27;t been any complaints so far</li>
            <li>shaver offers three speeds to choose from.</li>
            <li>That made no sense at all since I have had my old Norelco for 30 years and it still keeps on</li>
            <li>That made no sense at all since I have had my old Norelco for 30 years and it still keeps on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through at least four units (maybe more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sure how long I&#x27;ve had it, but at least 3-5 years and it still performs excellently.</li>
            <li>But regardless, you can get the performance you want, and adjust slower if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this one is the closest shaving one I have had</li>
            <li>So far they like them.  </li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for nearly 60 years.</li>
            <li>razor: You can plug it in directly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with my old trimmer as I don&#x27;t like removing the head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with my old trimmer as I don&#x27;t like removing the head.</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t need to turn it on, or unplug/replug to see how far along the charge was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They all worked reasonably well following the contours of my face, but there&#x27;s something about this shaver that sets it apart.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a considerable improvement over the Norelco 1290/8800 series with one exception.</li>
            <li>However, you can charge it separately by a direct connection.</li>
            <li>The Braun, like the 9700, can be charged directly without a stand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neither the Braun or Panasonic has any difficulty with the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to shave near the bottom of my sideburns also yields hairs being pulled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun and Panasonic cleaning systems are far better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only bit of warning would be not to use on more than a few days growth -- shaver every day or two -- as it will pull at that point.  </li>
            <li>and this does a good job, and it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, even after a couple days of not shaving.</li>
            <li>The only reasons the 9700 was more expensive were that the Smart Clean is \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; and there is a digital readout on the handle.</li>
            <li>If you want the same effect, while not spending as much money you can: 1. run hot water over the blades and let dry or 2.</li>
            <li>If this one has the same life expectancy as my other Norelco, this one should last many years.</li>
            <li>I have used other Norelco products in the past and been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This ensures that my skin won&#x27;t be sticky and my hairs are dry and crisp.</li>
            <li>The cleaner/charger takes a little getting used to, but it is not required to  either charge or clean the razor.</li>
            <li>Imagine a super size fountain soda sitting upside down on your counter -</li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>ended up using this Philips for everyday and Panasonic if I need to be really clean</li>
            <li>Now I consistently get very close shaves while getting the added benefit of having a sort of &#x27;session&#x27; every morning that I was missing with the electric.</li>
            <li>the older razors I had the head popped open</li>
            <li>I just used my Panasonic for the first time and what has been taking 15 minutes to do poorly just now took three minutes to do smooth.  </li>
            <li>A little three bar indicator on your digital display indicates how strong your WIFI signal is.  </li>
            <li>the cleaning was another nightmare , unlike Braun series 7  the cleaning system for this shaver is not sanitizing the razors because its water based solution it just clean and lubricate it only  , I didn&#x27;t like this point with the cleaning system due the lack hygienic for the shaver , The shaver dose not  deliver close shave</li>
            <li>Even on high, the shaver is incredibly quiet.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would say under my neck this actually does a better job that a straight razor, and I use expensive brand name straight razors.  </li>
            <li>A few limiting factors inherent to electric shavers are present but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from easily recommending this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>(but I don&#x27;t know how much the cleaning solutions sells for and how long it</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take long before it&#x27;s ready to be used.</li>
            <li>He had a mirror inside of his locker and would shave, get dressed and be off to muster long before the rest of us finished getting ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the old 8175XL has three rings of blades, while the 9700 has only two rings--the outer being the wider V-shaped blades, and the inner the straight blades.</li>
            <li>wash it under hot water (careful not to scald yourself)</li>
            <li>You could see the round blades were full of hair cuttings and that were not removed during the cleaning process as Norelco claims would happen.</li>
            <li>While I would not say this is necessary, it is a nice feature to have; whether or not you would use it would be if you have the space on your bathroom counter for it - the cleaning station is about as thick as a 2-liter bottle of soda and a little more than half as tall.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s first shave with this was on a day where he had a pretty decent beard - it had been at least 4 days since his last shave.  </li>
            <li>The SmartClean system that comes with the shave is kind of a pain to set up, but when I use it, which I do twice a week, the shaver seems to be even less irritating than when I clean with plain hot water.</li>
            <li>Because the current smart cleaner is too big.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the most expensive razor (by a large margin) that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Shaves closer and with less irritation than most other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, the shaver still has about 65% of its original charge left, so clearly taking it on a business trip for a week or two wouldn&#x27;t be a</li>
            <li>They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12</li>
            <li>Finally I decided to buy this new Philips Norelco s9721</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is the same but new.</li>
            <li>You can use this on wet and dry skin and clean up is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went back to a traditional straight razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging:  It charged up in about an hour and the digital display shows how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>All of that comes with a hefty price but someone looking fora shaver that will last them several years should really consider making an investment into the 9721.</li>
            <li>All of that comes with a hefty price but someone looking fora shaver that will last them several years should really consider making an investment into the 9721.</li>
            <li>It has a quick charge feature that when the battery is dead, if you charge it for about 5 minutes, you can use it for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a quick charge feature that when the battery is dead, if you charge it for about 5 minutes, you can use it for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Those with limited space on their sink or vanity should recognize that the real estate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two major components that will have to be replaced with the 9721 and</li>
            <li>There are three holes in the top, and there seems to be 2 or possibly 3 separate compartments, but they are all full of the cleaning solution, so it does not appear that the dirty solution is separated by anything besides sedimentation?</li>
            <li>I have a pretty square jaw and a fairly sharp chin.</li>
            <li>I do not know facts about the battery, but full charge gets only about half the minutes of the Sensotouch.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference whether or not was wet or dry shaving, using cream or not.</li>
            <li>I used the brush to clean it in the past, but there were no brushes included with this one.  </li>
            <li>* Cleaning indicator: This small spigot icon will flash after each use to remind you to wash or use the SmartClean system to clean the shaver.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The cleaner adds a little bulk to the charger but seems worth the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:</li>
            <li>I find the slower speeds are better for the tough spots (jaw line, neck, etc.)</li>
            <li>It is hard for me to comment yet on the three speeds available.</li>
            <li>It is hard for me to comment yet on the three speeds available.</li>
            <li>So far, I still prefer my Braun from last year over this one.</li>
            <li>The 9721 shaver fits into the SmartClean and uses the same AC adapter that will plug directly into the SmartClean.</li>
            <li>I end up using it for a couple of weeks, then putting it aside and going back to my old razor.</li>
            <li>This is a hardline policy, apparently.</li>
            <li>The old one only traveled for 10-14 days.</li>
            <li>My last case does for these, but it is soft so the lack of a blade cover makes me not want to do that.</li>
            <li>It ends up taking about 3 times as long to shave as it does for me normally.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely not - there are some fantastic shavers from Braun, Norelco, Panasonic and Remington that cost much much less but still perform well.</li>
            <li>I know we do not want something heavy to work with, but you tend to judge quality slightly on the heft of an item - does it feel solid and worthy, or does it feel cheap, lightweight and hollow?</li>
            <li>However, at Christmas time, I for a few Amazon gift certifiates and decided the time was right.</li>
            <li>rounded heads also move independently of each other so the shave is close on the first swipes</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just such a poor replacement for a decent Panasonic, doesn&#x27;t shave as smooth and takes a LOT longer to get those lackluster results.  </li>
            <li>I had tried electric razors in the past (mainly the cheap 3 circle ones for 70$ or less that resemble this norelco)</li>
            <li>Usually when I buy a new shaver, it is quiet at first, but gets louder with use.</li>
            <li>however, the weak spots were it shaving the more &#x27;coarse&#x27; hairs and the mustache on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>however, the weak spots were it shaving the more &#x27;coarse&#x27; hairs and the mustache on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I am so disappointed, after spending over $300 for a razor, it should a great job.</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing a Norelco shaver again and recommend that you do not purchase this shaver unless you get a separate warranty from a store that provides a full exchange for at least a year.</li>
            <li>All of the major shaver manufacturers offer a factory-direct money back guarantee if the retailer will not take it back.</li>

            <li>I bough this product, yet this super cleaning &#x27;gismo&#x27;, is hard for this 78yr old&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is said to charge enough in three minutes for a shave, which I found hard to believe, so I tested it, and if you&#x27;re in full wolfman mode a three-minute charge will get you only about half done, which means you either have to charge again for three minutes or go out in public, such as to celebrity art gallery openings and royal galas with only the right side of your face</li>
            <li>beard grows fast and is coarse and dark.</li>
            <li>Also, using smaller circular motions seemed to improve performance instead of straight lines up and down the face, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the Norelco with a thin gel-type shave cream and it did fine.</li>

            <li>Once in a while the side groves of the shaving head should be lightly brushed when dry to remove the cleaning process collect very small fine pieces of cut hair on it; not a problem if you&#x27;re not too fussy; does not interfere with the shaving.</li>
            <li>And I know that the manufacturers claim that it takes a while to \\&quot;train\\&quot; your skin for a new razor, so I&#x27;m going to keep using this and see if anything changes, but the other one had no difference over time, so</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the heads are already ruined and it is harder than it sounds to clean cheap plastic moving parts without snapping it in half.</li>

            <li> great shaver.</li>
            <li> great</li>
            <li> It should shave and give happy ending for that price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Quite honestly now, after using it, I know and feel that it is the perfect weight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shaver didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin, which was great, but it also didn&#x27;t do a great job shaving for me.</li>
            <li> and that is a great feature for travelers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it took some time, but I&#x27;m extremely happy with this Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this shaver.</li>

            <li> I am completely happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> the Braun and Panasonic have great built in cutters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great irritant of the Norelco is the position of the power</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It looks very nice in the bathroom but does take up a lot of space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The shaver comes with a very nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>

            <li> The charge indicator is a very nice feature.  </li>
            <li> I am going to return it and get the best shave/with a BUILT in sideburn trimmer, and I&#x27;ve used norelco customer since i was able to shave.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th Norelco electric shaver I have had and easily the best yet.  </li>
            <li> Amazing shaver and a great shave.</li>
            <li> Good, my boyfriend likes it.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise, save your money.</li>
            <li> It turns out you can use a good amount of pressure without stalling the blades at all.</li>
            <li> Norelco S9721 was well packaged and included a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fairly regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It should shave as good as any product you can buy.</li>
            <li> The shave was good in about 50% of the areas--especially well on the neck area</li>

            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: It has been a month using the product, and it is still performing as good as it did out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I called Philips and received good service and they will replace the cleaning device and FedEx it to me</li>
            <li> you are wise, go to the dollar store and get theirs.</li>
            <li> shave isn&#x27;t as good as a Gillette blade</li>
            <li> think both are good choices</li>
            <li> think both are good choices though.</li>
            <li> This seems to strike a good balance between convenience and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaved so good</li>
            <li> This seems like a good idea and a means of insuring continued quality shaves.</li>
            <li> I found a couple of areas the shaver wasn&#x27;t getting as good, but learned how to improve the performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have to spend a good chunk of cash anyway to start shaving again, I&#x27;m going to give the Braun 7 series</li>
            <li> Good Shaver.  </li>
            <li> So to be fair</li>
            <li> I thought originally since the hair on your face grows in all directions that moving in a circular motion would have the best benefits, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one time I used a shaving gel I found that it didn&#x27;t clean quite as well, despite having rinsed it beforehand, however it works perfectly otherwise.</li>
            <li> The one time I used a shaving gel I found that it didn&#x27;t clean quite as well, despite having rinsed it beforehand, however it works perfectly otherwise.</li>
            <li> So I was very interested in trying out the best of the Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> Great close shave, love the cleaning system as well.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied .</li>
            <li> ( I LOVE AMAZON HAPPY FACE DANCE).</li>
            <li> and I was pleased and  happy with it  </li>
            <li> Great product, but would be better if the trimmer was not a separate piece.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: it is a nice razor with a lot of good features.</li>
            <li> This cleaning process is easy and works great.  </li>
            <li> great close smooth shave..</li>
            <li> This one just shaves amazingly.  </li>
            <li> this is an amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is nice to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it has a nice and convenient cleaning</li>
            <li> did not like the XL model either but have liked all others and wore them out ( used for years).</li>
            <li> shaver is great on the jawline and chin, as far as fitting the contours and molding to it perfectly.</li>
            <li> in all, I do think it is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> in all, I do think it is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> so here is the review in his own words:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels lightweight and balances nicely in hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver also comes with a travel bag, which is nice.</li>
            <li> 9721 is a nice piece of kit.</li>
            <li> The feature is handy when traveling to prevent the shaver from inadvertently turning on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t even notices the size - being so thrilled with the self-cleaning aspect of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high-end electric razor which really will shave as close as a blade, this is your \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; device.very impressed.</li>
            <li> I really liked it and thought it was a closer shave.</li>
            <li> No longer a choice as to what kind of wash.</li>
            <li> The travel lock is a nice feature too.</li>
            <li> No visible way to know the charging or cleaning status, if you have nice lighting&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel lock is a nice feature too.</li>
            <li> No visible way to know the charging or cleaning status, if you have nice lighting&lt;br</li>
            <li> have the kind of face</li>
            <li> Great purchase and Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s a gadget to clean it too.</li>
            <li> , u can time this very easily.</li>
            <li> shaver charges unbelievably fast, which is very handy for my husband who often forgets to charge it!&lt;br /&gt;-It holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very interesting item that will make the man of the house feel just like he is very special.  </li>
            <li> own and use many shavers - collecting them is a hobby.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I am biased towards these types of razors - having used them for so many years.</li>
            <li> With the professed greater travel and angles of this I hoped it would be more effective, since I really liked the 3 head design they&#x27;ve had for a while and the one I ended up returning</li>
            <li> It is by far the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It was nice to see a company not try to get you to use it more often so they can make more money on the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the way I see it using the auto clean system is a good way to abuse and prematurely wear out the battery.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about it is it&#x27;s intelligent:</li>
            <li> PHILPS razor is also very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love the fast, clean, non-irritating shave, and am impressed by the improvements over the 8000 series.</li>
            <li> I love the fast, clean, non-irritating shave, and am impressed by the improvements over the 8000 series.</li>
            <li> The shave was very smooth again, and after accidentally cumping the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; button - he found out it works even better at a faster speed.  </li>
            <li> Gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;-I have to re-shave everywhere with my Norelco Arcitec, which I love, and it has a sideburn trimmer built-in to flip up when you like</li>
            <li> outstanding close shave.</li>
            <li> So much better then the Norelco</li>
            <li> if it can be equipped with one,it is better.</li>
            <li> Love my shaver9700</li>
            <li> Based on the feel alone, I would have guessed it cost $75 at most.</li>
            <li> While the Norelco is no slouch, the Braun just fits my hand better and is easier to grip.</li>
            <li> This 9700 series shaver was interesting because we also tried the 9300 series.</li>
            <li> rounded heads move in more directions</li>
            <li> packaging isn&#x27;t Amazon Frustration Free!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Philips Norelco can do better than this one ?</li>
            <li> I will say that the more I use it, the better i like the results, so there may be some truth to their claims.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did work better after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many limitations and mediocrities for a product that is priced in the &#x27;elite&#x27; category.will have to stop and rinse</li>
            <li> Many limitations and mediocrities for a product that is priced in the &#x27;elite&#x27; category.</li>
            <li> We especially liked that it has different speeds and comfort levels.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoyed (yes, he actually &#x27;enjoyed&#x27;) reading the manual.</li>
            <li> Much more so than the one</li>
            <li> It was the top of the line, and I never tried a rotary shaver before, so I went for</li>
            <li> I realized that unlike Panasonic, you have to use a circular motion to get the best shave, and with foam you can actually move the shaver quicker against your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have many comments regarding the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> If you have the patience for the initial period, you might find this to be the best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> I am deducting 1 point for breaking too soon and 1 point for warranty hassles, because if you ever have to deal with warranty, it is going to be a nightmare for you.he patience for the initial period, you might find this to be the best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> The shaver is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> The directions say it’s OK for the shower.</li>
            <li> Love the way it contours my face giving the cleanest shave yet with the shortest duration.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best shaver</li>
            <li> It pulls the hairs out most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This is much better than my Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to Panasonic (or most foil-type).&lt;br /&gt;Philips is better at:&lt;br /&gt;noise</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic is better at:&lt;br /&gt;closeness of shave&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic is better at:&lt;br /&gt;closeness of shave&lt;</li>
            <li> use the same shave cream that I use with my Merkur safety razor with the 9721, a brand called Prorasso, with excellent results.</li>
            <li> The cleaning is automated and is a more thorough cleaning than rinsing the razor heads under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or more like the lack thereof.</li>
            <li> On days I have an important meeting or event and need a tidy look I&#x27;ll stick with my Merkur safety</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure yet</li>
            <li> The trimmer isn&#x27;t quite the best I&#x27;ve used, but it does work well enough and its convenience can&#x27;t be beat.</li>

            <li> Outstanding electric shaver</li>
            <li> :  Those that are thinking of this razor better think twice now.  </li>
            <li> I love the automatic cleaning system on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun electric shaver user for many years.</li>
            <li> This is OK, but if you&#x27;ve gone on a trip and forgot the attachment, you&#x27;ll be out of luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while I like the Norelco&#x27;s design for home use, the Braun is a bit more compact for traveling purposes.</li>
            <li> Always the top of the line.</li>
            <li> so I got the top of the line Braun at the time (series7).</li>
            <li> Best Buy matched, so I went that way as I might have wanted to return, if necessary, to brick and mortar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best shave possible</li>
            <li> If it holds up, it&#x27;s better than sliced</li>
            <li> Best shave possible</li>
            <li> If it holds up, it&#x27;s better than sliced</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is also significantly more thorough than my Braun was.</li>
            <li> I just take the razor top off and rinse that assembly from inside.</li>
            <li> my needs are more than just \\&quot;does well on the neck and jawline.\\</li>
            <li> love cleaning systems,</li>
            <li> It just seems that it keeps my razors and the blades working better, longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something better.  </li>
            <li> I figured I should test it on my face, since that&#x27;s where probably 95% or more people will be using this razor.  </li>
            <li> The re-designed the shaving head which makes it much more flexible, easier to manuever around your face and providing a smoother cut.  </li>
            <li> I wondered what could possibly be so much better in this shaver</li>
            <li> In addition, the Braun cleaner is faster and more hygienic than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Unlike my Arctec, the top blade assembly comes off on to facilitate cleaning.  </li>
            <li> very smooth close shave  ,, for someone still interested with Philips Norelco Good luck ,,</li>
            <li> Shaver is just superb - but the Smart Clean device stopped working - the pump that fills the top of the basin to clean the shaver head ceased functioning.</li>
            <li> As for the price... I am still not convinced that ANY razor is worth 350 bucks, but it is a great gift and a nice splurge on yourself, if you don&#x27;t mind spending that much.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It comes with a trimming/ shape up blade as well that works pretty good.</li>
            <li> The feeling of menthol-laden lather and a blade sliding on your face is just as good as a hot shower to start</li>
            <li> u can travel very easily with this machine, the cleaner is pretty good, it leaves the machine, perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the machine is also easy manually, just pop the top with the blades and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> best environment for an e-razor is a dry face with no moisture.</li>
            <li> razor charges quickly and holds a charge effectively.  </li>
            <li> And it was actually a nice razor, but it just didn&#x27;t do a great job, especially on my head.  </li>
            <li> The thing is amazing and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Given those faults, I think 4 stars is more accurate, and could even make a case for 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> So far fastest is working great.</li>
            <li> And this one is just so much more comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work any better than cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice-looking, with its sleek design, and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> It is the best at conforming than any other razor I have tried.</li>
            <li> It automatically cleans with a solution, drys the head, and charges the battery to full strength!  </li>
            <li> shaver head comes apart easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to switch between the shaver and trimmer head, but highlighting the alignment tab on both head and shaver would make it easier to see and align for assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> it seems to charge very quickly.</li>
            <li> (Although that did tell me that the speed buttons are easy to bump.)  </li>
            <li> head of the shaver pops off easily and can be replaced with the included trimmer.</li>
            <li> head of the shaver pops off easily and can be replaced with the included trimmer.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I was in the Navy one of the shipmates had an electric razor and I can recall being envious of his being able to keep clean shaven without leaving the locker room.  </li>
            <li> In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products.</li>
            <li> have learned that people have some really strong feelings about shaving gear.  </li>
            <li> They feel good on the skin too, they glide, and do not get hot, even when using it for the full hour.</li>
            <li> Braun changed the way they manufactured their replacement blades on this particular razor and consequently ruined what was good about it.</li>
            <li> particular electric razor is almost as good as a bladed one.</li>
            <li> Norelco sets a new high in terms of rotary shaver performance with a device that provides for a truly wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor, but I don&#x27;t know why it is priced so high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver delivers a high quality shave, particulalry good for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> That remains true after using this shaver (the 9700), but it&#x27;s not because of the shave quality - this shaver gives a slightly better shave than the Series 7.</li>
            <li> The Norelco looks and feels cheap; the Braun looks more stylish and certainly feels better made.</li>
            <li> To get the best shave with the norelco, trim your beard slightly to get it within 1-3 days growth, then shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To get the best shave with the norelco, trim your beard slightly to get it within 1-3 days growth, then shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are three speeds available and the shaver is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Shaves are good, but not as close as a blade, a tad better than the series 7 braun which for me the neck is a bare, but lots of money now for a shave and one has to think of the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for 17 years (ever since I started shaving), buying the latest one that comes out each time, and have been pretty satisfied until now.</li>
            <li> It cleans fine though.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer, if you can find it in the drawer, works fine.</li>
            <li> For me there is a fine line between a close shave and the feeling that I&#x27;ve just run the fine side of a box grater over my neck.</li>
            <li> love it very much!</li>
            <li> but I was satisfied the very first</li>
            <li> You can also easily clean the shaver with water since it is waterproof, but the cleaning solution works a bit better; the solution lasts for 3 months and refills are about $5.50 a cartridge - but again note this is OPTIONAL, you can just use water to clean this waterproof razor if you&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they take up a lot of space on a sink, so unless you have a large vanity/bathroom, you might not be happy with the large size of the charging dock.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth, close shave with it, it is easy to clean and the heads are easily interchangable.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap beard trimmer years ago and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Performance-wise, it shaves a bit better than the $100ish razor I purchased for Christmas years ago, but at a pretty steep price!</li>
            <li> but the shaver surely got wet and worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never spent more than $150 for a unit, but I am very pleased that I had an opportunity to get this unit.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The Norelco looks cheap, sounds cheap, takes forever</li>
            <li> The Norelco looks cheap, sounds cheap, takes forever</li>
            <li> and you do not feel anything except the smooth glide across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each of the 3 blades move independently, allowing for great contours.</li>
            <li> I am happy that Norelco&#x27;s system is back on track after I had 2 below par shavers from them about 5 years ago and went elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> They are available in a 2-pack from the Philips website for $11.99 which includes free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Shaves my legs and armpits clean and easy with water on level two</li>
            <li> I think that is how it&#x27;s supposed to sound</li>
            <li> smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is quite a snazzy shaver with lots of nice features to</li>
            <li> Victor tried this Phillips Norelco electric razor he would have had to spend a lot more than he did for Remington, but it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> The follicle then retreats below the skin line for a close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery power is fantastic...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery power is fantastic...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I will find two slower settings to be useful since I don&#x27;t want to stretch out my shaving time any longer, and my skin is so insensitive :)  </li>
            <li> The cartridges sell on Philips&#x27; website for $17 for a 3 pack, with free shipping, and they recommend replacement every three months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too light.</li>
            <li> If you like gels, I would wash after each shave, My face feels completely smooth.</li>

            <li> Close smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> ; See how smooth my face feels?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> It took me 8 or 10 passes to get it to feel smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps the blades free of debris and skin oils.</li>
            <li> is its one and only great advantage</li>
            <li> the norelco did a good job at clearing most of my beard however, the spots it shaved well, it left irritated.</li>
            <li> We opened the box, which is very well packaged with plenty of cardboard to keep it safe in transit, and then he enjoyed putting it together and charging it.</li>
            <li> The directions say it may take 3 weeks of daily use to get a really close perfect shave</li>
            <li> But, so far so good...</li>
            <li> The rotary heads of the 9721 are far superior in my opinion to the foil shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rotary heads of the 9721 are far superior in my opinion to the foil shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am once again using my five-year-old Braun shaver and getting a far superior</li>
            <li> Its ok if you have just  super quick shave to do,</li>
            <li> Its ok if you have just  super quick shave to do,</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first, the 9721 is most definitely superior to my old Braun foil shaver.</li>
            <li> Head popped off easy for quick cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.  </li>
            <li> They are clean, easy, and quickly get the job done.</li>
            <li> The shaver is attractive; coated in a piano-black polished plastic housing with a sturdy black rubber backing where your hand makes the most contact.</li>
            <li> Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster.</li>
            <li> ~ You&#x27;re Worth It!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user for almost 40 years and am a fan of the original &amp;#34;triple</li>
            <li> Now, you can no longer buy the original replacement blades for it and</li>
            <li> The instructions were straightforward.</li>
            <li> In normal circumstances I would agree with it, but the root cause of the blades no longer working is THEIR OWN CLEANING</li>
            <li> It seemed the triple heads were better designed for concave surfaces like you&#x27;d get on the face or neck, but it didn&#x27;t do so great on the convex surface of my skull, so I returned it and went back to a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Use shaving cream, get a really smooth shave, and clean up that razor in a jiffy with the special cleaning device that comes with the outfit.  </li>
            <li> Cuts close, quick, and comfortably.</li>
            <li> It does not do a clean shave</li>
            <li> With the exception of this one, they all had the flaw of not providing a clean shave in all the areas of my face</li>
            <li> When you finish shaving, it reminds you to clean it with a blinking indicator that looks like a faucet, so you do not forget.</li>
            <li> Bear in mind that your device will be physically clean, but not disinfected.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to replace the cleaning cartridge every three months, but I suppose that would depend on the environment the cartridge is in and how often you clean the shaver with it.</li>
            <li> alcohol and heat to completely clean out the razor.</li>
            <li> The best I could come up with for deep cleaning my old cutter heads and foils was to detach the head and separate all the pieces and repeatedly pour boiling water over them and soak them.</li>
            <li> While the cleaning station is a nuisance to store in a crowded bathroom, and could be costly to maintain, depending on how often you use it--it definitely gives a nice cleaning and refreshing to your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I clean the shaver every 4th or 5th use, although it says do it every time.</li>
            <li> And since the liquid is part of the cartridge, there&#x27;s no water reservoir to have to fill and clean out sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the auto clean function.</li>
            <li> a detachable beard trimmer - pulling off the main heads and attaching the beard trimmer is very easy.  </li>

            <li> most electric razors I have used, this one charges up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a manual razor, but I&#x27;m extremely surprise and impressed by how close it really is.</li>
            <li> The Norelco people have made this item special in every way.  </li>
            <li> the liquid in the special device for cleaning needs to be replaced every three (3) months.  </li>
            <li> The 9721 has a nice, sturdy weight that strikes a good balance between feeling significant but not heavy enough to tire your hand while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is easy to clean and can be done with hot water.  </li>
            <li> White LEDs that are not too bright are on the read-out.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I have had that actually does a great job on my neck and on all of the curves of my face.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a bigger area that the shaving blades are in, so it can be tricky to do that and get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Otherwise there is a full two-year warranty.</li>
            <li> There are many complexities with this shaver, but once you learn what everything means, it really is an easy-to-use and helpful appliance.</li>

            <li> nice thing as far as charging, is that you can use it on 100v - 240v outlets and the cord automatically uses whichever voltage is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;Like most modern electric razors of the high-end variety, this one has a sizeable charging station with a cleaning function.</li>
            <li> At a full charge, I can get four shavings out of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested the cleaner yet for obvious reason, but I expect it to be good if not excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the full review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had avoided Philips rotary shavers since I tried them 15 years ago and they chewed up my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d shave with nothing but the 9721 for a full 3-weeks to fully acclimate my skin and shaving routine to the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> A full charge takes about an hour and that will translate into about 50-minutes of continuous shaving time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quiet while it runs, which is good just in case you need to shave while your spouse is still sleeping.</li>
            <li> This lasts 10 minutes, before a 4 hour drying cycle begins, and during the full time your shaver is also being charged.</li>
            <li> Unlike my arctec, you have a better feel for how much charge you have.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted one with an indicator in front to tell you when the charge is full.</li>
            <li> a quick aside to those who are new to electric shavers and are wondering if you have to pay this much to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> all it can be easily cleaned with hot water.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, quick, gentle and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Smooth, quick, gentle and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> But given the price, I think they should have done a better job with the overall build quality, and certainly a MUCH better job with the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> But given the price, I think they should have done a better job with the overall build quality, and certainly a MUCH better job with the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a need to use that too often, but as I use it more I can come back and update the review with more on that accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charges quickly</li>
            <li> , I wish it was built in like the older models.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price I am glad I bought this razor and hope to get another 15 years out of it.</li>
            <li> The unit charges quickly and provides a glowing LCD panel which displays the remaining percentage of charge.</li>
            <li> Technology is nice but it is not an answer for a shaver that has to shave smooth and deep.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver -- I have never been able to use Norelco before as it always caught my hairs wrong.  </li>
            <li> The shave is super close with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was waiting more for the high price that I paid</li>
            <li> I never knew any other shavers, but I seemed to get a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> I believe if they offered the same shaver with and without the system, they might sell more of this shaver and certainly have more satisfied customers that are getting exactly what they need.  </li>
            <li> then this is a very nice shaver that gets really, really close to replicating a traditional razor</li>
            <li> then this is a very nice shaver that gets really, really close to replicating a traditional razor</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a pretty smooth  and close shave and there hasn&#x27;t been any irritation while using it.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large (½ inch tall) and easy to see.</li>
            <li> It says to give it 3 weeks because your skin/hair needs to adapt to the new system and it states you will have better luck, closer shaves, etc as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Smart Clean System works well to clean and lubricate shaver.  </li>
            <li> After each use, you clean it by popping off the heads and holding the shaver and heads under hot running water, and then air drying.</li>
            <li> The shaver was quiet, very light to hold and very flexible - able to maneuver in and out of crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Higher cost does not mean better</li>
            <li> it takes about a week for the skin to get used to ithe new blades, the main cutter now has a z pattern, but it works just as nice as the old cutters, but it seams to grab more stuble, and more hair in each revolution, so in effect the machine is a little faster than the old one, messing around with the speed of the blades also helps depending on your skin, so great idea norelco...</li>
            <li> The 9700 is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> even though there was a LOT of shaving to do - he ended up with a very close, smooth shave and the shaver still had 83% percent power.  </li>
            <li> If the price point is something you can handle, I really don&#x27;t think you are going to find another shaving system that will outperform this one.t keeps the blades free of debris and skin oils.</li>
            <li> Braun wins the build quality metric by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is pretty useful and cool....</li>
            <li> The kind you can&#x27;t see, but you can definitely feel.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t find it all that useful as of</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t find it all that useful as of</li>
            <li> this one is negligible.e of such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like $100 less would be a more fair and realistic price.</li>
            <li> It feels solid, buttons are responsive, and the display is nice and bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was true for about the first month.</li>
            <li> The old Philips shavers are much better.</li>
            <li> It was definitely the closest shave I ever had and felt smooth most of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when things keep using the same power plugs, since that makes it easier to keep my bathroom neat.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning systems that comes with the razor is innovative but it takes up considerable space in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> , Panasonic delivered the most close shave I have ever experienced with any other shaver on my entire  life , no irritation</li>
            <li> Still, the cleaning fluid and associated stand provides a nice way to thoroughly clean the shaver every few weeks, which is sufficient if you&#x27;ve been good about washing it out each day or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my testing, I find this believable, and found this new unit leaves me clean shaven a minute or two faster than my older shaver.</li>
            <li> I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> It fits your hand in the right places and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> The shaver will notify you when it needs cleaned, with a lighted faucet icon right on the handle of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver will notify you when it needs cleaned, with a lighted faucet icon right on the handle of the shaver.</li>
            <li> and it cleaned it right up.  </li>
            <li> and I think the manual says the razor may not work right for a week or two if you do this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s right where my thumb rests during</li>
            <li> The head unit is made of cheap material, not as good as the #12 heads of the previous system and boy do they cost a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning solution does seem to be more effective than boiling water, though it would probably take a few runs through the system to get them clean as new.</li>
            <li> If you have the funds, the man in your life will really enjoy this high end razor.  </li>
            <li> If you have the funds, the man in your life will really enjoy this high end razor.  </li>
            <li> The new cleaning system rinses your shaver in the upside down position in a special cleaning solution that seems very effective at removing the &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; from your shaver.</li>
            <li> I have previously been very happy with their products, but this experience has me made reluctant to purchase from the company in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, the Norelco 9700 has finally caught up with and in my opinion surpassed straight razors in terms of closeness of shave, and it does so while offering a more comfortable shaving experience.  </li>

            <li> This has by far been my favorite, most reliable, and longest lasting shaver till now.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, but the one step down</li>
            <li> The second day I started with &#x27;medium&#x27; and found it worked much better, but still not quite good enough, so halfway through I switched to &#x27;high&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The heads glide amazingly well across my face, far better than any other rotary I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With less bright lights it is readable.</li>
            <li> This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my husband since he loved his previous Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> i went back to my last norelco triple header shaver and am happy again.</li>
            <li> That seems reasonable for the preventative care and maintenance of such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a final note the cleaning cartridge leaves a visible proof of how much it cleaned - its amazing...  </li>

            <li> 9700 model boasts that it cuts 20% more hair in a single pass, making for a faster, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Its surprisingly quiet and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Looks very modern and fits in well with any bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving is very straight forward with the 9721.</li>
            <li> It did a fantastic job on my head, better than any other razor I had tried.  </li>
            <li> If you forget, or just do not want to clean it regularly and the heads get too clogged up, an indicator light will tell you so.</li>
            <li> and I could empty the whiskers easily before needing to rinse, the heads on this unit do not come apart easily and the trimmer head is a separate head</li>
            <li> I found the best results shaving with my face dry before getting into the shower as that provides an even shave as I missed less spots than using a disposable razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those looking to upgade their electric shave.  </li>
            <li> far - this shaver is a huge hit.  </li>
            <li> I really like and prefer Norelco Shavers, generally, and have used them for many years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has a &#x27;choice&#x27; of 3 speeds, which you can try but set once, most likely.</li>
            <li> So, I must shave twice, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended to rinse it under hot running water after each shave which I do.</li>
            <li> but they could just produce a better trimmer that attaches to the same unit.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada.</li>
            <li> There really was NO comparison!</li>
            <li> First time use was with 5 days growth.</li>
            <li> sound:&lt;br /&gt;While neither are what I would call noisy, the Norelco is certainly more quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve used that beats the Braun 7 in shave quality.</li>

            <li> My skin thanks you!</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers over the years, but have never been satisfied with one.</li>
            <li> first thought was, &amp;</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that the blade moves independently of the silver ring around the blade - so that ring moves to accommodate you</li>
            <li> instruction booklet says to not be discouraged by lack of close shave or if you do have irritations at first.</li>
            <li> There is a great digital display from 0-100 which shows how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> , does not take any longer to shave than the higher speeds.  </li>
            <li> Manual cleaning the shaver between shaves lets the system do a better job and extends the fluid and filter life.  </li>
            <li> This razor never irritated my skin and gave me consistent, zero stubble shaves for over 7 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Travel Lock and Carrying Case: I somehow accidentally pressed the travel lock while shaving the first time.</li>
            <li> This is the first Norelco I have owned, and the first razor I have owned with the triple rotary shaving heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it for about 3 weeks now and find after I do my first pass of shaving I have to another pass</li>
            <li> Panasonic is only slightly better than Braun (foil-type shaver) for my face in terms of closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> When the shaver is first turned on the default power setting is on the &#x27;medium&#x27; setting and can be adjusted with the &#x27;+/-&#x27;</li>
            <li> my first week of using the 9721 I&#x27;ve carved out a schedule of daily rinsing the razor and then using the SmartClean for a more thorough wash once a week.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what I experienced during my 21-day challenge.rently $46 on Amazon&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what I experienced during my 21-day challenge.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really big - providing even more clutter on our bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> To put in another words, for the first time in over fifty years, I have not used a blade and shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving daily in excess of fifty years, mostly with blades and shaving gel.</li>
            <li> First of all, in the one that I received the website is improperly cited.  </li>
            <li> I have predominantly preferred electric shavers over razors for the last 15 or more years.</li>
            <li> Though I was very satisfied with my old model, this is definitely an improvement, and if experience is any indicator, Philips makes dependable, long-lasting products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look at the reviews of the razor heads first before anyone buys....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied with the Braun as I feel the shave isn&#x27;t quite close enough.</li>
            <li> The only difficulty I encountered is that the rotary blades don&#x27;t quite reach the area of my top lip just underneath my nose.</li>
            <li> At Norelco customer service&#x27;s request, I tried scrubbing with the brush that comes with Norelco razors, running under hot water and scrubbing, and soaking in boiling hot water until the water cooled - with the razors and foils removed).</li>
            <li> My first razor was a Braun.</li>
            <li> First were two ring, then three blades emerged.</li>
            <li> pretty scene.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty scene.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Norelco S9784 provides a shave that truly is as close as a blade, The cleaning system&#x27;s fluid is based on some soap-type substance rather than alcohol, and I think works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I may not have bought even though I was interested.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Panasonic razors back in 2011 when I got an ES8249S.  </li>
            <li> That was when I tried my first triple headed Philips, the Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D.  </li>
            <li> I currently use a Panasonic ES-LA93K which I reviewed here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s been my favorite razor ever.  </li>
            <li> I love the design of it, the feel, the motion sensor that shows you the battery life as soon as you pick it up, and how quiet it is.  </li>
            <li> They are signficantly improved and delvier a close and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw the product listing for the Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that had three speed settings.</li>
            <li> Norelco has a cutter that you must remove the shaver head first and snap it on.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good with heavy beards i.e. medium-to-long growth.</li>

            <li> You have to press down on the very  top  of the stand and it will spring up to allow fr room to get the shaver in place</li>
            <li> Many cool diodes spell out different sorts of information such as the extent of the battery charge, whether you should use the cleaning module (Yes, pretty much always, because those proprietary replacement cartridges generate a nice profit even though they&#x27;re pretty much alcohol and oil mixed in water), and whether tonight is a full moon in case you&#x27;re going to turn into a wolfman at midnight and want to pack your Norelco 9700 shaver before you leave for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just never got those circular motions right compared to the straight motions for shavers without rotating heads.  </li>
            <li> I expected a lot from a 350 dollar shaver and my husband says it was smooth and felt good, as well as did a great job on what it is supposed to do -- cutting whiskers.</li>
            <li> &#x27; buttons within easy reach to the right and left sides.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridge keeps the shaver very clean but if the cleaning cycle is run daily it lasts one month; with the 3-pack that would be about $5.50 per month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m struggling with a rating since the shave quality of this Norelco is so, so nice that it would be a shame to give it anything other than 5 stars.</li>

            <li> While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12</li>
            <li> You definitely get a really great shaver with this one, which should be expected with the price of it.</li>
            <li> initially thought a comparison between this, the Braun 7 and the former top-of-the-line Norelco (the SensoTouch 3D) would be a good way to explore the features.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a snap with regular tap rinses and more thorough cleaning with the SmartClean system.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My Panasonic is not loud, but it&#x27;s a higher, more persistent pitch that does penetrate walls and doors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with the Panasonic and I&#x27;m glad my testing period is finally over, because it was taking so much longer to shave...</li>
            <li> The SmartClean will display a &#x27;ready&#x27; light indicator once cleaning and drying is complete and once the razor is fully charged and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the batteries are great, they won&#x27;t die because u charged them mid charge or anything.... but to capitalize on the batteries design, remember, u can make this machine last a few years by giving it full charge and discharge cycles, given that the display will show accurate percentage read out</li>
            <li> Starting with cheap, low-end Braun or Wahl foil shavers, with the vibrating cutter heads, more recently I &amp;#34;jumped up&amp;#34; in the quality and price range of shavers, by purchasing the Philips Norelco 8175 Speed XL.</li>
            <li> This is the latest in a long chain of electric razors I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provide an OK shave, but not near as close as the Braun 7 Series.</li>
            <li> And for me, it pretty much was a repeat.  </li>
            <li> Do the reverse the Braun on the first day will show straight hairs about 1/8th of an inch.</li>
            <li> best for sharp looking face, I do not recommend for round shaped faces</li>
            <li> but honestly after use it as wet shaving method  with gel it gives close shave but hold on !!</li>
            <li> One minor gripe is that I seem to be more prone to getting ingrown hairs with purely electric shaves or</li>

            <li> For a more thorough cleaning you can open up the shaving heads and take out each set of blades and clean them individually.</li>
            <li> Usually an electric will not do good on my beard, but this one does very well.</li>
            <li> The side I shaved with this just did not feel as good as the side I shaved with my Panasonic, and it took over twice as long to do the same amount of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not by a lot, but the edge certainly goes to Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the cleaning/resting station is rather large and bulky, so if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space on your bathroom vanity, this could be a drawback.</li>
            <li> Kiam, who later owned the New England Patriots became famous as a CEO pitchman with a series of commercials about an electric razor whose tagline was \\&quot;It</li>
            <li> , can&#x27;t decide which was better as they both were just great,, I spent the extra money as I was tired of using a straight razor after my electric didn&#x27;t get close enough, good bye straight razor.</li>
            <li> display for battery is very useful as it gives you exact feedback on how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li> You can buy this in specially devised containers at the major stores in your neighborhood, price is $24.50 for 3 of them.  </li>

            <li> The net result is that although my face isn&#x27;t razor smooth I am getting a nice close shave in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor, but pretty darn close and without the burn I used to get with the older electric razors.</li>
            <li> Speaking of which, this razor does a pretty decent job of shaving my face.</li>
            <li> Again, greatest shaver I ever owned and continue to recommend it!ing head should be lightly brushed when dry to remove the cleaning process collect very small fine pieces of cut hair on it; not a problem if you&#x27;re not too fussy; does not interfere with the shaving.</li>
            <li> Not perfect by any means, but very good.  </li>
            <li> - the Norelco heads have more flexibility than the Braun, and did a better job around my Adam&#x27;s apple (always a tough spot for shaving).</li>
            <li> It left a satisfying, quick, clean shave, with little to no shaver irritation.</li>
            <li> My husband is quite happy to use it and we got rid of the older shaver that was a few years old in favor of this new one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought at first this would be an even higher speed than the old model, but it seems the top speed is the same as the old one.</li>
            <li> Much like the one I tried a year ago, I was amazed at the low sound levels this puts out.  </li>
            <li> This was a great buy -- expensive, but well worth it in my experience.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants suggestions post a comment</li>
            <li> It has a very plastic look and feel to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very hushed operating</li>
            <li> (the drying cycle is four hours), is a fingerprint and water spot magnet, and takes up too much counter</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s ready to goto work</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really pressing the shaver too much on my skin because I thought it would make the blades stop working as well.</li>
            <li> It runs quiet, is comfortable to use, has all the bells and whistles you could want, and it cleans itself while you watch football and drink a beer.</li>

            <li> I got routinely close shaves with these however, they caused much irritation when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to 2015, I purchased this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> 9700 also comes with a cleaning system/charging station that is very convenient despite it being a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> done Norelco, with the combination of close shave, comfortable grip, and overall fantastic shaving experience you have converted me back to electric shavers with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really cut.</li>
            <li> At over $300.00 this an absolute joke.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close.</li>
            <li> The entire head of the shaver can and should be replaced periodically and the indicator will light up when the unit needs replacement.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a very convenient feature.</li>
            <li> Though the shave is really close</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips Norelco has put together a very convenient, well built and well functioning electric shaver.</li>
            <li> finished my 21-day challenge and all in all I really like the 9721.</li>

            <li> He also tried out the trimmer - and it worked very well on his sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not only shaves closely; it is extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high-end electric razor which really will shave as close as a blade, this is your \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; device.</li>
            <li> Replacements are, as of this review, not available on Amazon.com, but are available through Philips&#x27; website for $12 a pair with free shipping, which I find extremely reasonable.</li>

            <li> The cutting heads on the 9700 are more flexible and exposed than the older model, and glide even more easily across the contours of your neck.</li>
            <li> I am ready to go with</li>
            <li> (But if you read carefully one comes with it and you can get three more for $8.01 delivered on their site.</li>
            <li> no need to take the whole head off.</li>
            <li> I really like the user interface on the shaver.</li>
            <li> If the price point is something you can handle, I really don&#x27;t think you are going to find another shaving system that will outperform this one.</li>
            <li> -- I couldn&#x27;t believe how much was in there when I changed it out after about 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This model is much quieter, cuts closer and recharges much quicker.  </li>
            <li> It was better than expected.</li>
            <li> You should not have to press and go over a spot on your face multiple times in order to clear it---the more you pass over your skin</li>
            <li> Even the user manual says you have to keep shaving &amp;#34;solely&amp;#34; with this shaver for at least 21 days before getting a good shave.</li>
            <li> I contacted Philips Norelco, and apparently there are known issues with the cleaning system so they offered to send me a new cleaning system for free.</li>
            <li> It gives better results than any other, so far and I am hopeful that it can only keep getting better.</li>
            <li> It gives better results than any other, so far and I am hopeful that it can only keep getting better.</li>
            <li> The first day I selected &#x27;low&#x27; and although it did a pretty good job, it seemed to take way too long, requiring many slow passes.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has to sit facing directly to the right</li>
            <li> Since my old shaver wouldn&#x27;t fit in the cleaning system, I nevertheless disassembled my old shaving head and just put the cutters in there to see how well it removed older, heavier accumulation.</li>
            <li> Likewise, spending extra money on cleaning fluid cartridges isn&#x27;t very economical when you can just use the running faucet to clean it, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An added plus is the &amp;#34;Smart Clean&amp;#34; feature which keeps the shaver very clean, allegedly keeps the blades sharper and lubricated - we&#x27;ll have to see on that.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco S9721/84 is my first rotary electric shaver and only my third (or so) electric shaver period; my others being a Braun 3 and 7-series foil-shavers that I used sporadically for many years.</li>
            <li> cleaning station is obviously one of the biggest reasons for the significant markup in price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is lighter, quieter and more responsive than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It takes about three or four passes to get a smooth shave, which is not quite as quick as my last electric shaver, however it&#x27;s so much smoother that it simply doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> cannot access the blades, to thoroughly clean them or move them to a different position.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the S9721, he had to repeatedly go over the same areas and still did not receive a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> The key seems to be in the pressure more than anything else, with possibly a slight advantage to a light shave cream that wont clog in the blades.</li>
            <li> It’s easy to do but takes about an hour to wash and 4 hours to dry.</li>
            <li> This is in simple terms a separate cradle that the 9721 electric razor pairs with to both charge and clean the razor.</li>
            <li> And oddly enough, the Philips website for this razor has videos, and one of them has the speaker specifically mentioning how to clean by hand, since you can do that all the time, and maybe once every 3 to 4 weeks run it through the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> Nothing breaking the clean lines of the unit on the outside.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I peeked about 6 or 8 minutes later it was almost up to 30%, so it certainly seems to charge quickly.  </li>
            <li> Because of the high cost, I can&#x27;t readily recommend this razor to others.</li>
            <li> ...then put the shaving head back onto the body of the razor and place it into the special holder.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the liquid in the special device for cleaning needs to be replaced every three (3) months.  </li>
            <li> As is, since it is a loose part it may get lost easily - so I put it in the included shaver case to ensure it does not get</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s nice to know that I can dry shave without having skin irritation or red</li>
            <li> Wet shaving with the 9721 in my opinion is superior to a dry shave in terms of closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s backed by a 2 year warranty, which shows they are equally confident of their product.e after separating the top portion of the shaver should be adequate for daily cleaning, and the more open design of the shaving heads seems to leave fewer &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; for shaving accumulation to dirty up your shaver.</li>
            <li> If u were to charge the machine every day and u don&#x27;t care, then the machine will last u roughly a year to two years max, ur going through the chemicals too quickly, but with full discharge and charge cycles u can get 4 to 5 years, and since it&#x27;s such a cool machine, i think it&#x27;s worth it....</li>
            <li> Power increments are low - medium - full power and displayed on a graduated scale.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty sensitive to both foil and rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> The angles seem to be a little better on this one for the convex curves on the skull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to shave very often due to sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> This makes a difference because I&#x27;m -- as you probably know if you&#x27;ve read many of my previous reviews -- a deodorant model.  </li>
            <li> So I began tweaking my methods... using more or less shaving cream, using none at all, etc.</li>
            <li> With more pressure, I noticed less or no stubble at all in some areas.</li>
            <li> After testing it, I can say that it does about 40-50% better than norelco razors that I have used that were 70$ or less.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s nothing it&#x27;s been unable to do, it&#x27;s been irritation free, and is a quick razor that&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can easily shave at night and someone even in the bedroom connected to the bathroom wouldn&#x27;t hear it if the door were closed.  </li>
            <li> particularly the contours of the jaw and throat.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> But it is a wider attachment than in older models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can see the results in ads in many recent fashion magazines such as Elle and Seventeen and Deodorant</li>
            <li> If I only shaved with the grain I did not get a adequate shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves it spotless afterward however, the cartridges will evaporate quickly, which means you will be buying cleaning cartridges regularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the box the shaver comes with enough power for a quick shave</li>
            <li> It is much more complicated to put the razor in it, and better suited for an engineer.</li>
            <li> The head comes off much easier than last time, and since you need the feature for beard trimming, it&#x27;s a worth while trade.</li>
            <li> This one also fit much better in the corner behind the sink.  </li>
            <li> I like that the cleaner actually displays how far into each stage it is - not just one light for cleaning, one for drying, and one for charging.  </li>
            <li> I tried cleaning it every other day after the first month and the shaver appears just as clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the single broad razor still does a better job on my face.</li>
            <li> knowing exactly how much charge you have left on board is very helpful.</li>
            <li> However, the convenience factor of electric shaving is quite high.</li>
            <li> However, the convenience factor of electric shaving is quite high.</li>
            <li> I had unusually high hopes for this Philips Norelco shaver from the start.</li>
            <li> cost of this Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver is on the high side, even at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> cost of this Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver is on the high side, even at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but it is as&lt;br /&gt;good or easy as other older models.</li>
            <li> While it is very nice to keep track of battery life in the digital readout, we determined that the upgrade isn&#x27;t necessary as the shaver is essentially the same as the 9300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Norelco has added some unusual tricks to that old classic.  </li>
            <li> am Caucasian and have full growth (no beard) but it is fine and straight, not heavy and thick or curly.</li>
            <li> I always clean my razors manually after a shave, then leave them to dry.  </li>
            <li> It was a powerful machine, but soon I realized it takes me twice the time to use it every day than my regular Gillette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below the LCD screen a few more icons can be displayed that provide a range of information.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The rotating heads require yearly replacement, assuming normal use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning my old model was definitely the most hassle, beyond the daily shaking out of stubble and rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li> shaver is only three months old, but it has to be within 45 days to get a full replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver can be cleaned with water, an improvement over the Braun, so you&#x27;ll likely find that you don&#x27;t need to use the full cleaning cycle particularly frequently.</li>
            <li> At first was seems kind of uncomfortable on my face but after 3 times shave, i must say still my first choice in any brand for shaving.</li>
            <li> If my face is dry, the Norelco is used as it does the best job; if my face is wet, I use a traditional razor as the Norelco does not shave as closely when my face is wet.  </li>

            <li> The primary differences are that I experience a much closer shave with less skin irritation with the 9721 than I ever did with my Braun.</li>
            <li> that made it 3 or 4 times more expensive than other good quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned (including others from Norelco).</li>
            <li> For this review I tested both, shaving cream on the left and none on the right, since I&#x27;m right-handed, for three shaves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;****uch as to celebrity art gallery openings and royal galas with only the right side of your face</li>
            <li> The shaves are quick, easy, complete and do not irritate the skin (at least not mine).  </li>
            <li> Norelco gets long hairs laying flat much better than the Braun and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found dry shaving is actually not so bad with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I liked all the bells and whistles on this shaver and because those extras were only available on this shaver which only comes with this bulky Jet Cleaning System, I was forced to buy it this way.</li>
            <li> This 9000 series shaver is manufactured with the new RQ12+ head.</li>
            <li> I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels brand new each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks and feels brand new each time.&lt;br</li>

            <li> That is the reason in 2007, I went ahead and got a new Panasonic ES shaver with all the bells and whistles and the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> seems like a &amp;#34;REFURBISHED&amp;#34;, even though it&#x27;s listed as NEW.</li>
            <li> else is new?</li>
            <li> A new feature is the adjustable speed (3 settings).</li>
            <li> I asked if I could get store credit to purchase new razor heads in lieu of a new cleaning system (which I&#x27;m not going to use anyway now</li>
            <li> About 4-6 years ago the new Norelco was called ?</li>
            <li> The razor worked but I started reading about the advances the new one has so...........</li>
            <li> this new one.</li>
            <li> We are moving and the new bathroom has softer lights</li>
            <li> He is like a kid with a new toy.</li>
            <li> and there he is using his new shaver...</li>
            <li> Within 2 hours the area under the nose and the jawline appear to need another shave.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with the Braun Series 7 790cc or the new 799cc</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin baby smooth and without the occasional scrape a regular blade gave me.  </li>
            <li> I like a vry close, smooth shave which seems to only come from a regular blade razor.</li>
            <li> Blade shavers may want to consider this option as well particularly if they frequently miss parts of their shave.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is not a difficult daily growth to shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does so pretty quietly....</li>
            <li> the shaver is pretty quiet!</li>
            <li> I wash the shaver under hot water before putting it back on the cradle anyway, so it is just another peace of</li>
            <li> The cartridges are supposed to last 2-3 months, but they&#x27;re not expensive.  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll likely want to charge the device first.</li>
            <li> It incorporates the principles of the original dual bladed razor, the Trac II, by using one blade to pull on the whisker and the other to snip it off.</li>
            <li> But by the same token, I like it anyway since it gives it a bit more functionality than the other cleaning systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ideally I will be shaving first with the Panasonic (my current favorite)&lt;br /&gt;then switching to the Norelco for finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, yet, if I will need to purchase new shaving heads as frequently on this new type of electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think a faucet rinse after separating the top portion of the shaver should be adequate for daily cleaning, and the more open design of the shaving heads seems to leave fewer &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; for shaving accumulation to dirty up your shaver.</li>
            <li> It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  </li>
            <li> But the razor I purchased a year ago for $100 less still outperforms this by a huge margin, so for this price, I just can&#x27;t see the value.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention, just shaving the one side of my head to a less than smooth result took 9 percent of the charge.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed having a few extra minutes each morning that are normally dedicated to shaving.</li>

            <li> With his setting, I found the shaver to be at its best, doing a lot of cutting with a single pass.</li>
            <li> At one point I used shaving gel and found it glided across my skin better, however the extra time it takes to apply the gel is part of what I&#x27;d like to avoid by switching to an electric razor, so I went back to dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether my beard is coarse and dense (after a weekend at the lake), or short and stubbly, it just takes a few quick passes to get the close smooth feel</li>
            <li> first starting out shaving, the Gillette Mach 3 (or any similar department store razors) was my main razor.</li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s display is clear, but is no match for this in terms of size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the shaver is locked in place, the cleaning system will clean the shaver heads for ten minutes, and then dry them for four hours.</li>
            <li> opening it, I still was unsure as to this hefty price tag, especially considering how the razor felt in my hand - sort of hollow and light.</li>
            <li> It is lighter than the Sensotouch and clearly cheaper looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Costco&#x27;s price was $144 for this whole system, regular $174.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s motion sensitive - when you pick up the razor</li>
            <li> (I believe it&#x27;s advertised as 8 different directions) and gives a much closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A helpful reminder for busy people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can also see how much battery you have left and what speed you&#x27;re using, if the shavers are blocked, when its locked for travel and when you need to replace the shaver</li>

            <li> I think norelco has gone too far in electric shaver tech.</li>
            <li> 9700 is much quieter than any shaver I&#x27;ve used and is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charges fast and last a while.</li>
            <li> how much batter power is left.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a while, but Panasonic was like that too and as loud or even louder.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that I really didn&#x27;t want the cleaning unit, but you have to pay for it to get the razor.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> There are also buttons on the shaver to set the shave speed in three settings - low, medium, fast.  </li>
            <li> While this razor does include a ~$22 year maintenance cost in changing the optional cleaning fluid, this is not required and you can just use water if to clean the razor - moreso $22/year is a lot less than you would be spending on straight razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

            <li> If I use medium or fast, my skin turns red.</li>
            <li> SmartClean operates in two phases - a cleaning cycle that takes about 10 minutes to complete and a drying cycle that takes about 4 hours to complete.</li>
            <li> but so far - I&#x27;ve heard nothing but raves.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, efficient, fast, sell-cleaning?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There haven&#x27;t been any complaints so far</li>
            <li> shaver offers three speeds to choose from.</li>
            <li> That made no sense at all since I have had my old Norelco for 30 years and it still keeps on</li>
            <li> That made no sense at all since I have had my old Norelco for 30 years and it still keeps on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least four units (maybe more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how long I&#x27;ve had it, but at least 3-5 years and it still performs excellently.</li>
            <li> But regardless, you can get the performance you want, and adjust slower if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this one is the closest shaving one I have had</li>
            <li> So far they like them.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for nearly 60 years.</li>
            <li> razor: You can plug it in directly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with my old trimmer as I don&#x27;t like removing the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with my old trimmer as I don&#x27;t like removing the head.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t need to turn it on, or unplug/replug to see how far along the charge was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They all worked reasonably well following the contours of my face, but there&#x27;s something about this shaver that sets it apart.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a considerable improvement over the Norelco 1290/8800 series with one exception.</li>
            <li> However, you can charge it separately by a direct connection.</li>
            <li> The Braun, like the 9700, can be charged directly without a stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither the Braun or Panasonic has any difficulty with the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to shave near the bottom of my sideburns also yields hairs being pulled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun and Panasonic cleaning systems are far better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only bit of warning would be not to use on more than a few days growth -- shaver every day or two -- as it will pull at that point.  </li>
            <li> and this does a good job, and it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, even after a couple days of not shaving.</li>
            <li> The only reasons the 9700 was more expensive were that the Smart Clean is \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; and there is a digital readout on the handle.</li>
            <li> If you want the same effect, while not spending as much money you can: 1. run hot water over the blades and let dry or 2.</li>
            <li> If this one has the same life expectancy as my other Norelco, this one should last many years.</li>
            <li> I have used other Norelco products in the past and been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This ensures that my skin won&#x27;t be sticky and my hairs are dry and crisp.</li>
            <li> The cleaner/charger takes a little getting used to, but it is not required to  either charge or clean the razor.</li>
            <li> Imagine a super size fountain soda sitting upside down on your counter -</li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> ended up using this Philips for everyday and Panasonic if I need to be really clean</li>
            <li> Now I consistently get very close shaves while getting the added benefit of having a sort of &#x27;session&#x27; every morning that I was missing with the electric.</li>
            <li> the older razors I had the head popped open</li>
            <li> I just used my Panasonic for the first time and what has been taking 15 minutes to do poorly just now took three minutes to do smooth.  </li>
            <li> A little three bar indicator on your digital display indicates how strong your WIFI signal is.  </li>
            <li> the cleaning was another nightmare , unlike Braun series 7  the cleaning system for this shaver is not sanitizing the razors because its water based solution it just clean and lubricate it only  , I didn&#x27;t like this point with the cleaning system due the lack hygienic for the shaver , The shaver dose not  deliver close shave</li>
            <li> Even on high, the shaver is incredibly quiet.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would say under my neck this actually does a better job that a straight razor, and I use expensive brand name straight razors.  </li>
            <li> A few limiting factors inherent to electric shavers are present but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from easily recommending this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> (but I don&#x27;t know how much the cleaning solutions sells for and how long it</li>

            <li> He had a mirror inside of his locker and would shave, get dressed and be off to muster long before the rest of us finished getting ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the old 8175XL has three rings of blades, while the 9700 has only two rings--the outer being the wider V-shaped blades, and the inner the straight blades.</li>
            <li> wash it under hot water (careful not to scald yourself)</li>
            <li> You could see the round blades were full of hair cuttings and that were not removed during the cleaning process as Norelco claims would happen.</li>
            <li> While I would not say this is necessary, it is a nice feature to have; whether or not you would use it would be if you have the space on your bathroom counter for it - the cleaning station is about as thick as a 2-liter bottle of soda and a little more than half as tall.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s first shave with this was on a day where he had a pretty decent beard - it had been at least 4 days since his last shave.  </li>
            <li> The SmartClean system that comes with the shave is kind of a pain to set up, but when I use it, which I do twice a week, the shaver seems to be even less irritating than when I clean with plain hot water.</li>
            <li> Because the current smart cleaner is too big.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most expensive razor (by a large margin) that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer and with less irritation than most other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, the shaver still has about 65% of its original charge left, so clearly taking it on a business trip for a week or two wouldn&#x27;t be a</li>
            <li> They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12</li>
            <li> Finally I decided to buy this new Philips Norelco s9721</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is the same but new.</li>
            <li> You can use this on wet and dry skin and clean up is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went back to a traditional straight razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging:  It charged up in about an hour and the digital display shows how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> All of that comes with a hefty price but someone looking fora shaver that will last them several years should really consider making an investment into the 9721.</li>

            <li> It has a quick charge feature that when the battery is dead, if you charge it for about 5 minutes, you can use it for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a quick charge feature that when the battery is dead, if you charge it for about 5 minutes, you can use it for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Those with limited space on their sink or vanity should recognize that the real estate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two major components that will have to be replaced with the 9721 and</li>
            <li> There are three holes in the top, and there seems to be 2 or possibly 3 separate compartments, but they are all full of the cleaning solution, so it does not appear that the dirty solution is separated by anything besides sedimentation?</li>
            <li> I have a pretty square jaw and a fairly sharp chin.</li>
            <li> I do not know facts about the battery, but full charge gets only about half the minutes of the Sensotouch.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference whether or not was wet or dry shaving, using cream or not.</li>
            <li> I used the brush to clean it in the past, but there were no brushes included with this one.  </li>
            <li> * Cleaning indicator: This small spigot icon will flash after each use to remind you to wash or use the SmartClean system to clean the shaver.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The cleaner adds a little bulk to the charger but seems worth the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:</li>
            <li> I find the slower speeds are better for the tough spots (jaw line, neck, etc.)</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to comment yet on the three speeds available.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to comment yet on the three speeds available.</li>
            <li> So far, I still prefer my Braun from last year over this one.</li>
            <li> The 9721 shaver fits into the SmartClean and uses the same AC adapter that will plug directly into the SmartClean.</li>
            <li> I end up using it for a couple of weeks, then putting it aside and going back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> This is a hardline policy, apparently.</li>
            <li> The old one only traveled for 10-14 days.</li>
            <li> My last case does for these, but it is soft so the lack of a blade cover makes me not want to do that.</li>
            <li> It ends up taking about 3 times as long to shave as it does for me normally.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not - there are some fantastic shavers from Braun, Norelco, Panasonic and Remington that cost much much less but still perform well.</li>
            <li> I know we do not want something heavy to work with, but you tend to judge quality slightly on the heft of an item - does it feel solid and worthy, or does it feel cheap, lightweight and hollow?</li>
            <li> However, at Christmas time, I for a few Amazon gift certifiates and decided the time was right.</li>
            <li> rounded heads also move independently of each other so the shave is close on the first swipes</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just such a poor replacement for a decent Panasonic, doesn&#x27;t shave as smooth and takes a LOT longer to get those lackluster results.  </li>
            <li> I had tried electric razors in the past (mainly the cheap 3 circle ones for 70$ or less that resemble this norelco)</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy a new shaver, it is quiet at first, but gets louder with use.</li>
            <li> however, the weak spots were it shaving the more &#x27;coarse&#x27; hairs and the mustache on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> however, the weak spots were it shaving the more &#x27;coarse&#x27; hairs and the mustache on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, after spending over $300 for a razor, it should a great job.</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing a Norelco shaver again and recommend that you do not purchase this shaver unless you get a separate warranty from a store that provides a full exchange for at least a year.</li>
            <li> All of the major shaver manufacturers offer a factory-direct money back guarantee if the retailer will not take it back.</li>

            <li> I bough this product, yet this super cleaning &#x27;gismo&#x27;, is hard for this 78yr old&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is said to charge enough in three minutes for a shave, which I found hard to believe, so I tested it, and if you&#x27;re in full wolfman mode a three-minute charge will get you only about half done, which means you either have to charge again for three minutes or go out in public, such as to celebrity art gallery openings and royal galas with only the right side of your face</li>
            <li> beard grows fast and is coarse and dark.</li>
            <li> Also, using smaller circular motions seemed to improve performance instead of straight lines up and down the face, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the Norelco with a thin gel-type shave cream and it did fine.</li>

            <li> Once in a while the side groves of the shaving head should be lightly brushed when dry to remove the cleaning process collect very small fine pieces of cut hair on it; not a problem if you&#x27;re not too fussy; does not interfere with the shaving.</li>
            <li> And I know that the manufacturers claim that it takes a while to \\&quot;train\\&quot; your skin for a new razor, so I&#x27;m going to keep using this and see if anything changes, but the other one had no difference over time, so</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the heads are already ruined and it is harder than it sounds to clean cheap plastic moving parts without snapping it in half.</li>
            <li> They said my only option was to purchase $60 razor heads again after only two months of use from a $350 razor that was supposed to last a year; even though the reason the heads were damaged was clearly Norelco&#x27;s fault (due to a faulty cleaning system).</li>
            <li> I generally use it when my face is dry to get the closest shave</li>

            <li> Finally my face has stopped burning from razors, and my skin is clean and clear as this does not scrape your skin or very slightly if you press it hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> They tilt and almost remind you of the pivot of a Dyson vacuum.</li>
            <li> Yet for some reason, it had a bear of a time doing the flat part of my head above my ear, the entire side just didn&#x27;t seem to want to shave well.  </li>
            <li> 9700 shaves much faster than the 1290, usually requiring only one repeat over the same area.</li>
            <li> my previous razors, I was buying new razor heads about every 9-10 months.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I opened the box the new model razors head was completely made from cheaply made plastic and</li>
            <li> Only when my face is tanned from being outside for long periods of time is when my shaven beard blends in with the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> My normal shave was about 5 minutes for the last few years.</li>
            <li> My normal shave was about 5 minutes for the last few years.</li>
            <li> you have to give an extra time and mess at sink and have to clean it up under running water for several times at least every 3- 4 strokes , I personally didn&#x27;t satisfy with this shaver and I after going underwhelming</li>
            <li> My beard grows at a rapid pace, and as a result I usually have to use a straight razor to take care of it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver would shave one small part of my face really well, but make the rest too sticky to be shaved because of the cleaning gel that remained on the head after cleaning.</li>
            <li> The foil openings are not very big and will catch long hairs, pulling them.</li>

            <li> otherwise it won&#x27;t sit flat.  </li>

            <li> motor seems under powered and not fast enough at the fastest setting.&lt;br /&gt;The low and medium speed setting is unusable for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not true of the neck which requires considerable repetition, causing some irritation.</li>
            <li> Cleaner charger is quite large, but at least for travel you can charge the shaver without it.</li>
            <li> It also uses the same plug as my other hair care Philips products - the balder, and one of the vacuum trimmers I have that I use for my beard.  </li>

            <li> My personal preference is to go with a wet shave and shaving cream along with the 9721</li>
            <li> Strangely as others have noted, the case won&#x27;t accommodate the cord.</li>

            <li> At first glance it appeared that the new model shaver had a larger surface area for cutting, but this was not so.</li>
            <li> both on dry skin and wet skin, again different from electric razors of the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to the previous Arcitec Norelco razor, this premium line product is less well designed than their older mid-level to low-end line.</li>
            <li> This razor is only about half the weight of the last.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, unlike the previous generation that I had tried and returned, this actually did well on the curved parts of my skull.  </li>
            <li> And with each new generation of electric razors, there&#x27;s usually some improvement with some facet of it.  </li>
            <li> This seems largely due to the new V-shaped cutting blades, compared to the old straight blades.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the single, broad head of my previous razors to these three mini-heads.</li>
            <li> In comparing the 3 I found that the slow setting was much easier on my skin while I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference in the cutting efficiency.</li>
            <li> The display also shows a variety of other data elements when the shaver is in use, such as speed, wash reminder, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, on every other metric - especially the cleaning station - the Braun is the hands-down winner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, on every other metric - especially the cleaning station - the Braun is the hands-down winner.</li>
            <li> This is likely due to the cleaning system which reduces the oil buildup on the blades.  </li>
            <li> This is likely due to the cleaning system which reduces the oil buildup on the blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can dry shave or use foam or gel.</li>
            <li> S9300 version is about $100.00 less for the same shaver, and same shave minus a couple of doodads.  </li>
            <li> The single AC adapter powers the SmartClean and charges the 9721 razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver uses Norelco’s usual lift-and-cut action that lifts up your hair follicles and then cuts them off, so you get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> for storing and cleaning it, this is probably where I am the most unhappy with it, due to the size and bulk.</li>
            <li> spent the following few days trying out different techniques before fully getting use to it.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco razor a long time ago and was curious to see how they have improved.  </li>
            <li> Razors have a small head so it gets real close in tight</li>
            <li> While not necessarily a deal breaker, it does cut down on the efficiency of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I finally had to just move it across or up and down my face in some areas.</li>
            <li> This one has a release button on the side, and the entire bottom drops down, and that&#x27;s where the cartridge slides.  </li>
            <li> Higher cost does not mean betterthis very expensive model.</li>
            <li> Trued both dry shave and wet shave</li>
            <li> Braun feels like a typical German-made product: solid.</li>
            <li> I have shaved wet and dry -</li>
            <li> /&gt;(+) Dry and wet shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(+) Dry and wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor is cordless and can be used wet or dry, with or without shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I am a longtime Braun user and switched to Norelco because this shaver was supposed to provide a similar shave in much less time.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, and also my after shave stings LESS</li>
            <li> It is quiet, and also my after shave stings LESS</li>
            <li> So my results are very similar to the comparison when I purchased the previous model of this Philips razor and ended up&lt;br /&gt;returning</li>
            <li> 9700 is designed for use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> 9700 is designed for use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This is my very first electric razor and I can find nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Beware of fake reviews written by some Norelco Philips promoters and some vendors , I&#x27;m using Philips Norelco since 10 years ago and my old Norlco 1280 was like a dream ,but the head razor got worn and new replacement was so pricey.</li>
            <li> , the less time is spent Photoshopping my axillary areas back to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried both wet and dry, and I prefer the wet shaving with foam.</li>
            <li> You can shave wet or dry!  </li>
            <li> The status lights on the cleaner could be a little brighter, but overall its a keeper,</li>
            <li> Even came back from a trip where I did little cleaning of the shaver</li>
            <li> I am soon to be 79 and would not go back to any other shaving system I have previously used.</li>
            <li> While I have owned Norelco shavers in the past with tilting blades, this is the first one I have tried that works in getting the hard to reach spots under my neck -</li>
            <li> Granted, the performance of both trimmers is far below what a dedicated trimmer can do, but at least the Braun makes it easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, the performance of both trimmers is far below what a dedicated trimmer can do, but at least the Braun makes it easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, this razor cuts so closely and so effortlessly (no hair pulling, no razor burn) that I am now going to switch back to electric shaving after years of buying expensive straight razor refills.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about the entire shaver is a lack of a storage spot for the trimmer on the cleaning/charging station itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Get the heads wet as well as your skin</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected to be blown away.</li>
            <li> you read the provided booklet there are a couple of things to be careful of.  </li>
            <li> After using the Phillips for a few weeks, I sent it back.  </li>
            <li> I had use a couple Braun models but never really thought they were that well done.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if I still like it after I have to pay up to replace the fluid in a few</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if I still like it after I have to pay up to replace the fluid in a few</li>
            <li> Shave the face with the 9700 after you have shaved with the Braun and you will see minimal collection.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It has bigger holes and causes the shaver to actually jam on a thick 2 day beard growth.</li>
            <li> While this cleaning base looks nice and sleek, it is still rather cumbersome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not messy at all, I mean it catches all the cut hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Biggest downside (but certainly not a deal-breaker) is that there isn&#x27;t any place on the stand to store the trimmer head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real big fan of wet shaving, but the Norelco was less messy than doing a wet shave with a foil</li>

            <li> decided to shave half my head with this, and the other half with my Panasonic I&#x27;ve been using for the last year or so.  </li>
            <li> So I shaved the same half of my face with this, the other half with my existing razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This lead me to contemplate other razors.</li>
            <li> solution is NOT alcohol based (unlike the info in some other reviews, it says so on the box).</li>
            <li> a small built-in LCD screen displays the current battery charge (in &#x27;%&#x27;) and a battery full/low indicator.</li>
            <li> A small tiered power meter is displayed above the battery indicator.</li>
            <li> The shaving technique for rotary shavers is to make small swirls across the shaving surface vice back and forth movements with foil shavers.</li>
            <li> The other I sometimes use of the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, it is expensive to replace the head of the razor, $64.50 and they recommend doing this every year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noise level is lower than other electric razors.</li>
            <li> Every couple of years I get a new electric razor, either as a gift or a splurge after I get tired of using a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> Note that you cannot actively shave while the 9721 is connected to your power outlet.</li>
            <li> that to my Panasonic, which shaved the other half of my head in about 1/3 of the time it took this, and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to give advice since every face is different.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to give advice since every face is different.</li>
            <li> That would usually be a lather several times and finish with a few blotches routine.</li>

            <li> I keep on in my car ( a battery powered Remington actually) to touch up if I have a late court hearing.</li>
            <li> The display goes dark after a timeout during charging, but&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this shaver to take down what I grow</li>

            <li> If your battery runs down</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I travel, my shaver bounces around in my travel bag and turns on, running down my battery.</li>
            <li> You put a cleaning cartridge in the cleaning system and place the shaver upside down into it.</li>
            <li> and then you press down again to lock it in place.</li>

            <li> Push down a connection with a click...and forget about it until tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> I have used several Panasonic models, and the cleaning cartridges slid in from the front on one leaving it visible, and slides into the rear on the other which you can still see because of how I have it positioned in the corner of my countertop by the wall to wall mirror behind the sinks.  </li>
            <li> Its an odd omission.</li>
            <li> In previous models, it used to be on the flip side of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The use of shaving cream seems to have made the shaves less prone to irritation of that dermic region.  </li>
            <li> Why not include it as a pop-out as in previous models.  </li>
            <li> I never needed it with my previous Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention my safety razor was much less than even the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleak, shiny, and black.</li>
            <li> However, you will get the razor slightly clogged while doing so.</li>
            <li> So far, we&#x27;ve been using it in its charging/cleaning base so it is always fully charged and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The 9721 can go in the shower and that&#x27;s where I typically shave</li>
            <li> while I keep the shaver in the cleaning station to charge between uses, I&#x27;ve never seen the display indicate less then 97% charged.</li>

            <li> 8000 series required the little plastic stand which is a pain to keep track of when you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li> The box and instruction and razor have lots of  little cartoon pictures</li>
            <li> This unit is a little pricey.  </li>

            <li> with all things, there are a few items which should be addressed.  </li>
            <li> After this continued to be a problem for a few weeks, I stopped using the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> have been a Norelco user for over 40 years, average life for past razors about 15 years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one&#x27;s just not worth the money, apparently may not last, and Norelco no longer stands behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few razors over the years.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am slightly pale...and the contrast to my almost black beard makes it hard to &#x27;look&#x27; like I have a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to need to be cleaned often in its base unit to keep the shaves clean,</li>
            <li> Also switching to the sideburn trimmer is cumbersome and it will be only a matter of time before that breaks down and is useless.</li>
            <li> Less than 30 days after its purchase, the shaver&#x27;s charging circuit failed and a red exclamation point appeared at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li> This sounds crazy but it is almost like a new &#x27;toy&#x27; to him.</li>
            <li> I tried to contact Philips warranty, but they have put so much barrier that it is almost impossible to send them proof of purchase.</li>

            <li> Razor burn is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> This is an added expense: I am not sure what replacement cartridges cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as for getting a close shave - at first I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> There is really not a better electric shaver out there.  </li>
            <li> Still, perhaps it is worth it for the charging/cleaning base and the maneuverability and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I have never bought one of their expensive models until now and don&#x27;t regret the extra money.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave comfort:&lt;br /&gt;Again, tough one to call, but again, I&#x27;d have to go with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> This $350 razor only lasts 60 days and Norelco does not stand behind their products!!!</li>
            <li> Eventually I got tired of it.</li>
            <li> only annoying part is the fact that you have to exchage the heads for a the clipper..</li>
            <li> My husband commented on that as he was taking out the umpteenth piece of unnecessary cardboard.</li>
            <li> But alas, no happy ending.</li>
            <li> and I have to return the broken one to them.</li>
            <li> I open the head and dump the hairs out then let the cleaning base do its thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the shaver still performs poorly because the residue from the faulty cleaning system will not wash</li>
            <li> It got a ton of poor reviews</li>
            <li> I at least can&#x27;t see the faint symbols on the SIDE of the cleaning well</li>
            <li> However, the build quality is disappointing and the cleaning station is a pale shadow of the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> these cutting heads pivot effortlessly and manage to maintain their cutting contact at every angle, which much less pulling and chafing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does a lousy job around the nose, and lips (vermilion boarder and corners (angles) of the mouth, and neck.</li>
            <li> Buy the 8000 series instead, this one is overpriced and uses expensive refill cartridges for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Norelco has NO OPTIONS for that replacement.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it will not run with the charging cord plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i just threw $300 away buying this useless piece of junk.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like and prefer Norelco Shavers, generally, and have used them for many years. I DO NOT like this one for the following reasons: I am 67 yo.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Cost&lt;br /&gt;-One must remove the blade unit and snap on the trimmer/sideburn clipper, as it is not built in.&lt;br /&gt;-It does not shave close.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a &#x27;choice&#x27; of 3 speeds, which you can try but set once, most likely. Gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;-I have to re-shave everywhere with my Norelco Arcitec, which I love, and it has a sideburn trimmer built-in to flip up when you like but it is as&lt;br /&gt;good or easy as other older models. So, I must shave twice, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended to rinse it under hot running water after each shave which I do. I recharge it and run it through the cleaner when the&lt;br /&gt; charge gets low.&lt;br /&gt;-It does a lousy job around the nose, and lips (vermilion boarder and corners (angles) of the mouth, and neck. I constantly play with the lip areas with my fingers and tongue , which bothers my wife, until I shave with the Arcitec.&lt;br /&gt;-Though it is cleaned regularly it shaves no better plus I use Norelco spray on it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;-You cannot access the blades, to thoroughly clean them or move them to a different position.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It looks very nice in the bathroom but does take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;-It is nice to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-it has a nice and convenient cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;-Prices are cheaper through Amazon for the three-pack cleaner, even with the Philips deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costco&#x27;s price was $144 for this whole system, regular $174.&lt;br /&gt;My father did not like this unit either.&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have full growth (no beard) but it is fine and straight, not heavy and thick or curly. It is not a difficult daily growth to shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the XL model either but have liked all others and wore them out ( used for years). I use this shaver to take down what I grow&lt;br /&gt; overnight and finish with a Norelco Arcitec 3-D model.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT recommend this very expensive model. I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers. I prefer the XL pop-out trimmer to trim down my sideburns and reduce chest hair. I bought this through Costco so got extras but it does not do what it is supposed to - SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this shaver, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone. I recommend the Norelco 2100! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this. Higher cost does not mean betterthis very expensive model.

            <li> Fantastic product. Cuts close, quick, and comfortably. The self cleaning feature is so simple. Just put the shavers away in the holder and it gets cleaned whenever it needs to. Battery lasts 2 weeks plus and I always charge when I get down to 50% charge remaining.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Norelco for years now and this is the best yet. The trimmer needs work but they could just produce a better trimmer that attaches to the same unit. I still give it five stars because this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Buy the 8000 series instead, this one is overpriced and uses expensive refill cartridges for cleaning.  Also, ugly in stand as this one goes in backwards.  Tricky to operate!  I returned it!</li>
            <li> outstanding close shave. Well made</li>
            <li> Cleaning the razor is labor intensive.  However I like the shave it gives.</li>
            <li> This 9000 series shaver is manufactured with the new RQ12+ head. In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products. First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada. Can you imagine that your shaver&#x27;s battery will need replacement in the next couple of years? Sorry, Norelco has NO OPTIONS for that replacement. I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  You will also notice on the Norelco Architec shaver that the cord can NOT be inserted into the shaver, but only into the charger. When the battery can no longer be charged, it can not be powered by the cord either. Next, you will want to consider the RQ12+ Replacement Head. While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12+ is poorly manufactured and has the following problems. 1. It has bigger holes and causes the shaver to actually jam on a thick 2 day beard growth. 2. The movable heads now have edges that protrude against the contours of your face and they will catch on your chin and elsewhere. 3. Shaves with this RQ12+ take longer. 4. Shaves with the RQ12+ are not nearly as close. Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster. There really was NO comparison! It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  I have spoken with their customer service reps twice and they simply take notes an apologize. They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12+ is \\&quot;better\\&quot;. This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception. You have been warned!</li>
            <li> I have used other Norelco products in the past and been very satisfied.  However this model is an improvement over the past models.&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof and can be used in the shower.  it is easy to clean and can be done with hot water.  It fits well in the hand and has 3 speeds&lt;br /&gt;depending on you beard length.  I think the cleaner that came with it  is a waste and after the cleaning product that came with it is gone, I doubt i will use it.  However I could not find this 3 speed razor without the cleaning element.&lt;br /&gt;After all it can be easily cleaned with hot water.  So i think the cleaning element is a waste.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer and with less irritation than most other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  Not perfect by any means, but very good.  The SmartClean system that comes with the shave is kind of a pain to set up, but when I use it, which I do twice a week, the shaver seems to be even less irritating than when I clean with plain hot water.</li>
            <li> An excellant razer. So much better then the Norelco I bought a couple of years ago. Usually an electric will not do good on my beard, but this one does very well.</li>
            <li> I was waiting more for the high price that I paid&lt;br /&gt;It is messing a support for the shaver when we are not using it. Because the current smart cleaner is too big.</li>
            <li> Used it now for a week. Great close shave, love the cleaning system as well. Trued both dry shave and wet shave, can&#x27;t decide which was better as they both were just great,, I spent the extra money as I was tired of using a straight razor after my electric didn&#x27;t get close enough, good bye straight razor.</li>
            <li> Good, my boyfriend likes it.</li>
            <li> Great razor. But at the price I hope it last longer than my last Norelco. My last razor lasted 2 years and at $300 cost is about 41 cents a shave. Just seems expensive, not counting the cleaning solution and new razor head approx. 58 cents per shave total.</li>
            <li> it shiped to my home of beijing  cost 12 days !&lt;br /&gt;but it works well ~ You&#x27;re Worth It!</li>
            <li> This shaver made me start use eletric shavers after 20 years!</li>
            <li> No advantage over cheaper versions. It does not do a clean shave</li>
            <li> Speedy and close shave.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied, thank you!</li>
            <li> After 1st change out of &#x27;wash bowl&#x27; liquid this feature stopped working! FYI.</li>
            <li> The cleaning fluid leaks</li>
            <li> Purchased two!  Gave one as a gift and the recipient is very happy with theirs and I am quite happy with mine!  I have had Norelco razors for over thirty years and of all of them this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This is not just another rotary blade razor. I have used  both types of electric razors: the perforated screen with vibrating head, and the rotary head razors of several manufacturers. With the exception of this one, they all had the flaw of not providing a clean shave in all the areas of my face, I had sort of given up on electric razors. Philips Norelco has come up with a rotary head that does the job. I am soon to be 79 and would not go back to any other shaving system I have previously used. The cleaner/charger takes a little getting used to, but it is not required to  either charge or clean the razor. The status lights on the cleaner could be a little brighter, but overall its a keeper,</li>
            <li> Seems to be too slow. Long hairs get yanked out causing some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JHL</li>
            <li> I used a Braun foil shaver some years ago. Super slow and the occasional painful tug of a hair. Eventually I got tired of it. I tried a Norelco about 16 years ago. I know they said to get used to it, but it was torture and I returned it.  Went back to a traditional straight razor. I have very sensitive skin. If I shave with a few days growth I am going to be scraping my face in a few places and leaving a mess in the sink. The 9700 is nothing short of amazing. First time use was with 5 days growth. That would usually be a lather several times and finish with a few blotches routine. The 9700 effortlessly cleaned my face like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Its surprisingly quiet and very comfortable. I find I am getting a closer shave than ever. I am shaving those little places that were always a nuisance to get to. It leaves my skin baby smooth and without the occasional scrape a regular blade gave me.  Razor burn is a thing of the past. The thing is amazing and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;My only peeve is that the carry case has no slot for the removable edge trimmer for sideburns and such.Its an odd omission.</li>
            <li> It is entirely a quality product ! Although , I have to charge it after 10 uses , but he just shaves in excellent condition. I think this is the best razor I had and I am very satisfied .</li>
            <li> The shaver did a great job while it lasted.  Less than 30 days after its purchase, the shaver&#x27;s charging circuit failed and a red exclamation point appeared at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li> The product is not equipped with a razor protective cover. if it can be equipped with one,it is better.</li>
            <li> great close smooth shave..only annoying part is the fact that you have to exchage the heads for a the clipper..cant understand why they couldnt just have a pop out one..maybe because of the self cleaning?..</li>
            <li> Received the goods, feel very good, the packaging is not damaged, a very pleasant time to shop! PHILPS razor is also very comfortable. Have the opportunity to buy.</li>
            <li> perfect. love it very much!</li>
            <li> Damn this s*** is crazy!!! Love my shaver9700</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor, but pretty darn close and without the burn I used to get with the older electric razors.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: Norelco sets a new high in terms of rotary shaver performance with a device that provides for a truly wonderful shave. However, the build quality is disappointing and the cleaning station is a pale shadow of the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review:&lt;br /&gt;I own and use many shavers - collecting them is a hobby. But I&#x27;ve always felt that if I could only have one, it would be the Braun Series 7. That remains true after using this shaver (the 9700), but it&#x27;s not because of the shave quality - this shaver gives a slightly better shave than the Series 7. Where it falls down is with build quality and ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[As a quick aside to those who are new to electric shavers and are wondering if you have to pay this much to get a good shave. Absolutely not - there are some fantastic shavers from Braun, Norelco, Panasonic and Remington that cost much much less but still perform well. If anyone wants suggestions post a comment and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially thought a comparison between this, the Braun 7 and the former top-of-the-line Norelco (the SensoTouch 3D) would be a good way to explore the features. But, after using all three shavers for the back-to-back tests, I decided to limit the comparison to just the Braun 7 since the 3D is beat by the 9700 on every metric (except for price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the comparisons below \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; refers to the Braun Series 7-790; \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; refers to the 9700.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun feels like a typical German-made product: solid. The Norelco feels flimsy. I was really disappointed when I took the Norelco out of the box. Based on the feel alone, I would have guessed it cost $75 at most. It has a very plastic look and feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of \\&quot;wow\\&quot; continues when you use the cleaning station. The Norelco looks and feels cheap; the Braun looks more stylish and certainly feels better made. Braun wins the build quality metric by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operating sound:&lt;br /&gt;While neither are what I would call noisy, the Norelco is certainly more quiet. Very hushed operating sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Display:&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco has one of the nicest displays I&#x27;ve come across. It&#x27;s motion sensitive - when you pick up the razor the display shows the percentage of battery power. The numbers are large (½ inch tall) and easy to see. The display also shows a variety of other data elements when the shaver is in use, such as speed, wash reminder, etc. The Braun&#x27;s display is clear, but is no match for this in terms of size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics:&lt;br /&gt;Braun takes the lead on this. While the Norelco is no slouch, the Braun just fits my hand better and is easier to grip. The Norelco&#x27;s buttons lack solid tactile feedback and, like the rest of the shaver, do not have the quality feel of the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave closeness:&lt;br /&gt;This is a tough one to call. Both are very good but I think the Norelco is just a bit closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave comfort:&lt;br /&gt;Again, tough one to call, but again, I&#x27;d have to go with the Norelco. The heads glide amazingly well across my face, far better than any other rotary I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neck shave:&lt;br /&gt;This was a surprise - the Norelco heads have more flexibility than the Braun, and did a better job around my Adam&#x27;s apple (always a tough spot for shaving). Not a night-and-day type difference, but the Norelco has a definite performance edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverability:&lt;br /&gt;Again, a surprise - I had an easier time getting around the edges of my mustache with the Norelco than the Braun. Even though the Norelco heads are rounded, I found it easier to shave a edge line with them versus the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave customization:&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers allow the speed of the cutters to be varied (L/M/H) and, for both shavers, it makes a difference. I find the slower speeds are better for the tough spots (jaw line, neck, etc.) so you can go slower but not get skin irritation from multiple passes. Both do it equally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave:&lt;br /&gt;Norelco by default since the Braun is a dry-only shaver. I tried the Norelco with a thin gel-type shave cream and it did fine. I&#x27;m not a real big fan of wet shaving, but the Norelco was less messy than doing a wet shave with a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;Braun by a mile. The Norelco uses a pop-on trimmer that is time consuming and cumbersome. The Braun is a simple pop-up. Granted, the performance of both trimmers is far below what a dedicated trimmer can do, but at least the Braun makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;Braun by a mile and then some. The Braun cleaning station is simple, easy to use, and works well. The Norelco looks cheap, sounds cheap, takes forever (the drying cycle is four hours), is a fingerprint and water spot magnet, and takes up too much counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco is a truly impressive performer when it comes to shave quality. Smooth, quick, gentle and easy to maneuver. It&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve used that beats the Braun 7 in shave quality. Not by a lot, but the edge certainly goes to Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on every other metric - especially the cleaning station - the Braun is the hands-down winner. The cleaning station for the Norelco  is almost an insult given this price point. I expect the 9000-series will come in models with and without the cleaning station. If so, skip the cleaning station!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m struggling with a rating since the shave quality of this Norelco is so, so nice that it would be a shame to give it anything other than 5 stars. But given the price, I think they should have done a better job with the overall build quality, and certainly a MUCH better job with the cleaning station. Given those faults, I think 4 stars is more accurate, and could even make a case for 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s face is different. A razor that works great for one person may perform poorly for another. All of the major shaver manufacturers offer a factory-direct money back guarantee if the retailer will not take it back. But don&#x27;t give up on a razor after only one shave. Your face needs to become accustomed to the shaver which can take several shaves. Norelco recommends using it for 3 weeks before making up your mind; I think one week is sufficient.ve:&lt;br /&gt;Norelco by default since the Braun is a dry-only shaver.

            <li> My husband was the tester for this product and his comments are framed in his deep affection for the Norelco brand. He&#x27;s always used a Norelco. This 9700 series shaver was interesting because we also tried the 9300 series. The only reasons the 9700 was more expensive were that the Smart Clean is \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; and there is a digital readout on the handle. While it is very nice to keep track of battery life in the digital readout, we determined that the upgrade isn&#x27;t necessary as the shaver is essentially the same as the 9300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver charges unbelievably fast, which is very handy for my husband who often forgets to charge it!&lt;br /&gt;-It holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver comes with a very nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;-The rounded heads move in more directions (I believe it&#x27;s advertised as 8 different directions) and gives a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;-The rounded heads also move independently of each other so the shave is close on the first swipes so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the area- particularly the contours of the jaw and throat.&lt;br /&gt;-The \\&quot;+\\&quot; and \\&quot;-\\&quot; buttons give you the option of speed in order to deal with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver has a separate attachment for the side burn trimmer. In previous models, it used to be on the flip side of the shaver. Now you have to take off the heads and put on the side burn attachment. While not necessarily a deal breaker, it does cut down on the efficiency of the shaver. But it is a wider attachment than in older models.&lt;br /&gt;-It is very expensive for not much improvement over the 9300 series shaver.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging isn&#x27;t Amazon Frustration Free! My husband commented on that as he was taking out the umpteenth piece of unnecessary cardboard.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my husband since he loved his previous Norelco shaver.  This is the WORST razor I have purchased!  After using for about 5or six months, he now shaves with shaving cream and a hand shaver.  With the S9721, he had to repeatedly go over the same areas and still did not receive a clean shave.  I am so disappointed, after spending over $300 for a razor, it should a great job. How I wish I could return it.  Word to the wise, save your money.</li>
            <li> This is my very first electric razor and I can find nothing wrong with it. I get a smooth, close shave with it, it is easy to clean and the heads are easily interchangable. An excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that people have some really strong feelings about shaving gear.  I have learned they aren&#x27;t reticent about expressing those feelings with gusto.  I have been on the receiving end of that gusto in Amazon reviews.  As you will see, I don&#x27;t care much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 is a high-quality cordless electric shaver that can be used with or without shaving cream on your armpits.  For this review I tested both, shaving cream on the left and none on the right, since I&#x27;m right-handed, for three shaves.  This makes a difference because I&#x27;m -- as you probably know if you&#x27;ve read many of my previous reviews -- a deodorant model.  The closer shave I can get without redness, the less time is spent Photoshopping my axillary areas back to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up preferring with.  The use of shaving cream seems to have made the shaves less prone to irritation of that dermic region.  You can see the results in ads in many recent fashion magazines such as Elle and Seventeen and Deodorant Quarterly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 comes with a cleaning module that also is the battery-charging station.  Many cool diodes spell out different sorts of information such as the extent of the battery charge, whether you should use the cleaning module (Yes, pretty much always, because those proprietary replacement cartridges generate a nice profit even though they&#x27;re pretty much alcohol and oil mixed in water), and whether tonight is a full moon in case you&#x27;re going to turn into a wolfman at midnight and want to pack your Norelco 9700 shaver before you leave for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is lithium ion, which is what you want.  It is said to charge enough in three minutes for a shave, which I found hard to believe, so I tested it, and if you&#x27;re in full wolfman mode a three-minute charge will get you only about half done, which means you either have to charge again for three minutes or go out in public, such as to celebrity art gallery openings and royal galas with only the right side of your face shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I subtract 1 star from 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****uch as to celebrity art gallery openings and royal galas with only the right side of your face shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I subtract 1 star from 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****</li>
            <li> This is a simple-to-use shaver, but complex in its design. They put a lot of thought into this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about it is it&#x27;s intelligent: The shaver automatically turns on its battery charge level indicator when it is moved. It&#x27;s washable. After each use, you clean it by popping off the heads and holding the shaver and heads under hot running water, and then air drying. When you finish shaving, it reminds you to clean it with a blinking indicator that looks like a faucet, so you do not forget. If you forget, or just do not want to clean it regularly and the heads get too clogged up, an indicator light will tell you so. For a more thorough cleaning you can open up the shaving heads and take out each set of blades and clean them individually. There is a tool provided to grab the blades, turn them counter-clockwise and pull them out. There is also an indicator on the shaver that tells you when it is time to replace the shaving heads. A helpful reminder for busy people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice-looking, with its sleek design, and feels good in your hand. It fits your hand in the right places and is lightweight. This shaver uses Norelco’s usual lift-and-cut action that lifts up your hair follicles and then cuts them off, so you get a closer shave. Also you can adjust the speed to three levels--if you need it slower or faster, you can make it so. Charging the shaver only takes and hour and gives you around fifty minutes of shave time. However, it took me about 2 1/2 weeks of shaving each day for the battery to run down--and that was using it on the highest speed. I think the lithium-ion battery helps it last longer. If your battery runs down and you forget to charge it for the next shave, you can do a 5-minute quick-charge that will give you three minutes of shave time, which is enough to get by. Sadly, it will not run with the charging cord plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the get-go this shaver has been quiet. Usually when I buy a new shaver, it is quiet at first, but gets louder with use. Not this one. I really like that. Sometimes when I travel, my shaver bounces around in my travel bag and turns on, running down my battery.This shaver has a travel lock that keeps that from happening. There is a hard-sided travel pouch for the shaver, as well, so it does not get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can dry shave or use foam or gel. The instructions tell you to use circular motions when shaving. However, it&#x27;s a bigger area that the shaving blades are in, so it can be tricky to do that and get a good shave. I finally had to just move it across or up and down my face in some areas. Like almost all razors these days, you can also trim you sideburns or mustache. For this there is a separate trimmer head. You simply pop off the shaver heads and pop on the trimmer head. It also can be rinsed under hot running water and air dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that is not enough, there is a cleaning system that comes with the shaver that will get the gunk out. Bear in mind that your device will be physically clean, but not disinfected. You put a cleaning cartridge in the cleaning system and place the shaver upside down into it. Once the shaver is locked in place, the cleaning system will clean the shaver heads for ten minutes, and then dry them for four hours. Indicator lights on the cleaning dock tell you which cleaning cycle it is in. During this time, if the shaver needs charging, it will be charged also. Thirty minutes after the cleaning system has cleaned and dried the shaver, it will power off. Therefore, you do not have to worry about it wasting electricity, if you go to work or just forget about it. You can also use the cleaning system as a place to store the shaver when you are not using it. The instructions say to replace the cleaning cartridge every three months, but I suppose that would depend on the environment the cartridge is in and how often you clean the shaver with it. This is an added expense: I am not sure what replacement cartridges cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco challenges you to try the razor twenty-one days, and if you do not like it they will refund your money. Otherwise there is a full two-year warranty. There are many complexities with this shaver, but once you learn what everything means, it really is an easy-to-use and helpful appliance. I recommend this shaver for the busy guy who wants a good shave and can afford the price of the device and future replacement cleaning cartridges.nt cartridges cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco challenges you to try the razor twenty-one days, and if you do not like it they will refund your money.

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Philips Norelco can do better than this one ? great shaver.</li>
            <li> i have really sensative skin and have been looking for a shaving system to help... This is the smoothest system out there... My skin thanks you!</li>
            <li> U pick up the razor and it kinda says hello, it lights up, it woulda been kinda campy if it did, but showing the power level and showing u it&#x27;s ready to goto work is pretty useful and cool....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great shaver, speed, faster, slower, three positions, power cable plugs into the machine itself too, so u can travel very easily with this machine, the cleaner is pretty good, it leaves the machine, perfectly clean. Cleaning the machine is also easy manually, just pop the top with the blades and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet machine, nobody bitches that the machine is doing its thing, big plus, also doesn&#x27;t drown out the radio or whatever ur listening to in the morning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shave.... it takes about a week for the skin to get used to ithe new blades, the main cutter now has a z pattern, but it works just as nice as the old cutters, but it seams to grab more stuble, and more hair in each revolution, so in effect the machine is a little faster than the old one, messing around with the speed of the blades also helps depending on your skin, so great idea norelco...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the batteries are great, they won&#x27;t die because u charged them mid charge or anything.... but to capitalize on the batteries design, remember, u can make this machine last a few years by giving it full charge and discharge cycles, given that the display will show accurate percentage read out, u can time this very easily. If u were to charge the machine every day and u don&#x27;t care, then the machine will last u roughly a year to two years max, ur going through the chemicals too quickly, but with full discharge and charge cycles u can get 4 to 5 years, and since it&#x27;s such a cool machine, i think it&#x27;s worth it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I luv Amazon.... great</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers over the years, but have never been satisfied with one. I like a vry close, smooth shave which seems to only come from a regular blade razor. I have never used an electric that didn&#x27;t leave me feeling a little prickly, with slight stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver - tall, dark and flashy, ...  with deep pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was, &amp;#34;a razor for 350 bucks?&amp;#34; What? It should shave and give happy ending for that price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening it, I still was unsure as to this hefty price tag, especially considering how the razor felt in my hand - sort of hollow and light. I know we do not want something heavy to work with, but you tend to judge quality slightly on the heft of an item - does it feel solid and worthy, or does it feel cheap, lightweight and hollow? I put the weight issue out of mind and continued unpacking. (Quite honestly now, after using it, I know and feel that it is the perfect weight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it up and waited for what seemed to be an ETERNITY before I could use this bad boy.  You charge it for an hour, for about 50 minute long use. It arrived with a drained battery, so needed charged before trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed when using it is the shaver heads. They move and conform to your skin like butter. They tilt and almost remind you of the pivot of a Dyson vacuum. They can cover any terrain, any contours. They feel good on the skin too, they glide, and do not get hot, even when using it for the full hour. They do not snag hairs at all and you do not feel anything except the smooth glide across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is great on the jawline and chin, as far as fitting the contours and molding to it perfectly. It is the best at conforming than any other razor I have tried. Each of the 3 blades move independently, allowing for great contours. What&#x27;s even better is that the blade moves independently of the silver ring around the blade - so that ring moves to accommodate you and so does the actual blade. The head unit itself also pivots, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no irritation to the skin. I have shaved wet and dry - with and without any creams. I haven&#x27;t had any irritations at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for getting a close shave - at first I was disappointed. After shaving, I could feel that little bit of stubble. The kind you can&#x27;t see, but you can definitely feel. So I began tweaking my methods... using more or less shaving cream, using none at all, etc. Then I tried tweaking the pressure I was using. I wasn&#x27;t really pressing the shaver too much on my skin because I thought it would make the blades stop working as well. It turns out you can use a good amount of pressure without stalling the blades at all. With more pressure, I noticed less or no stubble at all in some areas. It really didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference whether or not was wet or dry shaving, using cream or not. The key seems to be in the pressure more than anything else, with possibly a slight advantage to a light shave cream that wont clog in the blades. Also, using smaller circular motions seemed to improve performance instead of straight lines up and down the face, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction booklet says to not be discouraged by lack of close shave or if you do have irritations at first. It says to give it 3 weeks because your skin/hair needs to adapt to the new system and it states you will have better luck, closer shaves, etc as time goes on. I will say that the more I use it, the better i like the results, so there may be some truth to their claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a trimming/ shape up blade as well that works pretty good. I don&#x27;t have a need to use that too often, but as I use it more I can come back and update the review with more on that accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for storing and cleaning it, this is probably where I am the most unhappy with it, due to the size and bulk. Imagine a super size fountain soda sitting upside down on your counter - thats how this thing is.&lt;br /&gt;You put t in the base upside down of course to clean and charge. You have to press down on the very  top  of the stand and it will spring up to allow fr room to get the shaver in place and then you press down again to lock it in place. The shaver will notify you when it needs cleaned, with a lighted faucet icon right on the handle of the shaver. You can also see how much battery you have left and what speed you&#x27;re using, if the shavers are blocked, when its locked for travel and when you need to replace the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it with the base seems to work very well. It looks and feels brand new each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can charge it without using the base - just plug the cord straight into the shaver, but you cant use the shaver while its plugged in like that. It has a quick charge feature that when the battery is dead, if you charge it for about 5 minutes, you can use it for about 3 minutes. Its ok if you have just  super quick shave to do, but i don&#x27;t find it all that useful as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice thing as far as charging, is that you can use it on 100v - 240v outlets and the cord automatically uses whichever voltage is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do think it is a nice shaver. It gives better results than any other, so far and I am hopeful that it can only keep getting better. As for the price... I am still not convinced that ANY razor is worth 350 bucks, but it is a great gift and a nice splurge on yourself, if you don&#x27;t mind spending that much. It runs quiet, is comfortable to use, has all the bells and whistles you could want, and it cleans itself while you watch football and drink a beer.

            <li> I think norelco has gone too far in electric shaver tech. I bough this product, yet this super cleaning &#x27;gismo&#x27;, is hard for this 78yr old&lt;br /&gt;to ghasp. I am going to return it and get the best shave/with a BUILT in sideburn trimmer, and I&#x27;ve used norelco customer since i was able to shave.</li>
            <li> Norelco Model#S9721 is a high priced piece of junk with a flawed cleaning system that does not work as it does not remove the shaving hair cuttings from the shaver, leaving the shaver worthless. I found this out when the shaver got stuck in the Smartclean charging stand. The blade housing fell off as I removed the shaver from the charging stand. You could see the round blades were full of hair cuttings and that were not removed during the cleaning process as Norelco claims would happen. Also switching to the sideburn trimmer is cumbersome and it will be only a matter of time before that breaks down and is useless. I have been a Norelco user for over 40 years and i just threw $300 away buying this useless piece of junk. i went back to my last norelco triple header shaver and am happy again. AFTER WRITING NORELCO, THEY DID REFUND SOME OF MY MONEY BACK AND AMAZON ALSO REFUNDED SOME OF MY MONEY( I LOVE AMAZON HAPPY FACE DANCE).</li>
            <li> The shaves are quick, easy, complete and do not irritate the skin (at least not mine).  I am happy that Norelco&#x27;s system is back on track after I had 2 below par shavers from them about 5 years ago and went elsewhere.  There is really not a better electric shaver out there.  There are 3 reasons that I have given it 4 stars instead of 5:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is a great digital display from 0-100 which shows how much charge you have left. Yet, when you charge it in their dock, it only fits in backwards so that you can&#x27;t see the display and not know when it is fully charged.  What was the designer was thinking?&lt;br /&gt;2. The sideburn trimmer comes as separate component which you need to remove the shaver head component and then snap the sideburn component in.  Why not include it as a pop-out as in previous models.  It is one extra accessory to worry about now.  You now need to stop shaving, remove the head, find the sideburn trimmer, plug it in, then when finished turn it off, unplug the beard trimmer and add back the shaver head.  It is tedious, time consuming and now you have 1 more piece to keep track of making it possible to lose as well.&lt;br /&gt;3. I liked all the bells and whistles on this shaver and because those extras were only available on this shaver which only comes with this bulky Jet Cleaning System, I was forced to buy it this way. There is not an option to buy this excellent class shaver without the cleaning system.  I don&#x27;t know whether I will ever use it.  I never needed it with my previous Norelcos.  I used the brush to clean it in the past, but there were no brushes included with this one.  I believe if they offered the same shaver with and without the system, they might sell more of this shaver and certainly have more satisfied customers that are getting exactly what they need.  My guess is that it added $75.00 to the cost of what I paid.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor (but not the price) so here is the review in his own words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user for almost 40 years and am a fan of the original &amp;#34;triple header.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used Braun and Panasonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco S9721 was well packaged and included a good manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial charge lasted two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head comes apart easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving area feels much larger than it needs to be.  Low speed works well for my face, does not take any longer to shave than the higher speeds.  Manual recommends 3 weeks for your face to adjust to this shaver.  It did work better after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9700 is much quieter than any shaver I&#x27;ve used and is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to switch between the shaver and trimmer head, but highlighting the alignment tab on both head and shaver would make it easier to see and align for assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice bonus:  The travel lock feature prevents the shaver from accidentally coming on while traveling or storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard case provided also protects the shaver from damage during travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest downside (but certainly not a deal-breaker) is that there isn&#x27;t any place on the stand to store the trimmer head. It either lays on counter, adding to unsightly clutter, or gets put in a drawer for possible damage or even loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smart Clean System works well to clean and lubricate shaver.  Manual cleaning the shaver between shaves lets the system do a better job and extends the fluid and filter life.  The system alerts you when the filter is dirty.  Anticipated fluid cartridge life is 3 months, which I think is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not see an Amazon listing for replacement JC302 cleaning solution cartridges.  They are available in a 2-pack from the Philips website for $11.99 which includes free shipping.  That seems reasonable for the preventative care and maintenance of such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.  He feels like the difference in performance between his $250 shaver and this one is negligible.e of such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:889849caff23c7cf6e270982f792ffd3]]** Skip to 4:20 in video to begin the Norelco portion **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard grows fast and is coarse and dark. Only when my face is tanned from being outside for long periods of time is when my shaven beard blends in with the rest of my skin. Otherwise, I am slightly pale...and the contrast to my almost black beard makes it hard to &#x27;look&#x27; like I have a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---My History of Razors---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Digression--You can skip if you want to go straight to the review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first starting out shaving, the Gillette Mach 3 (or any similar department store razors) was my main razor. I got routinely close shaves with these however, they caused much irritation when shaving against the grain. If I only shaved with the grain I did not get a adequate shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During Christmas one year, I received a Braun 8595 (electric razor). I had tried electric razors in the past (mainly the cheap 3 circle ones for 70$ or less that resemble this norelco) however, they had never worked well. The Braun, however, was a &#x27;straight-across&#x27; electric razor with two &#x27;rows&#x27; of foils. This razor never irritated my skin and gave me consistent, zero stubble shaves for over 7 years. Braun changed the way they manufactured their replacement blades on this particular razor and consequently ruined what was good about it. Now, you can no longer buy the original replacement blades for it and thus...it basically does not exist anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lead me to contemplate other razors. I received a safety double-edged razor as a gift around 4 months ago and have since learned how to use it. Now I consistently get very close shaves while getting the added benefit of having a sort of &#x27;session&#x27; every morning that I was missing with the electric. The feeling of menthol-laden lather and a blade sliding on your face is just as good as a hot shower to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**End Digression**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 9700 shaver (I called it the &#x27;9000&#x27; series in the video because that is what the box says) is one of the e-razors that have the 3 circular heads. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t much luck with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Shaving Quality---] - 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best environment for an e-razor is a dry face with no moisture. This ensures that my skin won&#x27;t be sticky and my hairs are dry and crisp. On the highest setting (the norelco has 3) the norelco did a good job at clearing most of my beard however, the spots it shaved well, it left irritated. The spots it did not do well at...well, it left stubble that multiple circles would not pick up. You should not have to press and go over a spot on your face multiple times in order to clear it---the more you pass over your skin the more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of this razor, I was let down by the quality of the shave. In contrast, the Braun was half the price and shaved smoother on few passes--with no irritation. Not to mention my safety razor was much less than even the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Battery---] - 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges fast and last a while.

            <li> I expected a lot from a 350 dollar shaver and my husband says it was smooth and felt good, as well as did a great job on what it is supposed to do -- cutting whiskers. We especially liked that it has different speeds and comfort levels. My husband enjoyed (yes, he actually &#x27;enjoyed&#x27;) reading the manual. This sounds crazy but it is almost like a new &#x27;toy&#x27; to him. We opened the box, which is very well packaged with plenty of cardboard to keep it safe in transit, and then he enjoyed putting it together and charging it. A few thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;- the cleaning/resting station is rather large and bulky, so if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space on your bathroom vanity, this could be a drawback. of course, you don&#x27;t NEED to use it.  We have the space, but don&#x27;t like it to look cluttered. While this cleaning base looks nice and sleek, it is still rather cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;- it seems to charge very quickly. If you keep it in the cleaning base it charges continuously.&lt;br /&gt;- the fact that it cleans itself is a very nice feature. It does so pretty quietly.... with a little bit of &#x27;chirps&#x27; and motor sound.&lt;br /&gt;- It feels lightweight and balances nicely in hand.&lt;br /&gt;- Razors have a small head so it gets real close in tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;- We like how it lets you know how much batter power is left. So far, we&#x27;ve been using it in its charging/cleaning base so it is always fully charged and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;- the shaver is pretty quiet! Much more so than the one it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;- you can use it with or without shaving cream or water. My husband has been shaving without and has had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: it is a nice razor with a lot of good features. Performance-wise, it shaves a bit better than the $100ish razor I purchased for Christmas years ago, but at a pretty steep price! Still, perhaps it is worth it for the charging/cleaning base and the maneuverability and ease of use. My husband is quite happy to use it and we got rid of the older shaver that was a few years old in favor of this new one.&lt;br /&gt;-a few years old in favor of this new one.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I am a diehard fan of Gillette blades. I&#x27;ve been using them for well over 20 years. They are clean, easy, and quickly get the job done. However, the environmental issues with replaceable blades have always been in the back of my mind. That is the reason in 2007, I went ahead and got a new Panasonic ES shaver with all the bells and whistles and the cleaning unit. It was a powerful machine, but soon I realized it takes me twice the time to use it every day than my regular Gillette. I kept using it for about 18 months but finally gave up. Fast forward to 2015, I purchased this for Christmas. It was the top of the line, and I never tried a rotary shaver before, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First few days with this shaver was horrible! I felt like it is underpowered, even at the highest speed, and I was not getting a close shave. Even the user manual says you have to keep shaving &amp;#34;solely&amp;#34; with this shaver for at least 21 days before getting a good shave. Fortunately, it only took about 5-6 days before I started to notice some results. I tried both wet and dry, and I prefer the wet shaving with foam. I realized that unlike Panasonic, you have to use a circular motion to get the best shave, and with foam you can actually move the shaver quicker against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have many comments regarding the cleaning unit. Yes, it takes a while, but Panasonic was like that too and as loud or even louder. It is a little bit flimsy, but it gets the job done. I wash the shaver under hot water before putting it back on the cradle anyway, so it is just another peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The separate trimmer head is a bit strange, but not a deal breaker. The shaver also comes with a travel bag, which is nice. There is a tool for removing the blades for the overkill overhaul cleaning ritual as described in the manual, but I have a feeling I probably replace the blades by the time it requires such operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a very nice shaver. If you have the patience for the initial period, you might find this to be the best shaver ever. Phillips also guaranties this, and if you didn&#x27;t like it after 21 days, you can just return it for a refund. There&#x27;s nothing to lose, and you may help the environment on the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update 12/7/2016:&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to report after only 1.5 years of light use, the cleaning unit has stopped working. I tried to contact Philips warranty, but they have put so much barrier that it is almost impossible to send them proof of purchase. A third party company seems to be handling this named TelePerformance. They simply reject all emails with attachment, so there&#x27;s no way to send them proof of purchase even after they requested it themselves. I am deducting 1 point for breaking too soon and 1 point for warranty hassles, because if you ever have to deal with warranty, it is going to be a nightmare for you.he patience for the initial period, you might find this to be the best shaver ever.

            <li> The shaver is outstanding.  This is the 4th Norelco electric shaver I have had and easily the best yet.  Only issue is that I really didn&#x27;t want the cleaning unit, but you have to pay for it to get the razor.</li>
            <li> Wow. Amazing shaver and a great shave. Cleaner charger is quite large, but at least for travel you can charge the shaver without it. 8000 series required the little plastic stand which is a pain to keep track of when you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li> My beard grows at a rapid pace, and as a result I usually have to use a straight razor to take care of it.  That is, until I tried the Philips Norelco 9700 shaver.  While I have owned Norelco shavers in the past with tilting blades, this is the first one I have tried that works in getting the hard to reach spots under my neck - this is likely because the blades tilt two ways instead of one.  In fact, this razor cuts so closely and so effortlessly (no hair pulling, no razor burn) that I am now going to switch back to electric shaving after years of buying expensive straight razor refills.  In fact, I would say under my neck this actually does a better job that a straight razor, and I use expensive brand name straight razors.  The Norelco works well both on dry skin and wet skin, again different from electric razors of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9700 also comes with a cleaning system/charging station that is very convenient despite it being a bit bulky. This system allows you to place your razor in the holder after a shave and it will ensure it is cleaned to keep the blades in best condition.  While I would not say this is necessary, it is a nice feature to have; whether or not you would use it would be if you have the space on your bathroom counter for it - the cleaning station is about as thick as a 2-liter bottle of soda and a little more than half as tall.  You can also easily clean the shaver with water since it is waterproof, but the cleaning solution works a bit better; the solution lasts for 3 months and refills are about $5.50 a cartridge - but again note this is OPTIONAL, you can just use water to clean this waterproof razor if you&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display for battery is very useful as it gives you exact feedback on how much battery life is left.  Though, if you use the cleaning station it will keep the razor charged up for you so no worries about having a dead shaver.  There are also buttons on the shaver to set the shave speed in three settings - low, medium, fast.  Using medium I found the shaver gives an excellent shave without being too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also comes with a detachable beard trimmer - pulling off the main heads and attaching the beard trimmer is very easy.  However, I think a future model could improve upon the design by including an area on the cleaning station that holds the beard trimmer.  As is, since it is a loose part it may get lost easily - so I put it in the included shaver case to ensure it does not get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Norelco 9700 has finally caught up with and in my opinion surpassed straight razors in terms of closeness of shave, and it does so while offering a more comfortable shaving experience.  While this razor does include a ~$22 year maintenance cost in changing the optional cleaning fluid, this is not required and you can just use water if to clean the razor - moreso $22/year is a lot less than you would be spending on straight razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Norelco, with the combination of close shave, comfortable grip, and overall fantastic shaving experience you have converted me back to electric shavers with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has been a month using the product, and it is still performing as good as it did out of the box.  This is likely due to the cleaning system which reduces the oil buildup on the blades.  I generally use it when my face is dry to get the closest shave and this razor has remained my daily driver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2: I am still using the product regularly after some months.  However, I am alternating usage with a traditional razor depending on whether my face is wet or not.  If my face is dry, the Norelco is used as it does the best job; if my face is wet, I use a traditional razor as the Norelco does not shave as closely when my face is wet.

            <li> Shaves my legs and armpits clean and easy with water on level two (level three was a bit harsh). Get the heads wet as well as your skin and it works perfectly. The directions say it’s OK for the shower. I didn’t have the spray on when I used it but the shaver surely got wet and worked great. The three heads move in every direction so get close in every curve and crevice. The directions say it may take 3 weeks of daily use to get a really close perfect shave but I was satisfied the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging:  It charged up in about an hour and the digital display shows how much charge is left. I lose about 5% of the charge each time I shave so can get 20 shaves from each charge. Head popped off easy for quick cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel Lock and Carrying Case: I somehow accidentally pressed the travel lock while shaving the first time. It hasn’t happened since. Press power button three times to turn on and off. The case is well designed and holds only the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system:  This washes and dries your shaver with the press of a button showing each step of the process on the digital display. It does not disinfect the shaver. It’s easy to do but takes about an hour to wash and 4 hours to dry. The cleaner adds a little bulk to the charger but seems worth the space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: Has a trimmer. Looks standard. I did not use this feature.</li>
            <li> My rating is going from a 5 to a 4. Update to my prior review from about 10 months ago.  Shaver is just superb - but the Smart Clean device stopped working - the pump that fills the top of the basin to clean the shaver head ceased functioning. I have been using the cleaning device only with the proper Philips cleaner and replaced it monthly as I was using it daily.  Not very happy about this and will go to Philips for a replacement and will report the outcome.  I called Philips and received good service and they will replace the cleaning device and FedEx it to me and I have to return the broken one to them. My registering the product did not in any way speed up the service call as I had to provide all the information again.  But, so far so good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Philips Norelco shavers for over 30 years and this is the best one yet.  Love the way it contours my face giving the cleanest shave yet with the shortest duration.  I have never bought one of their expensive models until now and don&#x27;t regret the extra money. This one just shaves amazingly.  An added plus is the &amp;#34;Smart Clean&amp;#34; feature which keeps the shaver very clean, allegedly keeps the blades sharper and lubricated - we&#x27;ll have to see on that.  I used to change the blades every 3-4 months before and just simply water-cleaned or shook out the hairs. This cleaning process is easy and works great.  Even came back from a trip where I did little cleaning of the shaver and it cleaned it right up.  The cartridges are supposed to last 2-3 months, but they&#x27;re not expensive.  I&#x27;ll find out if they make it that long on a daily cleaning run. Definitely the best shaver so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03/24/15 update.  The cleaning cartridge keeps the shaver very clean but if the cleaning cycle is run daily it lasts one month; with the 3-pack that would be about $5.50 per month.  I tried cleaning it every other day after the first month and the shaver appears just as clean.  Once in a while the side groves of the shaving head should be lightly brushed when dry to remove the cleaning process collect very small fine pieces of cut hair on it; not a problem if you&#x27;re not too fussy; does not interfere with the shaving. As a final note the cleaning cartridge leaves a visible proof of how much it cleaned - its amazing...

            <li> This product is very good</li>
            <li> Since my college days, I have owned five electric razors. Three of those were Braun, two were Panasonic. This is the first Norelco I have owned, and the first razor I have owned with the triple rotary shaving heads.So far, I still prefer my Braun from last year over this one. It&#x27;s definitely a different feeling using this razor. It doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable or wrong in any way - just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most modern electric razors of the high-end variety, this one has a sizeable charging station with a cleaning function. I have mixed feeling about these things. they take up a lot of space on a sink, so unless you have a large vanity/bathroom, you might not be happy with the large size of the charging dock. Likewise, spending extra money on cleaning fluid cartridges isn&#x27;t very economical when you can just use the running faucet to clean it, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most electric razors I have used, this one charges up pretty quickly. At a full charge, I can get four shavings out of it. Speaking of which, this razor does a pretty decent job of shaving my face. I still prefer the single, broad head of my previous razors to these three mini-heads. I feel like the single broad razor still does a better job on my face. I can honestly say that I am biased towards these types of razors - having used them for so many years. I don&#x27;t think I am being facetious, though, when I say that those DO give my face a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my previous razors, I was buying new razor heads about every 9-10 months. I don&#x27;t know, yet, if I will need to purchase new shaving heads as frequently on this new type of electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most expensive razor (by a large margin) that I have ever owned. For the price, I expected to be blown away. I was not. It is a good razor, but I don&#x27;t know why it is priced so high. It seems like $100 less would be a more fair and realistic price. Because of the high cost, I can&#x27;t readily recommend this razor to others.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst purchase I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really cut. It pulls the hairs out most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;The necessity of changing cutting heads just to trim is an absolute joke.&lt;br /&gt;If you are wise, go to the dollar store and get theirs. At over $300.00 this an absolute joke.</li>
            <li> The worst shave&#x27; I have ever had</li>
            <li> I tried an electric shaver decades ago and my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it. I figured it was time to take another whirl to see if I had toughened up. This shaver didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin, which was great, but it also didn&#x27;t do a great job shaving for me. I&#x27;ve been trying it for about 3 weeks now and find after I do my first pass of shaving I have to another pass or two before I am finally done.  It ends up taking about 3 times as long to shave as it does for me normally.  Now, it may be due to the fact that I shave every 2nd or 3rd day, not on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to try it by varying how often I shave, but at this point it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This is much better than my Braun. Shaves very close. I only gave it 4 stars because I bought this from Amazon and my unit seems like a &amp;#34;REFURBISHED&amp;#34;, even though it&#x27;s listed as NEW.</li>
            <li> The package arrived intact the packaging was excellent. The unit had about 10% charge and was fully charged in under an hour. The instructions were straightforward. I haven&#x27;t tested the cleaner yet for obvious reason, but I expect it to be good if not excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave isn&#x27;t as good as a Gillette blade but it is only day 1. It does take a bit to get used to going in a circular motion and stretching the skin and applying pressure with the shaver.</li>
            <li> too expensive for such a quality shaving. the sides are not comfortable shave even trimmer. neck shaves bad ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put the summary first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips does not quite shave as close as my Panasonic does, but it gets ALL the hairs the Panasonic misses a few hairs around my neck and under jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this Philips for everyday and Panasonic if I need to be really clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the full review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had avoided Philips rotary shavers since I tried them 15 years ago and they chewed up my face. I was not hopeful about this but jumped at the chance to try them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just recently bought [[ASIN:B00FPQ70Z2 Panasonic ES-LV95-S Arc5 Wet/Dry Shaver with Cleaning and Charging System]] (foil-type shaver). Panasonic is only slightly better than Braun (foil-type shaver) for my face in terms of closeness of shave. When I compare this Philips to the Panasonic, the Braun can be lumped with the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations about this Philips:&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 speeds. I use the slowest. If I use medium or fast, my skin turns red. This is after allowing my face to get used to it exclusively for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It is really quiet. Quieter than any foil-type. I can hear the hairs being cut. I like that.&lt;br /&gt;It is not messy at all, I mean it catches all the cut hair. Nothing on my shirt or the sink.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like it needs to be lubricated. I think that is how it&#x27;s supposed to sound like.&lt;br /&gt;The manual wasn&#x27;t clear if I should rinse it before cleaning in the base or not? I open the head and dump the hairs out then let the cleaning base do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning takes 10 minutes. But drying takes 4 hours. Since you don&#x27;t need to use until the next morning, it shouldn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;The solution is NOT alcohol based (unlike the info in some other reviews, it says so on the box). This likely is why it takes 4 hours to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Panasonic (or most foil-type).&lt;br /&gt;Philips is better at:&lt;br /&gt;noise, it&#x27;s a lot quieter&lt;br /&gt;mess, it keeps hair in the shaver&lt;br /&gt;gets every hair, even the flat ones around my neck (I don&#x27;t have to check up close in a mirror to see if a hair is missed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is better at:&lt;br /&gt;closeness of shave&lt;br /&gt;speed of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s really hard to give advice since every face is different. And each shaver has strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this over the Panasonic?&lt;br /&gt;Probably (but I don&#x27;t know how much the cleaning solutions sells for and how long it lasts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both are good choices though.k (I don&#x27;t have to check up close in a mirror to see if a hair is missed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is better at:&lt;br /&gt;closeness of shave&lt;br /&gt;speed of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s really hard to give advice since every face is different.

            <li> The Philips Norelco S9721/84 is my first rotary electric shaver and only my third (or so) electric shaver period; my others being a Braun 3 and 7-series foil-shavers that I used sporadically for many years. My routine and \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; choice for shaving for the past five years or so has been a Merkur safety razor and disposable double-sided blades. I have always approached electric shavers as an \\&quot;in a pinch\\&quot; solution. With the 9721 I decided to take Philips Norelco on on their 21-day challenge - that is I&#x27;d shave with nothing but the 9721 for a full 3-weeks to fully acclimate my skin and shaving routine to the electric shaver. I&#x27;m a week in and here are my thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9721 is a nice piece of kit. The shaver is attractive; coated in a piano-black polished plastic housing with a sturdy black rubber backing where your hand makes the most contact. Holding the 9721 your thumb will find itself resting on the &#x27;On/Off&#x27; button with the &#x27;+/-&#x27; buttons within easy reach to the right and left sides. Touches of silver (&#x27;+/-&#x27; buttons) and chrome accents (shaving head) are used to finish the shaver . The 9721 has a nice, sturdy weight that strikes a good balance between feeling significant but not heavy enough to tire your hand while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below the power button a small built-in LCD screen displays the current battery charge (in &#x27;%&#x27;) and a battery full/low indicator. A small tiered power meter is displayed above the battery indicator. Power increments are low - medium - full power and displayed on a graduated scale. When the shaver is first turned on the default power setting is on the &#x27;medium&#x27; setting and can be adjusted with the &#x27;+/-&#x27; buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box the shaver comes with enough power for a quick shave but you&#x27;ll likely want to charge the device first. A full charge takes about an hour and that will translate into about 50-minutes of continuous shaving time. The white-LCD panel constantly updates on the status of the battery charge in increments of 0 to 100%. Note that you cannot actively shave while the 9721 is connected to your power outlet. I haven&#x27;t tried this myself but it is documented in the instruction manual. The 9721 accepts from 100V to 240V AC and that is a great feature for travelers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional notifications:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below the LCD screen a few more icons can be displayed that provide a range of information.&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning indicator: This small spigot icon will flash after each use to remind you to wash or use the SmartClean system to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;* Travel Lock: Pressing and holding the power button will activate and deactivate the travel lock feature that will disable all buttons. The feature is handy when traveling to prevent the shaver from inadvertently turning on.&lt;br /&gt;* Replace Shaving Unit: The entire head of the shaver can and should be replaced periodically and the indicator will light up when the unit needs replacement. Philips Norelco advertises about a year of usage per shaving unit but that will vary from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;* Blocked Shaving Head: This indicator is a red exclamation point and signals that a shaving head is blocked and needs to be thoroughly cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, the 9721 is most definitely superior to my old Braun foil shaver. The primary differences are that I experience a much closer shave with less skin irritation with the 9721 than I ever did with my Braun. The shaving technique for rotary shavers is to make small swirls across the shaving surface vice back and forth movements with foil shavers. The net result is that although my face isn&#x27;t razor smooth I am getting a nice close shave in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving is very straight forward with the 9721. It&#x27;s literally just a button press away and I&#x27;ve found dry shaving is actually not so bad with this shaver. My personal preference is to go with a wet shave and shaving cream along with the 9721 but if I&#x27;m in a hurry it&#x27;s nice to know that I can dry shave without having skin irritation or red-face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the same shave cream that I use with my Merkur safety razor with the 9721, a brand called Prorasso, with excellent results. The 9721 can go in the shower and that&#x27;s where I typically shave so it&#x27;s a very convenient feature. Wet shaving with the 9721 in my opinion is superior to a dry shave in terms of closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;SMARTCLEAN SYSTEM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other major component with the 9721 is of course the included cleaning system. This is in simple terms a separate cradle that the 9721 electric razor pairs with to both charge and clean the razor. The cleaning is automated and is a more thorough cleaning than rinsing the razor heads under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included cleaning cartridge holds the cleaning solution and slides into the base of the SmartClean device. The 9721 shaver fits into the SmartClean and uses the same AC adapter that will plug directly into the SmartClean. The single AC adapter powers the SmartClean and charges the 9721 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SmartClean operates in two phases - a cleaning cycle that takes about 10 minutes to complete and a drying cycle that takes about 4 hours to complete. The SmartClean will display a &#x27;ready&#x27; light indicator once cleaning and drying is complete and once the razor is fully charged and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my first week of using the 9721 I&#x27;ve carved out a schedule of daily rinsing the razor and then using the SmartClean for a more thorough wash once a week. This seems to strike a good balance between convenience and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;CONSUMABLES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two major components that will have to be replaced with the 9721 and here they are with current prices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SH90 Shaving Unit - replace yearly / Currently $46 on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* JC302 Cleaning Cartridge - replace every three months / Seemingly not available on Amazon as of this review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;WHAT PHILIPS NORELCO GOT RIGHT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) The shave.

            <li> My husband&#x27;s first shave with this was on a day where he had a pretty decent beard - it had been at least 4 days since his last shave.  He charged it fully and then set to work - and even though there was a LOT of shaving to do - he ended up with a very close, smooth shave and the shaver still had 83% percent power.  The shaver was quiet, very light to hold and very flexible - able to maneuver in and out of crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He used it today (2 days later) and it was still at 71% after being off the charger. The shave was very smooth again, and after accidentally cumping the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; button - he found out it works even better at a faster speed.  (Although that did tell me that the speed buttons are easy to bump.)  He also tried out the trimmer - and it worked very well on his sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an observer (and a wife) I am not thrilled with the size of the cleaning base.  I think it&#x27;s really big - providing even more clutter on our bathroom counter.  He didn&#x27;t even notices the size - being so thrilled with the self-cleaning aspect of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far - this shaver is a huge hit.  Given the price - it should perform as well as it does - but so far - I&#x27;ve heard nothing but raves.  Quiet, efficient, fast, sell-cleaning?  It meets all needs!</li>
            <li> You definitely get a really great shaver with this one, which should be expected with the price of it. It really is quite a snazzy shaver with lots of nice features to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charges quickly so it doesn&#x27;t take long before it&#x27;s ready to be used. You also don&#x27;t have to charge it very often as it&#x27;s been used a few of times but we haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it yet. This shaver gives a pretty smooth  and close shave and there hasn&#x27;t been any irritation while using it. It&#x27;s really quiet while it runs, which is good just in case you need to shave while your spouse is still sleeping. There are three speeds available and the shaver is easy to hold. You can use this on wet and dry skin and clean up is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There haven&#x27;t been any complaints so far and I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> 30 Day UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one exception I have used this razor every day for over thirty days. To put in another words, for the first time in over fifty years, I have not used a blade and shaving gel. The quality of the shave is virtually the same. This is the best electric razor I have ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor Kiam, who later owned the New England Patriots became famous as a CEO pitchman with a series of commercials about an electric razor whose tagline was \\&quot;It shaved so good, I bought the company.\\&quot; And he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had Victor tried this Phillips Norelco electric razor he would have had to spend a lot more than he did for Remington, but it would have been worth it. I have been shaving daily in excess of fifty years, mostly with blades and shaving gel. I have a couple of electric razors, both gifts. I keep on in my car ( a battery powered Remington actually) to touch up if I have a late court hearing. The other I sometimes use of the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular electric razor is almost as good as a bladed one. It incorporates the principles of the original dual bladed razor, the Trac II, by using one blade to pull on the whisker and the other to snip it off. The follicle then retreats below the skin line for a close and smooth shave.  I see very little difference in the quality of shaves. The razor is cordless and can be used wet or dry, with or without shaving gel. It has three speeds (why?) and three rotating heads. I have used it in the shower when my beard is the softest but without gel. It not only shaves closely; it is extremely comfortable. It has a battery meter and it appears that each shave confuses about 2-3 % of batter life. The recharging station doubles as a cleaning device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a cleaning system which comes with the razor. This seems like a good idea and a means of insuring continued quality shaves. The rotating heads require yearly replacement, assuming normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed. If you are looking for a high-end electric razor which really will shave as close as a blade, this is your \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; device.very impressed. If you are looking for a high-end electric razor which really will shave as close as a blade, this is your \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; device.</li>
            <li> Every couple of years I get a new electric razor, either as a gift or a splurge after I get tired of using a cartridge razor. I end up using it for a couple of weeks, then putting it aside and going back to my old razor. They&#x27;re never as convenient nor offer as close of a shave as I expect. I had unusually high hopes for this Philips Norelco shaver from the start. Out of the box, it&#x27;s a very impressive device. It feels solid, buttons are responsive, and the display is nice and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver offers three speeds to choose from. The first day I selected &#x27;low&#x27; and although it did a pretty good job, it seemed to take way too long, requiring many slow passes. The second day I started with &#x27;medium&#x27; and found it worked much better, but still not quite good enough, so halfway through I switched to &#x27;high&#x27;. Even on high, the shaver is incredibly quiet. With his setting, I found the shaver to be at its best, doing a lot of cutting with a single pass. At this point I was already convince that this was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the following few days trying out different techniques before fully getting use to it. I found a couple of areas the shaver wasn&#x27;t getting as good, but learned how to improve the performance. At one point I used shaving gel and found it glided across my skin better, however the extra time it takes to apply the gel is part of what I&#x27;d like to avoid by switching to an electric razor, so I went back to dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it took some time, but I&#x27;m extremely happy with this Norelco shaver. It&#x27;s not as close as a manual razor, but I&#x27;m extremely surprise and impressed by how close it really is. It takes about three or four passes to get a smooth shave, which is not quite as quick as my last electric shaver, however it&#x27;s so much smoother that it simply doesn&#x27;t compare. I&#x27;ve had no irritation whatsoever, unlike with a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big feature of this shaver is the &#x27;docking station&#x27; that charges, cleans, and lubricates the unit. The one time I used a shaving gel I found that it didn&#x27;t clean quite as well, despite having rinsed it beforehand, however it works perfectly otherwise. Cartridges with cleaning solution are required and are expected to last three months of daily use. Replacements are, as of this review, not available on Amazon.com, but are available through Philips&#x27; website for $12 a pair with free shipping, which I find extremely reasonable. I can&#x27;t say for sure yet whether these cartridges really do last three months of daily use though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the shaver pops off easily and can be replaced with the included trimmer. The trimmer isn&#x27;t quite the best I&#x27;ve used, but it does work well enough and its convenience can&#x27;t be beat. My only complaint about the entire shaver is a lack of a storage spot for the trimmer on the cleaning/charging station itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery power is fantastic... fully charges in an hour and while I keep the shaver in the cleaning station to charge between uses, I&#x27;ve never seen the display indicate less then 97% charged. This should easily last a week off the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this shaver. It&#x27;s met or surpassed all my expectations.

            <li> Very interesting item that will make the man of the house feel just like he is very special.  The Norelco people have made this item special in every way.  Years ago when I was in the Navy one of the shipmates had an electric razor and I can recall being envious of his being able to keep clean shaven without leaving the locker room.  He had a mirror inside of his locker and would shave, get dressed and be off to muster long before the rest of us finished getting ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Norelco has added some unusual tricks to that old classic.  You can shave wet or dry!  Use shaving cream, get a really smooth shave, and clean up that razor in a jiffy with the special cleaning device that comes with the outfit.  You put the box on your counter and plug it in.  Then after you are done shaving, you take the razor head off...wash it under hot water (careful not to scald yourself)...then put the shaving head back onto the body of the razor and place it into the special holder.  Push down a connection with a click...and forget about it until tomorrow.  It automatically cleans with a solution, drys the head, and charges the battery to full strength!  That is convenience to the ultimo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you read the provided booklet there are a couple of things to be careful of.  First of all, in the one that I received the website is improperly cited.  However, to correct this, you put in the reference backwards \\&quot;support/norelco.com\\&quot; and this will take you to the correct page.  Also, for some reason their main site is wrong as well.  They are in the process of correcting this and it should be done by the time this comes out on the market.  I will update this paragraph when they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all things, there are a few items which should be addressed.  First of all, it is expensive to replace the head of the razor, $64.50 and they recommend doing this every year.  If that is the case, then you have the gift you can keep on giving year after year.  Secondly, the liquid in the special device for cleaning needs to be replaced every three (3) months.  You can buy this in specially devised containers at the major stores in your neighborhood, price is $24.50 for 3 of them.  The third thing is that the booklet tells you how to remove and properly dispose of the lithium battery.  Sad thing is that there are no instructions on to put a new battery in or the size that you should get.  When talking with customer service they said that you should dispose of the razor!  That made no sense at all since I have had my old Norelco for 30 years and it still keeps on going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver is on the high side, even at Amazon.  If you have the funds, the man in your life will really enjoy this high end razor.  It is not as expensive as a Alpha Romero (retail $845,000), but it is up there for a razor!y, the liquid in the special device for cleaning needs to be replaced every three (3) months.

            <li> I have predominantly preferred electric shavers over razors for the last 15 or more years. I&#x27;ve gone through at least four units (maybe more...I&#x27;ve lost track) prior to receiving this one for testing. Starting with cheap, low-end Braun or Wahl foil shavers, with the vibrating cutter heads, more recently I &amp;#34;jumped up&amp;#34; in the quality and price range of shavers, by purchasing the Philips Norelco 8175 Speed XL. This has by far been my favorite, most reliable, and longest lasting shaver till now. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how long I&#x27;ve had it, but at least 3-5 years and it still performs excellently. So this is my basis for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9700 model boasts that it cuts 20% more hair in a single pass, making for a faster, clean shave. In my testing, I find this believable, and found this new unit leaves me clean shaven a minute or two faster than my older shaver. This seems largely due to the new V-shaped cutting blades, compared to the old straight blades. To my surprise, the old 8175XL has three rings of blades, while the 9700 has only two rings--the outer being the wider V-shaped blades, and the inner the straight blades. At first glance it appeared that the new model shaver had a larger surface area for cutting, but this was not so. The cutting heads on the 9700 are more flexible and exposed than the older model, and glide even more easily across the contours of your neck. It left a satisfying, quick, clean shave, with little to no shaver irritation. Though I was very satisfied with my old model, this is definitely an improvement, and if experience is any indicator, Philips makes dependable, long-lasting products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is new? A little three bar indicator on your digital display indicates how strong your WIFI signal is.  Just kidding. A new feature is the adjustable speed (3 settings). I thought at first this would be an even higher speed than the old model, but it seems the top speed is the same as the old one. I don&#x27;t know that I will find two slower settings to be useful since I don&#x27;t want to stretch out my shaving time any longer, and my skin is so insensitive :)  But regardless, you can get the performance you want, and adjust slower if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is obviously one of the biggest reasons for the significant markup in price. Cleaning my old model was definitely the most hassle, beyond the daily shaking out of stubble and rinse under the faucet. The best I could come up with for deep cleaning my old cutter heads and foils was to detach the head and separate all the pieces and repeatedly pour boiling water over them and soak them. The new cleaning system rinses your shaver in the upside down position in a special cleaning solution that seems very effective at removing the &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; from your shaver. It seems that it pulses the shaver on and off to spin and rinse in the solution that floods the shallow well where you place the shaver. This lasts 10 minutes, before a 4 hour drying cycle begins, and during the full time your shaver is also being charged. Since my old shaver wouldn&#x27;t fit in the cleaning system, I nevertheless disassembled my old shaving head and just put the cutters in there to see how well it removed older, heavier accumulation. The cleaning solution does seem to be more effective than boiling water, though it would probably take a few runs through the system to get them clean as new. The sediment from the stubble and cleaning ends up in the bottom of the cleaning cartridge which also holds the solution. There are three holes in the top, and there seems to be 2 or possibly 3 separate compartments, but they are all full of the cleaning solution, so it does not appear that the dirty solution is separated by anything besides sedimentation? Perhaps a sales rep can answer that question. The cartridges sell on Philips&#x27; website for $17 for a 3 pack, with free shipping, and they recommend replacement every three months. I think a faucet rinse after separating the top portion of the shaver should be adequate for daily cleaning, and the more open design of the shaving heads seems to leave fewer &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; for shaving accumulation to dirty up your shaver. While the cleaning station is a nuisance to store in a crowded bathroom, and could be costly to maintain, depending on how often you use it--it definitely gives a nice cleaning and refreshing to your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I love the fast, clean, non-irritating shave, and am impressed by the improvements over the 8000 series. I trust the reliability and durability of Philips Norelco shavers, and expect the same from this one. It&#x27;s backed by a 2 year warranty, which shows they are equally confident of their product.e after separating the top portion of the shaver should be adequate for daily cleaning, and the more open design of the shaving heads seems to leave fewer &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34; for shaving accumulation to dirty up your shaver.

            <li> Outstanding electric shaver</li>
            <li> Good shaver, but the one step down S9300 version is about $100.00 less for the same shaver, and same shave minus a couple of doodads.  Shaves are good, but not as close as a blade, a tad better than the series 7 braun which for me the neck is a bare, but lots of money now for a shave and one has to think of the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Those that are thinking of this razor better think twice now.  The head unit is made of cheap material, not as good as the #12 heads of the previous system and boy do they cost a whole bunch.  Look at the reviews of the razor heads first before anyone buys....</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco triple head shavers ever since I started shaving and they have been perfect.  The last one I had was one of the cord/cordless models and I have had that one for almost 30 years.  This one should last the rest of my life... I love the automatic cleaning system on this one.</li>
            <li> I am a longtime Braun user and switched to Norelco because this shaver was supposed to provide a similar shave in much less time. That was true for about the first month. After that, the quality of the shaves went downhill. The cleaning station began leaving a residue on the shaver. The shaver would shave one small part of my face really well, but make the rest too sticky to be shaved because of the cleaning gel that remained on the head after cleaning. After this continued to be a problem for a few weeks, I stopped using the cleaning system. However, the shaver still performs poorly because the residue from the faulty cleaning system will not wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips Norelco about the issue. They agreed to replace the defective cleaning station, but would not replace the cutting blades. This is a hardline policy, apparently. In normal circumstances I would agree with it, but the root cause of the blades no longer working is THEIR OWN CLEANING SYSTEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is only three months old, but it has to be within 45 days to get a full replacement. So, I am stuck with a $300 shaver that performs very poorly. I am once again using my five-year-old Braun shaver and getting a far superior shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with the shaver and very disappointed with Philips Norelco. I have previously been very happy with their products, but this experience has me made reluctant to purchase from the company in the future. I will not be purchasing a Norelco shaver again and recommend that you do not purchase this shaver unless you get a separate warranty from a store that provides a full exchange for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Great purchase and Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> The closest shave that I have got with a electric shaver, and I have been using electric shavers for 45 yrs. I replaced a Philips Norelco sensor touch 3D.with the 9700.</li>
            <li> have been a Norelco user for over 40 years, average life for past razors about 15 years. So far this one is the closest shaving one I have had and no razor burn doing it.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to need to be cleaned often in its base unit to keep the shaves clean, the older razors I had the head popped open and I could empty the whiskers easily before needing to rinse, the heads on this unit do not come apart easily and the trimmer head is a separate head, I wish it was built in like the older models.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price I am glad I bought this razor and hope to get another 15 years out of it.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun electric shaver user for many years. I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied with the Braun as I feel the shave isn&#x27;t quite close enough. By midday it always looks like I need to shave again. So I was very interested in trying out the best of the Norelco rotary shavers. The unit charges quickly and provides a glowing LCD panel which displays the remaining percentage of charge. The panel turns on automatically when the shaver is moved. After a few weeks of use, the shaver still has about 65% of its original charge left, so clearly taking it on a business trip for a week or two wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works well and has three operational speeds which can be chosen depending upon your preference. I found the slowest speed to result in the closest shave. The only difficulty I encountered is that the rotary blades don&#x27;t quite reach the area of my top lip just underneath my nose. My Braun reaches that area without having to switch to the clipper. On the Norelco, I need the clipper, and the Norelco doesn&#x27;t have a built-in clipper. Instead, there is a separate attachment providing clipping. This is OK, but if you&#x27;ve gone on a trip and forgot the attachment, you&#x27;ll be out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can be cleaned with water, an improvement over the Braun, so you&#x27;ll likely find that you don&#x27;t need to use the full cleaning cycle particularly frequently. Still, the cleaning fluid and associated stand provides a nice way to thoroughly clean the shaver every few weeks, which is sufficient if you&#x27;ve been good about washing it out each day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a rugged traveling case. And while I like the Norelco&#x27;s design for home use, the Braun is a bit more compact for traveling purposes. I&#x27;ve found myself using the Norelco at home and taking the Braun on the road. The Norelco has caused no hair pulls, no cuts, and no difficulties. It works well and has no design flaws that I&#x27;ve come across in several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Pricey. The old Philips shavers are much better. Technology is nice but it is not an answer for a shaver that has to shave smooth and deep. I am disappointed and I put the machine aside using my old shaver that still do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I bought 3. My two sons and husband.  So far they like them.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Nothing i do not like about it.</li>
            <li> This $350 razor only lasts 60 days and Norelco does not stand behind their products!!! Buyer beware!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor 60 days ago and the cleaning system left gunk on the razor heads that hardened and prevents the heads from pivoting making it impossible to get a close shave now (since they are stuck in a weird position). I contacted Philips Norelco, and apparently there are known issues with the cleaning system so they offered to send me a new cleaning system for free. Unfortunately, the heads are already ruined and it is harder than it sounds to clean cheap plastic moving parts without snapping it in half. At Norelco customer service&#x27;s request, I tried scrubbing with the brush that comes with Norelco razors, running under hot water and scrubbing, and soaking in boiling hot water until the water cooled - with the razors and foils removed). Nothing helped. They said my only option was to purchase $60 razor heads again after only two months of use from a $350 razor that was supposed to last a year; even though the reason the heads were damaged was clearly Norelco&#x27;s fault (due to a faulty cleaning system). I asked if I could get store credit to purchase new razor heads in lieu of a new cleaning system (which I&#x27;m not going to use anyway now that I know it could ruin the razor heads again costing me another $60 each time). They said that unfortunately their computer system doesn&#x27;t work that way. I have to pay up if I want to keep using my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for 17 years (ever since I started shaving), buying the latest one that comes out each time, and have been pretty satisfied until now. Compared to the previous Arcitec Norelco razor, this premium line product is less well designed than their older mid-level to low-end line. Unfortunately, this one&#x27;s just not worth the money, apparently may not last, and Norelco no longer stands behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have to spend a good chunk of cash anyway to start shaving again, I&#x27;m going to give the Braun 7 series a try instead.shaving again, I&#x27;m going to give the Braun 7 series a try instead.</li>
            <li> Beware of fake reviews written by some Norelco Philips promoters and some vendors , I&#x27;m using Philips Norelco since 10 years ago and my old Norlco 1280 was like a dream ,but the head razor got worn and new replacement was so pricey.Finally I decided to buy this new Philips Norelco s9721 I was shocked when I opened the box the new model razors head was completely made from cheaply made plastic and the cleaning was another nightmare , unlike Braun series 7  the cleaning system for this shaver is not sanitizing the razors because its water based solution it just clean and lubricate it only  , I didn&#x27;t like this point with the cleaning system due the lack hygienic for the shaver , The shaver dose not  deliver close shave but honestly after use it as wet shaving method  with gel it gives close shave but hold on !!you have to give an extra time and mess at sink and have to clean it up under running water for several times at least every 3- 4 strokes , I personally didn&#x27;t satisfy with this shaver and I after going underwhelming I decided to give a try for Panasonic ES-LV81-K  and I was pleased and  happy with it  , Panasonic delivered the most close shave I have ever experienced with any other shaver on my entire  life , no irritation no mess and  no time wast again in less then 3 minutes I am ready to go with very smooth close shave  ,, for someone still interested with Philips Norelco Good luck ,,</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for nearly 60 years. All but two were Norelco. My first razor was a Braun. Electric razors were not yet big in the US but my dad got me this foil Braun that was corded and needed a US adapter to work. I still have it. Then maybe 8-10 Norelco&#x27;s. Always the top of the line. First were two ring, then three blades emerged. I never knew any other shavers, but I seemed to get a very nice shave. About 4-6 years ago the new Norelco was called ?Articect. It got a ton of poor reviews so I got the top of the line Braun at the time (series7). I really liked it and thought it was a closer shave. About 18 months into it, I realized I hated shaving. I can&#x27;t say what, but I quit on it and went to the Norelco Sensotouch and got the jetcleaner as well. It was definitely the closest shave I ever had and felt smooth most of the day. Recently the jetcleaner started to leak and the battery counter has become erratic. The razor worked but I started reading about the advances the new one has so........... It was for sale on Amazon for $239, Best Buy matched, so I went that way as I might have wanted to return, if necessary, to brick and mortar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this new one. It is lighter than the Sensotouch and clearly cheaper looking and feeling. The box and instruction and razor have lots of  little cartoon pictures and I could not figure out what any of them meant. After playing around I figured them out, but they just get in the way especially if you leave one on by mistake. The cleaning system is the same but new. You need to buy cartridges. (But if you read carefully one comes with it and you can get three more for $8.01 delivered on their site. My Braun had these cartridges. It&#x27;s ok./ However the controls and readout on the jetclean are spread out, illogical, unclear, very hard to see(remember I&#x27;m in my late 70&#x27;s) and make using it harder than it needed. I actually ended up cleaning my1 hr. old razor trying to check out the buttons which are very faint. It cleans fine though.  It is much more complicated to put the razor in it, and better suited for an engineer. No longer a choice as to what kind of wash. Booklet says wash every day and cartridges last three months. I intend to do it every Sunday and hand wash on Thursday as I have done for quite a while. The carrying case is a harder version of my last one, BUT there is no plastic cover to put on as in last model. NOTE: I just figured out our bathroom has fluorescent bulbs. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t read the cleaner info. With less bright lights it is readable. That would be a big help. We are moving and the new bathroom has softer lights I think. Keep it in mind if you are compulsive like me. It&#x27;s unreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor: You can plug it in directly. Yeah! The old one only traveled for 10-14 days. This one if you take a cord can be recharged. Strangely as others have noted, the case won&#x27;t accommodate the cord. My last case does for these, but it is soft so the lack of a blade cover makes me not want to do that. They give you a tool you must keep track of to take off the 3 blade cases. A total pain and I think the manual says the razor may not work right for a week or two if you do this. Another minor thing: The razor goes in the cleaner-charger facing backwards so you can&#x27;t tell the charge status. I at least can&#x27;t see the faint symbols on the SIDE of the cleaning well so I leave it in all night. This razor is only about half the weight of the last. It&#x27;s too light. Cheaper plastic and a smaller battery are likely causes. I do not know facts about the battery, but full charge gets only about half the minutes of the Sensotouch. The buttons feel flimsy but I think will still last. The head comes off much easier than last time, and since you need the feature for beard trimming, it&#x27;s a worth while trade. Up until now, the Norelco trimmers were worthless. I bought a cheap beard trimmer years ago and it works fine. This trimmer, if you can find it in the drawer, works fine. I&#x27;m sticking with my old trimmer as I don&#x27;t like removing the head. It is hard for me to comment yet on the three speeds available. So far fastest is working great. The travel lock is a nice feature too. Twenty years ago I was out of the country and in changing planes my razor  at the time decided to turn on. Not a pretty scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have left the shave to last. This is totally subjective, so this part you take with a grain of salt. This is the CLOSEST AND QUICKEST SHAVE  I have ever had. My normal shave was about 5 minutes for the last few years. This razor is done in a little over two and a half minutes. It is quiet, and also my after shave stings LESS so it is probably cutting hair not skin. I don&#x27;t use pre-shave gels as they made my previous razor gummed up. If you like gels, I would wash after each shave, My face feels completely smooth. My previos razor left a spot under my chin. This razor leaves no patches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Best shave possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: $239 is a lot. Do not pay $349 that&#x27;s silly&lt;br /&gt;  No visible way to know the charging or cleaning status, if you have nice lighting&lt;br /&gt;  Looks and feels cheaper than any previous Norelco shaver. If it holds up, it&#x27;s better than sliced bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result:  If $240 is affordable, BUY this razor, otherwise buy lower in the line (still on sale)ne.

            <li> Good Shaver.  Close smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> This is the latest in a long chain of electric razors I&#x27;ve used for years. My last was a Braun, and I replaced it because it was performing progressively poorer as time went on, even after I replaced the blades. This Norelco S9784 provides a shave that truly is as close as a blade, The cleaning system&#x27;s fluid is based on some soap-type substance rather than alcohol, and I think works a lot better. It doesn&#x27;t disinfect, though, so if you&#x27;re concerned about that you might want to rinse it with isopropyl occasionally. The cleaning cycle is also significantly more thorough than my Braun was. I also have very sensitive skin and this does a good job, and it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, even after a couple days of not shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for his birthday.. He is like a kid with a new toy. He is retired and every once in a while I will glance over at him in his recliner and there he is using his new shaver...Then he comes over to me and says&amp;#34; See how smooth my face feels?&amp;#34;. He is so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After using the Phillips for a few weeks, I sent it back.  I thought originally since the hair on your face grows in all directions that moving in a circular motion would have the best benefits, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provide an OK shave, but not near as close as the Braun 7 Series.</li>
            <li> Finally my face has stopped burning from razors, and my skin is clean and clear as this does not scrape your skin or very slightly if you press it hard on your skin. I clean the shaver every 4th or 5th use, although it says do it every time. No need.. I just take the razor top off and rinse that assembly from inside. no need to take the whole head off. This is well built and works like 1000 dollars.</li>
            <li> I may not have bought even though I was interested. I thought it was a bit expensive. However, at Christmas time, I for a few Amazon gift certifiates and decided the time was right. I am completely happy with this shaver. It does a fantastic job. There has not been any skin irritation either. I read others reviews before the purchased and they helped. The only one I dismissed as either a joke or idiocy was by guy who claimed he could not get the shaver off the charging base. That was as simple as you could ever hope. I immediately started it at the fastest speed thinking I would decrease as ncessary. But I have left it at that setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few razors over the years.  I shave my head, so my needs are more than just \\&quot;does well on the neck and jawline.\\&quot;  I had use a couple Braun models but never really thought they were that well done.  I fell in love with Panasonic razors back in 2011 when I got an ES8249S.  It did a fantastic job on my head, better than any other razor I had tried.  It lasted about 2 years before the cleaning system died, so I took that as a sign to upgrade.  That was when I tried my first triple headed Philips, the Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D.  And it was actually a nice razor, but it just didn&#x27;t do a great job, especially on my head.  It seemed the triple heads were better designed for concave surfaces like you&#x27;d get on the face or neck, but it didn&#x27;t do so great on the convex surface of my skull, so I returned it and went back to a Panasonic.  I currently use a Panasonic ES-LA93K which I reviewed here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s been my favorite razor ever.  There&#x27;s nothing it&#x27;s been unable to do, it&#x27;s been irritation free, and is a quick razor that&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love cleaning systems, but I don&#x27;t use them often.  I always clean my razors manually after a shave, then leave them to dry.  The actual cleaning system I only use every 3 to 4 weeks when I have to charge it.  I like the convenience, and the lubrication that they get from the cleaning solution.  It just seems that it keeps my razors and the blades working better, longer.  And oddly enough, the Philips website for this razor has videos, and one of them has the speaker specifically mentioning how to clean by hand, since you can do that all the time, and maybe once every 3 to 4 weeks run it through the cleaning system.  It was nice to see a company not try to get you to use it more often so they can make more money on the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this one came up in the Vine program, I jumped on it.  I&#x27;m always looking for something better.  And with each new generation of electric razors, there&#x27;s usually some improvement with some facet of it.  So while an earlier generation of this type of Razor didn&#x27;t work out for me, I wanted to see if this one would.  With the professed greater travel and angles of this I hoped it would be more effective, since I really liked the 3 head design they&#x27;ve had for a while and the one I ended up returning&lt;br /&gt;was a pleasure to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a 9% charge in it.  I plugged it in so it could charge, and began doing some box teardown for my recycle can.  When&lt;br /&gt;I peeked about 6 or 8 minutes later it was almost up to 30%, so it certainly seems to charge quickly.  It also uses the same plug as my other hair care Philips products - the balder, and one of the vacuum trimmers I have that I use for my beard.  And like them, it&#x27;s also a 15v output.  It&#x27;s nice when things keep using the same power plugs, since that makes it easier to keep my bathroom neat.  Extras get shoved somewhere I don&#x27;t come across them unless I have to, and there&#x27;s just one cord then I can use for charging them all as needed one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside of 40 minutes I was up over 70% and under an hour to hit 100%.  The display goes dark after a timeout during charging, but&lt;br /&gt;apparently there&#x27;s some sensor since when I picked it up to look, it turned the display on for me to see the battery level.  So I didn&#x27;t need to turn it on, or unplug/replug to see how far along the charge was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cleaning system&#x27;s look.  I have used several Panasonic models, and the cleaning cartridges slid in from the front on one leaving it visible, and slides into the rear on the other which you can still see because of how I have it positioned in the corner of my countertop by the wall to wall mirror behind the sinks.  And there&#x27;s a water reservoir you have to fill on the Panasonic units that adds bulk to the back.  This one has a release button on the side, and the entire bottom drops down, and that&#x27;s where the cartridge slides.  Then you shove it back up to close it.  Nothing breaking the clean lines of the unit on the outside.  And since the liquid is part of the cartridge, there&#x27;s no water reservoir to have to fill and clean out sometimes.  This one also fit much better in the corner behind the sink.  The Panasonic has to sit facing directly to the right otherwise it won&#x27;t sit flat.  This one fits and can be pivoted to face any direction in less area than the Panasonic takes up.  I like that the cleaner actually displays how far into each stage it is - not just one light for cleaning, one for drying, and one for charging.  This shows LED dashes between them so you can see that it&#x27;s 2/3 of the way finished cleaning, or 1/2 of the way into the drying stage.  Granted, I don&#x27;t put my razors into the cleaning stations and run a cleaning cycle when I know I&#x27;m going to have to use it in 20 minutes or something, so it&#x27;s a bit superflous.  But by the same token, I like it anyway since it gives it a bit more functionality than the other cleaning systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to shave half my head with this, and the other half with my Panasonic I&#x27;ve been using for the last year or so.  I set this to the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting for speed.  Much like the one I tried a year ago, I was amazed at the low sound levels this puts out.  You can easily shave at night and someone even in the bedroom connected to the bathroom wouldn&#x27;t hear it if the door were closed.  It&#x27;s that quiet.  My Panasonic is not loud, but it&#x27;s a higher, more persistent pitch that does penetrate walls and doors better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco seemed to have a tougher time shaving my head.  Oddly enough, unlike the previous generation that I had tried and returned, this actually did well on the curved parts of my skull.  The angles seem to be a little better on this one for the convex curves on the skull.  Yet for some reason, it had a bear of a time doing the flat part of my head above my ear, the entire side just didn&#x27;t seem to want to shave well.  It took me 8 or 10 passes to get it to feel smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare that to my Panasonic, which shaved the other half of my head in about 1/3 of the time it took this, and did it smoother to boot.  So my results are very similar to the comparison when I purchased the previous model of this Philips razor and ended up&lt;br /&gt;returning it and getting the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, just shaving the one side of my head to a less than smooth result took 9 percent of the charge.  So to be fair I figured I should test it on my face, since that&#x27;s where probably 95% or more people will be using this razor.  So I shaved the same half of my face with this, the other half with my existing razor.  And for me, it pretty much was a repeat.  The side I shaved with this just did not feel as good as the side I shaved with my Panasonic, and it took over twice as long to do the same amount of shaving.  I even went over the rough spots several times, just to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is depressing, since I *really* like the technology of this razor and the cleaning station.  And this one is just so much more comfortable to hold.  And if I had gone from one of my razors three or four years ago to this, I would&#x27;ve been impressed.  But the razor I purchased a year ago for $100 less still outperforms this by a huge margin, so for this price, I just can&#x27;t see the value.  And I know that the manufacturers claim that it takes a while to \\&quot;train\\&quot; your skin for a new razor, so I&#x27;m going to keep using this and see if anything changes, but the other one had no difference over time, so I&#x27;m not anticipating this one will, but if it does I&#x27;ll update the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - A month and a half later, I&#x27;ve used this razor exclusively, and have had nothing but bad experiences.  I just used my Panasonic for the first time and what has been taking 15 minutes to do poorly just now took three minutes to do smooth.  I&#x27;ve given my skin time to adjust to this razor, and it&#x27;s just not effective at all.  I love the design of it, the feel, the motion sensor that shows you the battery life as soon as you pick it up, and how quiet it is.  But it&#x27;s just such a poor replacement for a decent Panasonic, doesn&#x27;t shave as smooth and takes a LOT longer to get those lackluster results.  I&#x27;m sticking with the Panasonic and I&#x27;m glad my testing period is finally over, because it was taking so much longer to shave...</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco razor a long time ago and was curious to see how they have improved.  They are signficantly improved and delvier a close and consistent shave.  The re-designed the shaving head which makes it much more flexible, easier to manuever around your face and providing a smoother cut.  The variable razor speeds deliver different types of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor charges quickly and holds a charge effectively.  The cleaning systems that comes with the razor is innovative but it takes up considerable space in the bathroom.  Those with limited space on their sink or vanity should recognize that the real estate.  This is one reason for a four star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver delivers a high quality shave, particulalry good for an electric razor.  It is comparable to shaving with a blade.  I found the best results shaving with my face dry before getting into the shower as that provides an even shave as I missed less spots than using a disposable razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those looking to upgade their electric shave.  Blade shavers may want to consider this option as well particularly if they frequently miss parts of their shave.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the product listing for the Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver I wondered what could possibly be so much better in this shaver that made it 3 or 4 times more expensive than other good quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned (including others from Norelco). The answer is that after a month of daily use, I still can&#x27;t tell you what, but there is no doubt about it....this is an amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the kind of face that&#x27;s pretty sensitive to both foil and rotary shavers. For me there is a fine line between a close shave and the feeling that I&#x27;ve just run the fine side of a box grater over my neck. The Philips Norelco S9721/84, 9700 Shaver provides a truly close shave, while leaving all the skin where it should be. In fact I didn&#x27;t notice any irritation at all and for me that&#x27;s the exception, not the rule, for electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is lighter, quieter and more responsive than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have owned and used a number of pivoting head razors in the past. They all worked reasonably well following the contours of my face, but there&#x27;s something about this shaver that sets it apart. I have a pretty square jaw and a fairly sharp chin. these cutting heads pivot effortlessly and manage to maintain their cutting contact at every angle, which much less pulling and chafing. Whether my beard is coarse and dense (after a weekend at the lake), or short and stubbly, it just takes a few quick passes to get the close smooth feel I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that had three speed settings. In comparing the 3 I found that the slow setting was much easier on my skin while I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference in the cutting efficiency. I really like the user interface on the shaver. knowing exactly how much charge you have left on board is very helpful. The charging system and lithium ion battery supply all the shave time I need with plenty to spare. I like the constant cleaning system. It keeps the blades free of debris and skin oils. We&#x27;ll see if I still like it after I have to pay up to replace the fluid in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9700 is designed for use wet or dry. While I can&#x27;t imagine taking an electric shaver into the shower, this one lets you do it. My only problem with this review is that I really can&#x27;t find anything negative to say about this shaver. If the price point is something you can handle, I really don&#x27;t think you are going to find another shaving system that will outperform this one.t keeps the blades free of debris and skin oils.

            <li> This shaver is a considerable improvement over the Norelco 1290/8800 series with one exception. With the 1290 you can wash the blades and leave the shaver open in its stand. The 9700, unless you put it in the jet cleaning system, cannot stand. However, you can charge it separately by a direct connection. With the 1290/8800 you had to take the stand with you when you trqvel if you think you will need to charge the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The 9700 shaves much faster than the 1290, usually requiring only one repeat over the same area. This is not true of the neck which requires considerable repetition, causing some irritation. Within 2 hours the area under the nose and the jawline appear to need another shave.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with the Braun Series 7 790cc or the new 799cc there is a substantial difference. Shave the face with the 9700 after you have shaved with the Braun and you will see minimal collection. Do the reverse the Braun on the first day will show straight hairs about 1/8th of an inch. On the second day the  shaving will produce hairs in a powder form. With either Norelco I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 1:00 P.M. The Braun does not show such a need until dinner time. In addition, the Braun cleaner is faster and more hygienic than the Norelco. The Braun, like the 9700, can be charged directly without a stand.</li>
            <li> best for sharp looking face, I do not recommend for round shaped faces</li>
            <li> This Norelco 9700 shaver is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It cuts just about as close as a blade. It&#x27;s noise level is lower than other electric razors. The only caveat is when you go to use the automatic cleaner, it also charges the razor every time. So the way I see it using the auto clean system is a good way to abuse and prematurely wear out the battery. That is why I usually rinse mine under hot water. Then when I have only have 10-15% power left I&#x27;ll use the auto clean function. Also by doing that makes the cleaner cartridge last quite a while. Even with the one caveat, I am still singing praises of this razor. It is by far the best one I have ever had. And I have had at least 10 Norelco and Braun electric razors in my lifetime. I think you&#x27;ll be very happy with this razor!</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver -- I have never been able to use Norelco before as it always caught my hairs wrong.  Perhaps I just never got those circular motions right compared to the straight motions for shavers without rotating heads.  But this one works great, and the cleaner is awesome -- I couldn&#x27;t believe how much was in there when I changed it out after about 6 weeks.  Only bit of warning would be not to use on more than a few days growth -- shaver every day or two -- as it will pull at that point.  This is the first shaver I have had that actually does a great job on my neck and on all of the curves of my face.  This was a great buy -- expensive, but well worth it in my experience.</li>
            <li> At first was seems kind of uncomfortable on my face but after 3 times shave, i must say still my first choice in any brand for shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of Norelco electric razors over the years.  Prior to this model provided by the Vine, I was using an Arctec.  This model is much quieter, cuts closer and recharges much quicker.  Unlike my Arctec, the top blade assembly comes off on to facilitate cleaning.  Withe arctec and my prior Norelco&#x27;s, each blade would have to be open and then cleaned one by one.  This model also comes with a cleaning set up.  Kinda of weird since I never had razor that came with a cleaning unit...and this unit can also be used to recharge the razor.  You load up the razor in the unit, push the assembly into the cleaning solution, push the start and the cleaning unit does the rest.  The charge indicator is a very nice feature.  Unlike my arctec, you have a better feel for how much charge you have.  This unit is a little pricey.  I&#x27;ve never spent more than $150 for a unit, but I am very pleased that I had an opportunity to get this unit.  If this one has the same life expectancy as my other Norelco, this one should last many years.</li>
            <li> Best razor i have owned.</li>
            <li> Great product, but would be better if the trimmer was not a separate piece.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work any better than cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it. My husband wanted one with an indicator in front to tell you when the charge is full. Unfortunately, the old Norelco ones with that feature are no longer available in the market anywhere we looked. It&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s a gadget to clean it too.</li>
            <li> I have the following shavers:&lt;br /&gt;Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 Electric Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco has been quite a pain, literally!&lt;br /&gt;I usually let my beard grow 3-4 days between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco pulls at the stubble and hurts till it gets it under control.&lt;br /&gt;The motor seems under powered and not fast enough at the fastest setting.&lt;br /&gt;The low and medium speed setting is unusable for me.&lt;br /&gt;Neither the Braun or Panasonic has any difficulty with the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to shave near the bottom of my sideburns also yields hairs being pulled.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco has a cutter that you must remove the shaver head first and snap it on.&lt;br /&gt;Both the Braun and Panasonic have great built in cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco gets long hairs laying flat much better than the Braun and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;This is its one and only great advantage the Norelco has.&lt;br /&gt;It excels at getting those hairs just under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco also shaves closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system of the Norelco is flawed.&lt;br /&gt;It fails to rinse a lot of gunk out after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have been popping off the head and rinsing it after the cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning lights on the base are very dim.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun and Panasonic cleaning systems are far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great irritant of the Norelco is the position of the power button.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s right where my thumb rests during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I am still turning it off and pulling hairs during a shave.&lt;br /&gt;There is no lock except to keep it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally I will be shaving first with the Panasonic (my current favorite)&lt;br /&gt;then switching to the Norelco for finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya later guys...</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a Norelco electric razor for 50 years. This is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is the shaver I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I&#x27;ve never been able to shave very often due to sensitive skin - but with this shaver it&#x27;s no problem.  The shave is super close with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> It was better than expected.</li>
