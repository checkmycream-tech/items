            <li>This eyeliner is my favorite of all liners.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and no sharpening!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, and has yet to disappoint me.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the sharpener, so it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner, when they say its long wearing, they mean it.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner, when they say its long wearing, they mean it.</li>
            <li> cos its inexpensive, lasts long, has a small sharpener on the end of the pencil,very portable even in small clutches, the color lasts and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t go on black, and then it would fade after an hour or two, and then start to smudge a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using black eyeliner on my waterline for years and have used countless different types of eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I like this product and have tried other liners but always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> Also, with all that applying, the pencil twists back down.</li>
            <li> my go to daily black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Needs a couple of coats to get to deep black...</li>
            <li> It was in a grey tube with a black cap</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out that dark black.  </li>
            <li> The black is very dark and the lines are sharp.</li>
            <li> I use to use this everyday for school it was (still is)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Almay in the past....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I probably won&#x27;t buy anything from Almay anymore because this isn&#x27;t the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that I hated.</li>
            <li> It works well and just saved going to the store which is sometimes difficult for me.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this eyeliner.</li>

            <li> Great product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner, when they say its long wearing, they mean it. I can apply this before going out for the evening and it will last all night. Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, and has yet to disappoint me. Highly recommended.</li>

This one doesn&#x27;t really compare to some of the others I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t come out that dark black.  One of my favorites is Sephora&#x27;s Nano Eyeliner, which is what I should have bought in the first place.  Will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This works great for me.  It&#x27;s a rich black color and stays on like it&#x27;s suppose to.  It&#x27;s hard to find.  Get it while you can.</li>
            <li> I use to use this everyday for school it was (still is) my go to daily black eyeliner. I use to walk up two sets of stairs to get back and forth to my classes and this stuff was one of the only eyeliners I could find that wouldnt be all over my face at the end of the day when i got on the bus.. now i have two kids ages 2 and 6 months and at the end of the day it still hasnt gone anywhere!</li>
            <li> Had to buy online and this was a good price and came in on time. It works well and just saved going to the store which is sometimes difficult for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for 5+ years. It is by far my favorite. The black is very dark and the lines are sharp. I can do simple liner or cat&#x27;s eye. In stores this liner is around $8, so 2 eyeliners at this price is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I want to apply once and be done with it for the day.  I&#x27;ve used Almay in the past....It was in a grey tube with a black cap and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere! I am have been struggling with this particular brand to get it evenly covered on both eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a long-time favorite product that does a good job.  The color, Black 205, is perfect for me.  I have searched local stores but can never find it in stock any longer.  This comes in a 2-pack, which is an important consideration when pricing this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye liner for many years.  Maybe 10 or more years.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t rub off easily from just going on with your day.  It comes off easily with eye makeup remover though.  I&#x27;ve tried several other ones but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> I will only ever use this eyeliner...it is the best.. Stay on practically all day.. Even if i cry l</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and lasts all day long.  I don&#x27;t really use the sharpener, so it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is my favorite of all liners. It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear. It lasts all day.

            <li> This is my only eyeliner I use. Good in water or those teary days</li>

            <li> I was so disappointed with this eyeliner. It really didn&#x27;t go on black, and then it would fade after an hour or two, and then start to smudge a little. I won&#x27;t buy this again. In fact, I probably won&#x27;t buy anything from Almay anymore because this isn&#x27;t the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that I hated.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Goes on smooth and no sharpening!</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! Easy application, smooth, vibrant color, and retractable! Not to mention hypoallergenic, which both me and my best friend DIED over!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my sister loved it.</li>
            <li> Needs a couple of coats to get to deep black...</li>
            <li> excelent will always order everything from amazon EXCELENTTTTTTTT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply because you have to rub and rub it to get a good, dark line. My eyelids hurt after that! It looks perfectly nice once you can get a good coat on, and it lasts all day. I love the little sharpener, and it does apply better after you use the sharpener. But you&#x27;d have to use the sharpener every day, losing a lot of the product that way. Also, with all that applying, the pencil twists back down. So I&#x27;m constantly twisting it back up and trying to figure out how to keep it from twisting back in while I&#x27;m using it. I wont buy again.</li>
            <li> This is one of teh best eye liners I have used, and I can assure you I have used almost every eye liner in the market. So this is great cos its inexpensive, lasts long, has a small sharpener on the end of the pencil,very portable even in small clutches, the color lasts and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.</li>
