            <li>My wife and I used these and they worked just as good as the ones we received from the dentist that did the teeth whitening</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it is effective.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok ..</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Way more affordable</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>Great, what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it came fast</li>
            <li>I have bought this product several times - always good.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described!</li>
            <li>, other then that service was good ...</li>
            <li>Got results right away and compliments too.</li>
            <li>I experienced a lot of tooth sensitivity from using crest strips when I was younger and oddly enough it does not occur using this product!</li>
            <li>The first time I bleached under my dentist care.  </li>
            <li>Doc charged me much more for the same product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and was pleased to find is at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out my initial bleaching gels I was very worried about the cost of getting more.</li>
            <li>Thanks Very Much</li>
            <li>It is so  much cheaper than what my dentist wanted to charge me</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>This will cause teeth to be more sensitive and have a long of &amp;#34;zings,&amp;#34; in which I experienced the first few tries.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product may need to be a lot stronger to help whiten your teeth because as it is right now it will only whiten 1 shade.</li>
            <li>Would be better to get it in a small box.</li>
            <li>20% is not very  strong, dont get any better results with this product than using whitening toothpaste, I will get the 44% next time.</li>
            <li>Suggested packing in a box for shipment instead of a soft envelope.  </li>
            <li>I like the lower% as my teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had sore gums and sensitive teeth for several days after bleaching.  </li>
            <li>great product same as my dentist only less expensive.</li>
            <li>I would only caution you not to keep it on too long if you have sensitive teeth.</li>

            <li> And I mean, really hurts.  </li>

            <li> and I think that the other products were not fresh and DID NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> Just as I get from the dentist, but less than half the price!</li>
            <li> I got this 8 pack in few days ..</li>
            <li> I had bleeding gums for one week and could hardly brush my teeth every day.</li>
            <li> It was really painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent seller.  I recommend it</li>
            <li> Great, what I expected.  My dentist told me about getting this product from online.  He was saving me money as oppose to having a perscription done for it.  He told me what shade to order and I did just that.  Saves money!</li>
            <li> I love this product it came fast and it works great. my teeth are so white. be careful not to leave on there beyond the directions.</li>
            <li> My wife and I used these and they worked just as good as the ones we received from the dentist that did the teeth whitening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Opalescence since years now. 20% it&#x27;s ok .. I do it only few times a month and it&#x27;s enough. I got this 8 pack in few days .. the only thing I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s I got it in an envelope. Would be better to get it in a small box.</li>
            <li> Suggested packing in a box for shipment instead of a soft envelope.  Great price and quality of items.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was pleased to find is at such a reasonable price.  Quality is great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Got results right away and compliments too. Very easy to use and clean up. I would only caution you not to keep it on too long if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The first time I bleached under my dentist care.  He instructed me to bleach overnight.  The instructions that came with the opalescence 20% said to bleach for an hour.  Since I had the same product from the dentist I followed the dentist instructions.  I had sore gums and sensitive teeth for several days after bleaching.  Next time I will go for the hour.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and product</li>
            <li> great product same as my dentist only less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is so  much cheaper than what my dentist wanted to charge me and I use them once every 4 to 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I feel that this product may need to be a lot stronger to help whiten your teeth because as it is right now it will only whiten 1 shade.</li>
            <li> I only tried the 20% gel for 30 minutes. It was really painful. My gums were irritated when I took the caps off, and the pain staid for a week. The whitening effect was OK, even after only one trial of 30 mins, but the side effect was so painful, that I didn&#x27;t dare to try again. The gel irritates the gums and increases the sensitivity of the enamel. I had bleeding gums for one week and could hardly brush my teeth every day.</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was one of the surenges was open so I had to throw it away , other then that service was good ...</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is effective.  However, caution, it hurts and burns your gums.  And I mean, really hurts.  I suffer like they say to look beautiful.</li>
            <li> I won a opalescence gift bag at a tricky tray about a year ago. It included the gels and an appt to get my mold done for the custom trays. I love this product! When I ran out my initial bleaching gels I was very worried about the cost of getting more. I was relieved to find some great deals here on amazon for them! This product is perfect! I use it for about an hour each day and it blows crest white strips out of the water! I experienced a lot of tooth sensitivity from using crest strips when I was younger and oddly enough it does not occur using this product!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times - always good.</li>
            <li> Doc charged me much more for the same product.  He is a money making doctor.  Be careful of those..........Thanks Very Much</li>
            <li> Fast service. Item exactly as described! A+++++++</li>
            <li> 20% is not very  strong, dont get any better results with this product than using whitening toothpaste, I will get the 44% next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. This is the same product sold by my dentist. Way more affordable and it does work with the trays. I have purchased this product from others and I think that the other products were not fresh and DID NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> This is a great teeth whitener. The same stuff you get at the dentist office at a fraction of the price. Does the job</li>
            <li> Just as I get from the dentist, but less than half the price! I like the lower% as my teeth are sensitive. Does the job of whitening.</li>
            <li> This is the same whitener my dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it came in an 8 pack, but it was not worth even a penny. I experienced no results when I used this product. I even went ahead to resell the other 4-pack that I didn&#x27;t use. My teeth, even after two weeks of using Opalescence were not whiter. But if you do consider purchasing this, they forgot to mention that you should NOT apply Opalescence immediately after you brush/floss/eat. This will cause teeth to be more sensitive and have a long of &amp;#34;zings,&amp;#34; in which I experienced the first few tries. This 20% did offer some sensitivity to my teeth, but it was manageable. However, I would definitely recommend Crest Whitestrips rather than Opalescence.</li>
