            <li> They do not go around your entire lower back, so they&#x27;re smaller than the average lower back tattoo, but they&#x27;re also big enough.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Ill add this trick to my repitoire :0)</li>

            <li> The tattoos look very real and they are lovely. They do not go around your entire lower back, so they&#x27;re smaller than the average lower back tattoo, but they&#x27;re also big enough. I recommend them to anyone who wants a lower back tattoo but wants to test it out first.</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative for permanent tatoos.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my 16-year old granddaughter and she loves them. Great tatoos without the pain. Easily removed with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Works nice. Look good.</li>
            <li> They work great. Always thought back tattoos on women were sexy but unfortunately also permanent and that wouldn&#x27;t work for my wife. But this is the best of both worlds. They look incredibly real, and if you put one on Friday night it still looks great Sunday night. It starts to wear away after that but can last up to five days. And comes off literally in seconds with rubbing alcohol. If you want a sexy tattoo but only for the night or weekend this is for you.</li>
            <li> These are so real looking when you put them on. I was amazed! I purchased these for a bachelorette party this weekend, but could not help but try one on as soon as they came. It is still on and looks perfect. Can&#x27;t wait to share them with all the girls. I am sure going to order more!</li>
            <li> Love, we&#x27;re all very fond of.Mom and dad love, my wife love it too.I&#x27;ll tell my friend</li>
            <li> Excellent fake tattoos. Go on ridiculously easy. Ridiculously hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Well I like these but my boyfriend laughed at it and told me not to ever get a tramp stamp. He wouldn&#x27;t mind if I got a tat elsewhere, just not there. So I wear them for myself. Not as fun as I had imagined but I still like them.</li>
            <li> Nice Concept way too small though,&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for my wife but will not be buying again However It was worth the money</li>
            <li> Deceptive.  teeny, tiny.  Not at all like shown in photo.  Unless that back they&#x27;re showing the tattoo on is a Barbie doll.</li>
            <li> i was pleased with the product but then UPS screwed up and didn&#x27;t deliver as they were to. I was on the phone with them 4 times between friday night and saturday and it never showed up. It was for a Halloween costume and that I didn&#x27;t get to wear and it was my party so I was not in costume</li>
            <li> Yes popped. I dont have any real tattoos but was going on a cruise and thought... Why not? Put the one that say &amp;#34;dream on lower back&amp;#34; while hubby gambling. When i was gettin ready my normally conservative husband spied the tattoo peeking out from my panties and .......... Hu hu hu. Ill add this trick to my repitoire :0)</li>
            <li> Super fun for both...</li>
