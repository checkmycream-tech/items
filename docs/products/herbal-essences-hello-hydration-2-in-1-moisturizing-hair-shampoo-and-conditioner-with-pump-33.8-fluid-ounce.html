            <li>However I noticed significant hair breakage after using the Herbal Essence Hydration Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for the first time.  </li>
            <li>And definitely worth the price.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this locally so its nice to be able to buy it on Amazon! I think all shampoo bottles should have pumps!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is IT!  If you are a natural sister the smell is great and it provides so much moisture to your hair in just one wash.  The smell is great and rejuvinating!  Use with the conditioner for the best results!</li>
            <li> After using this product for two days I noticed my hair flaking, like in disgusting amounts, all over the place.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff or a dandruff problem.  This has never happened to me before.  It took another day to realize it was this shampoo.  So gross!  While I love the conditioner, this shampoo made my scalp absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for curly hair and soo reasonably priced. Very quick service.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo. I have very thick straight hair and this Leaves my hair very soft and shiny. Unfortunately, it gives me bad dandruff.  Even if I wash my hair every day it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It has a nice subtle scent of coconuts and it is very much moisturizing. I like the larger bottle as it lasts a long time, and I can find it for a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells amazing and it does moisturize my hair. Herbal essences hair products are great. It makes my hair feel really healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> love it for my hair.. it&#x27;s not heavy on my hair and i don&#x27;t feel it makes it frizzy either.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for Christmas and I&#x27;m not a big fan of it. It makes my hair feel gross after it&#x27;s been washed... it&#x27;s either too greasy feeling or too dry.... very strange ... never had this happen with another shampoo. It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure though. I just know that I won&#x27;t be using this again, and maybe not even their brand.&lt;br /&gt;The Scent is decent. The color of the shampoo is pretty, but kind of weird.</li>
            <li> Smalls good and cleanses hair well. The pump makes it easy to use. Also purchased conditioner. Would purchase again. Great price.</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo is great and lasts all day long.  It seems like it actually does something to your hair to moisturize it although that may just be a placebo effect.  Overall, one of my favorite hair care products especially for the relatively low price you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I always come back to Herbal Essence after I try to save some money with another brand, but getting it in this larger size works great for me</li>
            <li> This is very different from other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s feels very rich, smells wonderful, and latters up really well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and I love this product because it pulls out any oil and followed by its sister conditioner it helps rehydrate my hair.  This with its sister conditioner really helps my hair!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the shampoo and it cleans the family&#x27;s hair well, and this is the only place we&#x27;ve seen it in a large size plus it is such a good price.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo and the cleansing effects however my hair felt STRIPPED.  I am transitioning from relaxed hair and this shampoo came as a recommendation.  I did not prepoo because I had product build up. Following this shampoo, I used a water and apple cider vinegar mix to rinse my hair.  My hair was immediately softened.  I would recommend this for a once a month thorough cleansing if you&#x27;re addicted to fragrances but I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase this again. I&#x27;m weaning myself off of sulfates.  Did I say I loved the smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/1/13 Update - It just occurred to me that I can use the sister conditioner as a cowash/detangler. DUH</li>
            <li> Love the product, but subscribe and save has a lot to be desired.  Amazon can&#x27;t seem to keep items on their subscribe &amp; save feature at all.  Everything swaps in an out.  nothing seems very consistent.</li>
            <li> I miss the original Herbal Essence but this modern version keeps the tradition alive with nice texture and great fragrance</li>
            <li> this item shipped quickly i would buy here again deff recomend the subscripion though product is of good quality w</li>
            <li> This is such a deal for the amount of product you get. My husband uses this shampoo because he has dark course hair and this helps his hair stay softer.</li>
            <li> This item is less than I pay at Wal-Mart once subscribe and save is factored in.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  My wife and I both like the shampoo and the large bottle is convenient.</li>
            <li> Its HUGE. And definitely worth the price. Smells AMAZING and is exactly what you want if you have tried this brand before.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price, much cheaper than sold in the local pharmacy. It works like shampoo- not sure what else to say. Lathers well and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and it is the best! It makes my hair smooth and silky. I love the smell too. I used to buy it in stores for about $5 for a 23.7 oz bottle. Then I found this 33.8 oz bottle for about $6. What a deal! It also has a hand pump and is a much larger container. I subscribe and save to this product and am very pleased with it. I&#x27;ve tried other kinds by Herbal Essences but I always go back to this one. It works best and does not disappoint. I have not had any problems with hair loss either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hope of finally finding a great shampoo for my hair. God, did that product disappoint me!!! I loved it at first because I could de-tangle my hair while washing it, but 2 weeks later my hair started breaking, shedding like crazy, and could not retain moisture for nothing. I hate this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Great Smell.&lt;br /&gt;*Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Dries hair out&lt;br /&gt;*Dries Scalp out&lt;br /&gt;*Causes shedding and dandruff&lt;br /&gt;**TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE**</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Herbal Essence Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner because I noticed all of the good ratings, I remembered the television advertisements and because the product contains coconut which is supposed to be good for hair health. When the product arrived, I noticed that the bottle is a great value (large product for a good price) and the product smells great. The downside was that I noticed that the products contain some ingredients not good for hair (ie. both the shampoo and conditioner contain sulfate and dimethicone) but I figured that unfortunately most shampoo products contain those ingredients. However I noticed significant hair breakage after using the Herbal Essence Hydration Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for the first time.  The next week I switched back to my original shampoo and conditioner and everything was fine.  The bottles are practically full I didn&#x27;t want to waste the content, so I figured I would try the Herbal Essence Hydration shampoo and conditioner one more time just to make sure. But I just revisited the Amazon.com customer reviews and viewed a different set of reviews and I noticed that quite a few other customers also experienced hair loss. At this point, I am not going to use the shampoo and conditioner again and I am going to throw the products in the garbage because I don&#x27;t want to loose any more hair for the sake of getting my money&#x27;s worth. The products did not meet my expectations.  Buyer Beware!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LINK TO CUSTOMER RATINGS:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Herbal-Essences-Hydration-Moisturizing-Shampoo/product-reviews/B003AYEG4E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_hist_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;filterBy&#x3D;addOneStar&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0</li>
            <li> Best I have found for use with curls and hard water!  Lathers well. Smells wonderful and lasts forever. Works best with the HE Hydration conditioner.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference after only one shampoo! Amazing. My hair calmed down, and shine was restored. Recommended if you have dry hair problems.</li>
            <li> We love the hand pump on this shampoo.  It can be used by all family members because it is such a great product.</li>
