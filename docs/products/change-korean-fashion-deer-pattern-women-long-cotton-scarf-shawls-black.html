            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li>I love the lightweight fabric</li>
            <li>For the price, it certainly is okay.</li>
            <li>there was a smell other than that it was perfect.</li>
            <li>This scarf might rip easily for someone who is prone to snagging their clothes.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and light weight, I receive many complements on it.  </li>
            <li>Material is too light.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight but it doesn&#x27;t look cheap or anything.</li>
            <li>It looks fuller in the picture than it actually is, but it&#x27;s a good buy considering how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>It is very soft &amp; surprisingly warm as well as fashionable.  </li>
            <li>and i dont really need a jacket i love it</li>
            <li>The quality is good, the price is fantastic, shipping takes a few weeks but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I love my scarf and it looks like it cost a whole lot more money than I actually paid for it.</li>
            <li>The scarf is a thinner material, which I love, because I was looking for something to complete my outfits, not provide warmth, although It does work to give you some warmth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for slightly chilly nights and perfect for breezy/windy days.</li>

            <li>fast shipping, I will definitely order more scarves in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Just a normal, pretty scarf.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use the scarves we buy on amazon, i loved this one a little more so than my daughter as it&#x27;s black with grey deer.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and the deer print is subtle and very wearable.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more fluffy from the picture</li>
            <li>Love the scarf matches a few of my outfits.</li>
            <li>It goes great and really dresses up a plain grey or black shirt.</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely deer print that is subtle, yet</li>
            <li>The scarf is see through and thin, so it&#x27;s great for summer or for an office outfit that needs a little extra something.</li>
            <li>Long shipped slow love it though</li>
