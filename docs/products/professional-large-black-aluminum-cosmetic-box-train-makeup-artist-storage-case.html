            <li>The case is beautiful and well-made.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great size.</li>
            <li>I loved the removable dividers so I could separate products how I wanted to.  </li>
            <li>The strap is good works well.</li>
            <li>The size of the makeup train is the perfect fit for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>While this still didn&#x27;t hold everything, I am very pleased with the size and set up.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap at all!!</li>
            <li>Hot damn this is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I own a LOT of makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best investment for a makeup artist that is on a budget.</li>
            <li>This is just perfect for bringing the essentials I need and still looking professional.</li>
            <li>Its all a perfect black which looks great and not faded.</li>
            <li>I have a very large collection of makeup and the moveable dividers came in very handy to keep everything where I wanted it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to store it all in one place.  </li>
            <li>I love this makeup box</li>
            <li>I love the size its perfect not to big</li>
            <li>Has to locks on top and it comes with two keys.</li>
            <li>I love that it has dividers, makes it easy to adjust  the storage space to the size of your makeup.</li>
            <li>The dividers on the top I was able to size them and the bottom dividers can be remove to fit my makeup palettes.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly for my pastels and other art equipment.  </li>
            <li>Has enough space for all her things, happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Sturdy Secure and chic....</li>
            <li>I like how light it is considering it&#x27;s strength and durability.</li>
            <li>Maybe two eye shadow palletes fit at the bottom in between everything.</li>
            <li>It still feels light weight considering the amount of makeup supplies and palettes.</li>
            <li>I can fit daytime, night time, and clown make-up collections in here.</li>
            <li>I can fit a 4oz bottle of Liquiset standing up in a bottom quarter section, and a 8oz bottle of makeup remover if I lay it at an angle.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size, I set it on top of my toilet in my tiny apartement bathroom and fold the trays out, it stays put and the trays glide up easily, it comes with 2 keys-</li>
            <li>the bottom has 4 compartments I wish there was no divider at the bottom but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>that looks professional and is a good size but for the ladys that love makeup to the max you will maybe need a bigger box</li>
            <li>The dividers in the bottom came out completely and my large Coastal Scents palettes fit in the bottom compartment easily.</li>
            <li>it has a lot of room, and it more sturdy than any cases she looked at in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li>This cosmetic case is exactly what it describes.</li>
            <li>Overall I am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very spacious had extra room to buy more make up</li>
            <li>It is definitely large and has a lot of storage space.</li>
            <li>I reccomend this to anyone who wants a make up box</li>
            <li>the storage is great for a small makeup collection or in my case I&#x27;m using it to separate my huge collection from my immediate everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>The exterior is high quality and very durable.</li>
            <li>This would be the only downfall, not being able to store big palletes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and I feel professional using it!</li>
            <li>The removable dividers are great if only you can do the same for the bottom that was the only down side.</li>
            <li>The dividers are all moveable, maybe not super easily, but the construction is overall very solid.</li>
            <li>The bottom will not fit big eyeshadow or makeup palletes, the 4 top trays can be arranged to accomodate the Urban Decay Naked eyeshadow pallete, but the bottom of the case with its dividers can not.</li>
            <li>Other than the very small dent (not worth the hassle of returning), it seems like a great case.  </li>

            <li> At first I was a little ambivalent about the exterior texture of this train case, it is a slightly rough texture, but after putting all of my make-up in it and still have room for my collection to grow, and the fact that it survived my 3 year old nephew&#x27;s curious attack on it, I have decided to keep it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the slight roughness on the outside since it still looked professional.</li>
            <li> The dividers on the 4 trays are removable but alas the bottom 4 dividers are not, at least I don&#x27;t think they are because I tried pulling them out and the dividers wouldn&#x27;t budge, but honestly I don&#x27;t mind that the bottom is divided because I like having my makeup seperated.</li>
            <li> Also fits long palettes.</li>
            <li> If I could change one thing, I would make it just a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> I can finally be orginized and not have broken blushes lying around.</li>
            <li> Uneven racks so closing and locking</li>

            <li> the storage is great for a small makeup collection or in my case I&#x27;m using it to separate my huge collection from my immediate everyday makeup. Its sitting in my restroom and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap at all!!</li>
            <li> Looks like the Picture</li>
            <li> the wife was ecstatic when she received this case. it has a lot of room, and it more sturdy than any cases she looked at in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;got it 2 years ago and it is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is the best train case I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have a very large collection of makeup and the moveable dividers came in very handy to keep everything where I wanted it. The dividers in the bottom came out completely and my large Coastal Scents palettes fit in the bottom compartment easily.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend that does make up. She loves it. Has enough space for all her things, happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Sturdy Secure and chic....Holds all my makeup I no longer have to look everywhere to find my stuff! the bottom has 4 compartments I wish there was no divider at the bottom but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a makeup artist but I own a LOT of makeup.  I wanted to be able to store it all in one place.  While this still didn&#x27;t hold everything, I am very pleased with the size and set up.  I loved the removable dividers so I could separate products how I wanted to.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for my pastels and other art equipment.  I like how light it is considering it&#x27;s strength and durability.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup box it is absolutely perfect for the amount I have. I love the size its perfect not to big i was expecting it to be much smaller but when it arrived i was amazed of how big it was. The removable dividers are great if only you can do the same for the bottom that was the only down side. Its all a perfect black which looks great and not faded. Has to locks on top and it comes with two keys. The strap is good works well. Maybe two eye shadow palletes fit at the bottom in between everything. If it came in white i would totally get it. I can finally be orginized and not have broken blushes lying around. I reccomend this to anyone who wants a make up box that looks professional and is a good size but for the ladys that love makeup to the max you will maybe need a bigger box lol</li>

It is the perfect size, I set it on top of my toilet in my tiny apartement bathroom and fold the trays out, it stays put and the trays glide up easily, it comes with 2 keys-one is a spare and it stays locked. The dividers on the 4 trays are removable but alas the bottom 4 dividers are not, at least I don&#x27;t think they are because I tried pulling them out and the dividers wouldn&#x27;t budge, but honestly I don&#x27;t mind that the bottom is divided because I like having my makeup seperated.

            <li> The case is beautiful and well-made.  If I could change one thing, I would make it just a little bigger.  Overall I am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am still stocking this for our up coming dance recital.  seems to hold everything I need.  seems to be functional.</li>
            <li> Other than the very small dent (not worth the hassle of returning), it seems like a great case.  All dividers are adjustable, even the bottom sections.</li>
            <li> Uneven racks so closing and locking it is a hassle. Handle broke within a week. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Great size. Travel size spray bottles standing up. Also fits long palettes. It&#x27;s very sturdy and I feel professional using it!</li>
            <li> Hot damn this is perfect. The dividers are all moveable, maybe not super easily, but the construction is overall very solid. I can fit daytime, night time, and clown make-up collections in here. I can fit a 4oz bottle of Liquiset standing up in a bottom quarter section, and a 8oz bottle of makeup remover if I lay it at an angle.</li>
