            <li>Please don&#x27;t make me have to fly to the UK to get this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times and find it a very nice product.</li>

            <li>Coincidentally, two weeks ago I had blood pressure readings, quite good for my age:</li>
            <li>Who knows at any rate, the product is good.</li>
            <li>since I just found out I have COPD - and need a good product to fend off anything that might go to the chest.</li>
            <li>it properly, it&#x27;s a good protection</li>
            <li>This Vicks is perfect but, as described, should be used immediately you feels the first signs of a cold.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>I used this product for 3 days as directed and it was so effective in draining the congestion, painlessly</li>
            <li>and it had risen to an astounding 151/80.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered two more of this nasal spray product BECAUSE it seems to work in</li>
            <li>so I might add, that I ordered two more, one for travel, and one to always have around.  </li>
            <li>I love this product I recommend to all who have colds etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is time to stock up on more.</li>
            <li>Whenever the grandchildren visit, they bring the rampant school germs to a house that&#x27;s fairly isolated from elementary schools.  </li>

            <li>Best stuff - can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not readily available now!</li>
            <li>On this new order, I&#x27;ve been notified of a 5 day delivery date, relatively quick delivery for an outstanding product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>we start right on using it.</li>
            <li>Once more a little more communication consideration from the seller store to the customer on when items are shipped would be helpful.</li>

            <li>This scenario has played out twice since I ordered my first spray.  </li>
            <li>And even though the product ad notifies of a one or two week delivery window (I assume because it&#x27;s a UK product), the first time it took 4 days for delivery.  </li>
            <li>I panicked at first</li>

            <li>This is the first real test I have given it</li>
            <li>But at home today, I had another very very high reading</li>
            <li>The whole family had colds.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product Jan 27th 2012, it was allegedly supposed to arrive the latest by March 7th 2012</li>

            <li>Of course, with the right precautions and good food and vitamins, First Defense does wonder, and i am not worry any more about getting a full scale cold or flu because I use it regularly in the winter time or even when I go to crowded or congested places such as transportation or markets.</li>

            <li> On moving back to the US, my lingering colds returned, at least until I discovered that I could get First Defence on-line.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time and only arrived yesterday!!</li>
            <li> I have used this after I caught pnuemonia during a long flight.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from low immune system for years which caused repeated cold and flu symptoms several times a year.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using Vicks First Defense Nasal Spray, my cold and flu cases were heavily minimized to light symptoms which no one can avoid but I can live with.</li>
            <li> Maybe its a British thing they could care less once products leave their store.</li>
            <li> Although it is not a fast working thing, it takes time.</li>
            <li> I wished I would have purchased several bottles at the time as I did not realize it was not available in the states.</li>
            <li> My bottle is now almost empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every remedy you can think of (apple cider vinegar, various herbs and vitamins, emergen-C, airborne, eating raw garlic, colloidal silver, etc)</li>
            <li> A spray before we board any flight minimises the risk of infection from other passengers.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star; simply because I haven&#x27;t really had the need to use it yet on a cold - thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Since using this travel technique we have rarely ended up with an unwanted cold on our holidays.</li>
            <li> I take it as soon as I feel a cold coming on (tickle throat and nose, feeling feverish etc) and as long as I stick with it and keep taking it a day after all the symptoms magically disappear, I never get the cold.  </li>
            <li> You will not get a cold if you use this at the first sign.</li>
            <li> and it certainly seems to damp down the symptoms and shorten the cold.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this stuff is not available in US pharmacies.</li>
            <li> that I was very nasally congested, not sure if I was beginning a cold, or, allergies.  </li>
            <li> We got introduced to this in Scotland (horrible, wet weather), and began using it with early (sore throat, sinus congestion) symptoms, and the full cold never developed.  </li>
            <li> Three days of using it and my cold symptoms were completely gone.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 72 years of age and thought the worst) until I recalled that some nasal sprays can raise blood pressure and this particularly powerful oral spray can too, methinks!!  </li>
            <li> In the past 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve averted 2 serious virus infections passed on my my son and his children.  </li>
            <li> It was days late.</li>
            <li> The only product out that that stops a cold in its tracks.  </li>
            <li> If you have young children that get you sick often, this is a must have item.  </li>
            <li> It does not let your cold progress, while it might make your cold stagnant, it wont let it get worse and with a little more time and patience; plus a couple of these it will make your cold go away.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY friends, you need this in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> Normally I get very sick with a cold, but after using this I had a few sniffles, the cold never developed and symptoms were gone in a couple days.</li>
            <li> When traveling with a group of friends to Ireland, several in the group came down with terrible colds.</li>
            <li> surprisingly I never caught that cold.</li>
            <li> The cold did not materialize.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice when I felt a cold coming on</li>
            <li> if I travel or come into contact with someone that has a cold.</li>
            <li> I have not had a cold in quite a while.</li>
            <li> I used it when my throat and sinuses got that scratchy pre cold feeling.  </li>
            <li> And I used to get a cold every month or two, so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get through cold season without it!</li>

            <li> My daughter introduced me to this miracle spray when I visited the UK.  The whole family had colds.  I finally had symptoms too and used this spray.  Normally I get very sick with a cold, but after using this I had a few sniffles, the cold never developed and symptoms were gone in a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have used this after I caught pnuemonia during a long flight. It seems to have helped but who knows. I can np longer  buy it in Australia so had to use Internet. Total cost is more than I would like but on the off chance it will work.....</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from low immune system for years which caused repeated cold and flu symptoms several times a year.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using Vicks First Defense Nasal Spray, my cold and flu cases were heavily minimized to light symptoms which no one can avoid but I can live with. Of course, with the right precautions and good food and vitamins, First Defense does wonder, and i am not worry any more about getting a full scale cold or flu because I use it regularly in the winter time or even when I go to crowded or congested places such as transportation or markets. I am extremely grateful to have such a great medication in today&#x27;s hectic life.</li>
            <li> Excellent for temporary or long term sinus cogestion. Has a pleasant menthol type fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best stuff - can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not readily available now!</li>
            <li> We got introduced to this in Scotland (horrible, wet weather), and began using it with early (sore throat, sinus congestion) symptoms, and the full cold never developed.  Now, at first sign, we use it.  It works excellent for us!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just ordered two more of this nasal spray product BECAUSE it seems to work in that I was very nasally congested, not sure if I was beginning a cold, or, allergies.  I used this product for 3 days as directed and it was so effective in draining the congestion, painlessly so I might add, that I ordered two more, one for travel, and one to always have around.  The cold did not materialize.  This scenario has played out twice since I ordered my first spray.  And even though the product ad notifies of a one or two week delivery window (I assume because it&#x27;s a UK product), the first time it took 4 days for delivery.  On this new order, I&#x27;ve been notified of a 5 day delivery date, relatively quick delivery for an outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This product is working wonderfully again; my grandchildren always have colds and I catch them, until I discovered this product.  In the past 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve averted 2 serious virus infections passed on my my son and his children.  CAVEAT: I&#x27;ve been using this spray for 3 weeks now (not daily but almost)and it is recommended on packaging to continue to use it two days after it appears the infection is truly gone. Coincidentally, two weeks ago I had blood pressure readings, quite good for my age: 114/79 and yesterday, I had occasion to check my blood pressure again and it had risen to an astounding 151/80.  BTW, both readings were at a doctor&#x27;s office in connection with an annual physical but I wasn&#x27;t concerned attributing the second high reading to &#x27;white coat syndrome&#x27;. But at home today, I had another very very high reading and I began to examine what new substance has entered my body (I take no medication).  Today was my last dosage of the two day post infection phase, and my blood pressure reading is 159/90.  What??  Whoops!!!  I panicked at first (I&#x27;m 72 years of age and thought the worst) until I recalled that some nasal sprays can raise blood pressure and this particularly powerful oral spray can too, methinks!!  Stillwill go to doc to share this info and make sure all is well because this product is supposed to be made only of plant extracts!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this stuff is not available in US pharmacies. It works so well. I discovered it while living in London, and my wife and I both swear by it. I have always had one or two winter-time colds that dragged on for weeks. I went years with no more than sniffles for a day or two while using First Defence. On moving back to the US, my lingering colds returned, at least until I discovered that I could get First Defence on-line.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in Mexico by the same name but in spanish. It works quite well. Although it is not a fast working thing, it takes time. Be patient it does what it says. It does not let your cold progress, while it might make your cold stagnant, it wont let it get worse and with a little more time and patience; plus a couple of these it will make your cold go away. I love this product I recommend to all who have colds etc.&lt;br /&gt;The seller though, lacks communication on shipping. It takes for ever to ship from overseas, and the lack of communication from the seller makes you believe your products were lost. I ordered this product Jan 27th 2012, it was allegedly supposed to arrive the latest by March 7th 2012 It was days late. Once more a little more communication consideration from the seller store to the customer on when items are shipped would be helpful. Maybe its a British thing they could care less once products leave their store. Who knows at any rate, the product is good.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really works.  I have used it twice when I felt a cold coming on and it certainly seems to damp down the symptoms and shorten the cold.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that has made it possible for me to live sinusitis-free&lt;br /&gt;without the use of antibiotics, ever since I started using it six years ago.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star; simply because I haven&#x27;t really had the need to use it yet on a cold - thank goodness. I have used it a couple of times and find it a very nice product. I will continue to use it always...since I just found out I have COPD - and need a good product to fend off anything that might go to the chest. This seems to be a great way to stop a cold in its tracks.</li>
            <li> We use Vicks Fist Defence whenever we travel. A spray before we board any flight minimises the risk of infection from other passengers. Since using this travel technique we have rarely ended up with an unwanted cold on our holidays.</li>
            <li> This product really works and I always like to have some around for if I travel or come into contact with someone that has a cold.</li>
            <li> This does seem to work, but of course, I can&#x27;t provide clinical evidence.  I know three people who have been using this at the first sign of a cold, and they have remained healthy.  I just wish it were available locally.</li>
            <li> When traveling with a group of friends to Ireland, several in the group came down with terrible colds. We purchased a bottle of First Defence at that time (recommended by the salesman at the drugstore)and surprisingly I never caught that cold. I wished I would have purchased several bottles at the time as I did not realize it was not available in the states. I have guarded that bottle for over a year and every time a feel as if I am catching a cold I use it for a couple of days. I have not had a cold in quite a while. My bottle is now almost empty so it is time to stock up on more. I will buy several bottles this time. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Whenever the grandchildren visit, they bring the rampant school germs to a house that&#x27;s fairly isolated from elementary schools.  When I heard the first sniffle, I started with First Defence.  My immune system isn&#x27;t the best but this time the dad and granddad caught their colds and I didn&#x27;t.  I credit First Defence.  This is the first real test I have given it and I&#x27;d say it worked.</li>
            <li> This produce definitely helps to stop the onset of colds!  As soon as I feel one coming on, I use immediately.</li>
            <li> You will not get a cold if you use this at the first sign. I use a cotton swab to apply rather than spraying it in my nose as it can sting. Works every time. It looks like amazon is nit carrying it now. Please don&#x27;t make me have to fly to the UK to get this stuff. I can&#x27;t get through cold season without it!</li>
            <li> I like this product and it seems to do as it says.  I can no ;longer get it here in Western Australia so had to send to UK for it - It took a very long time and only arrived yesterday!!</li>
            <li> Guys, this stuff really works!  No BS - I have felt various ailments coming on, usually the symptoms of a sinus infection, no fewer than 6-7 times - used this stuff as soon as I could, and felt much better in 1-2 days.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every remedy you can think of (apple cider vinegar, various herbs and vitamins, emergen-C, airborne, eating raw garlic, colloidal silver, etc), this is the only thing that has worked consistently every single time.  I wish it was sold here in the states, I always keep a supply at home just in case.  If you have young children that get you sick often, this is a must have item.  SERIOUSLY friends, you need this in your arsenal.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff really works.  I used it when my throat and sinuses got that scratchy pre cold feeling.  It calmed the sore throat and runny nose.  Three days of using it and my cold symptoms were completely gone.  I&#x27;m ordering more for other family members.</li>
            <li> The only product out that that stops a cold in its tracks.  And it isn&#x27;t even a drug!  I take it as soon as I feel a cold coming on (tickle throat and nose, feeling feverish etc) and as long as I stick with it and keep taking it a day after all the symptoms magically disappear, I never get the cold.  And I used to get a cold every month or two, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about!  I wish it was sold in the US.</li>
            <li> My partner and I swear by this stuff. The moment either of us just fel a sniffle coming on we start right on using it.</li>
            <li> This Vicks is perfect but, as described, should be used immediately you feels the first signs of a cold.&lt;br /&gt;Using it properly, it&#x27;s a good protection</li>
