            <li> Some minor concerns.</li>
            <li> Replacements should serve their purpose for a long while.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> not impressed,,, I used the AirFloss side by side with the water pic,, water pic wins hands</li>
            <li> These are not easily found on the local shelves.</li>
            <li> This enabled me and other family members to use one handle and change refills.</li>
            <li> I went to use my Airfloss as usual this morning only to find</li>
            <li> I tried mini tooth brushes but my interstices are not even and some are too small for such brushes.</li>
            <li> After a complaint, they stated that the US does not carry 2 different colors.</li>
            <li> color difference between the two nozzles in the package is almost impossible to see in real life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;apart and split down the middle starting at the base.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted - as usual.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is almost no difference in the colors, it is difficult to tell that there are two colors.  </li>
            <li> I am clumsy in using ordinary floss.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find parts for this</li>
            <li> I do wish they were silicone tipped instead of hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, but my teeth are so close together that it&#x27;s a daily requirement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird because hubby bought his air flosser months before I bought one</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to buy another expensive flosser.</li>
            <li> might try a rematch,,, to see if I have wrongly criticized the airfloss</li>
            <li> and I would hate to throw it out.</li>
            <li> If you hate to floss I would suggest you use this water pick by Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Works as expected, but not very sturdy. This is my second replacement order. I&#x27;m on my third nozzle in less than a year, and it works great until that tiny &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shaped groove near the base of the nozzle splits. When it happen, water or mouthwash squirts out of the crack and the air pressure changes. It&#x27;s weird because hubby bought his air flosser months before I bought one and he has never replaced the nozzle. Maybe I&#x27;m putting pressure on the nozzle somehow. Full disclosure - I hate flossing, but my teeth are so close together that it&#x27;s a daily requirement. I should buy stock in dental floss as I have to use it every time I eat anything. Daily use of the air flosser has paid off because my dentist gave me two thumbs up on my last check-up, so it definitely helps. I&#x27;ll have to be more attentive to how I&#x27;m flossing and see if that makes a difference in the life of the nozzles. For now, three stars.</li>
            <li> great product, but wish they came in multiple colors so it is easier to have multiple people use the same product.</li>
            <li> They fit my airflosser</li>
            <li> Thanks for an efficient transaction; product as described.</li>
            <li> Lots of pressure - recommended to me by my dental people</li>
            <li> Love the air flosser and you can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> Great price!!! Amazon offered the best deal--again..</li>
            <li> Just started to use the Airfloss system and like the way it cleans between my teeth.</li>
            <li> the airfloss was recomended to me by my dental hygenist. I&#x27;m very sure I&#x27;ll be needing these.</li>
            <li> Arrived before estimated time given and they are fine.</li>
            <li> excellent product, great service.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare Airfloss came back to life when the new tip was installed.  Delighted!</li>
            <li> Received and and works as promised and described!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I just started using this product along with AirFloss about a month ago. I hear that dentists tend to rave after people&#x27;s next visit assuming it&#x27;s used regularly. So far so good! Let&#x27;s see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have an upcoming dental cleaning and am waiting to see if the SS dental tech gives me a positive review.</li>
            <li> I snapped one of these shoving it in for travel. The replacements work. If you travel, nice to have a backup so you can use your flosser or take out the tip and secure it.</li>
            <li> I went right to Phillips to order and they were out of stock for 30 days but said they would let me know which they never did. Very happy to find the item on Amazon and much cheaper than Phillips quoted me.</li>
            <li> These fit the Philips Sonicare Airfloss. Although there appear to be multiple model numbers for the device, there really is only one nozzle size. Philips recommends replacing the nozzle very six months - ah that might be too frequent. I&#x27;ve had my Airfloss for two years and kind of go with the once a year replacement. Not because the nozzle was worn out, it just feels like the right thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color difference between the two nozzles in the package is almost impossible to see in real life. I wouldn&#x27;t use these as his and hers nozzles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004Y9AINC Philips Sonicare HX8111/02 Airfloss, Rechargeable Electric Flosser]]</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet..they are the right ones..the only thing I thought was they were high in price.. I do love using the product..</li>
            <li> What can I say, these work very well.  These are not easily found on the local shelves.</li>
            <li> An easy way to keep up with refills............just notify Amazon &amp; it&#x27;s a done deal!</li>
            <li> The airfloss appliance is really great.  I use it twice daily and my teeth are pretty much stain free.  No stains in between them at all.  You do have to replace the nozzles every 6 months.  I do and it does help.  Just like replacing the brush on the Sonicare toothbrush.  It must be replaced and you do notice the difference.  Try the airfloss.  It really does work..  This is now my 3rd replacement order and still the same 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Like the product was reccomended by my dentist. Flossing is still required. Another tool to use for fighting tooth decay.</li>
            <li> Love using the Sonicare are air floss</li>
            <li> Very thoughtful for philips to create these heads in different color for each user. Now, if only I could order them in specific colors....</li>
            <li> Not too much to say - they are replacement heads for a great oral care device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest the recurring shipment program to save some money and ensure that you have fresh, sterile replacement heads when you need them!</li>
            <li> The airfloss is great and it&#x27;s nice to find the accessory parts for so cheap. No complaints, great quality. One piece of advise, make sure the nozzle is firmly on before pressing the button for the jet of water. My original one flew off into the toilet. : (</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of using it, I use it twice daily and it makes my mouth feel very clea.</li>
            <li> Works great. Always nice to have a spare on hand.</li>
            <li> This product helps me keep me keep my teeth clean, and is a good companion to a toothbrush.  I use regular mouthwash with it.</li>
            <li> very comfortable and useful, a good substitute for normal flossing, you can do it everywhere even in bed time and work hours</li>
            <li> Works well at removing food bits and tartar.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low in local stores, pharmacies, etc. and could not locate the replacement nozzles. I was so happy to find them on Amazon as this is a great product and I would hate to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Refills for Sonicare AirFloss flosser. This enabled me and other family members to use one handle and change refills. Don&#x27;t have to buy another expensive flosser.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT IT ON DENTIST STRONG RECOMMENDATION.  WORKS BEAUTIFULLY AND KEEPS ME FROM PICKING AT MY TEETH.  WHEN HOME I USE IT AFTER EVERY MEAL.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a fresh new start ever quarter or after a cold or sickness.  No running around looking for them.  Just purchase and love when they appear at your door.</li>
            <li> I went to use my Airfloss as usual this morning only to find&lt;br /&gt;that it wasn&#x27;t working properly - there was no pressure from&lt;br /&gt;the nozzle.  When I checked, the stem of nozzle itself had come&lt;br /&gt;apart and split down the middle starting at the base.  Examining it&lt;br /&gt;(and a new nozzle) more closely, it seems that it is glued together&lt;br /&gt;along the entire length and this is what split apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not abuse the nozzle (never been dropped, bumped, etc), and&lt;br /&gt;I have been the only one to use it (gently).  I use it with mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;so I&#x27;m wondering if the seam was defective or the mouth wash&lt;br /&gt;weakened the glue.  Either way it split and is uselessâ€¦  Despite the&lt;br /&gt;fact that the literature with the device suggests changing the nozzle&lt;br /&gt;every 6 monthsâ€¦ hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the replacement tip lasts (I&#x27;ll be watching this&lt;br /&gt;very closely)</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare airfloss replacement nozzles is a great price and better than some other stores.&lt;br /&gt;I love the replacement nozzles.</li>
            <li> Sonicar Airfloss.it really gets all the food particles from between and under you gums.  I love it....I mouth never felt this clean before using the Sonicar airfloss</li>
            <li> After using this item I still feel the need to floss.  So why do I need this product?&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I Liked my philips sonicare hx8012/64 airfloss, replecement nozzles 2 paks bnecause it is a very good produt&lt;br /&gt;i bought for my daughter and for me</li>
            <li> They were perfect replacements!!!</li>
            <li> My husband likes them alo.t.  He would never floss.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> Fairly good. Some minor concerns.</li>
            <li> Did not get 2 different colored nozzles as was in the picture as well as in the description. After a complaint, they stated that the US does not carry 2 different colors. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with the Airflossâ€¦will see what dentist says next check-up?</li>
            <li> The Airfloss were prefect and the cost was even better. First of all looking for them was very hard at stores and when we found them they were much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a Great Price</li>
            <li> If you hate to floss I would suggest you use this water pick by Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> I liked the product.  One of ours fell off a shelf and broke and it is hard to find parts for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it was pricey!  Twenty five bucks for this!!!</li>
            <li> not impressed,,, I used the AirFloss side by side with the water pic,, water pic wins hands down.&lt;br /&gt;I might try a rematch,,, to see if I have wrongly criticized the airfloss</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> Works like originals.</li>
            <li> They work great, they are an exact replacement, and they are reasonably priced.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for my Airfloss.  My dentist said my gums are in the best condition he has seen, so it is working.  Good price.</li>
            <li> GREAT way to get the kids flossing!</li>
            <li> I use these with my sonic are flosser hx8140. They are the right length and width. They are long enough to get to the back of your mouth and slim enough to be comfortable for repeat use. However, the tip is too sharp, you could injure your gums if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been a dental hygienist over 30 years and I LOVE the Airflosser.  These replacement nozzles are great to have on hand.  If you don&#x27;t like to use dental floss, GET ONE OF THESE!!</li>
            <li> not sure if these are more effective than old school floss but definitely less destructive to your gums</li>
            <li> Great to have spare ones around the house as much as we use this airfloss, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased these replacement nozzles, the price is unbeatable, I compared prices and no one could beat this price</li>
            <li> Purchased these as replacements in case I need them. Appear to be same as original produucts.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Always happy to receive these in the mail, as the timing is great for replacing the old nozzle!</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  Quality replacement parts which fit and worked well.</li>
            <li> Replacements should serve their purpose for a long while.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off at 38.99 Suggested retail is 8.99 what are you folks doing</li>
            <li> These heads preform exactly as they should. I do wish they were silicone tipped instead of hard plastic. This would be gentler on gum, especially for my kids! This sonic are system works great for my 13 year old with braces!</li>
            <li> Love the Airfloss brushes they really do a good job &amp; get between teeth as they are meant to :)</li>
            <li> So easy to change and works well with the Phillips Sonicare unit. I bought these to just have on hand for future use.</li>
            <li> GREAT, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A STAND TO HOLD THE FLOSSERS</li>
            <li> I bought these as replacements for the head that came on the Airfloss.  They arrived quickly and are exactly what I expected.  My only complaint is that there is almost no difference in the colors, it is difficult to tell that there are two colors.  I would prefer the two heads be noticeably different colors.  Other than that these are wonderful and function perfectly.</li>
            <li> Heads to fit the excellent Airfloss. One draw back is a lack of space on the machine to place them.</li>
            <li> Great!! It was just what I wanted - as usual.  They will last me four years -- hope my teeth last that long!</li>
            <li> They spew streams of magic into my mouth; that&#x27;s perfect from where I sit.</li>
            <li> I am clumsy in using ordinary floss. I tried mini tooth brushes but my interstices are not even and some are too small for such brushes. This new device serves me better when used with water jet but I was expecting it to operate only on air jet as implied by its name.</li>
            <li> The Airfloss is a very good idea and works very well. So this means the additional nozzles are good too. Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Excelent replacement Accessory for Philips Air Floss</li>
