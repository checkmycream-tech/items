            <li>Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent...</li>
            <li>I bought it on sale and gifted it to a friend of mine.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is better than the run of the mill</li>
            <li>Love is will buy it agine.</li>
            <li>FAVORITE:</li>
            <li>I just got this for my dad and he thinks its ok</li>
            <li>but once it gets situated on your skin the scent gets a lot better.</li>
            <li>but I still love the smell</li>
            <li>I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>In fact, the smell will annoy you more than anyone else.</li>
            <li>the scent is okay</li>
            <li>love my husband with this smell.....</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li>Package your products safely or don&#x27;t offer it for sale.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Bought this and the Yatch Man Red together and they are both excellent.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.</li>
            <li>I would love to see more from this maker.</li>
            <li>I would buy more when they supply them.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews, because the people that wrote a good review for this was right on the money.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>this is a great masculine scent.it smells better in the night to me more than during the day.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good</li>
            <li>It ok for price ..very strong scent</li>
            <li>Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns of hazardous materials (which this is considered), and even so it&#x27;s almost not even worth the effort to save the $6.</li>
            <li>Looks great, aroma is tops; dry &amp; sophisticated, but not &amp;#34;loud!&amp;#34; What more could I ask for???</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong and stays close to his skin, so you can smell it when he&#x27;s close</li>
            <li>excellent product was everything I expected good perfumes they recommend and high quality and durability, buy with confidence that they liked much</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Red is my favorite and is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with way shipped package secure and easy to open.</li>
            <li>I like this cologne, but it&#x27;s too light.  </li>
            <li>i ordered this item through amazon, if nothing else, to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li>this cologne isnt to light it just need reapplication every so often</li>
            <li>The amount you get for the price is fantastic, and he likes it too</li>
            <li>it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li>Right choice, I love it</li>
            <li>If the scent would last, it would be a great clean scent.  </li>
            <li>so I tried it on and at first I thought it was ok</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has been wearing this for the past 6 years and he nor I can&#x27;t get over how awesome it smells.</li>
            <li>, i recommended this product is because is like an original perfume for lower price..</li>
            <li>I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li>The scent is very good, but does not last much longer.</li>
            <li>it smells like a clean soap and get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, its clean.  </li>
            <li>Spirits of the middle class to be said sootvetsvstvy with a price we can say that good and made in Germany</li>
            <li>It smells nice and if you like soft smell, go for it.</li>
            <li>Good Scent like the different scents from Yacht Man...</li>
            <li>Good basic all purpose scent.</li>
            <li>yachtman has a few good ones love this one</li>
            <li>That is outstanding service on amazon&#x27;s part (and the only reason it got more than 1 star).</li>
            <li>Fragrance goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>but the yacht man blue smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it really smells great, last a decent while and is familiar but not.  </li>
            <li>try all of the yacht clubs they are dirt cheap and all smell great to me at least.</li>
            <li>I knew this was a cheap scent and didn&#x27;t expect much when i got it.</li>
            <li>I really just needed some filler to get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Worth its price.</li>
            <li>you get your money worth with this product all pro&#x27;s no cons.</li>
            <li>Pretty suitable for young men.</li>
            <li>nice fragrance for a low price will buy this again.</li>
            <li>pretty mild and pleasing.</li>
            <li>Price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl</li>
            <li>Came slightly damaged at the top so doesn&#x27;t close securely and doesn&#x27;t seem to be a  full bottle either.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, I tend to wear this when I want to smell good but not seem like I am trying to hard.</li>
            <li>the initial reaction will be that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>[and this is not exaggerated].</li>
            <li>yacht man red is better</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed the scent on me, it smelled like peppermint.</li>
            <li>It was delivered so fast too!</li>
            <li>will buy something more lasting that doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li>but EVERYONE especially me was highly satisfied with it</li>
            <li>When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>even when i get cologne i fall in love with i still have a few people that tell me its too strong or it</li>
            <li>not bad for the price its strong when applying then mild&#x27;s down later on, but very clean, like after the shower</li>
            <li>This is a nice smell, but the perfume is extremely impermanent.</li>
            <li>It is a light, fresh masculine scent that is reminiscent of sprays like Axe but a little more mature, and it doesn&#x27;t have the underlying alcohol smell that seems to characterize many cheap colognes.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s an absolute steal at the current price another reason I ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I purchased the other two bottles in the set.  </li>
            <li>It is a little light for some people but it is really fit into my style.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>This was not the smell I expected, I really love the chocolate and gray smell</li>
            <li>Really like it...</li>
            <li>like the cologne, but a person has to be very close to smell it.</li>
            <li>but the fragance is very hurt, like the Swiss Camps, Acceptable quality.</li>
            <li>The scent does smell like an inexpensive scent, very outdoorsy smell, a lot of pine scent to us.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast and swift.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s a  lovely fragrance and last a fairly considerable period on  you</li>
            <li>I see a lot of people dinging this for not smelling as strong or as long as others, and thats probably why I like it.  </li>
            <li>so I will be getting him more Metal and probably some of the other fragrances in the line when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for the \\&quot;young adult\\&quot; male.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very similar to cool water.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my bro, he had in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li>Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li>If you want a very very faint fragrance than this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I have the entire YachtMan collection and this out of the 7 is 2nd from the bottom, I find it has top notes of talc and linen and then after after the burdown I get middle notes of powder and a clean scent.</li>
            <li>Great inexpensive cologne, doesn&#x27;t las all that long, but at this price you can afford to use it a few times a day!</li>
            <li>you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  </li>
            <li>Why pay $50 plus dollars for the ones at the department stores when this is just as high quality.  </li>
            <li>The selection for this product is vast and it was worth every cent.</li>
            <li>this is lightly fragrant and seems like it should be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and subtle and has a convenient non-breakable package.</li>
            <li>The fragrance, although I realize it is cheap, does not last longer that ten minutes</li>
            <li>Seems like more time was spent on advertising than the actual fragrance.</li>
            <li>Normal and cheap serve for everyday.</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  </li>
            <li>I just got this colonge an all I can say wow</li>
            <li>However, he said don&#x27;t remember it being so soft and when I tried it</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last for a hour if that much.</li>
            <li>I bought this direct from Amazon</li>
            <li>and I can smell it from far away</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Probably</li>
            <li>Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast.</li>
            <li>females love it as it subtly goes away</li>
            <li>Now it was cheap at like 8.00 or less and product of German.</li>
            <li>like spraying on water, fragrance only lasts for a very short time, not even worth the low price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>, I thought the same; soft.</li>
            <li>Never expected any miracle</li>
            <li>but I think that I would have to empty the whole bottle onto myself for you to know I was wearing something.  </li>
            <li>I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who&#x27;s exp dates are approaching.</li>
            <li>I find it similar to the nautica blue, but less strong and less long lasting.  </li>

            <li> I just got this for my dad and he thinks its ok</li>
            <li> but once it gets situated on your skin the scent gets a lot better.</li>
            <li> but I still love the smell</li>
            <li> I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> In fact, the smell will annoy you more than anyone else.</li>
            <li> the scent is okay</li>
            <li> love my husband with this smell.....</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> Package your products safely or don&#x27;t offer it for sale.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the Yatch Man Red together and they are both excellent.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.</li>
            <li> I would love to see more from this maker.</li>
            <li> I would buy more when they supply them.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews, because the people that wrote a good review for this was right on the money.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> this is a great masculine scent.it smells better in the night to me more than during the day.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good</li>
            <li> It ok for price ..very strong scent</li>
            <li> Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns of hazardous materials (which this is considered), and even so it&#x27;s almost not even worth the effort to save the $6.</li>
            <li> Looks great, aroma is tops; dry &amp; sophisticated, but not &amp;#34;loud!&amp;#34; What more could I ask for???</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong and stays close to his skin, so you can smell it when he&#x27;s close</li>
            <li> excellent product was everything I expected good perfumes they recommend and high quality and durability, buy with confidence that they liked much</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red is my favorite and is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with way shipped package secure and easy to open.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne, but it&#x27;s too light.  </li>
            <li> i ordered this item through amazon, if nothing else, to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li> this cologne isnt to light it just need reapplication every so often</li>
            <li> The amount you get for the price is fantastic, and he likes it too</li>
            <li> it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li> Right choice, I love it</li>
            <li> If the scent would last, it would be a great clean scent.  </li>
            <li> so I tried it on and at first I thought it was ok</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been wearing this for the past 6 years and he nor I can&#x27;t get over how awesome it smells.</li>
            <li> , i recommended this product is because is like an original perfume for lower price..</li>
            <li> I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li> The scent is very good, but does not last much longer.</li>
            <li> it smells like a clean soap and get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, its clean.  </li>
            <li> Spirits of the middle class to be said sootvetsvstvy with a price we can say that good and made in Germany</li>
            <li> It smells nice and if you like soft smell, go for it.</li>
            <li> Good Scent like the different scents from Yacht Man...</li>
            <li> Good basic all purpose scent.</li>
            <li> yachtman has a few good ones love this one</li>
            <li> That is outstanding service on amazon&#x27;s part (and the only reason it got more than 1 star).</li>
            <li> Fragrance goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> but the yacht man blue smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it really smells great, last a decent while and is familiar but not.  </li>
            <li> try all of the yacht clubs they are dirt cheap and all smell great to me at least.</li>
            <li> I knew this was a cheap scent and didn&#x27;t expect much when i got it.</li>
            <li> I really just needed some filler to get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Worth its price.</li>
            <li> you get your money worth with this product all pro&#x27;s no cons.</li>
            <li> Pretty suitable for young men.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance for a low price will buy this again.</li>
            <li> pretty mild and pleasing.</li>
            <li> Price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl</li>
            <li> Came slightly damaged at the top so doesn&#x27;t close securely and doesn&#x27;t seem to be a  full bottle either.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, I tend to wear this when I want to smell good but not seem like I am trying to hard.</li>
            <li> the initial reaction will be that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> [and this is not exaggerated].</li>
            <li> yacht man red is better</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed the scent on me, it smelled like peppermint.</li>
            <li> It was delivered so fast too!</li>
            <li> will buy something more lasting that doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li> but EVERYONE especially me was highly satisfied with it</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> even when i get cologne i fall in love with i still have a few people that tell me its too strong or it</li>
            <li> not bad for the price its strong when applying then mild&#x27;s down later on, but very clean, like after the shower</li>
            <li> This is a nice smell, but the perfume is extremely impermanent.</li>
            <li> It is a light, fresh masculine scent that is reminiscent of sprays like Axe but a little more mature, and it doesn&#x27;t have the underlying alcohol smell that seems to characterize many cheap colognes.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an absolute steal at the current price another reason I ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I purchased the other two bottles in the set.  </li>
            <li> It is a little light for some people but it is really fit into my style.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> This was not the smell I expected, I really love the chocolate and gray smell</li>
            <li> Really like it...</li>
            <li> like the cologne, but a person has to be very close to smell it.</li>
            <li> but the fragance is very hurt, like the Swiss Camps, Acceptable quality.</li>
            <li> The scent does smell like an inexpensive scent, very outdoorsy smell, a lot of pine scent to us.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and swift.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s a  lovely fragrance and last a fairly considerable period on  you</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people dinging this for not smelling as strong or as long as others, and thats probably why I like it.  </li>
            <li> so I will be getting him more Metal and probably some of the other fragrances in the line when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for the \\&quot;young adult\\&quot; male.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very similar to cool water.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bro, he had in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li> Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li> If you want a very very faint fragrance than this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I have the entire YachtMan collection and this out of the 7 is 2nd from the bottom, I find it has top notes of talc and linen and then after after the burdown I get middle notes of powder and a clean scent.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive cologne, doesn&#x27;t las all that long, but at this price you can afford to use it a few times a day!</li>
            <li> you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  </li>
            <li> Why pay $50 plus dollars for the ones at the department stores when this is just as high quality.  </li>
            <li> The selection for this product is vast and it was worth every cent.</li>
            <li> this is lightly fragrant and seems like it should be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and subtle and has a convenient non-breakable package.</li>
            <li> The fragrance, although I realize it is cheap, does not last longer that ten minutes</li>
            <li> Seems like more time was spent on advertising than the actual fragrance.</li>
            <li> Normal and cheap serve for everyday.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  </li>
            <li> I just got this colonge an all I can say wow</li>
            <li> However, he said don&#x27;t remember it being so soft and when I tried it</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last for a hour if that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this direct from Amazon</li>
            <li> and I can smell it from far away</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Probably</li>
            <li> Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast.</li>
            <li> females love it as it subtly goes away</li>
            <li> Now it was cheap at like 8.00 or less and product of German.</li>
            <li> like spraying on water, fragrance only lasts for a very short time, not even worth the low price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> , I thought the same; soft.</li>
            <li> Never expected any miracle</li>
            <li> but I think that I would have to empty the whole bottle onto myself for you to know I was wearing something.  </li>
            <li> I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who&#x27;s exp dates are approaching.</li>
            <li> I find it similar to the nautica blue, but less strong and less long lasting.  </li>
            <li> However I would/will do future orders, not totally un-happy just feel it sat on shelf for to long...</li>
            <li> and it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just like for people standing right up near me to smell the scent and not some random BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle and packaging were actually larger than i had expected when i ordered it, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This time the fragrance does not smell the same as previous purchase of same product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it and several other Yacht Man cologne fragrances.</li>
            <li> the yacht blue is wayyyyyyy better but its not that bad</li>
            <li> I always recommend yachtman red for those who like oriental fruity spice, or black for those who like the tobacco leather notes.</li>
            <li> It lasts probably 3 hours on him, which isn&#x27;t too bad but could be better.</li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need people 10&#x27; behind me to have to put something over their face to keep from gagging, and I don&#x27;t really need a cologne that lasts 57 hours.  </li>
            <li> It definitely rivals expensively purchase high end colognes.</li>
            <li> Use to mix with other one</li>
            <li> It looks sharp and shiny.</li>
            <li> To summarize: The scent isn&#x27;t bad, but i can&#x27;t really tell how it is or anything like that, but the cheap manufacturing of the item has rendered it useless</li>
            <li> It would barely spray out and just come out as a weak stream.</li>
            <li> The silage is a bit weak as the scent is gone in 3 hours and also not a big projection of scent.</li>
            <li> 4 Stars, because was wait a little time.</li>
            <li> If not, don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Maybe the other person who reviewed had bad body chemistry but short and simple</li>
            <li> Although I paid very less to get this product</li>
            <li> Not sure what I am gonna do with it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too subtle.</li>
            <li> Just not a good smell.</li>
            <li> I had read that it was not good</li>
            <li> I have never had that happen with any other fragrance, very weird.  </li>
            <li> It is very subtle and evaporates in seconds.</li>
            <li> Very weak colgne.</li>
            <li> the name is a little well stupid...</li>
            <li> u won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> And sorry to say</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am not a peppermint type of person.</li>
            <li> it was 5.45,,,now its expensive</li>
            <li> This is too faint of a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but this is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> stinks</li>
            <li> Too bad, because I got two of these, and I now can&#x27;t return them.</li>
            <li> Bad smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a used bottle and that too a badly scratched one.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, I picked up the box</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> This one is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> :&#x27;(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it. pretty mild and pleasing. Worth its price.</li>
            <li> I have not used this personally.  I bought it on sale and gifted it to a friend of mine. He apparently liked it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is good value for the money, attractive package. The fragrance is better than the run of the mill</li>
            <li> It ok for price ..very strong scent</li>
            <li> Love is will buy it agine.</li>
            <li> i bought this cologne as a gift and found it to smell like a mixture of tea &amp; beer. thank God i tested it before i gave it. but the yacht man blue smells pretty good. it&#x27;s very similar to cool water.</li>
            <li> Right choice, I love it</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really good.  It definitely rivals expensively purchase high end colognes. I liked it so much that I purchased the other two bottles in the set.  Strongly recommended for the \\&quot;young adult\\&quot; male.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> Spirits of the middle class to be said sootvetsvstvy with a price we can say that good and made in Germany</li>
            <li> Very light spray&lt;br /&gt;Smell nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Btw&lt;br /&gt;Love the fancy bottle</li>
            <li> I like this cologne, but it&#x27;s too light.  I&#x27;ve tried Yacht Man Red, Yacht Man Blue, and Yacht Men Metal, and this one is my least-favorite of the three.  Yacht Man Red is my favorite and is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent... it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  I would skip on the Yacht Man Metal.  FAVORITE: [[ASIN:B0019RO78E Yacht Man Red by Myrurgia Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.40 Ounce]]  SECOND-FAVORITE: [[ASIN:B001B0X05U Yacht Man Blue By Puig Eau-de-toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce]]  PASS: [[ASIN:B001RVMQX0 Yacht Man Metal by Myrurgia Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 3.40-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I have the entire YachtMan collection and this out of the 7 is 2nd from the bottom, I find it has top notes of talc and linen and then after after the burdown I get middle notes of powder and a clean scent. The silage is a bit weak as the scent is gone in 3 hours and also not a big projection of scent. I always recommend yachtman red for those who like oriental fruity spice, or black for those who like the tobacco leather notes.</li>
            <li> I just got this for my dad and he thinks its ok but mom didn&#x27;t like it so I tried it on and at first I thought it was ok but now as I&#x27;m typing about an hour after application to my wrists I&#x27;m now ordering another 2 bottles that&#x27;s how much I like it. If you do get it give it a chance the initial reaction will be that it&#x27;s ok but once it gets situated on your skin the scent gets a lot better. I think it&#x27;s an absolute steal at the current price another reason I ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> Came slightly damaged at the top so doesn&#x27;t close securely and doesn&#x27;t seem to be a  full bottle either. However it&#x27;s a  lovely fragrance and last a fairly considerable period on  you</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe the other person who reviewed had bad body chemistry but short and simple this is lightly fragrant and seems like it should be a lot more expensive. females love it as it subtly goes away it smells like a clean soap and get compliments all the time. try all of the yacht clubs they are dirt cheap and all smell great to me at least.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smell, but the perfume is extremely impermanent. It is very subtle and evaporates in seconds. Too bad, because I got two of these, and I now can&#x27;t return them. Not sure what I am gonna do with it. Bummer.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent perfume its scent is very nice and durable, I liked the aroma s truly excellent. Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl loves this perfume. My buddies told me that was the perfume were looking for.</li>
            <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I was timely and just what I purchased</li>
            <li> This was not the smell I expected, I really love the chocolate and gray smell so I ordered this product again with the gray model and what I received was another model.</li>
            <li> Really like it... Use to mix with other one</li>
            <li> I just got this colonge an all I can say wow this smells great, I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews, because the people that wrote a good review for this was right on the money. To those that don&#x27;t have this u need to get it u won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is wonderful for a Man, so many men&#x27;s colognes nowadays seem like they belong on a woman. Thank you Amazon for your amazing selection and pricing.</li>
            <li> this is a great masculine scent.it smells better in the night to me more than during the day. my brother loved it.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive cologne, doesn&#x27;t las all that long, but at this price you can afford to use it a few times a day!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bro, he had in the past and liked it. However, he said don&#x27;t remember it being so soft and when I tried it, I thought the same; soft. The scent doesn&#x27;t last for a hour if that much. Never expected any miracle but this is a bit disappointing. It smells nice and if you like soft smell, go for it. If not, don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> This time the fragrance does not smell the same as previous purchase of same product.  I will not likely purchase this product anymore</li>
            <li> Smells great. Bought it for Christmas for my bf last year. Now ex :&#x27;( but I still love the smell</li>
            <li> Normal and cheap serve for everyday. Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li> I am happy with way shipped package secure and easy to open. I just wasnt quite the smell I was looking for the bottle said 2004. And sorry to say but it smell like kind of furminted. Now it was cheap at like 8.00 or less and product of German. However I would/will do future orders, not totally un-happy just feel it sat on shelf for to long...Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Todd</li>
            <li> Smells nice and subtle and has a convenient non-breakable package. I initially wanted to give it as a gift but decided to keep it</li>
            <li> Hi good afternoon. I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase. Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li> Just not a good smell. In fact, the smell will annoy you more than anyone else. Bad smelling fragrance. bad</li>
            <li> this for my husband he was running out so I thought I&#x27;ll try this for him the scent is okay and he seem to like it</li>
            <li> Great!!! like it  a lot!</li>
            <li> buy one for my dad and one for me. The scent is very good, but does not last much longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cologne for the price, can&#x27;t beat it, great gift for family and friend when your on a budget, bottle looks high end as well as the box...</li>
            <li> The fragrance, although I realize it is cheap, does not last longer that ten minutes [and this is not exaggerated]. It smells pretty good but you almost have to carry it along with you.</li>
            <li> Great gift for business person.</li>
            <li> yacht man red is better</li>
            <li> Good product and service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all.</li>
            <li> The smell of it is great but it does not have any scent after a minute.  I&#x27;m not kidding, a minute later there was no scent. I sprayed it both on skin, and clothing, and there was no scent.  I have never had that happen with any other fragrance, very weird.  If the scent would last, it would be a great clean scent.  F.Y.I. I bought this direct from Amazon</li>
            <li> it only stay on you for 5 mins,Is different from the ones sold in shops.i anti gonna buy this product online</li>
            <li> smell good not too strong which is very good..</li>
            <li> Another great frangrance.</li>
            <li> smells good and price is great..love my husband with this smell.....yachtman has a few good ones love this one the best....wish bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> this is very good you get your money worth with this product all pro&#x27;s no cons. I will recommend this to every body.</li>
            <li> like spraying on water, fragrance only lasts for a very short time, not even worth the low price</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fragrance smell good</li>
            <li> He loved it and so do I.  It has a wonderful smell, very manly.  I am so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he LOVES it. Its light and very manly but not overpowering which makes it perfect for him to use when he goes to work.  I definitely recommend Metal out of all of the Yacht Man collection!!!</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell, but after a couple hours the scent disappears. It is a bit too subtle. Got it so I am going to wear it, but will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed the scent on me, it smelled like peppermint. Needless to say I am not a peppermint type of person. I sold the scent to a coworker and he loves it. So it depends on your taste.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the price! Looks great, aroma is tops; dry &amp; sophisticated, but not &amp;#34;loud!&amp;#34; What more could I ask for???</li>
            <li> Very pleased with delivery of product</li>
            <li> like the cologne, but a person has to be very close to smell it.</li>
            <li> Smills Awsome. I am disappointed, I picked up the box and I can smell it from far away, I was happy but when I open it the cologne was all over the carton and inside the package. Just imagine if that happen when I was traveling overseas. Amazon did give me a refund but it could have been a disaster. Package your products safely or don&#x27;t offer it for sale.</li>
            <li> This scent is so nice that I like it on my husband all the time! Price is great and it arrived prompt too.</li>
            <li> Good Scent like the different scents from Yacht Man...Try it</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome! Pretty suitable for young men. It is a little light for some people but it is really fit into my style.</li>
            <li> 4 Stars, because was wait a little time. but the fragance is very hurt, like the Swiss Camps, Acceptable quality.</li>
            <li> The scent doesnt smell that great and it doesnt last long the yacht blue is wayyyyyyy better but its not that bad</li>
            <li> GREAT SMELL! GREAT BOTTLE &amp; LOOK! It was delivered so fast too! I think every man should own this bottle. I bought it for my close friend (a male) and I also bought my son a bottle. It is a fantasic smell. &amp;#34;5 STARS&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> Although I paid very less to get this product but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a used bottle and that too a badly scratched one. I guess, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent - not overpowering.  Why pay $50 plus dollars for the ones at the department stores when this is just as high quality.  Puig has been around for many years and has always made great fragrances.</li>
            <li> Precio incre&amp;iacute;ble, aroma espectacular. Nadie creer&amp;aacute; que la compr&amp;eacute; por menos de 4 USD en oferta. De hecho se realizaron m&amp;aacute;s pedidos.</li>
            <li> I have both Yacht Man Blue and Yacht Man Red and is the mildest of the three. Not a bad smell, I tend to wear this when I want to smell good but not seem like I am trying to hard.</li>
            <li> This colone smells good for the price, i would recommend it to anyone not trying to break the bank for colone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg</li>
            <li> I love the scent. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because only after a couple days it stopped spraying correctly. It would barely spray out and just come out as a weak stream.</li>
            <li> masssss buenaaaaaa...</li>
            <li> If i ever loose/run out of my good cologne , I use this. stays on for about 2 hours. Has a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scent i guess.</li>
            <li> This sent was not like I envisioned it to be because of the fancy name and bottle. Seems like more time was spent on advertising than the actual fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the Yatch Man Red together and they are both excellent. Didn&#x27;t know about this brand before but I must say they have proven to be a competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this as part of your collection.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been wearing this for the past 6 years and he nor I can&#x27;t get over how awesome it smells. Love it</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Wine sealed well packaged. Good price and arrived at the deadline.</li>
            <li> i ordered this item through amazon, if nothing else, to get the free shipping. I knew this was a cheap scent and didn&#x27;t expect much when i got it. The product shipped the same day i ordered it, and it arrived 2 days later. That is outstanding service on amazon&#x27;s part (and the only reason it got more than 1 star). The bottle and packaging were actually larger than i had expected when i ordered it, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. When it arrived, obviously i wanted to try it out and see how it smelled. The spray nozzle didn&#x27;t work, so i kept spraying, thinking it would start to work after awhile. it didn&#x27;t. i tried removing the cap, cleaning it, twisting it, everything, and the product just doesn&#x27;t work. Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns of hazardous materials (which this is considered), and even so it&#x27;s almost not even worth the effort to save the $6. To summarize: The scent isn&#x27;t bad, but i can&#x27;t really tell how it is or anything like that, but the cheap manufacturing of the item has rendered it useless: What good is a cologne you can&#x27;t wear?</li>
            <li> For the price, I have no complaints. It doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Probably will buy something more lasting that doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Good price and elegant bottle. Love it. Has a similar scent to polo red.</li>
            <li> Good basic all purpose scent.</li>
            <li> I like this product... nice fragrance for a low price will buy this again. I would recommend this to anyone..</li>
            <li> severely affecting my health&lt;br /&gt;Please contact the provider&lt;br /&gt;ASK&lt;br /&gt;at this moment that product I&lt;br /&gt;produced&lt;br /&gt;fever, shortness of breath&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I really just needed some filler to get the free shipping.  Never heard of this and the name is a little well stupid...but it really smells great, last a decent while and is familiar but not.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality, the seller makes shipments fast and efficiently, This recommended sell good quality products and work in the fresh QUICK, good price and excellent quality</li>
            <li> I bought it for fathers day..it was 5.45,,,now its expensive</li>
            <li> I remember buying this for my husband at a mall kiosk years ago and then one year I found it on-line for under 10 bucks, winner!</li>
            <li> Purchased for easter basket gift for teen son. The scent does smell like an inexpensive scent, very outdoorsy smell, a lot of pine scent to us.</li>
            <li> Fragrance goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who&#x27;s exp dates are approaching. Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast. There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.</li>
            <li> this product content a excellent fragrance and the price is like a candy, i recommended this product is because is like an original perfume for lower price..</li>
            <li> Smells great! My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price its strong when applying then mild&#x27;s down later on, but very clean, like after the shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift hope that smells good as well....I am happy to see the size and packages being delivered. thanks</li>
            <li> The selection for this product is vast and it was worth every cent. I really like this product. I would love to see more from this maker. I would buy more when they supply them.</li>
            <li> excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor</li>
            <li> Very good price excellent product</li>
            <li> This is too faint of a fragrance.  This is a nice fragrance but I think that I would have to empty the whole bottle onto myself for you to know I was wearing something.  The price is good.  If you want a very very faint fragrance than this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> even when i get cologne i fall in love with i still have a few people that tell me its too strong or it stinks and i know my cologne. this cologne isnt to light it just need reapplication every so often but EVERYONE especially me was highly satisfied with it even girls were wearing it. Thaks YACHT MAN</li>
            <li> I ordered this  and was so excited about getting it. When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people dinging this for not smelling as strong or as long as others, and thats probably why I like it.  I don&#x27;t need people 10&#x27; behind me to have to put something over their face to keep from gagging, and I don&#x27;t really need a cologne that lasts 57 hours.  I&#x27;d just like for people standing right up near me to smell the scent and not some random BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works for that purpose, I can reapply it once or twice if I want it to last longer, and I don&#x27;t reek like there was an explosion at an eau-de-toilette factory.  I like the scent, its clean.  I find it similar to the nautica blue, but less strong and less long lasting.  Price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> excellent product was everything I expected good perfumes they recommend and high quality and durability, buy with confidence that they liked much</li>
            <li> Very weak colgne. I had read that it was not good and I should have believed what I read. You literally can&#x27;t smell it when you walk out of the bathroom. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne on sale for $3 for my boyfriend, and it smells wonderful on him! It isn&#x27;t too strong and stays close to his skin, so you can smell it when he&#x27;s close but it doesn&#x27;t knock you out as soon as he walks into a room. It is a light, fresh masculine scent that is reminiscent of sprays like Axe but a little more mature, and it doesn&#x27;t have the underlying alcohol smell that seems to characterize many cheap colognes. He smells so good and clean when he wears it and it just makes me want to cuddle up to him all the time. It lasts probably 3 hours on him, which isn&#x27;t too bad but could be better. The amount you get for the price is fantastic, and he likes it too so I will be getting him more Metal and probably some of the other fragrances in the line when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and swift. It looks sharp and shiny. Dont be fooled. This one is absolutely worthless. No smell at all after 2-3 uses. Might as well spray some water on your garments.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I only use this cologne to finish it. I purchased it and several other Yacht Man cologne fragrances. Truly disappointed with this cologne. The scent does not last. you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
