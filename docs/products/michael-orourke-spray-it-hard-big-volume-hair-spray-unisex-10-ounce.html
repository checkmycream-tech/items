            <li>Holds my hair perfectly in place and such cute bottle!!</li>
            <li>But as far as hairspray goes...its the best.</li>
            <li>Rock your hair products are definitely in a league of their own &lt;3</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most fabulous packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen and the product works MAGIC!</li>
            <li>Tried them and love them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS,</li>
            <li>** Love it</li>
            <li>That said, it seems to work okay, but it leaves flakes if you brush it out and start over.</li>
            <li>It is a solid product and my style held perfectly throughout the night of dinner and dancing!  </li>
            <li>Could add a bit more shine though.</li>
            <li>this is a fabulous hairspray!  </li>
            <li>Looks cute on my dresser.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have the most delicious smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with more inexpensive products.</li>
            <li>Michael ORourke was at a fair where I live and had all of his products there for $5/bottle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and is sure to get the results you want.</li>
            <li>i love that the spray is more of a mist than a direct spray which keeps you from getting way to much in one spot.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend if you are looking for a natural hairspray, this is more like a freeze spray</li>
            <li>but this does a pretty good job, beware that if you spray too much, you&#x27;ll get a bit of tiny &amp;#34;specks&amp;#34; on your hair.</li>
            <li>This hairsrpray works very well!</li>
            <li>But, the can is pretty...</li>
            <li>Fix your hair first thing in the morning,</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and can be used for a male or female.</li>
            <li>Love the hot pink packaging.</li>
            <li>Really holds ypur style in place and creates vlume.</li>
            <li>I love the pink</li>
            <li>This is a hairspray I just can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this spray because I use a couple other products of Michael O&#x27;Rourke and love them, but I have to go back to my old reliable Matrix brand.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too sticky or hard but has very nice, long lasting hold.</li>
            <li>Not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>Natural hold.</li>
            <li>but, it barely works.</li>
            <li>i have short hair (a little longer on top than a pixie cut) which becomes unruly in humidity, but this keeps it at bay without weighing it down.</li>

            <li> This is a stiff, but not heavy hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product in both humid and dry weather</li>
            <li> Being pink with rhinestone in the shape of a heart on can, makes this hairspray anything but unisex, as was labeled in the description.</li>
            <li> Its not really one that lets the hair move.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair and this hairspray doesn&#x27;t hold a curl or teasing.</li>
            <li> Spray It Hard hair spray holds really well all day with no build-up and doesn&#x27;t make the hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I expected this to have the holding power of all the other Michael O&#x27;Rourke products, but it pales in comparison.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not really good for natural styles.</li>
            <li> I did find this for half the price at Nordstrom Rack though.</li>
            <li> That may not matter to you, but as a guy, I&#x27;m a little embarrassed to leave it in a visible location if friends are coming over.</li>
            <li> I bought a few.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
            <li> Holds the style well without being stiff and unnatural.</li>
            <li> not that you should breathe in any hairspray, but i usually leave the room to breathe and one day i inhaled it and coughed all day.</li>
            <li> I have gone through hundreds of hair sprays in the past</li>
            <li> It holds rock hard all day too.</li>
            <li> It words like a hard spray and holds like a hard spray</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell bad</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> This is my new favorite hairspray. Michael ORourke was at a fair where I live and had all of his products there for $5/bottle. I bought a few. Tried them and love them. Very happy to find them on Amazon. This is a stiff, but not heavy hairspray.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS, FEELS AND HOLDS... IT&#x27;S AWESOME! It&#x27;s the most fabulous packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen and the product works MAGIC!</li>
            <li> Spray It Hard hair spray holds really well all day with no build-up and doesn&#x27;t make the hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling  and holding hairspray I have come across* I do hair ... so I go through alot of hair sprays** Love it****  you can also  get this at walmart  for 14.00</li>
            <li> Being pink with rhinestone in the shape of a heart on can, makes this hairspray anything but unisex, as was labeled in the description. That may not matter to you, but as a guy, I&#x27;m a little embarrassed to leave it in a visible location if friends are coming over. That said, it seems to work okay, but it leaves flakes if you brush it out and start over. I prefer the &amp;#34;Spray and Play Hard&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Spray and Play Harder&amp;#34; hairsprays over this one.</li>
            <li> I used this hair spray in order to keep a specific style in place. It is a solid product and my style held perfectly throughout the night of dinner and dancing!  I would highly recommend this product and is sure to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> Holds the style well without being stiff and unnatural.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray! It doesn&#x27;t get too sticky or hard but has very nice, long lasting hold. The smell is pleasant and can be used for a male or female.</li>
            <li> This is a hairspray I just can&#x27;t live without! It has amazing but flexible hold! It brings my straight limp hair back to life! Not to mention the Beautiful Packaging !</li>
            <li> Best hair spray ive ever used!! Holds my hair perfectly in place and such cute bottle!! I do not recommend if you are looking for a natural hairspray, this is more like a freeze spray</li>
            <li> This hairsrpray works very well! Really holds ypur style in place and creates vlume. Could add a bit more shine though.</li>
            <li> this is a fabulous hairspray!  It dries in seconds and it smells amazing! It holds rock hard all day too. Not really good for natural styles. Its not really one that lets the hair move. It stays frozen in place. But thats what hairspray is supposed to do. Yes it feels stiff...its hairspray. No it dosent hold up when you get rained on...its not a miracle. But as far as hairspray goes...its the best. And Im from Jersey. I know my hairspray.</li>
            <li> Natural hold. Not stiff or sticky. A little goes a long way. No need to spray a ton. Love the hot pink packaging. Looks cute on my dresser.</li>
            <li> I have bought countless brands and some don&#x27;t even hold my hair but this does a pretty good job, beware that if you spray too much, you&#x27;ll get a bit of tiny &amp;#34;specks&amp;#34; on your hair. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Instantly freezes your hair! Does not leave white residue if you touch/ move your hair after styling. Best hold in hair spray I&#x27;ve ever had. I did find this for half the price at Nordstrom Rack though.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I expected this to have the holding power of all the other Michael O&#x27;Rourke products, but it pales in comparison. I have tried this product in both humid and dry weather and it just doesn&#x27;t hold my curly hair.  I thought I would try this spray because I use a couple other products of Michael O&#x27;Rourke and love them, but I have to go back to my old reliable Matrix brand.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is great.  It words like a hard spray and holds like a hard spray but it isn&#x27;t heavy.  I love the pink can...really cute!</li>
            <li> i saw this on a blog and decided to try it. i have short hair (a little longer on top than a pixie cut) which becomes unruly in humidity, but this keeps it at bay without weighing it down. i love that the spray is more of a mist than a direct spray which keeps you from getting way to much in one spot. the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s noxious to breathe in. not that you should breathe in any hairspray, but i usually leave the room to breathe and one day i inhaled it and coughed all day. don&#x27;t inhale it, and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you to the creator of rock your hair hairspray! Not only does it have the most delicious smell but it gives your hair shine and the perfect amount of hold! I have gone through hundreds of hair sprays in the past but I can promise you this is THE only one to use! Rock your hair products are definitely in a league of their own &lt;3</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell bad but, it barely works. I&#x27;ve had better results with more inexpensive products. But, the can is pretty...</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair and this hairspray doesn&#x27;t hold a curl or teasing. It does not give it volume or shine like it claims to do. It does feel flexible.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray a person could ever ask for.  Fix your hair first thing in the morning, spray well and your hair looks the same all day long. AWESOME</li>
