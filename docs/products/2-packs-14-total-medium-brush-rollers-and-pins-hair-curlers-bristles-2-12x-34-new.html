            <li> Great. They are just like the kind I used to buy back in the old days. They served the purpose perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers for my girlfriend and they are the worst rollers she has ever had she put them in her hair and then the hair would not come loose from them and by the time she had gotten them out she had a lot of her hair torn out. These are so bad someone should sue whoever makes and sells these.</li>
            <li> The variety of sizes is particularly useful.  Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These hair  rollers are my favorite. I&#x27;ve used this type for about fifty years and always happy to find replacements. This order was filled and sent to me quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for replacing the ones that someone else already owned and couldn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> These rollers should not be called &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;. They were very small - too small for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find these old-fashioned brush rollers.  They work best for me, and are very difficult to locate..</li>
            <li> the curlers were a little smaller than expected...but will be able to use them...thanks</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my short hair, and you can dry them qjuickly with a hand-held dryer - I aim it through the &amp;#34;tunnels&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s drying from the inside as well as the outside.  this takes just a few minutes while I&#x27;m watching the morning news.  Sometimes, I use them on dry hair  just using a finishing foam.  This perks the curls up again when I&#x27;m going out in the evening.  (My hair is baby fine and has very little body.) I use two sizes;  medium for most, and a few larger ones for the back where I don&#x27;t want so much curl.</li>
            <li> These are the old fashioned curlers I used as a teenager.  The brushes are a little longer than other colored curlers, so hold my hair in better.  My hair won&#x27;t go around a curler and stay until I dry it, so I have the use the brush curlers.  I really do like these so much better.</li>
            <li> I tried every store and beauty supply in town and could not find the plain old brush rollers which are, by the way, the only kind that will stay in my thin, fine hair.  I had spent money on several others folks had told me would work, but no such luck.  They may be old-fashioned by some folks&#x27; standards, but they work for me.</li>
            <li> These are like the ones I used when I was a young girl. My head must have gotten soft cause I did not remember them being so uncomfortable</li>
            <li> brushes are too stiff. they hurt.</li>
            <li> We should have noted other reviews! The bristles fall out of the rollers. We are unable to use this product.</li>
            <li> they said medium size and they are too small.I got them for my mom and she was not happy with them at all</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> Was looking for a small brush roller thought these were the smallest,I do think there is a smaller size,haven&#x27;t found any.Arrived on time,works well.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness!  I have searched all over looking for these rollers and they are here on amazon...little pricey but I am completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they would be</li>
            <li> Work just as well as they did when I used them in high school. Picks are flimsy.</li>
            <li> My mom loves these.  They are so hard to find!!</li>
