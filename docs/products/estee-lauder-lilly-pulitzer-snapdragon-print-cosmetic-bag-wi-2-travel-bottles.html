            <li>Love the bright colors</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a makeup bag that was nice sized and</li>
            <li>The case is nice quality, better than the photo.</li>
            <li>The quality is nice and the colors are just to cute</li>
            <li>This is such a great makeup bag!</li>
            <li>I love the printed bottles.</li>
            <li>but now I am so glad that I went for it.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>I love Lilly Pulitzer designs</li>
            <li>Very pretty design, great size, exactly what I wanted for my purse!</li>
            <li>And such a good price!</li>
            <li>the inside of these are lined for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I received this order very quickly considering it was around the holidays.</li>
            <li>the design is pretty and the two matching bottles are just what she was looking for to put her regular shampoo and conditioner in,This is great for traveling and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>The plastic looks like the kind that could shatter; they are too pretty and unique to drop and see.</li>
            <li>The little containers inside are perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li>Super cute and worth every cent!</li>
            <li>For only $7 I think it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>I only thing that would have been better is a lighter weight for the bottles and more flexible.</li>
            <li>I love the vibrant colors and</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>it can easily fit into one of my large purses...</li>
            <li>Although this obviously isn&#x27;t the real product, it is still a good quality replica.</li>
            <li>I can never find make up bags that are the right size, but this one does the trick.</li>
            <li>It came right on time</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little too big for my gym bag, but it is perfect size!</li>
            <li>I use this as a pencil case for school and it is great and holds a lot of stuff, i dont really know what to do with the little bottles but their pretty</li>
            <li>This was my first makeup bag</li>
            <li>A lot of people I know are getting ready for spring break and going on Vacation ,</li>
            <li>And the little travel bottles will definitely come in handy for shampoo/lotion/etc!</li>
            <li>When I received this item it was smaller than expected, but the person I gave it to as a present loved it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty cosmetic bag, with a thoughtful design, including two small bottles for liquids, attach to outside of bag.  </li>
            <li>This is such a cute little make-up bag.</li>
            <li>Although, the reusable bottles felt like good hard plastic that would last through multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Upon actually receiving this product the bag had a burlap feeling to it which I personally didn&#x27;t like very much.</li>
            <li>Great small size and big enough for all my small size travel products: 2 bottles for shampoo conditioner, mini face wash bottle, mini bodysoap bottle, razor, toothbrush and toothpaste</li>
            <li>They barely held 3 oz.</li>
