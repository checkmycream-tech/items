            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own ideal, I suppose, but a guy can dream...  </li>
            <li>Good size for travelling.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>When it worked, this compact trimmer did a good job.  </li>
            <li>I Looked Everywhere Online for a Nose Hair Trimmer with Good Reviews at a Good Price.  </li>
            <li>Knowing these two things should give you a good experience with this tool.</li>
            <li>It also works good on you eyebrows and ears.</li>
            <li>and it worked exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m Very Glad</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, cuts great, works on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Great price from Amazon, I ordered a pair to have a backup, so shipping was free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries here and there, but not so often that it seems like they drain quickly - honestly,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s performed nicely during that time.</li>
            <li>But it is not quite as effective and also it bites (pulls) periodically, but does the job.</li>
            <li>complaining to the battery company for this kind of problem.</li>
            <li>That kind of drives me nuts.</li>
            <li>These do an excellent, gentle removal of hairs.</li>
            <li>It cuts the hairs and it nice and compact.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a flimsy plastic trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have any good qualities aside from the cheap price tag.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to bother with returning the old one; excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>This one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li>Bottom Line is That This is a Great, Well Made, Powerful and Inexpensive Trimmer for the Money.</li>
            <li>This is the best nose hair trimmer on the market by far.</li>
            <li>In addition, the non-replaceable blade is designed to wear out after about two years of use.&lt;br /&gt;There must be better products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this one as well.</li>
            <li>I probably should buy a couple more</li>
            <li>and I have owned many.  </li>
            <li>Was so pleased to find a replacement on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>much better than the others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I like this model much better than any of the newer ones.  </li>
            <li>What is the perfect personal groomer?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this gizmo for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the practically identical ER115 version (wet/dry washable) for many years, probably around 5 or 6.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it more times than I&#x27;d like to admit, and</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ll say it:  </li>
            <li>This item is a replacement for one I have used for many years.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works much better than the one I had.</li>
            <li>Still better then the sissor method \\&quot;OUCH\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a micro touch max  made in china at walmart , It works better than any trimmer I ever had and is more versitile.</li>
            <li>I found this product just OK...</li>
            <li>Bought the Panasonic 20 dollar model and this one works way better.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better noise hair clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Vendor, quick shipping AAA+++ highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In fact, as far as I can tell, its less than perfect performance is best in its class.     </li>
            <li>I have found that the long flat-blade style trimmers (instead of the rotary trimmers like this one) work best on ear hair.</li>
            <li>I am glad these are still available because nobody builds a better one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never even had to clean it!</li>
            <li>B000063XHR Panasonic ER112BC Nose and Ear Trimmer]]  Not as good as the older model, but still works a lot better then Remington or others.  </li>
            <li>having one for over 5 years I know that &lt;br /&gt;one of the problems has to do with the contacts becoming dirty/</li>
            <li>Most trimmers break within a month and are cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li>You can always expect good quality from Panosonic even in Nose &amp; Ear Trimmers, really does the job.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best, simplest, and most reliable nose hair trimmer that I have ever used</li>
            <li>cutter head comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li>It works better when clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to pop off the top and clean.</li>
            <li>It easily cuts off nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>and I find it to work fine.</li>
            <li>The corrosion will come off and it should work fine again.</li>
            <li>I have even had fine use with a rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li>Its the best ear and nose trimmer that I have tried and was glad to find this particular one on line, as trying the local stores I couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and quick about it!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge problem for me</li>
            <li>Cheap - but works with a bit of fiddling around.  </li>
            <li>I still use this same trimmer on a weekly basis and it still does a great job.</li>
            <li>It would be waterproof, and thus easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t feel so light and cheap in my hands.  </li>
            <li>OH... and it doesn&#x27;t cut me like a cheap jobbie did that I bought before I bought this one to replace it.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap toy.</li>
            <li>It was solid and did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to the mechanical unit that I had before that didn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li>This is a good item for packing in your toiletries for a trip, being more compact than its bigger brother the ER415SC which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I doubt I would recommend this product to my friends, however, since the whole point of a trimmer is a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li>Great product, small compact and works better than most of the fancier products for sale.</li>
            <li>It Does an Overall Good Job at Trimming the Hairs and is Easy to Handle and Use.  </li>
            <li>The solution is to clean the contacts thoroghly.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; and \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; that others report is also minimized by having the blades lubricated so that they cut cleanly rather than jam.</li>
            <li>The switch doesn&#x27;t make very good contact, so you end up switching it on and off a few times to get it to start.  </li>
            <li>This one is a little more successful in the ear department, but still care must be taken.  </li>
            <li>Takes one AA battery and gets good life out of the battery, which I remove when traveling so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get switched on, which has occasionally happened.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I have gone full circle and purchased this one again.    </li>
            <li>I would that the full unit were water proof.  </li>
            <li>I have six or seven different nose trimmers that I bought on the cuff, just to see if they would work as good as this, and none compare.</li>
            <li>Even so, you can easily remove the top, rinse, and then let the top part air dry.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews state, this Panasonic ER112BC works great on nose hair.  </li>
            <li>This gizmo has worked fine and has never failed.</li>
            <li>It works very well for trimming nose hairs as it doesn&#x27;t pull them and is somewhat easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Quick learner that I am</li>
            <li>Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  </li>
            <li>It does seem pretty cheap but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item.</li>
            <li>and I was able to live with it.  </li>
            <li>Great little product.  </li>
            <li>The cutters seem cheap and don&#x27;t trim very closely.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money and would buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>I got one of these and the blades would spin for just a bit before the unit stopped even with a fresh battery.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Overall this unit is exactly worth the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>my husband was thrilled when he finally found his \\&quot;original\\&quot; trimmer.  </li>
            <li>He probably didn&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li>You spend 5 minutes trying to align each hair so that it will enter the nozzle at the right angle to cut.  </li>
            <li>But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean.</li>
            <li>trimming is not as clean as I would like, but it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a better one.&lt;BR&gt;E.L.</li>
            <li>Luckily, those ears are without a lot of danglers, thanks to Panasonic and its less-than-miracle machine.</li>
            <li>It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water.  </li>
            <li>It pulls on hairs occasionally, but it the most powerful trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I gave up using it after the first few attempts because, amazingly, it doesn&#x27;t cut hair!  </li>
            <li>He likes it very much.</li>
            <li>This Trimmer Appears to Be an Older Design by Panasonic, but Thats Not a Bad Thing in This Case.  </li>
            <li>If it did a better job actually trimming I might be willing to put up with the discomfort, but in the end</li>
            <li>Think I will wait a couple of months first.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>First one lasted about 7 yrs.</li>
            <li>The first one arrived and after inserting the battery it would not work.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I lost my first one:</li>
            <li>First off, this thing is built like a tank for what it is.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This one has never failed.  </li>
            <li>Trims well, but seems like I might be more likely to cut myself,</li>
            <li>I bought this exact model over 10 years ago and today I dropped it on the ground and it stopped working</li>
            <li>but it cuts nose hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>This works great, at least on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for at least 5 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>
            <li>As Soon as You Put the Batteries In and Turn This On for the First Time, You Know that This Has Plenty of Power to Do Its Job.  </li>
            <li>and I find it very dependable and useful.</li>
            <li>First we tried the nose, then the ears, then the arm then the twigs and berries</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Panasonic trimmer about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is very effective, long-lasting, easy to clean, uses very few batteries over its life, shaves nose hairs very cleanly (the more expensive model did not shave nearly as close to the hair root nor did it reach all areas reached by the Panasonic), does not cause injuries to skin.  </li>
            <li>certainly good enough, especially for price.</li>
            <li>and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>I put new batteries in, fiddled with it, took the top piece off and screwed back on tighter, etc.</li>
            <li>A new one was shipped right away</li>
            <li>It is compact, runs on a single AA battery, comes apart for cleaning, uses stainless steel blades, and seems safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does not cut nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  </li>
            <li>This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I oil the cutter with a drop of light oil, such as baby oil, after each use.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and the vendor was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>This one works very well and gets the job done; I recommend it.</li>
            <li>On reflection, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and does the job.  </li>
            <li>This one cuts and that&#x27;s what really counts.</li>
            <li>So much for my reputation as a boy genius.  </li>
            <li>This one has performed very admirably all these years</li>
            <li>For some reason it takes so much longer to get results.</li>
            <li>There is nothing really to rave about this.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I Was Very Nervous About Taking Another Chance on Panasonic.</li>
            <li>However I discovered that a spritz of WD40 into the cutter blades has made this tool very dependable.</li>
            <li>not work as well as one with a stainless steel outed comb but</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>But until I find a better model or decide to go native, I&#x27;m stuck with this for better or for worse.</li>
            <li>The smaller trimmer blade is the secret - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>I have purchased other trimmers in that time to see if anything newer on the market does a better job.</li>
            <li>It trims better than the other 2 or 3 trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for over a year and it still runs on it&#x27;s original batteries (only use once every 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li>DOES THE JOB BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I HAVE TRIED</li>
            <li>It nice and small uses one AA battery.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off spending an extra $5 on \\&quot;MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer\\&quot; here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>the older I get</li>
            <li>main PLUS of this product is its size.  </li>
            <li>Now his regular grooming is back to normal and he is exceptionally pleased.  </li>
            <li>It would be solidly constructed and last a good long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>The funniest thing is that by now, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d realize that you can only give a total of 5 stars for these products, when in reality I personally feel they deserve MUCH more!</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not going to lie to you: this little guy was just a liiiiiiiiiitle tricky to remove from the packaging, but then again, it made me feel safe, so am I bragging or complaining (</li>
            <li>And this little gadget works great at trimming it down.  </li>
            <li>still works great, don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive models.</li>
            <li>Spare yourself the trouble and get something better.</li>
            <li>It works well, is a small, convenient size and the price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s underpowered, so it starts up kind of slow, and you wonder if it is up to the task.  </li>
            <li>And it removes the hairs after they&#x27;re cut with a mild vacuum action.</li>
            <li>I could easily see losing a piece down the drain.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get a new one, but it wasn&#x27;t working from day one.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this new one.  </li>
            <li>it there&#x27;s not even a scratch on it, plus it works almost as well as when new.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to try something new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And use a new AA battery.  </li>
            <li>I returned it and was given a new one within a week.</li>
            <li>] I have one that I received for a gift 17 years ago and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li>But in my case it meant not buying their new hair and beard trimmer....</li>
            <li>It also got hot if I tried to run it long enough to boldly probe where no nostril has been probed before.  </li>
            <li>I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender, using every conceivable angle of attack, throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.    </li>
            <li>I think I bought my first ER112BC trimmer in 1990, and sometime around last December it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Wahl, Remington, Norelco, wet-dry models, an old fashioned mechanical do-hickey from an on-line &#x27;country&#x27; store, the el-cheapo as seen on TV (!?) model from the drug store, ...  </li>
            <li>This was my first and only trimmer</li>
            <li>Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  </li>
            <li>A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap, so if it does die, at least you won&#x27;t lose too much.</li>
            <li>My husband hasn&#x27;t had any complaints with that one so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a Panasonic product would be this defective.</li>
            <li>(naturally - it IS lodged up in your nose), but the family notices it trimmed well.</li>
            <li>It did not perform nearly as well as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>but then again, this thing IS about 6 years old and the blades have never been sharpened.  </li>
            <li>Looks like my old panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li>So Far.  </li>
            <li>complete POS</li>
            <li>my old Panasonic device worked well for years......</li>
            <li>It has pretty good power for something that uses a battery; it doesn&#x27;t slow down or require multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>Plus, this one is more expensive than many of the other trimmers.</li>
            <li>You can do better and faster with a pair of scissors, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>easy to loss,  small size....</li>
            <li>BTW, I bought another kind (flat shaver style) and the thing is too clumsy to use (cut myself twice).  </li>
            <li>In the interim, from Brookstone I purchased a more expensive trimmer that had very high consumer ratings.  </li>
            <li>These simple trimmers outperform others costing three times as much - and last forever.</li>
            <li>Works better than at least 3 types I&#x27;ve bought since I last had this type.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why two of the other reviewers had problems, this little gizmo has worked great for me for the past 5 years when I bought it at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>Mine got slower and slower, fresh batteries made little difference.</li>
            <li>This was a handy little thing until I tried to use it after only using it 3 times, and it was just totally dead.</li>
            <li>After it finally died we went to several local stores looking for the exact same one, our search was futile.  </li>
            <li>Like getting an old friend back!</li>
            <li>Just to see if this thing really could cut hair I tried to trim a piece of hair on my head and just as I expected it whipped the piece of hair around in a circular motion failing to cut it.</li>
            <li>Though the speed seems the same as my old trimmer</li>
            <li>The trimmer first developed problems with starting, where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going.  </li>
            <li>Yes, sometimes it starts up slowly before reaching full RPM.  </li>
            <li>If you found a better model or figured out a clever braiding technique to keep these blasted hairs from making an egress from their orifices, I&#x27;m all ears.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really cut very much, it&#x27;s so tickly and irritating that I find it unusable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product over any other.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s what you get when it&#x27;s so cheap, but pretty disappointing...</li>

            <li> After 10 years it&#x27;s still the best!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great for ear hair, which seems to grow faster</li>
            <li> But I have experienced troubles that were</li>

            <li> I have had this trimmer for years and it works great.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> Everyone has their own ideal, I suppose, but a guy can dream...  </li>
            <li> Good size for travelling.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> When it worked, this compact trimmer did a good job.  </li>
            <li> I Looked Everywhere Online for a Nose Hair Trimmer with Good Reviews at a Good Price.  </li>
            <li> Knowing these two things should give you a good experience with this tool.</li>
            <li> It also works good on you eyebrows and ears.</li>
            <li> and it worked exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m Very Glad</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, cuts great, works on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Great price from Amazon, I ordered a pair to have a backup, so shipping was free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries here and there, but not so often that it seems like they drain quickly - honestly,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s performed nicely during that time.</li>
            <li> But it is not quite as effective and also it bites (pulls) periodically, but does the job.</li>
            <li> complaining to the battery company for this kind of problem.</li>
            <li> That kind of drives me nuts.</li>
            <li> These do an excellent, gentle removal of hairs.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hairs and it nice and compact.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flimsy plastic trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have any good qualities aside from the cheap price tag.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to bother with returning the old one; excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> This one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line is That This is a Great, Well Made, Powerful and Inexpensive Trimmer for the Money.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer on the market by far.</li>
            <li> In addition, the non-replaceable blade is designed to wear out after about two years of use.&lt;br /&gt;There must be better products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this one as well.</li>
            <li> I probably should buy a couple more</li>
            <li> and I have owned many.  </li>
            <li> Was so pleased to find a replacement on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> much better than the others i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like this model much better than any of the newer ones.  </li>
            <li> What is the perfect personal groomer?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this gizmo for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the practically identical ER115 version (wet/dry washable) for many years, probably around 5 or 6.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it more times than I&#x27;d like to admit, and</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll say it:  </li>
            <li> This item is a replacement for one I have used for many years.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than the one I had.</li>
            <li> Still better then the sissor method \\&quot;OUCH\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a micro touch max  made in china at walmart , It works better than any trimmer I ever had and is more versitile.</li>
            <li> I found this product just OK...</li>
            <li> Bought the Panasonic 20 dollar model and this one works way better.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better noise hair clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Excellent Vendor, quick shipping AAA+++ highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In fact, as far as I can tell, its less than perfect performance is best in its class.     </li>
            <li> I have found that the long flat-blade style trimmers (instead of the rotary trimmers like this one) work best on ear hair.</li>
            <li> I am glad these are still available because nobody builds a better one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even had to clean it!</li>
            <li> B000063XHR Panasonic ER112BC Nose and Ear Trimmer]]  Not as good as the older model, but still works a lot better then Remington or others.  </li>
            <li> having one for over 5 years I know that &lt;br /&gt;one of the problems has to do with the contacts becoming dirty/</li>
            <li> Most trimmers break within a month and are cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li> You can always expect good quality from Panosonic even in Nose &amp; Ear Trimmers, really does the job.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best, simplest, and most reliable nose hair trimmer that I have ever used</li>
            <li> cutter head comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It works better when clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to pop off the top and clean.</li>
            <li> It easily cuts off nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> and I find it to work fine.</li>
            <li> The corrosion will come off and it should work fine again.</li>
            <li> I have even had fine use with a rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li> Its the best ear and nose trimmer that I have tried and was glad to find this particular one on line, as trying the local stores I couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and quick about it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge problem for me</li>
            <li> Cheap - but works with a bit of fiddling around.  </li>
            <li> I still use this same trimmer on a weekly basis and it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> It would be waterproof, and thus easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t feel so light and cheap in my hands.  </li>
            <li> OH... and it doesn&#x27;t cut me like a cheap jobbie did that I bought before I bought this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap toy.</li>
            <li> It was solid and did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to the mechanical unit that I had before that didn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> This is a good item for packing in your toiletries for a trip, being more compact than its bigger brother the ER415SC which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I doubt I would recommend this product to my friends, however, since the whole point of a trimmer is a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li> Great product, small compact and works better than most of the fancier products for sale.</li>
            <li> It Does an Overall Good Job at Trimming the Hairs and is Easy to Handle and Use.  </li>
            <li> The solution is to clean the contacts thoroghly.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; and \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; that others report is also minimized by having the blades lubricated so that they cut cleanly rather than jam.</li>
            <li> The switch doesn&#x27;t make very good contact, so you end up switching it on and off a few times to get it to start.  </li>
            <li> This one is a little more successful in the ear department, but still care must be taken.  </li>
            <li> Takes one AA battery and gets good life out of the battery, which I remove when traveling so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get switched on, which has occasionally happened.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have gone full circle and purchased this one again.    </li>
            <li> I would that the full unit were water proof.  </li>
            <li> I have six or seven different nose trimmers that I bought on the cuff, just to see if they would work as good as this, and none compare.</li>
            <li> Even so, you can easily remove the top, rinse, and then let the top part air dry.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews state, this Panasonic ER112BC works great on nose hair.  </li>
            <li> This gizmo has worked fine and has never failed.</li>
            <li> It works very well for trimming nose hairs as it doesn&#x27;t pull them and is somewhat easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Quick learner that I am</li>
            <li> Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  </li>
            <li> It does seem pretty cheap but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item.</li>
            <li> and I was able to live with it.  </li>
            <li> Great little product.  </li>
            <li> The cutters seem cheap and don&#x27;t trim very closely.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the money and would buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I got one of these and the blades would spin for just a bit before the unit stopped even with a fresh battery.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Overall this unit is exactly worth the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> my husband was thrilled when he finally found his \\&quot;original\\&quot; trimmer.  </li>
            <li> He probably didn&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> You spend 5 minutes trying to align each hair so that it will enter the nozzle at the right angle to cut.  </li>
            <li> But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean.</li>
            <li> trimming is not as clean as I would like, but it was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a better one.&lt;BR&gt;E.L.</li>
            <li> Luckily, those ears are without a lot of danglers, thanks to Panasonic and its less-than-miracle machine.</li>
            <li> It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water.  </li>
            <li> It pulls on hairs occasionally, but it the most powerful trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I gave up using it after the first few attempts because, amazingly, it doesn&#x27;t cut hair!  </li>
            <li> He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> This Trimmer Appears to Be an Older Design by Panasonic, but Thats Not a Bad Thing in This Case.  </li>
            <li> If it did a better job actually trimming I might be willing to put up with the discomfort, but in the end</li>
            <li> Think I will wait a couple of months first.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> First one lasted about 7 yrs.</li>
            <li> The first one arrived and after inserting the battery it would not work.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I lost my first one:</li>
            <li> First off, this thing is built like a tank for what it is.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This one has never failed.  </li>
            <li> Trims well, but seems like I might be more likely to cut myself,</li>
            <li> I bought this exact model over 10 years ago and today I dropped it on the ground and it stopped working</li>
            <li> but it cuts nose hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> This works great, at least on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for at least 5 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>
            <li> As Soon as You Put the Batteries In and Turn This On for the First Time, You Know that This Has Plenty of Power to Do Its Job.  </li>
            <li> and I find it very dependable and useful.</li>
            <li> First we tried the nose, then the ears, then the arm then the twigs and berries</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Panasonic trimmer about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is very effective, long-lasting, easy to clean, uses very few batteries over its life, shaves nose hairs very cleanly (the more expensive model did not shave nearly as close to the hair root nor did it reach all areas reached by the Panasonic), does not cause injuries to skin.  </li>
            <li> certainly good enough, especially for price.</li>
            <li> and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> I put new batteries in, fiddled with it, took the top piece off and screwed back on tighter, etc.</li>
            <li> A new one was shipped right away</li>
            <li> It is compact, runs on a single AA battery, comes apart for cleaning, uses stainless steel blades, and seems safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does not cut nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  </li>
            <li> This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I oil the cutter with a drop of light oil, such as baby oil, after each use.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and the vendor was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> This one works very well and gets the job done; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> On reflection, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and does the job.  </li>
            <li> This one cuts and that&#x27;s what really counts.</li>
            <li> So much for my reputation as a boy genius.  </li>
            <li> This one has performed very admirably all these years</li>
            <li> For some reason it takes so much longer to get results.</li>
            <li> There is nothing really to rave about this.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I Was Very Nervous About Taking Another Chance on Panasonic.</li>
            <li> However I discovered that a spritz of WD40 into the cutter blades has made this tool very dependable.</li>
            <li> not work as well as one with a stainless steel outed comb but</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> But until I find a better model or decide to go native, I&#x27;m stuck with this for better or for worse.</li>
            <li> The smaller trimmer blade is the secret - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers in that time to see if anything newer on the market does a better job.</li>
            <li> It trims better than the other 2 or 3 trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year and it still runs on it&#x27;s original batteries (only use once every 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I HAVE TRIED</li>
            <li> It nice and small uses one AA battery.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off spending an extra $5 on \\&quot;MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer\\&quot; here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the older I get</li>
            <li> main PLUS of this product is its size.  </li>
            <li> Now his regular grooming is back to normal and he is exceptionally pleased.  </li>
            <li> It would be solidly constructed and last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> The funniest thing is that by now, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d realize that you can only give a total of 5 stars for these products, when in reality I personally feel they deserve MUCH more!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not going to lie to you: this little guy was just a liiiiiiiiiitle tricky to remove from the packaging, but then again, it made me feel safe, so am I bragging or complaining (</li>
            <li> And this little gadget works great at trimming it down.  </li>
            <li> still works great, don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Spare yourself the trouble and get something better.</li>
            <li> It works well, is a small, convenient size and the price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s underpowered, so it starts up kind of slow, and you wonder if it is up to the task.  </li>
            <li> And it removes the hairs after they&#x27;re cut with a mild vacuum action.</li>
            <li> I could easily see losing a piece down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get a new one, but it wasn&#x27;t working from day one.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this new one.  </li>
            <li> it there&#x27;s not even a scratch on it, plus it works almost as well as when new.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to try something new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And use a new AA battery.  </li>
            <li> I returned it and was given a new one within a week.</li>
            <li> ] I have one that I received for a gift 17 years ago and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li> But in my case it meant not buying their new hair and beard trimmer....</li>
            <li> It also got hot if I tried to run it long enough to boldly probe where no nostril has been probed before.  </li>
            <li> I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender, using every conceivable angle of attack, throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.    </li>
            <li> I think I bought my first ER112BC trimmer in 1990, and sometime around last December it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Wahl, Remington, Norelco, wet-dry models, an old fashioned mechanical do-hickey from an on-line &#x27;country&#x27; store, the el-cheapo as seen on TV (!?) model from the drug store, ...  </li>
            <li> This was my first and only trimmer</li>
            <li> Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  </li>
            <li> A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap, so if it does die, at least you won&#x27;t lose too much.</li>
            <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t had any complaints with that one so far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a Panasonic product would be this defective.</li>
            <li> (naturally - it IS lodged up in your nose), but the family notices it trimmed well.</li>
            <li> It did not perform nearly as well as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> but then again, this thing IS about 6 years old and the blades have never been sharpened.  </li>
            <li> Looks like my old panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> So Far.  </li>
            <li> complete POS</li>
            <li> my old Panasonic device worked well for years......</li>
            <li> It has pretty good power for something that uses a battery; it doesn&#x27;t slow down or require multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> Plus, this one is more expensive than many of the other trimmers.</li>
            <li> You can do better and faster with a pair of scissors, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> easy to loss,  small size....</li>
            <li> BTW, I bought another kind (flat shaver style) and the thing is too clumsy to use (cut myself twice).  </li>
            <li> In the interim, from Brookstone I purchased a more expensive trimmer that had very high consumer ratings.  </li>
            <li> These simple trimmers outperform others costing three times as much - and last forever.</li>
            <li> Works better than at least 3 types I&#x27;ve bought since I last had this type.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why two of the other reviewers had problems, this little gizmo has worked great for me for the past 5 years when I bought it at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> Mine got slower and slower, fresh batteries made little difference.</li>
            <li> This was a handy little thing until I tried to use it after only using it 3 times, and it was just totally dead.</li>
            <li> After it finally died we went to several local stores looking for the exact same one, our search was futile.  </li>
            <li> Like getting an old friend back!</li>
            <li> Just to see if this thing really could cut hair I tried to trim a piece of hair on my head and just as I expected it whipped the piece of hair around in a circular motion failing to cut it.</li>
            <li> Though the speed seems the same as my old trimmer</li>
            <li> The trimmer first developed problems with starting, where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going.  </li>
            <li> Yes, sometimes it starts up slowly before reaching full RPM.  </li>
            <li> If you found a better model or figured out a clever braiding technique to keep these blasted hairs from making an egress from their orifices, I&#x27;m all ears.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really cut very much, it&#x27;s so tickly and irritating that I find it unusable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product over any other.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what you get when it&#x27;s so cheap, but pretty disappointing...</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cutting the hair but it will also cut your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Tried 2 other brands since then until I thought of shopping for my old faithful on-line.</li>
            <li> This little nose and ear trimmer really does the job and only uses a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> I dropped my previous one in the bathroom and broke and had to order a new one.</li>
            <li> Maybe the extra cost is for the long lasting durability?</li>
            <li> I would buy a few of these in case one breaks or for replacement before spending 18-20-or 30 dollars for the high price ones.</li>
            <li> I have given these as gifts to others and their comments are that this thing really works well, with very little ripping of the hairs in the nose.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 although one is enough as long as I don&#x27;t drop it or lose it.</li>
            <li> mean very very thoroughly.   </li>
            <li> Overall sound and feel is cheesy.  </li>
            <li> (Who really wants to spend their hard earned cash on yet another nose-hair trimmer?)  </li>
            <li> After discussing nose hair trimmers over a family dinner tonight (strange isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li> leaking batteries from putting the unit away for a long time</li>
            <li> I considered purchasing a couple of them in case he needs another one in the distant future!!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It finally broke down recently</li>
            <li> Single AA battery lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> You might have to push a little harder in the bend near the tip of your nose to get a close trim</li>
            <li> It would have sharp enough blades to weed-whack</li>
            <li> &quot; Let me just start by saying that if you are looking to buy this product, you better have three inch nose hairs because this little device is unable to trim my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I tried other batteries, with the same result.  </li>
            <li> The other thing people should know is that while the blades cut in a rotary direction, the only way the hairs get into the cutter is through the slots.</li>
            <li> The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes, that fail after minimal use.  </li>
            <li> This thing could not cut a single hair.  </li>
            <li> You have to go back and forth on a single spot multiple times and there are those few, ever-so-stubborn little proboscis follicles that just won&#x27;t leave without an extra going-over.  </li>
            <li> And speaking of taking care, very occasionally the little monster snags one of said nostril hairs and heaves it out, in a tweezer-like fashion.  </li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say here.</li>
            <li> I guess buy it and then remember to be careful.</li>
            <li> this is that when the metal gets wet it will eventually  &lt;</li>
            <li> But there &lt;br /&gt;is not much to do</li>
            <li> It worked to a point but not very efficiently.</li>
            <li> the replacement works as expected.    </li>
            <li> however, eventually it finally broke and a part went missing.  </li>
            <li> Performs well as expected, but I&#x27;ve never had another to compare with.</li>
            <li> And stays sharp after months of use... at least so far.  </li>
            <li> It also works for nose hair, which I guess is its main function, but I find that if the battery isn&#x27;t really fresh, it slows down a bit and can pull hard on a hair instead of cutting it(ouch-</li>
            <li> This is the basic model that I started with and I have gone through a number of others over the past 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li> I bought him a more expensive panasonic model, one with a light, and he hated it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried other nose hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> I had this model in the past but could not find it in any local store.</li>
            <li> Other?</li>
            <li> I have a beard and mustache trimmer for all other grooming</li>
            <li> sad to say this is the first Panasonic product that I have ever bought that has not lived up to the name.</li>
            <li> It goes deeper than any other and never pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> It is compact and travels well in a small toilet kit in my carry-on flight bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and depended on one of these for at least a decade before it finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all!</li>
            <li> I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available.</li>
            <li> I read some negative reviews of the Panasonic here prior to buying another and did not understand how anyone could have anything bad to say about it, especially if the user has experience with more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> I paid less than $10 for this trimmer including shipping.</li>
            <li> I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years</li>
            <li> Sadly, the ER112BC falls short of this simple little dream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the postage or trouble to return it,so it just lays in the drawer.</li>
            <li> 15 years ago I received this little trimmer as a gift.</li>
            <li> Although it rattles a little when you turn it on, it works well.</li>
            <li> I like the Panasonic ER112BC a lot, but it vibrates a little and tickles the inside of my nose during use (so 4 stars).  </li>
            <li> It worked for a few days, and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> It takes a few runs in each nostril to get everything trimmed, and it starts smelling like oiled-metal as you use it</li>
            <li> Nothing would fix it, it&#x27;s just dead.</li>
            <li> .......it was as if the blade was missing......</li>
            <li> I bought mine at least a decade ago, after a couple of other models broke or ripped me up.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is built like a TANK (if tanks were mad out of plastic), and the plastic casing is very lightweight, allowing me to reach those hard-to-get-to spots with Heavenly ease.</li>
            <li> In case this is not enough to dissuade you from making this purchase, the device also produces an unpleasant and potentially harmful ozone smell.</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t work even after buying new batteries, and the cutting head looks like it&#x27;s been smashed.</li>
            <li> It vibrates, tickles, and twirls them around, but too often fails to actually trim them off.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to, although a small flashlight helps assist trimming inside your nose.</li>
            <li> The plastic nozzle that houses the blades is held on with tiny plastic hooks, which eventually broke making my trimmer useless.</li>
            <li> , quality feel that is usually absent with [..]grooming products.  </li>
            <li> Basically you have two small blades attached to two plastic hooks.</li>
            <li> all plastic usually means garbage.)</li>
            <li> it is small, it works, it fits in your hand, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> But for a small, lightweight and packable &#x60;nose and ear&#x27; trimmer, it does the job</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time with this plastic piece of junk!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their e-mail based customer service, however, is manned by folks who carelessly send back \\&quot;canned\\&quot; responses not addressing the question.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my current one for 3 years and should something go wrong with it, will replace it with another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of this little sucker!</li>
            <li> I want something that cuts nose hair as hard as steel.</li>
            <li> It even managed to scratch the inside of my nose because I was pushing too hard to make it work.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> I find I use it at least 3-4 times a week to keep well-groomed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> at least a couple of years between changes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a lemon, but this trimmer was a total disappointment.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried nose trimmers before and were disappointed that they just didn&#x27;t trim close enough (you know the ones that look like little rocket ships)</li>
            <li> we have purchased 5 different, and some very expensive trimmers since that never matched up to this one.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though, it has some problems:  1.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the motor died after a few months.  </li>
            <li> those crazy little nose hairs with one or two passes, yet not tug on that unsightly nostril hair, causing a paroxysmal sneeze.  </li>
            <li> I have never purchased anything by Panasonic that was made this poorly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind and cuts at the tip which makes it easier to trim at any angle.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this little \\&quot;bad boy.\\</li>
            <li> He has since purchased a couple different trimmers and was very disappointed in them.  </li>
            <li> I had Bought a Newer Nose Trimmer from Panasonic which I was Very Disappointed With and Broke After Six Months of Occasional Use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone prehistoric and tried a pair of nail scissors (I won&#x27;t regale you with the gory details).</li>
            <li> It is singularly serviceable, but not too posh and certainly not perfect.  </li>
            <li> However, I have found it useless for ear hair and will have to buy another product for that.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> you have to insert and reinsert to get uncut hairs into the slots.</li>
            <li> I should add that while it fails to trim anything, the device does in fact result in sensations that cannot be called pleasurable as it pulls on your nose hairs in futility.      </li>
            <li> I was skeptical before I bought it, but am now convinced; it works.  </li>
            <li> Apart from the minor twang of pain, this gives me an oddly uncomfortable twitching sensation and leads to a paroxysmal AAAACHOOOO!!!  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, this is a very poorly made product (Made in China) with a Panasonic logo that should NOT be on this product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a plain and boring look to it</li>
            <li> crap crap crap crap.</li>
            <li> Crap crap crap crap</li>
            <li> It can get close to the hair&#x27;s base without hurting the underlying skin.</li>
            <li> I must admit that my son hated the one I bought for him.</li>
            <li> I got this for my pops, his eye sight is getting worst, so</li>
            <li> the worst product ever!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a flimsy plastic trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have any good qualities aside from the cheap price tag. You&#x27;re better off spending an extra $5 on \\&quot;MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer\\&quot; here on Amazon. My husband hasn&#x27;t had any complaints with that one so far.</li>
            <li> The family convinced me it was time to trim my nose hairs, so I purchased this Panasonic personal grooming device. It is compact, runs on a single AA battery, comes apart for cleaning, uses stainless steel blades, and seems safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does not cut nose hairs. It vibrates, tickles, and twirls them around, but too often fails to actually trim them off. In addition, the non-replaceable blade is designed to wear out after about two years of use.&lt;br /&gt;There must be better products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Note: My experience is with the ER115KC version of this product, which is a washable variation of the ER112BC product.</li>
            <li> I must admit that my son hated the one I bought for him. He probably didn&#x27;t use it right. Just inserting it into a nostril and moving it around doesn&#x27;t cut it (pun intended). Instead, turn it on and insert it about 1/4 inch into the nostril, then out, then in, etc., focusing on each area you want to trim. You can tell when its done trimming an area by the change in pitch.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cutter head comes apart easily for cleaning. I oil the cutter with a drop of light oil, such as baby oil, after each use.</li>
            <li> I have used this item a couple of times now. It works fine. If you have the jungles of Estonia sweeping out of your nostrils then go buy a weedwacker, otherwise, shell out the 8 bucks this thing costs and throw it in your dopp kit and then check it off the list. That is all.</li>
            <li> Cheap - but works with a bit of fiddling around.  Good size for travelling.    I would probably buy a more expensive model next time.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for 15 years and it finally died on me this summer. I have tried others and like this one the best. It is compact and travels well in a small toilet kit in my carry-on flight bag. I never leave home without it, ha. Does what it is supposed to, although a small flashlight helps assist trimming inside your nose. Takes one AA battery and gets good life out of the battery, which I remove when traveling so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get switched on, which has occasionally happened. Great price from Amazon, I ordered a pair to have a backup, so shipping was free.</li>
            <li> I had this type of Panasonic trimer for several years. I decided to get a new one, but it wasn&#x27;t working from day one. I got another one. It worked for a few days, and then stopped working. I was surprised that a Panasonic product would be this defective. IF it is working, it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought it for under $10, and it works - that&#x27;s a great bang for my buck.   It takes a few runs in each nostril to get everything trimmed, and it starts smelling like oiled-metal as you use it (naturally - it IS lodged up in your nose), but the family notices it trimmed well. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I think I bought my first ER112BC trimmer in 1990, and sometime around last December it stopped working.  Recently I replaced it through Amazon.  In the interim, from Brookstone I purchased a more expensive trimmer that had very high consumer ratings.  It did not perform nearly as well as the Panasonic.  I read some negative reviews of the Panasonic here prior to buying another and did not understand how anyone could have anything bad to say about it, especially if the user has experience with more expensive models.  I will never switch again, there is no need.  The Panasonic is very effective, long-lasting, easy to clean, uses very few batteries over its life, shaves nose hairs very cleanly (the more expensive model did not shave nearly as close to the hair root nor did it reach all areas reached by the Panasonic), does not cause injuries to skin.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an alternative to scissors, but no.  It doesn&#x27;t really cut very much, it&#x27;s so tickly and irritating that I find it unusable.  If it did a better job actually trimming I might be willing to put up with the discomfort, but in the end it&#x27;s all pain, no gain.</li>
            <li> I had the precursor to this one and it did the job and lasted for several years. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this one as well. It&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I never got to use the trimmer. The motor doesn&#x27;t work even after buying new batteries, and the cutting head looks like it&#x27;s been smashed.It&#x27;s not worth the postage or trouble to return it,so it just lays in the drawer.</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these trimmers for several years.  After it finally died we went to several local stores looking for the exact same one, our search was futile.  I finally looked on Amazon and found it.  Now his regular grooming is back to normal and he is exceptionally pleased.  I probably should buy a couple more so he will not be without again.  Think I will wait a couple of months first.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item a number of years ago at Sharper Image store.  This is the best nose,ear, anywhere hair trimmer ever.  I&#x27;m buying a back up for travel.</li>
            <li> I paid 12.94 for this over a year ago. It works very well for trimming nose hairs as it doesn&#x27;t pull them and is somewhat easy to clean.  I knocked it off the bathroom counter this morning and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  It does seem pretty cheap but gets the job done. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $20 for it. Was going to purchase it if it was around $10 but think I will try something else</li>
            <li> After discussing nose hair trimmers over a family dinner tonight (strange isn&#x27;t it?), I wanted to share my thoughts on this trimmer.  15 years ago I received this little trimmer as a gift. I still use this same trimmer on a weekly basis and it still does a great job. I have purchased other trimmers in that time to see if anything newer on the market does a better job. The newer ones I have tried have not been impressive.   If they are still made the same as they were 15 years ago, buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I dropped my previous one in the bathroom and broke and had to order a new one. Couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best, simplest, and most reliable nose hair trimmer that I have ever used and I have owned many.  I had this one like 10 years ago, and lost it in a move and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  So I went through a chain of bigger name, more expensive crappy trimmers, only to find this one on amazon a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I paid less than $10 for this trimmer including shipping. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. This trimmer replaced another one made by another company that starts with W. There is no comparison. This is well worth the money and would buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and depended on one of these for at least a decade before it finally wore out.  Was so pleased to find a replacement on Amazon.  When it arrived I fired it up, and it works like a champ.  Like getting an old friend back!</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are correct. I too had problems with the switch not working and the blades spinning inconsistently. The plastic nozzle that houses the blades is held on with tiny plastic hooks, which eventually broke making my trimmer useless.</li>
            <li> Great Product...This is the second one Ive owned. First one lasted about 7 yrs. Does an excellent job. much better than the others i&#x27;ve tried. Excellent Vendor, quick shipping AAA+++ highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for years.  They don&#x27;t last forever so I ordered this new one.  The first one arrived and after inserting the battery it would not work.  I contacted Amazon and the vendor was very helpful.  A new one was shipped right away and I didn&#x27;t have to bother with returning the old one; excellent customer service.  I like this model much better than any of the newer ones.  This one works very well and gets the job done; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great little product.  Although it rattles a little when you turn it on, it works well.</li>
            <li> This is the basic model that I started with and I have gone through a number of others over the past 10 years or so.  Wahl, Remington, Norelco, wet-dry models, an old fashioned mechanical do-hickey from an on-line &#x27;country&#x27; store, the el-cheapo as seen on TV (!?) model from the drug store, ...  I&#x27;ve even gone prehistoric and tried a pair of nail scissors (I won&#x27;t regale you with the gory details). With each purchase I was hopeful that I found the holy-grail of the personal grooming device, but it was not to be.  None improved upon the Panasonic model.  So here I am.  I have gone full circle and purchased this one again.    What is the perfect personal groomer?  Everyone has their own ideal, I suppose, but a guy can dream...  It would have sharp enough blades to weed-whack those crazy little nose hairs with one or two passes, yet not tug on that unsightly nostril hair, causing a paroxysmal sneeze.  It would be waterproof, and thus easy to clean.  It would be solidly constructed and last a good long time. (Who really wants to spend their hard earned cash on yet another nose-hair trimmer?)  I can almost see it!  Sugar plums dancing in my head!    Sadly, the ER112BC falls short of this simple little dream.  You have to go back and forth on a single spot multiple times and there are those few, ever-so-stubborn little proboscis follicles that just won&#x27;t leave without an extra going-over.  This one is a little more successful in the ear department, but still care must be taken.  And speaking of taking care, very occasionally the little monster snags one of said nostril hairs and heaves it out, in a tweezer-like fashion.  Apart from the minor twang of pain, this gives me an oddly uncomfortable twitching sensation and leads to a paroxysmal AAAACHOOOO!!!  I would that the full unit were water proof.  It&#x27;s not.  Even so, you can easily remove the top, rinse, and then let the top part air dry.  I wish it didn&#x27;t feel so light and cheap in my hands.  Yes.  That&#x27;s how I lost my first one: I dropped it, it cracked, and took field trip to the landfill.  Then the search for trimmers galore....    And yet, here I am with the less-than-perfect but so-far-best-in-its-class model, the Panasonic ER112BC.  It is singularly serviceable, but not too posh and certainly not perfect.  But until I find a better model or decide to go native, I&#x27;m stuck with this for better or for worse. On reflection, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and does the job.  In fact, as far as I can tell, its less than perfect performance is best in its class.     So I&#x27;m open to any suggestions.  If you found a better model or figured out a clever braiding technique to keep these blasted hairs from making an egress from their orifices, I&#x27;m all ears.  Luckily, those ears are without a lot of danglers, thanks to Panasonic and its less-than-miracle machine.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 5 different trimmers. And I always came out disapointed. This one is the best by far. I want a trimmer not a massager. I want something that cuts nose hair as hard as steel. This one cuts and that&#x27;s what really counts. Easy to hold, cuts great, works on nose and ear hair. Buy it you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well.  It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all!</li>
            <li> This item worked well for a month or so, but then began working intermitently after that. Eventually it stopped working all together. In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this gizmo for many years. It&#x27;s far superior to the mechanical unit that I had before that didn&#x27;t cut at all. This gizmo has worked fine and has never failed. However, it just won&#x27;t cut the hair. I have to buzz and buzz and buzz to get the job done, which really only should take about 5 seconds per nostril.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the practically identical ER115 version (wet/dry washable) for many years, probably around 5 or 6.  First off, this thing is built like a tank for what it is.  Very solid plastic, and the movable parts like the cap for the battery and the on/off switch have a precision, quality feel that is usually absent with [..]grooming products.  I&#x27;ve dropped it more times than I&#x27;d like to admit, and it there&#x27;s not even a scratch on it, plus it works almost as well as when new.  It&#x27;s great for ear hair, which seems to grow faster the older I get...I find I use it at least 3-4 times a week to keep well-groomed.  It also works for nose hair, which I guess is its main function, but I find that if the battery isn&#x27;t really fresh, it slows down a bit and can pull hard on a hair instead of cutting it(ouch-but I&#x27;ve never drawn blood)...but then again, this thing IS about 6 years old and the blades have never been sharpened.  I seem to recall that the manual that came with it suggested replacing the unit like after 2 years (anyone else read that?)but I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of this little sucker!</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll say it:  I have a lot of nose hair.  And this little gadget works great at trimming it down.  And stays sharp after months of use... at least so far.  Uses 1 AA battery.  Travels well.  Exactly what I needed.  OH... and it doesn&#x27;t cut me like a cheap jobbie did that I bought before I bought this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> This item is a replacement for one I have used for many years.  These simple trimmers outperform others costing three times as much - and last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year and I find it to work fine. I don&#x27;t quite understand the negative reviews. I plan to buy another as a backup and a third to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> After searching in the price range of under $30 dollars for a nose hair trimmer I realized that they were all going to be battery powered. I decided to go with this little \\&quot;bad boy.\\&quot; Let me just start by saying that if you are looking to buy this product, you better have three inch nose hairs because this little device is unable to trim my nose hairs. Basically you have two small blades attached to two plastic hooks. The plastic hooks are spun by a plastic notch (hint: all plastic usually means garbage.) Since it is only powered by one battery it lacks power. Just to see if this thing really could cut hair I tried to trim a piece of hair on my head and just as I expected it whipped the piece of hair around in a circular motion failing to cut it. Bottom line, this is a very poorly made product (Made in China) with a Panasonic logo that should NOT be on this product. I have never purchased anything by Panasonic that was made this poorly.</li>
            <li> As other reviews state, this Panasonic ER112BC works great on nose hair.  No pulling or pain.  However, I have found it useless for ear hair and will have to buy another product for that.  I have found that the long flat-blade style trimmers (instead of the rotary trimmers like this one) work best on ear hair.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer Do Excatly What I Needs It To Do It Get Rid Of All UnWanted Hair</li>
            <li> I bought mine at least a decade ago, after a couple of other models broke or ripped me up.  This one has never failed.  Yes, sometimes I have to smack it to make the contacts work.  Yes, sometimes it starts up slowly before reaching full RPM.  I have one in my shaving kit and one in my medicine cabinet.  I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries here and there, but not so often that it seems like they drain quickly - honestly, at least a couple of years between changes.  But I like it - it is small, it works, it fits in your hand, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say here. This trimmer works much better than the one I had. It was a Remington. Trims well, but seems like I might be more likely to cut myself,hence four instead of five stars. I guess buy it and then remember to be careful.</li>
            <li> I got this for my pops, his eye sight is getting worst, so I can&#x27;t stand the thought of him snipping his nostrils.  It nice and small uses one AA battery.  Panasonic makes goods stuff.  He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000063XHR Panasonic ER112BC Nose and Ear Trimmer]]  Not as good as the older model, but still works a lot better then Remington or others.  Still better then the sissor method \\&quot;OUCH\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I got one of these and the blades would spin for just a bit before the unit stopped even with a fresh battery.  Starting and stopping all the time was a pain.  It also got hot if I tried to run it long enough to boldly probe where no nostril has been probed before.  It didn&#x27;t cut too well either, leaving plenty of hairs still poking up after multiple passes.  Quick learner that I am, I bought another one, just in case.  That had all the same faults and also kept coming apart.  So much for my reputation as a boy genius.  Spare yourself the trouble and get something better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this trimmer is still around. I bought this exact model over 10 years ago and today I dropped it on the ground and it stopped working so I&#x27;ve been looking on amazon for a replacement. This was my first and only trimmer and it&#x27;s performed nicely during that time. I don&#x27;t know if the ones being made today are of the same quality but mine gets 5 stars for longevity.  This trimmer has a plain and boring look to it but it cuts nose hair pretty well. Never had an issue with it pulling on hair unless the battery was low. You might have to push a little harder in the bend near the tip of your nose to get a close trim but it&#x27;s not troublesome.   Towards the end of this trimmer&#x27;s life it did start having issues turning on. I found out the battery contacts were getting corroded. If you look at the contacts and see a bluish greenish coloring on them, it&#x27;s corrosion and is preventing contact with the battery. To remedy this I took a cotton swab and dabbed it in vinegar and wiped the contacts. The corrosion will come off and it should work fine again. But eventually the corrosion will come back. It wasn&#x27;t a huge problem for me and I was able to live with it.  But now it&#x27;s time to find another trimmer. This one has performed very admirably all these years but I&#x27;d like to try something new. Plus, this one is more expensive than many of the other trimmers. Maybe the extra cost is for the long lasting durability? Anyways happy trimming!</li>
            <li> This is a good item for packing in your toiletries for a trip, being more compact than its bigger brother the ER415SC which I prefer. But it is not quite as effective and also it bites (pulls) periodically, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why two of the other reviewers had problems, this little gizmo has worked great for me for the past 5 years when I bought it at Wal-Mart.  Now they don&#x27;t carry them and I want a replacement.  BTW, I bought another kind (flat shaver style) and the thing is too clumsy to use (cut myself twice).  This works great, at least on me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name Panasonic fool you. This is a cheap toy. Mine got slower and slower, fresh batteries made little difference. It didn&#x27;t even last a year. Spend a little more and get a better one.&lt;BR&gt;E.L.</li>
            <li> I use this about 1x / month.  It cuts the nose and ear hair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being an engineer and having one for over 5 years I know that &lt;br /&gt;one of the problems has to do with the contacts becoming dirty/ &lt;br /&gt;corroded.  The solution is to clean the contacts thoroghly. &lt;br /&gt;I mean very very thoroughly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And use a new AA battery.  I have even had fine use with a rechargable battery.  But I have experienced troubles that were &lt;br /&gt;traced back to corroded battery contacts.  I think the reason  &lt;br /&gt;for this is that when the metal gets wet it will eventually  &lt;br /&gt;corrode.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also leaking batteries from putting the unit away for a long time &lt;br /&gt;with an low battery will cause damage to any circuitry when a &lt;br /&gt;battery leaks a bit of alkaline material. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Consider complaining to the battery company for this kind of problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall this unit is exactly worth the price you pay for it.  &lt;br /&gt;It does cut my hair which is coarse but I&#x27;m Arabic. Maybe a  &lt;br /&gt;Black person should avoid this. Or maybe a Blonde person should avoid it.  I have not tested it on my friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does tickle the nose. That kind of drives me nuts. But there &lt;br /&gt;is not much to do but tolerate it. It does give a close shave &#x27;up there&#x27; if you move it around and around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the cutter. I do.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have owned several types, manual &amp; battery powered. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve found anywhere. I ordered it as replacement for another just like it that I dropped and broke the head/cutter.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for about ten years but I dropped it last year. Tried 2 other brands since then until I thought of shopping for my old faithful on-line. I bought 2 although one is enough as long as I don&#x27;t drop it or lose it. After 10 years it&#x27;s still the best!</li>
            <li> When it worked, this compact trimmer did a good job.  Unfortunately the motor died after a few months.  The trimmer first developed problems with starting, where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going.  Performance deteriorated until it finally refused to start at all.  The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes, that fail after minimal use.  Maybe I got a lemon, but this trimmer was a total disappointment.  It is cheap, so if it does die, at least you won&#x27;t lose too much.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive unit works great and after using it, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. You can&#x27;t beat this unit for cost and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for at least 5 years and it still works great. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these over the years. It worked to a point but not very efficiently. You can do better and faster with a pair of scissors, if you know what I mean. They are also very fragile, both of mine shattered into pieces from dropping onto the bathroom floor by accident.</li>
            <li> It does make noise, but I could not find any cut hairs. Even when I tried to make it cut a specific hair it did not work. In the end I had to get the scissors and tweezer out.</li>
            <li> Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn&#x27;t say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had this one and it broke. I bought him a more expensive panasonic model, one with a light, and he hated it. He said it didn&#x27;t have enough power. So I bought him this one again and he&#x27;s happy now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried nose trimmers before and were disappointed that they just didn&#x27;t trim close enough (you know the ones that look like little rocket ships) this Panasonic trimmer is for you. The smaller trimmer blade is the secret - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried other nose hair clippers.  They did nothing.  These do an excellent, gentle removal of hairs.</li>
            <li> A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one.  Using clippers or scissors just doesn&#x27;t make it and you risk infection.  This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth.  No pinching and no discomfort.  It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water.  I could easily see losing a piece down the drain.  But for a small, lightweight and packable &#x60;nose and ear&#x27; trimmer, it does the job and it&#x27;s not that expensive.  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that nose trimmers are not sexy, but neither are nose hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery not included.  Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  I returned it and was given a new one within a week.</li>
            <li> I received the trimmer and left the country the next day for an extended period of time.  When I opened it up and put in a battery, it did not work.  I tried other batteries, with the same result.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> My husband got one of these trimmers about 4 years ago and it finally broke.  He has since purchased a couple different trimmers and was very disappointed in them.  I went on line and started looking for yet another trimmer and found this one.  Oh Happy Day!  I purchased it and he is very happy again.  I considered purchasing a couple of them in case he needs another one in the distant future!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this ear and nose trimmer to replace my panasonic trimmer. Looks like my old panasonic trimmer. Though the speed seems the same as my old trimmer it just doesnt do the same job. For some reason it takes so much longer to get results. I ended up buying a micro touch max  made in china at walmart , It works better than any trimmer I ever had and is more versitile.</li>
            <li> Look no further. The weedwacker of trimmers. Compact, great for travel or home. Single AA battery lasts quite a long time. Gets the job done and quick about it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thing over a year ago from Amazon.  You people LIED to me!  I&#x27;m shopping for a replacement!  Seriously though, it has some problems:  1. The switch doesn&#x27;t make very good contact, so you end up switching it on and off a few times to get it to start.  2. It&#x27;s underpowered, so it starts up kind of slow, and you wonder if it is up to the task.  One AA battery isn&#x27;t enough.  3. The cutters seem cheap and don&#x27;t trim very closely.  4. Overall sound and feel is cheesy.  This is NOT a precision instrument.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem.  Sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works.  Never falls apart and cut hair great.  I&#x27;d buy another if this one would ever wear out!</li>
            <li> I like the Panasonic ER112BC a lot, but it vibrates a little and tickles the inside of my nose during use (so 4 stars).  Those of you who are looking for a practical product that is inexpensive, works well and are not ticklish this is nose trimmer is for you.  BTW, it works well on ears also.</li>
            <li> The price was cheap, but it was a poor quality nose hair trimmer. The nose hair trimmer only lasted two month.</li>
            <li> You can always expect good quality from Panosonic even in Nose &amp; Ear Trimmers, really does the job.</li>
            <li> There is nothing really to rave about this.  It cuts the hairs and it nice and compact.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I Looked Everywhere Online for a Nose Hair Trimmer with Good Reviews at a Good Price.  I Found This One Here on Amazon about 7 Months Ago and I&#x27;m Very Glad I Did, So Far.  This Trimmer Appears to Be an Older Design by Panasonic, but Thats Not a Bad Thing in This Case.  As Soon as You Put the Batteries In and Turn This On for the First Time, You Know that This Has Plenty of Power to Do Its Job.  It Does an Overall Good Job at Trimming the Hairs and is Easy to Handle and Use.  I had Bought a Newer Nose Trimmer from Panasonic which I was Very Disappointed With and Broke After Six Months of Occasional Use.  Therefore, I Was Very Nervous About Taking Another Chance on Panasonic. Bottom Line is That This is a Great, Well Made, Powerful and Inexpensive Trimmer for the Money.</li>
            <li> This little nose and ear trimmer really does the job and only uses a single AA battery. It may be a tab noisy to some, but then again it is a trimmer.</li>
            <li> easy to loss,  small size....</li>
            <li> had problems with the 1st one i received; so I left seller about the issue I had and got a replacement. the replacement works as expected.    i would rate this a 5 star if the 1st one worked.</li>
            <li> I had this model in the past but could not find it in any local store. It trims better than the other 2 or 3 trimmers I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind and cuts at the tip which makes it easier to trim at any angle.</li>
            <li> the worst product ever!  why, you ask?  because it didn&#x27;t even work!  i put the battery in and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  don&#x27;t waste your time with this plastic piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Its the best ear and nose trimmer that I have tried and was glad to find this particular one on line, as trying the local stores I couldn&#x27;t find one. I&#x27;ve had this unit for years and Its tops in my book. Harold</li>
            <li> This was a handy little thing until I tried to use it after only using it 3 times, and it was just totally dead. I put new batteries in, fiddled with it, took the top piece off and screwed back on tighter, etc. Nothing would fix it, it&#x27;s just dead. I guess that&#x27;s what you get when it&#x27;s so cheap, but pretty disappointing...</li>
            <li> years ago, i bought this nose hair trimmer for my husband. it&#x27;s awesome.  however, eventually it finally broke and a part went missing.  we have purchased 5 different, and some very expensive trimmers since that never matched up to this one.  my husband was thrilled when he finally found his \\&quot;original\\&quot; trimmer.  still works great, don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive models.</li>
            <li> The funniest thing is that by now, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d realize that you can only give a total of 5 stars for these products, when in reality I personally feel they deserve MUCH more! Now, I&#x27;m not going to lie to you: this little guy was just a liiiiiiiiiitle tricky to remove from the packaging, but then again, it made me feel safe, so am I bragging or complaining (hahaha!)?!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my ER112BC since 2011 and I&#x27;ve never had one issue with this-and in fact I&#x27;m still waiting for the battery to die-AMAZING! This trimmer is built like a TANK (if tanks were mad out of plastic), and the plastic casing is very lightweight, allowing me to reach those hard-to-get-to spots with Heavenly ease. When I&#x27;m done I just replace to cap (included) and voila-I&#x27;m done! I&#x27;ve never even had to clean it! Would I recommend this to a family member, a friend? Other? Does a bird have a beak? You bet I would!</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous different brands of nose trimmers through the years, but never have I found one that can match the Panasonic ER112BC. I have given these as gifts to others and their comments are that this thing really works well, with very little ripping of the hairs in the nose. I have six or seven different nose trimmers that I bought on the cuff, just to see if they would work as good as this, and none compare. I could not find this model anywhere, after my last one finally died after about eight years and Amazon was the only place I could find it. Highly recommend this product over any other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several years now and I find it very dependable and useful. I initially had some startup problems that I, too, thought might be battery or switch related. However I discovered that a spritz of WD40 into the cutter blades has made this tool very dependable. As with all hair-cutting clippers and shavers, blade lubrication is needed. The other thing people should know is that while the blades cut in a rotary direction, the only way the hairs get into the cutter is through the slots. So this tool cuts on the way IN only, so just putting it in the area and leaving it there will be ineffective...you have to insert and reinsert to get uncut hairs into the slots. Knowing these two things should give you a good experience with this tool. The \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; and \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; that others report is also minimized by having the blades lubricated so that they cut cleanly rather than jam.</li>
            <li> Great product, small compact and works better than most of the fancier products for sale.</li>
            <li> Worked well while it lasted. Hair trimmer just died recently and after swapping out batteries, no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light and compact is perfect for traveling. Easy to pop off the top and clean. Performs well as expected, but I&#x27;ve never had another to compare with.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000063XHR Panasonic ER112BC Nose and Ear Trimmer]] I have one that I received for a gift 17 years ago and it is still working like new. I purchase another for my home in Lima Peru.The Best</li>
            <li> The nose clipper is wonderful.  I highly recommend it to others.  It works well, is a small, convenient size and the price was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> I found this product just OK...trimming is not as clean as I would like, but it was very inexpensive. I doubt I would recommend this product to my friends, however, since the whole point of a trimmer is a nice, clean trim.</li>
            <li> Works better than at least 3 types I&#x27;ve bought since I last had this type.  Can&#x27;t find this in any BAM in this part of the country. Happy to find it on line.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for years and it works great. I even dropped it on the floor and it still works. It also works good on you eyebrows and ears.</li>
            <li> This product is an embarrassment to the brand.    Installed a brand-new Duracell battery in a brand-new trimmer and attempted to trim for a solid two minutes.  This effort resulted in no appreciable impact.      I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender, using every conceivable angle of attack, throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.    I should add that while it fails to trim anything, the device does in fact result in sensations that cannot be called pleasurable as it pulls on your nose hairs in futility.      In case this is not enough to dissuade you from making this purchase, the device also produces an unpleasant and potentially harmful ozone smell.</li>
            <li> Bought the Panasonic 20 dollar model and this one works way better. I have a beard and mustache trimmer for all other grooming so I just wanted a unit for nose hair. I would buy a few of these in case one breaks or for replacement before spending 18-20-or 30 dollars for the high price ones. It works great and I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Did not work! Had to send it back for exchange! No response yet after two weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;Crap crap crap crap crap. Crap crap crap crap</li>
            <li> Quality product. Most trimmers break within a month and are cheaply constructed.  I have had this product for over a year and it still runs on it&#x27;s original batteries (only use once every 2 weeks).  It pulls on hairs occasionally, but it the most powerful trimmer I&#x27;ve had. spins like a jet engine</li>
            <li> ...for travel. Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work as well as one with a stainless steel outed comb but certainly good enough, especially for price. Panasonic grooming products tend to be excellent value and to,work as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their e-mail based customer service, however, is manned by folks who carelessly send back \\&quot;canned\\&quot; responses not addressing the question. I suppose that is part of keeping prices low. But in my case it meant not buying their new hair and beard trimmer....</li>
            <li> This is one of the better noise hair clippers I&#x27;ve used.  I had this same model maybe 10+ years ago and it lasted for 6 or 7 years.  I&#x27;ve had my current one for 3 years and should something go wrong with it, will replace it with another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others; they didn&#x27;t work. This Panasonic (ER112B) is different. It really works. It easily cuts off nose and ear hairs. It can get close to the hair&#x27;s base without hurting the underlying skin. And it removes the hairs after they&#x27;re cut with a mild vacuum action. Neat.  It has pretty good power for something that uses a battery; it doesn&#x27;t slow down or require multiple passes.  The noise level is moderate - not silent, but not a racket either. You can use it in your ears without going deaf.  I was skeptical before I bought it, but am now convinced; it works.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You should think about using eye-watering tweezers rather than buy this product.  I gave up using it after the first few attempts because, amazingly, it doesn&#x27;t cut hair!  You spend 5 minutes trying to align each hair so that it will enter the nozzle at the right angle to cut.  Even then, the blades tend to push the hairs out of the way rather than cut them.  It even managed to scratch the inside of my nose because I was pushing too hard to make it work.  A bit of a design flaw for a hair trimmer!</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I HAVE TRIED</li>
            <li> This thing could not cut a single hair.  First we tried the nose, then the ears, then the arm then the twigs and berries.......it was as if the blade was missing......complete POS......my old Panasonic device worked well for years......sad to say this is the first Panasonic product that I have ever bought that has not lived up to the name.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Panasonic trimmer about 15 years ago. It was solid and did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;When it was time to buy another there was no question that I was buying another Panasonic. My mistake! didn&#x27;t last 6months.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer on the market by far. It goes deeper than any other and never pulls hairs. I am glad these are still available because nobody builds a better one.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for my nose hair. Does a good job of cutting the hair but it will also cut your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
