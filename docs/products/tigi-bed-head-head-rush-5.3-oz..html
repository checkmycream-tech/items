            <li>The items came quickly, and  am otherwise happy with the seller, just a product malfunction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 100s of haircare products designed to shine and this one is the best as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  In our super-heated house this winter, my fine hair was flying everywhere with static…and brushing it made me look like I was at the Magic House with my kids!  </li>

            <li>I would spray this on, as a finishing spray after I was finished using Moroccan Oil and styling and it made all of the drier spots look hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Best product for flat ironing hair; seals your hair, keeps it straight and smooth.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very light and leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>

            <li>Love this stuff for use with the flat iron!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about these products in the past</li>
            <li>I really like BedHead products to begin with.  </li>

            <li>This aresol spray makes my blonde hair very shiny after blowdrying!  </li>
            <li>but I can no longer find this product...which is unfortunate since this was a great product that left my hair glamorously shiny and so lite that you couldn&#x27;t tell that you have it on your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair ends up feeling soft and it looks shinier.  </li>
            <li>For about 2 years straight I bleached and dyed my hair all different colors.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, very very curly, thick hair.</li>

            <li> Amazon was half the price for the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry hair</li>
            <li> The last product I used was made by TIGI and came in a small, dark blue, plastic spray bottle...</li>

            <li> This product makes your hair so shiny and silky and you a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I tried BedHead Headrush and was so grateful to discover that it tamed down fly-away, dry hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Price is much less than hair salons.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t end up with an oily, greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> If you never used this before you are missing out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this because it did not create shine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim and was not sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> The spray Nozzle stopped working after the first use :-(  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but my hair feels greasy after using it, and not particularly shiny either.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  </li>
