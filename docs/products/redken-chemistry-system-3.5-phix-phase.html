            <li> I bought this product, along with the Shot Phase, as an intensive moisturizing treatment. It definitely did not live up to the name &#x27;Extreme Moisture.&#x27; My dry hair remained...dry...after treatment. I even attempted the treatment again, about three days after the initial treatment, and followed this treatment with a moisture mask. I received the same benefits as when I used the moisture mask alone. The Extreme Moisture treatment did not provide the moisture advertised.</li>
            <li> Easy to do at home and much more cost effective than have a &amp;#34;Chem-shot&amp;#34; at the beauty salon!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. *This is intended to use with Redken Chemistry Shot phase ( Step #1)</li>
            <li> This with the All Soft Chem Shot ... makes amazing hair.  I use this about three times per month.  It has rescued my hair.  I won&#x27;t go without it.  If you have colored blonde hair this is a must for you.  But do follow the directions exactly.  As my hair stylist said leave it on for exactly the time it says and not longer.  Before this I use the CAT Spray 5 minutes only (do not leave longer than 5 minutes) and rinse and towel dry, and then you use the All Soft Chem Shot on your hair leave on 5 minutes (do not rinse hair), and then spray the 3.5 phix phase on hair and then rinse.  And absolutely silky beautiful hair.  Best investment in keeping your hair amazing!</li>
            <li> 2nd step in Redken system, use Shot phase first.  Start out with towel dried hair.  Makes hair feel healthy and shiny.  I have dry/damaged on the coarse side hair.  Always use this before going out. Don&#x27;t notice any build up at this time, but if it were to happen use like a malibu treatment and start again.  Would highly recommend.  Had this done at a Salon for $10.  Saves money</li>
            <li> This product is great when used with shot phases.  Saw instant results the first use!  Highly recommend!  Was first recommended to me by a hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was getting. Works okay.</li>
            <li> When using it correctly your hair will feel like silk and not weighed down.  Very moisturizing and gives your hair a great shine.</li>
            <li> i use this with the all soft shot phase as my conditioner at night, love the way my hair feels soft after this!</li>
            <li> Just like the treatment at the beauty shop.  Does wonders for damaged hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, this didn&#x27;t gel with my hair.</li>
            <li> best product ever for the health of your hair!</li>
            <li> I love the product when used with the Shot Phase, but the packaging was faulty. I can&#x27;t get the spray to work.</li>
            <li> It is not the same product you get at the hairdresser</li>
            <li> AS A LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST.. let me give you some advice. The \\&quot;Phix Phase\\&quot; is the SECOND step to the Redken Conditioning Treatment. The FIRST step involves \\&quot;Shot Phase\\&quot; Conditioning Creme (Extreme, Real Control, Color Extend, All Soft, Smooth Locks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE CAN NOT WORK WITHOUT THE OTHER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step by step Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash the hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. Towel dry hair (just a little)&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the \\&quot;Shot Phase\\&quot; Conditioning Cream.&lt;br /&gt;4. Let the Conditioning Cream sit in your hair for a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;5. Spray your hair with the \\&quot;Phix Spray\\&quot; (over the conditioning cream).&lt;br /&gt;6. Let the magic begin. Allow both to sit in your hair for a couple of minutes. (The longer the better). I suggest 5-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;7. Rinse using cool water (doesn&#x27;t have to be freezing cold) the cool water helps to close your hair cuticle and locks in all of that moisture.&lt;br /&gt;8. Condition your hair. (some don&#x27;t say this step isn&#x27;t needed, but I have been working with the ChemShot treatment for 5+ years, and I say you should).&lt;br /&gt;9. Rinse your hair and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel brand new!</li>
            <li> This is a must try!!! This is the second of 2 part product!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> I was ignorant when I ordered the Redken Chemistry Shot Phase All Soft and didn&#x27;t know that there was a second step to using it.  The second step obviously being the 3.5 pHix pHase. It works great along with the Shot Phase. Better than a deep conditioning at the salon for sure.</li>
