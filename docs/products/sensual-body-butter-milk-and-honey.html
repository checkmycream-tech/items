            <li>Originally purchased at kiosk in mall at greater cost.  </li>

            <li>It smells absolutel fabulous.</li>
            <li>I would prefer unscented if it were available.</li>
            <li>and this product goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so refreshed.  </li>
            <li>She said it was the best thing she had ever tried for her cracked and dried out hands.</li>
            <li>Buy from this seller and save so much money while getting the most fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I originally discovered DSC products at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>deep sea cosmetics are so good they just smell so good and are so soft going on .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, not sickening sweet.</li>
            <li>Wife wouldnt be without her Dead Sea cosmetics,every product I get for her is better then the last,keeps her happy</li>
            <li>It is a great product and really keeps the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon too :)</li>
            <li>Deep Sea Cosmetics Body Butter is smooth and effective.  </li>
            <li>It was also not nearly as thick and rich as the original product and did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love way it makes my skin feel, soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have a slight obsession with body lotions and body butters, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s like more than double the price.</li>
            <li>Nice non greasy product and not much of a girly smell for men.</li>
            <li>I started using this body butter about 3 months ago and now can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 4 starts is because I tend to need a heavy moisturizer and while this is a great lotion it isn&#x27;t quite up to \\&quot;body</li>
            <li>not what i really wanted  </li>
            <li>Great product that I have become addicted to.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than any other of it</li>
            <li>there are many other alternatives out there</li>
            <li>But then i found it on Amazon for MUCH less and bought more.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time, so seller highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very thick and smells good.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money combined with the sea salt from the same company.</li>
            <li>Always bought this item , although the last bottle i bought in the mall a long time ago had more smell to it .</li>
            <li>My hands are usually cracked and dried, but after the salt scrub and moisturizer my hands look great.</li>
            <li>Plus my nail buffer can be replaced any time during the next two years for free as long as I bring in my receipt and old buffer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even gentle enough for my two year old son- who likes to do whatever we do and occassionally applies it to his hands, face, and so on.</li>
            <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the face I frequently applied it to my legs which is hit the hardest with Eczema in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this causes no problems.</li>
            <li>I am completely committed to these products.</li>
            <li>a major plus for the men of the house!    </li>
            <li>The product has virtually no odor isn&#x27;t very slimy like cocoa butter is when you apply it and made my skin baby lotion soft for twice as long as any other product I had ever used.</li>
            <li>I first purchased one before Christmas a few years ago....</li>

            <li> I first purchased one before Christmas a few years ago....</li>
            <li> The texture is very thin and has an overwhelming perfume smell.</li>
            <li> The only creme that helps my cracking fingers and dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It offers moisture without a heavy or greasy film.</li>
            <li> Plus I was told I can come to the shop any time within the next year with my receipt and empty container and get a refill on any of my products for $10.</li>
            <li> It makes the butter cream go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single issue with any of their dsc products.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The customer service left a little to be desired.  </li>
            <li> This is not the same product I purchase a few years ago in the mall, though the jars and numbers match.</li>
            <li> Loved the products but hated the haggling and the price you had to pay for them.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and a little goes a long ways, however; if you want it to last longer, mix it with a non-scented lotion such as Aveno.  </li>
            <li> For the past two years I have found these products on Amazon at a third the cost.</li>
            <li> The product was so overly perfumed that I could not wear it due to my asthma.</li>
            <li> No longer use other body lotions.  </li>
            <li> It does do the job for areas that don&#x27;t need heavy moisturizers and/or for those that don&#x27;t have naturally dry skin (my husband and son).</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry skin on my legs and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry until I use a little of this cream.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft without irritating Eczema.</li>
            <li> and so the lotion gets a bit odd in texture.  </li>
            <li> This product goes bad rather quickly</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I may have been getting ripped off, but I walked away today with two salt scrubs, one body butter, one nail kit, a face cleanser, and a facial moisturizer for a total of $185.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy odor or scent-</li>
            <li> A few years ago I received the combination Dead Sea Cosmetics Body Scrub &amp; Body Butter</li>
            <li> I depend on dead sea minerals to restore my skin to its softness whenever I slack on my routine.</li>
            <li> at a kiosk in a mall...and paid an unbelievable $80 for it.  </li>
            <li> They shipped wrong product, I was told by company to mark refused but UPS would not take back to return, the company would not reship correct product until I took comments off the comment page</li>
            <li> gave me a hard time about a refund.</li>
            <li> We were stupid for paying so much...</li>
            <li> This cream is SO thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It is just like the same expensive one you can find in the mall without the expensive mall price.</li>
            <li> My wife has bad eczema and this product definitely helps cure it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I originally discovered DSC products at a mall kiosk. Loved the products but hated the haggling and the price you had to pay for them. For the past two years I have found these products on Amazon at a third the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife has bad eczema and this product definitely helps cure it. Well worth the money combined with the sea salt from the same company.</li>
            <li> Both of us use this lotion (which is something I can&#x27;t say too often about my husband and I). It offers moisture without a heavy or greasy film. It&#x27;s even gentle enough for my two year old son- who likes to do whatever we do and occassionally applies it to his hands, face, and so on. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy odor or scent- a major plus for the men of the house!    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 4 starts is because I tend to need a heavy moisturizer and while this is a great lotion it isn&#x27;t quite up to \\&quot;body butter\\&quot; in my opinion. It does do the job for areas that don&#x27;t need heavy moisturizers and/or for those that don&#x27;t have naturally dry skin (my husband and son).</li>
            <li> A few years ago I received the combination Dead Sea Cosmetics Body Scrub &amp; Body Butter and I can honestly say this is the best affordable product I have ever used. I am a seasonal Eczema sufferer and I found it minimized the itching and dryness 100%. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and because the use of fragrance is natural and minimal it didn&#x27;t burn the way most lotions do. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the face I frequently applied it to my legs which is hit the hardest with Eczema in the winter months. The product has virtually no odor isn&#x27;t very slimy like cocoa butter is when you apply it and made my skin baby lotion soft for twice as long as any other product I had ever used. In the months that I don&#x27;t suffer from Eczema I use this product after I shave and love it. It makes your skin feel so soft without irritating Eczema. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with this product and I love it. You gotta try it!</li>
            <li> The best scent ever!!! This product works better than any other of it&#x27;s kind. It does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do. It leaves smooth, silky skin, with the most fabulous scent. It&#x27;s fresh, not sickening sweet. This product is over $40 in retail stores (or mall kiosks). Buy from this seller and save so much money while getting the most fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Wife wouldnt be without her Dead Sea cosmetics,every product I get for her is better then the last,keeps her happy</li>
            <li> I have a slight obsession with body lotions and body butters, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. It smells absolutel fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have sensitive skin and this causes no problems. Feels good going on and smells wondeful.  My sister will be receiving this from me for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel and look awesome! The scent is quite pleasant and I get compliments whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Paid almost double for this product at the mall.  So nice to be able to buy online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry skin on my legs and this did the trick.  I depend on dead sea minerals to restore my skin to its softness whenever I slack on my routine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this amazing product. The product arrived on time, so seller highly recommended. Just watch the price. It fluctuates as you probably know. I bought it at $13 last year. Now it&#x27;s like more than double the price.</li>
            <li> There is something about the smell that I absolutely love.  It goes on my skin smoothly, its not greasy, and it smells great.  And it does keep my skin moist.  Itâ€™s my new favorite!</li>
            <li> does not smell like the one we purchased years ago in the mall.  We were stupid for paying so much...there are many other alternatives out there</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product, thank you</li>
            <li> This cream is SO thick and creamy.  It is wonderful.  I first purchased one before Christmas a few years ago....at a kiosk in a mall...and paid an unbelievable $80 for it.  (Yes, I was ripped off)  But then i found it on Amazon for MUCH less and bought more.</li>
            <li> Scent is not the best.  I would prefer unscented if it were available.</li>
            <li> This product goes bad rather quickly and so the lotion gets a bit odd in texture.  Also it likely has parabens which I wouldn&#x27;t have checked for then.</li>
            <li> The only creme that helps my cracking fingers and dry hands.  I love the acent.</li>
            <li> Having bought this exact product at a mall kiosk previosly and other dsc cosmetic products from other dealers at amazon I ordered 2 jars. The product was so overly perfumed that I could not wear it due to my asthma. It was also not nearly as thick and rich as the original product and did nothing for my skin. When I returned the product online cosmetics4u gave me a hard time about a refund. I will buy all of my dsc from bargain mall in the future. I have not had a single issue with any of their dsc products.</li>
            <li> its okay not what i really wanted  it really doesnt smell that great so i have it sitting in the drawer</li>
            <li> deep sea cosmetics are so good they just smell so good and are so soft going on .  I have alot of skin problems in the sun and I use them to help get me thru the summer.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have become addicted to.  No longer use other body lotions.  Originally purchased at kiosk in mall at greater cost.  Tried to make another purchase and they didn&#x27;t have the Milk &amp; Honey.  Glad to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same product though the UPC numbers match. The texture is very thin and has an overwhelming perfume smell. This is not the same product I purchase a few years ago in the mall, though the jars and numbers match.</li>
            <li> This item is ok, but to be honest I used it one time and I do not care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I got this at the mall today and already love it! My hands are usually cracked and dried, but after the salt scrub and moisturizer my hands look great. I also wanted to note that I got a much better deal on these products at the mall then I&#x27;m seeing here on Amazon. I was afraid that I may have been getting ripped off, but I walked away today with two salt scrubs, one body butter, one nail kit, a face cleanser, and a facial moisturizer for a total of $185. To buy the same items on Amazon would cost me $450! Plus I was told I can come to the shop any time within the next year with my receipt and empty container and get a refill on any of my products for $10. Plus my nail buffer can be replaced any time during the next two years for free as long as I bring in my receipt and old buffer. So, make sure you are pricing this out and taking addition discounts into consideration.</li>
            <li> I started using this body butter about 3 months ago and now can&#x27;t live without it!! My skin is softer than it has been since I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> I am completely committed to these products. They are excellent. It&#x27;s just what I wanted. I love the scents and results of them</li>
            <li> This smells really good. I use it fallowing the sea salt srub and they are a perfect combination for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Always bought this item , although the last bottle i bought in the mall a long time ago had more smell to it .</li>
            <li> The scent and the feel has changed and I wish I could return it.  The product as it had been was wonderful.  I cannot use many fragrances and the original product was perfect for me.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this!!  It is just like the same expensive one you can find in the mall without the expensive mall price.</li>
            <li> Very thick and smells good. I found that taking it into the bathroom to use right after finishing the shower works best. Application while still damp makes it go on very smooth and soaks in perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the best body butter and the milk and honey smells wonderful. I am so glad I found it on line</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have very dry skin and this product goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so refreshed.  Love the clean scent and will be purchasing this again.  Much cheaper on Amazon too :)</li>
            <li> Love the product - have purchased it in Florida before.  The customer service left a little to be desired.  They shipped wrong product, I was told by company to mark refused but UPS would not take back to return, the company would not reship correct product until I took comments off the comment page and then I was until 9/26/12 getting the correct product.</li>
            <li> Deep Sea Cosmetics Body Butter is smooth and effective.  My skin is very dry until I use a little of this cream.</li>
            <li> I am so hooked on this body, I can&#x27;t do with out it.  I love way it makes my skin feel, soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> From the folks that brought you sea salt scrub. Nice non greasy product and not much of a girly smell for men.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great prices, I was able to buy this as gifts, which went over very well. I bought this for myself, best friend, and mother.  It is a great product and really keeps the skin soft.  It is best when using the salt/oil scrub once per week (just a recommendation).  Everyone that has used it, says they love it!  It is really thick and a little goes a long ways, however; if you want it to last longer, mix it with a non-scented lotion such as Aveno.  It makes the butter cream go a long way.</li>
            <li> My mom loved this! She said it was the best thing she had ever tried for her cracked and dried out hands.</li>
            <li> I love this product as well.</li>
