            <li>When you&#x27;re living between Maryland and hell, trying to survive climate change melting in record high temps even the best body wash couldn&#x27;t keep you smelling good for 8 hours.    </li>

            <li>This body wash smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>, this is BY FAR the best body wash I have ever used.    </li>
            <li>Ordered these for my husband as he likes the old spice body washes, and this deal was an excellent one.</li>
            <li>My husband immediately became more attractive after the first shower he took while using this as his body wash.</li>
            <li>glad to have this purchase option</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with a better scent, I think.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this and we both love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>In-laws, gotta love em.      </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for quite some time and love it.</li>
            <li>a better note</li>
            <li>Just needs to be packed better.</li>
            <li>and i wouldnt have bought so many of them if i werent thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Come on amazon,be more competitive.</li>
            <li>I am comparing this one to my favorite which is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it lather much better.  </li>
            <li>It does foam up quite well like most of the Body Washes I have tried.</li>
            <li>two cents, the bar soap and deodorant of the same \\&quot;Swagger\\&quot; smell, don&#x27;t quite match the awesome that this body wash delivers.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell that stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and it leaves me very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The scent is incredible, and it does actually stay on your skin.</li>
            <li>So buying it in the 3 pack is really easy for me.  </li>
            <li>It has a good smell, lathers up nicely, and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean all day, smells good all day, and most importantly, smells NATURAL all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and has become my favorite out of all the Old Spice soaps.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of this body wash and find the name entertaining.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only that it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>, I have had numerous coworkers tell me I smelled great at work, and I have been using it for 2 years</li>
            <li>It foams up rather nicely and certainly leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent of the old spice brand, it has a very noticeable good smelling scent to it.</li>
            <li>First of all let me just say that I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>deodorant is still good/ original.</li>
            <li>Suds up well, leaving that familiar scent around in declining levels for 8 hours while the effectiveness of the skin cleansing goes well beyond that time period.</li>
            <li>My husband smells great for a very long time,without it being overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not overpowering, but it does clean you up.</li>
            <li>He uses it in the mornings and still smells so good when he comes back from work.</li>
            <li>I got this after trying their mountain and ocean scent stuff which smelled good, but didn&#x27;t really last.  </li>
            <li>Cool Wave Body Wash, 16-Ounce</li>
            <li>Mmmmm, not bad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about things like deodorant, laundry detergent, and body wash--it all has to come together in a perfect combination of masculine but pleasant scents--and Swagger is the only body wash that I use, despite the fact that I feel like a giant tool when I buy a body wash called \\&quot;Swagger.\\</li>
            <li>B004A7VFHG Gillette Fresh and Clean</li>
            <li>think this is what Outkast meant by &amp;#34;So Fresh and So Clean, Clean!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt super fresh and clean all day and the smell wasnt overpowering.</li>
            <li>I really want to try some different scents of the Old Spice body wash to find the perfect scent.  </li>
            <li>and i regularly ship this over because of how much i love the smell!</li>
            <li>Very mild, clean, masculine, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The scent however, just seems to elude me and is rather non distinct.</li>
            <li>The scent is great; anyone worried about smelling like their grandfather need not worry, since this is nowhere near the classic Old Spice scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something other than Axe, and this had good reviews</li>
            <li>I love Old spice product, every one I get in contact with right after my shower they seem to like it very much as well.</li>
            <li>right off of them.</li>
            <li>It is almost like the Pure Sport but has a sweet aroma to it.</li>
            <li>Swagger is my absolute favorite Old Spice sent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in trying other Old Spice body washes after I run through the 6 month supply of this stuff, lol.</li>
            <li>It is much more sporty, with nary a trace of classic Old Spice.</li>
            <li>She grabbed a bottle of Swagger and said \\&quot;This smells like a hot guy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was curious (partly because I liked her)</li>
            <li>Smells great but does not last as long as it claims.</li>
            <li>First time trying this body wash</li>
            <li>There was a time when Old Spice smelled more like Old Bay.  </li>
            <li>After going through numerous bottles of Axe, Gillette and Dial body wash and not finding any that I remotely liked, I figured I would give Old Spice Swagger a try.  </li>
            <li>In fact, after using this and Swagger body spray, I would recommend using only the body wash and a good deodorant; that should last you for the whole day.    </li>
            <li>Cleans well, the bottle is easy to hold and open with soapy hands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend this though, it lathers really well and the blue color makes it really easy to see.</li>
            <li>His skin is also really touchable.</li>
            <li>Now fast forward to 2011.  </li>
            <li>so how much of a review can I really give?  </li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES the scent.</li>
            <li>and I really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li>and like it just as much.. except I&#x27;m not embarrassed to tell anyone what it is.</li>
            <li>Yea I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li>but I figured Old Spice typically smells pretty nice regardless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lather : Doesn&#x27;t lather nearly as thick as the Cool Wave, so I end up using more of the swagger.  </li>
            <li>: Is a neon blue, which makes it easy to see on the loofah, the Gillette is more of a dark blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser:  Swagger wins on this one, a very controlled amount comes out with a moderate squeeze.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Old Spice product in probably twenty years time.  </li>
            <li>Zanzibar scent is great too, but a little harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I find that it tolerates this body wash quite well -- better than any actual facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used to this point.</li>
            <li>A little less professional then the Gillette Cool Wave, meaning it&#x27;s got more of a fruity smell then a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for men who respect their smelf.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>B002TSA91Q Dove Men + Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh, 18 Ounce</li>
            <li>Every time my man uses it right after he is out of the shower I definitely get turned on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got friends and family with very sensitive noses who are very quick to complain about powerful smells, and not once have they complained to me about it.</li>
            <li>Not only does this have a nice long lasting scent, it made me go through puberty again.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll be better off trying something from the store rather than buying some unknown product off internet.</li>
            <li>Swagger realistically advertises 8 hours as its goal, while using a variation of the classic “ship that sails the ocean&amp;#34; scent of Old Spice</li>
            <li>It actually smells and performs better than those other \\&quot;trendy\\&quot; men&#x27;s soaps.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re listening Old Spice send me some samples!      </li>
            <li>after no comments about the Axe, Gillette or Dial washes, my wife definitely took notice when I first used Swagger.</li>
            <li>but luckily did not get on my other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product but Old Spice seems to change their formulas every couple of years and this one is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>It really does not seem that is in the Old Spice traditional.</li>
            <li>about Old Spice - if your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it; you wouldn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li>I have to admit,I thought Old Spice was for old men.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some crusty old man scent either.</li>
            <li>No hyperbole required to describe the unparalleled greatness that is Old Spice Swagger.  </li>
            <li>I like the Old Spice Body Wash line.</li>
            <li>But after visiting my in-laws, my brother in-law had some Old Spice body wash</li>
            <li>My face is also extremely sensitive</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin perhaps get something that hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li>I dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have old spice from where i come from</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I do like this body wash and would buy again, just not as much as the Gillette because of the reasons above.</li>
            <li>IT WAS FANTASTIC,WHEN IT WAS A RED LIQUID.MY ABSOLUTE F A V O R</li>
            <li>(Old Spice Swagger Body Wash in a 16 ounce plastic bottle.)</li>
            <li>So much so, he ended up having to take a second shower...</li>
            <li>I chose this because when I received the package, one of the bottle had leaked all over the box, leaving one of the bottles more empty than the other two.</li>
            <li>Nothing special as it does not stand out above other body wash soaps.  </li>
            <li>There was a time when if you uttered the words Old Spice, you immediately thought of someone that dressed like Mr. Roper from Three&#x27;s Company shirt open, chest hairs blowing in the wind, a mullet reeking of some of the finest Old Spice scents this side of CVS.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;8-hour scent technology\\&quot; is no mere puffery; it DOES last for that long.</li>
            <li>this soap is not harsh and does not dry out his skin.</li>
            <li>The Dollar General website sells the</li>
            <li>Tons and tons of compliments, it really does last a long time after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Old Spice made a come back.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The other Old Spice body washes are kind of mediocre, but they knocked it out of the park with this one.</li>
            <li>but it could be due to the high humidity here.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers, the smell stays with you a few hours whereas with Axe it seems to be gone more or less when you get out of the shower.    </li>

            <li> , I have had numerous coworkers tell me I smelled great at work, and I have been using it for 2 years</li>
            <li> It foams up rather nicely and certainly leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of the old spice brand, it has a very noticeable good smelling scent to it.</li>
            <li> First of all let me just say that I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> deodorant is still good/ original.</li>
            <li> Suds up well, leaving that familiar scent around in declining levels for 8 hours while the effectiveness of the skin cleansing goes well beyond that time period.</li>
            <li> My husband smells great for a very long time,without it being overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not overpowering, but it does clean you up.</li>
            <li> He uses it in the mornings and still smells so good when he comes back from work.</li>
            <li> I got this after trying their mountain and ocean scent stuff which smelled good, but didn&#x27;t really last.  </li>
            <li> Cool Wave Body Wash, 16-Ounce</li>
            <li> Mmmmm, not bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about things like deodorant, laundry detergent, and body wash--it all has to come together in a perfect combination of masculine but pleasant scents--and Swagger is the only body wash that I use, despite the fact that I feel like a giant tool when I buy a body wash called \\&quot;Swagger.\\</li>
            <li> B004A7VFHG Gillette Fresh and Clean</li>
            <li> think this is what Outkast meant by &amp;#34;So Fresh and So Clean, Clean!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt super fresh and clean all day and the smell wasnt overpowering.</li>
            <li> I really want to try some different scents of the Old Spice body wash to find the perfect scent.  </li>
            <li> and i regularly ship this over because of how much i love the smell!</li>
            <li> Very mild, clean, masculine, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The scent however, just seems to elude me and is rather non distinct.</li>
            <li> The scent is great; anyone worried about smelling like their grandfather need not worry, since this is nowhere near the classic Old Spice scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something other than Axe, and this had good reviews</li>
            <li> I love Old spice product, every one I get in contact with right after my shower they seem to like it very much as well.</li>
            <li> right off of them.</li>
            <li> It is almost like the Pure Sport but has a sweet aroma to it.</li>
            <li> Swagger is my absolute favorite Old Spice sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested in trying other Old Spice body washes after I run through the 6 month supply of this stuff, lol.</li>
            <li> It is much more sporty, with nary a trace of classic Old Spice.</li>
            <li> She grabbed a bottle of Swagger and said \\&quot;This smells like a hot guy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was curious (partly because I liked her)</li>
            <li> Smells great but does not last as long as it claims.</li>
            <li> First time trying this body wash</li>
            <li> There was a time when Old Spice smelled more like Old Bay.  </li>
            <li> After going through numerous bottles of Axe, Gillette and Dial body wash and not finding any that I remotely liked, I figured I would give Old Spice Swagger a try.  </li>
            <li> In fact, after using this and Swagger body spray, I would recommend using only the body wash and a good deodorant; that should last you for the whole day.    </li>
            <li> Cleans well, the bottle is easy to hold and open with soapy hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still recommend this though, it lathers really well and the blue color makes it really easy to see.</li>
            <li> His skin is also really touchable.</li>
            <li> Now fast forward to 2011.  </li>
            <li> so how much of a review can I really give?  </li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES the scent.</li>
            <li> and I really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> and like it just as much.. except I&#x27;m not embarrassed to tell anyone what it is.</li>
            <li> Yea I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li> but I figured Old Spice typically smells pretty nice regardless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lather : Doesn&#x27;t lather nearly as thick as the Cool Wave, so I end up using more of the swagger.  </li>
            <li> : Is a neon blue, which makes it easy to see on the loofah, the Gillette is more of a dark blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser:  Swagger wins on this one, a very controlled amount comes out with a moderate squeeze.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Old Spice product in probably twenty years time.  </li>
            <li> Zanzibar scent is great too, but a little harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I find that it tolerates this body wash quite well -- better than any actual facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used to this point.</li>
            <li> A little less professional then the Gillette Cool Wave, meaning it&#x27;s got more of a fruity smell then a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for men who respect their smelf.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> B002TSA91Q Dove Men + Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh, 18 Ounce</li>
            <li> Every time my man uses it right after he is out of the shower I definitely get turned on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got friends and family with very sensitive noses who are very quick to complain about powerful smells, and not once have they complained to me about it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this have a nice long lasting scent, it made me go through puberty again.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll be better off trying something from the store rather than buying some unknown product off internet.</li>
            <li> Swagger realistically advertises 8 hours as its goal, while using a variation of the classic “ship that sails the ocean&amp;#34; scent of Old Spice</li>
            <li> It actually smells and performs better than those other \\&quot;trendy\\&quot; men&#x27;s soaps.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re listening Old Spice send me some samples!      </li>
            <li> after no comments about the Axe, Gillette or Dial washes, my wife definitely took notice when I first used Swagger.</li>
            <li> but luckily did not get on my other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product but Old Spice seems to change their formulas every couple of years and this one is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> It really does not seem that is in the Old Spice traditional.</li>
            <li> about Old Spice - if your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it; you wouldn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> I have to admit,I thought Old Spice was for old men.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some crusty old man scent either.</li>
            <li> No hyperbole required to describe the unparalleled greatness that is Old Spice Swagger.  </li>
            <li> I like the Old Spice Body Wash line.</li>
            <li> But after visiting my in-laws, my brother in-law had some Old Spice body wash</li>
            <li> My face is also extremely sensitive</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin perhaps get something that hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li> I dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have old spice from where i come from</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I do like this body wash and would buy again, just not as much as the Gillette because of the reasons above.</li>
            <li> IT WAS FANTASTIC,WHEN IT WAS A RED LIQUID.MY ABSOLUTE F A V O R</li>
            <li> (Old Spice Swagger Body Wash in a 16 ounce plastic bottle.)</li>
            <li> So much so, he ended up having to take a second shower...</li>
            <li> I chose this because when I received the package, one of the bottle had leaked all over the box, leaving one of the bottles more empty than the other two.</li>
            <li> Nothing special as it does not stand out above other body wash soaps.  </li>
            <li> There was a time when if you uttered the words Old Spice, you immediately thought of someone that dressed like Mr. Roper from Three&#x27;s Company shirt open, chest hairs blowing in the wind, a mullet reeking of some of the finest Old Spice scents this side of CVS.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;8-hour scent technology\\&quot; is no mere puffery; it DOES last for that long.</li>
            <li> this soap is not harsh and does not dry out his skin.</li>
            <li> The Dollar General website sells the</li>
            <li> Tons and tons of compliments, it really does last a long time after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Old Spice made a come back.  </li>
            <li> &quot; The other Old Spice body washes are kind of mediocre, but they knocked it out of the park with this one.</li>
            <li> but it could be due to the high humidity here.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers, the smell stays with you a few hours whereas with Axe it seems to be gone more or less when you get out of the shower.    </li>
            <li> Last long time, your will get plenty of complements from this scent.</li>
            <li> Why is this so much more expensive than in other sites?  </li>
            <li> This Body Wash has a strange scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry him out.    </li>
            <li> The one thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Me and husband saw the new body wash commercials and still decided to at least try them out on him.    </li>
            <li> I think my expectations were all above the roof because of the previous reviews I read about it.</li>
            <li> The Gillette pours out when you open it and is hard to squeeze out smaller</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want to waste money and possibly not like the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was using Old Spice Game Changer, but recently switched to Swagger.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Swagger comes from the “Red Zone” line and unlike competitors that make loft claims of long periods of effectiveness and fail.</li>
            <li> had I used any other body wash.</li>
            <li> I ordered other items with this purchase but it seemed the body wash was the laziest packed of them all.</li>
            <li> I use other soaps.</li>
            <li> Seriously, your smell is important, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts for quite a long time, too, so I usually don&#x27;t have to buy it again for about a month or two.</li>
            <li> Typical liquid soap - except for the smell.  </li>
            <li> I think it works for women as well since it has a slightly fruity scent.</li>
            <li> This is almost $4 less than amazon.  </li>
            <li> , not overpowering, not sweet.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours the scent disappears.</li>
            <li> This is something we usually buy in the store</li>
            <li> I personally find that it lasts for about an hour, but that could just be my lousy smell.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the high price amazon has on this product.  </li>
            <li> But what the hell, it can be our little secret.  </li>
            <li> NOW IT IS BLUE AND STINKS.</li>
            <li> And I do mean LASTS.</li>
            <li> Not like bad laundry detergent stays on your clothes, just enough where if you happen to be within an inch or two of your skin, you will catch a whiff of the super-fresh awesomeness.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and lathers well.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, so I was not happy.</li>
            <li> You know, there&#x27;s still this limitation of being unable to smell, taste, try on things from online stores before stepping forward and paying for the items you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a weird guy when it comes to smells.</li>
            <li> Received these bad boys yesterday</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the scent.</li>
            <li> I feel a bit disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but I just hate its name...</li>
            <li> It smells AWFUL</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Typical liquid soap - except for the smell.  Very mild, clean, masculine, and lasts all day.  My wife loves it on me.  Zanzibar scent is great too, but a little harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about Old Spice - if your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it; you wouldn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> This is my first Old Spice product in probably twenty years time.  I wanted to try something other than Axe, and this had good reviews so I gave it a whirl.  It smells good, not overpowering, not sweet.  I agree with the other reviewers, the smell stays with you a few hours whereas with Axe it seems to be gone more or less when you get out of the shower.    I&#x27;d be interested in trying other Old Spice body washes after I run through the 6 month supply of this stuff, lol.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and I use this and LOVE IT! I purchased this in a gift set for my bf and he doesnt like OS so i gave it a go. I feel a million times cleaner than I would have felt had I used any other body wash. I felt super fresh and clean all day and the smell wasnt overpowering. I think it works for women as well since it has a slightly fruity scent. I will continue to use this and the deodorant as well.</li>
            <li> I have to admit,I thought Old Spice was for old men. I never cared for their cologne. Me and husband saw the new body wash commercials and still decided to at least try them out on him.    I LOVE this stuff! My husband smells great for a very long time,without it being overpowering.He uses it in the mornings and still smells so good when he comes back from work.It&#x27;s not some crusty old man scent either. It actually smells and performs better than those other \\&quot;trendy\\&quot; men&#x27;s soaps.We&#x27;re in our twenties,so this is good for all ages.His skin is also really touchable.Doesn&#x27;t dry him out.    So take a woman&#x27;s opinion on this one,try this stuff out!I&#x27;m sure the woman in your life will be all over you!</li>
            <li> glad to have this purchase option</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed in the scent.I had hoped it would smell like the underarm products of the same brand.It does not.It is however,an excellent product otherwise.</li>
            <li> I feel a bit disappointed with this product. I think my expectations were all above the roof because of the previous reviews I read about it. I was looking for something with a better scent, I think. Next time I&#x27;ll be better off trying something from the store rather than buying some unknown product off internet. You know, there&#x27;s still this limitation of being unable to smell, taste, try on things from online stores before stepping forward and paying for the items you need.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and we both love the way it smells. We did do some price comparison and it is WAY cheaper at walmart - both in stores and online.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across Swagger when I was at a store with a former coworker and we were looking at the different body washes. She grabbed a bottle of Swagger and said \\&quot;This smells like a hot guy.\\&quot; I was curious (partly because I liked her) so I took a whiff and I instantly loved it, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I&#x27;m a weird guy when it comes to smells. I&#x27;m very picky about things like deodorant, laundry detergent, and body wash--it all has to come together in a perfect combination of masculine but pleasant scents--and Swagger is the only body wash that I use, despite the fact that I feel like a giant tool when I buy a body wash called \\&quot;Swagger.\\&quot; The other Old Spice body washes are kind of mediocre, but they knocked it out of the park with this one. Women have always commented on how good I smell when I use this stuff. One of my exes said that it smells like \\&quot;delicious man.\\&quot; Seriously, your smell is important, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This body wash keeps me clean and smelling great for hours. The bluish color lets me know if i haven&#x27;t scrubbed it off, preventing embarrassing moments aka loss of swagger.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses this body wash. He&#x27;s clean and smells good, so it gets a thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body washes that I have tried. I love the smell of it and it leaves me very clean feeling. No residue, or tightness of skin. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this body wash and find the name entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not overpowering, but it does clean you up.</li>
            <li> This was a deal at the price. I actually thought I was getting the smaller bottles lol.</li>
            <li> This is something we usually buy in the store but I always forget it.  So buying it in the 3 pack is really easy for me.  It is good body wash and my husband loves it.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> No hyperbole required to describe the unparalleled greatness that is Old Spice Swagger.  The scent is incredible, and it does actually stay on your skin. Not like bad laundry detergent stays on your clothes, just enough where if you happen to be within an inch or two of your skin, you will catch a whiff of the super-fresh awesomeness.  I&#x27;ve also never used another soap that lathers like this one. Suds for days!</li>
            <li> This was a gift...it was well received</li>
            <li> Awesome body wash. I was using Old Spice Game Changer, but recently switched to Swagger. I get a lot of compliments about the smell</li>
            <li> I like the Old Spice Body Wash line. Swagger is a good smell and you can get matching deodorant. It foams up rather nicely and certainly leaves you feeling clean. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> There was a time when if you uttered the words Old Spice, you immediately thought of someone that dressed like Mr. Roper from Three&#x27;s Company shirt open, chest hairs blowing in the wind, a mullet reeking of some of the finest Old Spice scents this side of CVS.  There was a time when Old Spice smelled more like Old Bay.  I remember laughing at my friend for telling me he used Axe boxy wash and one of those holey sponge things that the ladies use.  \\&quot;You gurly mon\\&quot;.  Men using body wash?  That&#x27;s so metrosexual.  But what the hell, it can be our little secret.  Now fast forward to 2011.  Old Spice made a come back.  I still wouldn&#x27;t touch their colognes (do they still make colognes)?  But after visiting my in-laws, my brother in-law had some Old Spice body wash and I took a sniff.  Mmmmm, not bad.  I then proceeded to use it up, never replacing it.  In-laws, gotta love em.      The swagger scent definitely has some swag to it.  It&#x27;s body wash so how much of a review can I really give?  It smells good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts 8 hrs.  Then again.  When you&#x27;re living between Maryland and hell, trying to survive climate change melting in record high temps even the best body wash couldn&#x27;t keep you smelling good for 8 hours.    Specifically speaking of this product on Amazon, the 3 pack.  LOOOOVE IT!  I didn&#x27;t even realize it was a 3 pack until I received it.  Win!  I really want to try some different scents of the Old Spice body wash to find the perfect scent.  But I don&#x27;t want to waste money and possibly not like the scent.  If you&#x27;re listening Old Spice send me some samples!      This one however is a winner.</li>
            <li> Very thick and lathers well. The smell is amazing and has become my favorite out of all the Old Spice soaps. I also ordered up the Swagger deodorant go along with it.</li>
            <li> my grandson loves this</li>
            <li> I got this after trying their mountain and ocean scent stuff which smelled good, but didn&#x27;t really last.  Not only does this have a nice long lasting scent, it made me go through puberty again.</li>
            <li> Great product smells great. Last long time, your will get plenty of complements from this scent. I have been using this product for quite some time and love it.</li>
            <li> Swagger is my absolute favorite Old Spice sent. When combined with the body spray and deodorant, it still doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses. It leaves me feeling clean all day, smells good all day, and most importantly, smells NATURAL all day. I&#x27;ve got friends and family with very sensitive noses who are very quick to complain about powerful smells, and not once have they complained to me about it. My face is also extremely sensitive and I find that it tolerates this body wash quite well -- better than any actual facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used to this point. This bottle lasts for quite a long time, too, so I usually don&#x27;t have to buy it again for about a month or two.</li>
            <li> I love Old spice product, every one I get in contact with right after my shower they seem to like it very much as well. Make you smell very good but dries the heck out of your skin though. If you have sensitive skin perhaps get something that hydrates the skin. I dont have sensitive skin so this does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of the old spice brand, it has a very noticeable good smelling scent to it. It&#x27;s the only brand/scent combo of body wash that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li> Love this product but Old Spice seems to change their formulas every couple of years and this one is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> I ordered other items with this purchase but it seemed the body wash was the laziest packed of them all. It only had its manufactured plastic wrap on it that left a lot of room for it to be banged around as it did. It leaked through out my box but luckily did not get on my other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a better note this body wash smells amazing. Just needs to be packed better.</li>
            <li> After going through numerous bottles of Axe, Gillette and Dial body wash and not finding any that I remotely liked, I figured I would give Old Spice Swagger a try.  And I have to say, this is BY FAR the best body wash I have ever used.    The scent is great; anyone worried about smelling like their grandfather need not worry, since this is nowhere near the classic Old Spice scent. It is much more sporty, with nary a trace of classic Old Spice. The one thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and the scent lasts. And I do mean LASTS. The \\&quot;8-hour scent technology\\&quot; is no mere puffery; it DOES last for that long. But it is not overpowering or overly perfumy, so you won&#x27;t offend anyone in close quarters. In fact, after using this and Swagger body spray, I would recommend using only the body wash and a good deodorant; that should last you for the whole day.    Finally, it passed the wife test: after no comments about the Axe, Gillette or Dial washes, my wife definitely took notice when I first used Swagger. She absolutely LOVES the scent. And lastly, if it&#x27;s good for LL Cool J, Brian Urlacher and Tony Stewart, how can it not be good for you?</li>
            <li> ...or with me. I use other soaps. But when I do, I get the pout and the ask &amp;#34;why? I wanted to smell you when I took my shower?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can argue with that logic? Highly recommended for men who respect their smelf.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have old spice from where i come from and i regularly ship this over because of how much i love the smell! My siblings and girlfriend like to take their showers after me just for the scent! IMO, It definitely doesn&#x27;t last for 8 hours but it could be due to the high humidity here. I personally find that it lasts for about an hour, but that could just be my lousy smell. I&#x27;d still recommend this though, it lathers really well and the blue color makes it really easy to see.</li>
            <li> great body wash with an amazing smell and i wouldnt have bought so many of them if i werent thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I always get complements from women about how good I smell. They think I am wearing cologne.  I am shocked at the high price amazon has on this product.  Your local store sells it for $3 a bottle. This is almost $4 less than amazon.  Come on amazon,be more competitive.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this product a 3/5. I chose this because when I received the package, one of the bottle had leaked all over the box, leaving one of the bottles more empty than the other two. I got this as a gift, so I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this one to my favorite which is [[ASIN:B004A7VFHG Gillette Fresh and Clean Cool Wave Body Wash, 16-Ounce (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell : A little less professional then the Gillette Cool Wave, meaning it&#x27;s got more of a fruity smell then a clean scent.  The lady wasn&#x27;t as keen to notice the scent on me, meaning it&#x27;s a lighter scent, which some may like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather : Doesn&#x27;t lather nearly as thick as the Cool Wave, so I end up using more of the swagger.  Although compared to [[ASIN:B002TSA91Q Dove Men + Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh, 18 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] it lather much better.  I still consider it be an acceptable amount of lather for a body wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: Is a neon blue, which makes it easy to see on the loofah, the Gillette is more of a dark blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser:  Swagger wins on this one, a very controlled amount comes out with a moderate squeeze.  The Gillette pours out when you open it and is hard to squeeze out smaller amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like this body wash and would buy again, just not as much as the Gillette because of the reasons above.</li>
            <li> First of all let me just say that I love this body wash.  It has a good smell, lathers up nicely, and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star review is because I can&#x27;t believe someone thinks it&#x27;s ok to sell a 3-pack for $30!  $10 a bottle?  Are you out of your mind!?  Soap.com sells them for $5.50 each.  The Dollar General website sells the *6-pack* for $24!  Find it somewhere else. This is a price gouging embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Great body wash for men!</li>
            <li> Nothing special as it does not stand out above other body wash soaps.  I would buy it again.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s going to be a while before switch to something else. Plus the commercials are awesome.</li>
            <li> This Body Wash has a strange scent. It is almost like the Pure Sport but has a sweet aroma to it. It really does not seem that is in the Old Spice traditional. It does foam up quite well like most of the Body Washes I have tried. The scent however, just seems to elude me and is rather non distinct.</li>
            <li> Smells great but does not last as long as it claims. After a few hours the scent disappears.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells pretty good! The smell rocks! I would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re a guy.</li>
            <li> They changed the ingredients.  It smells AWFUL now.&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant is still good/ original.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling body wash for men out there right now, if you aren&#x27;t smell savvy, go ask a girl to shop with you. Tons and tons of compliments, it really does last a long time after taking a shower. Its like a cologne and body wash combination. Just wear some neutral deodorant so you don&#x27;t have clashing smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two cents, the bar soap and deodorant of the same \\&quot;Swagger\\&quot; smell, don&#x27;t quite match the awesome that this body wash delivers. Weaker/different scent.</li>
            <li> First time trying this body wash and I really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> smells pretty good. lathers nice.</li>
            <li> IT WAS FANTASTIC,WHEN IT WAS A RED LIQUID.MY ABSOLUTE F A V O R I T E.  NOW IT IS BLUE AND STINKS. I THINK SOMEBODY SOLD PHONEY STUFF OR....SOMEONE SCREWED UP...TOTALLY BAD..BEWARE...</li>
            <li> The man of the house smells good and thus just enhances it!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, I have had numerous coworkers tell me I smelled great at work, and I have been using it for 2 years but I just hate its name...so I switched to &#x27;denali&#x27; scent recently and like it just as much.. except I&#x27;m not embarrassed to tell anyone what it is.</li>
            <li> I smell great. Never left the house</li>
            <li> Yea I really like this body wash. Every time my man uses it right after he is out of the shower I definitely get turned on! Great smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is even like 6 hours later I smell his arm and he still smells like the swagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this soap is not harsh and does not dry out his skin. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize it either but no male body wash does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is what Outkast meant by &amp;#34;So Fresh and So Clean, Clean!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Love IT****</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Lasts a while and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Five SPICY Stars! Old Spice Swagger comes from the “Red Zone” line and unlike competitors that make loft claims of long periods of effectiveness and fail. Swagger realistically advertises 8 hours as its goal, while using a variation of the classic “ship that sails the ocean&amp;#34; scent of Old Spice After Shave. Suds up well, leaving that familiar scent around in declining levels for 8 hours while the effectiveness of the skin cleansing goes well beyond that time period. Highly Recommended. (Old Spice Swagger Body Wash in a 16 ounce plastic bottle.)</li>
            <li> Cleans well, the bottle is easy to hold and open with soapy hands and I get many compliments on how good I smell!</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my husband as he likes the old spice body washes, and this deal was an excellent one. He hadn&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;Swagger\\&quot; before, nor had I smelled it...but I figured Old Spice typically smells pretty nice regardless. Received these bad boys yesterday and oh man....one smell and I was hooked. My husband immediately became more attractive after the first shower he took while using this as his body wash. So much so, he ended up having to take a second shower...ya dig. Ladies, I recommend this to you for your men, and men, I recommend this to you should you like the ladies...or hell, even if you don&#x27;t. The smell is so fly it should rock anyone&#x27;s socks....right off of them.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the smell that stays with you all day.  Why is this so much more expensive than in other sites?  Amazon always has the best price.  Why not on this one?</li>
