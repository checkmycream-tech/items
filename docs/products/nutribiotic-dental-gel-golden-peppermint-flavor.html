            <li> My gums are bleeding badly after using this product twice a day for 2 weeks anyone else having this problem?</li>
            <li> Love it. Teeth feel cleaner and gums are a nice even pink color.&lt;br /&gt;Going to the dentist next week for cleaning and anxious to see the results.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE THE SIZE NEED TO BE BIGGER.</li>
            <li> Great product and great taste.  YES, the product does have fluoride which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this product! It is sweetened with Stevia so you know there is nothing in this product that is harmful to your system. It cleans your teeth beautifully. The product was delivered quickly too, which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste  has really help my teeth and has whitened them some too thanks</li>
            <li> i recently ordered this online thinking it would help me cure my gingivitis, well 4 days of using this 2 times a day i am now starting to think other wise...    Because instead of my gums turning pink they turn a dark red after each brush and remain that way for an hour, then return to normal light red color.    This toothpaste is not for every one be cautious of GSE liquid concentrate..    if you are going to use it as a mouth wash, PLEASE DONT it will destroy your gum tissue</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my Nutritional Chiropracter - I have been using this toothpaste exclusively since 2010 - I have had the BEST dental hygenist checkups in my entire life especiially in reduction of built-up plaque.  I have a thyroid issue; this is one part of my prescribed regimine - it is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this when I had a chronic sinus infection and repeated antibiotics had failed to successfully treat. I bought this in addition to the Nutribiotic Nasal Spray and Grapefruit Seed Extract tablets. It worked! The sinus infection that had lasted for 6 months despite antibiotics, is now gone. The soothing toothpaste makes mouth, gums &amp; tongue feel clean w/o a strong taste. Even my kids like it, which I now prefer they use, being concerned with the ingestion of fluoride in their developing bodies. A great product, one I would now recommend to everyone instead of chronic antibiotic use!</li>
            <li> Product was thicker - wasn&#x27;t like gel.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gel that did not contain fluoride because we get tons of fluoride in our water.  I am pleasantly surprised and how it cleans my teeth and works on the tartar too.  I recommend this gel to anyone looking for a non-fluoride gel that works well.</li>
            <li> I used one of their products before- liked it. This one- not so much. Teeth does not feel clean. It feels as if I had some residue left after brushing. I am not sure what to do with my second tube!!!</li>
            <li> Not much of a flavor, leaves no after taste.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very good tooth gel.  I haven&#x27;t tried it long enough yet to give any results.</li>
            <li> I like the Nutribiotic Dental Gel very much.  My mouth is very sensitive and most mint toothpastes irritate it.  This one does not and it always leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> After trying several pastes for mostly receding gum issues, this by far has been the best all around mouth care. The pastes were great, but even with one of them, my toothbrush was gummed (no pun intended) up, took forever to clean it and really did not target the gums specifically. Reading about aloe and other properties, I found this and this one has become my favorite paste. The gel is not loose, tastes a nice mint and leaves an extremely clean feel to my teeth and gums. I will continue to purchase this one and have passed on my used tubes to a friend a work who has other issues.</li>
            <li> The image in the picture says peppermint, which is what I thought I was ordering, but what I received was Dental Gel Plus (plus whitening).  I don&#x27;t like the taste of the whitening Dental Gel, but I&#x27;ve got it now so I guess I&#x27;ll use it.  As for the Peppermint, I prefer to use toothpaste without fluoride and this works really well and really doesn&#x27;t taste bad. In fact, I like that it doesn&#x27;t totally destroy your taste buds after using it like regular toothpaste does.</li>
            <li> works well, gums are in better condition in just one month</li>
            <li> I like the way it taste; hope it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Yuck!  I spent way too much $$ on this item--and hated the medicinie taste.  My husband says it is fine, but never used it.  I could not send it back (unreturnable it said on Amazon??), so threw it out.  I know the ingredients are good for you, but I like my toothpaste to taste good too.  Just way TOO healthy for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this toothpaste! I love the natural ingredients, that it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride ( found to be harmful and a possible carcinogenic, not to meantion it calcifies your &#x27;third eye&#x27; chakra) the flavor and lasting freshness is unparalleled  Do yourself the favor and switch over 🙌🏽</li>
            <li> taste needs more peppermint</li>
            <li> This is a good product, very satisfied with it and the results.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! The taste is good, not bitter like GSE can be. I love using it and think the GSE is really good for my oral health too.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite toothpastes. Tastes great and healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It was recommended by my chiropractor and works great.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and toxins that normal toothpaste has.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I rate product high because of the ingredients.  Great product. Helps my breath to remain very pleasant throughout the day</li>
            <li> This is the second flavor I&#x27;ve tried  of nutribiotic toothpaste.  It makes your mouth feel REALLY clean, it is the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. It really leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh. I hate toothpaste with baking soda cause itt leaves a nasty taste in my mouth and a whitte coat on myy tongue but this one does not.</li>
            <li> been using this product for 25 years.  no dental problems.  This is a great dental gel and when i stopped using it for a couple months, my sensitive teeth bothered me again.  Gums are better with it too.  Yes, more expensive to use but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and is hard to find now. I use instead of regular toothpaste. great taste</li>
            <li> If you want a nice clean taste (no aftertaste) and superior germ fighter, then get this Dental Gel! I have been using it for years and it works.</li>
            <li> I leaves a strange aftertaste but seems to work effectively.  My teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as when I use mainstream products like Crest and Colgate.  I will probably not buy more when it is all gone.</li>
