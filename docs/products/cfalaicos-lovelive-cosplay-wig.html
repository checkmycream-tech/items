            <li>The wig is absolutely stunning and the two toned pink is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love the wig headphones are cheaply made but over all im</li>
            <li>They still look great, and I highly recommend buying this!&lt;br /&gt;Ships out faster than originally told as well, got the product in 4 days compared to the almost two weeks originally stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re borderline styrofoam, because they made styro-scratchy noises when I tried to adjust one of the top wire things.</li>
            <li>The wig is a must for Super Sonico though!</li>
            <li>The wig is gorgeous, soft, easy to style, and comfortable to wear.</li>

            <li>Also, the headphones are cheap hand-painted plastic/styrofoam.</li>
            <li>As for the headphones they are made out of foam, however that comes with the advantage of them being light.</li>
            <li>Headphones are cheaply made but they will do</li>
            <li>It came relatively fast, way before the actual quoted delivery date, which is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>I  received my package today which I was super excited about</li>
            <li>It appears handmade and mostly true to the Sonico look.</li>
            <li>It also comes with the headphones and they look cool,</li>
            <li>The wig is true to the colourin the image.</li>
            <li>thank you very much  !</li>
            <li>The headphones are fragile, but are light and look pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I order this wig for my Super Sonico cosplay I am doing and so far I love this wig ^-^.</li>
            <li>I can hear just fine as they rest on the top of my ears, and they won&#x27;t weigh down during a con and will be very comfortable to wear for a whole day.</li>
            <li>is very soft as well as easy to style.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I do wish later versions of the headphones would use more molded plastic for durability.  </li>
            <li>Great for Sonico.&lt;br /&gt;Headphones are craft foam and delicate.</li>
            <li>It is exactly like on the stock pictures.</li>
            <li>The wig is two toned, with a more vibrant pink at the ends, and pastel pink at top, super accurate picture.</li>
            <li>I was aware I was getting fragile headphones, BUT GOOD LORD ARE THEY FRAGILE.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>very satisfiyed</li>
            <li>The handmade headphones fell apart really fast.</li>
            <li>However the headphone prop is mostly made of soft and fragile foam.</li>
            <li>Overall the wig itself makes it worth the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love how it came out</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig is cute, it&#x27;s a light pink layered over a layer of darker pink hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>this wig is really full and fluffy and the two colors make it look really pretty and the headset is fairly accurate but pretty fragile so be careful with it</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, and would highly  recommend this to anyone considering purchase.</li>
            <li>The texture of the wig is very soft.</li>
            <li>The headphones are a bit filmsy, they are not actual usable headphones, straight prop.</li>
            <li>The bangs are pretty long so you might have to cut it short to your desired.</li>
            <li>It has a 2 tone colors (dark and light pink).</li>
            <li>The wig is two toned in light and slightly darker shades of pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to brush and soft but a little thick.</li>
            <li>When I pulled it out of the bag I was a little worried as it appeared very shiny.</li>

            <li> good for fixing up and having a starting base to work with.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long for it to come not that I don&#x27;t mind the wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little longer than the picture, but that could be because I&#x27;m very short and have a short torso.</li>
            <li> but like other people say, they are kinda fragile</li>
            <li> only reason I give it 1 less star is because of the delicacy of the headphones.</li>
            <li> it also came with a few extra gift things...</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before purchasing so</li>
            <li> The headphones were a bit small and they were very very VERY fragile.</li>
            <li> The wig is soft and thick, but the bangs are a little weird...</li>
            <li> If you try to find the Sonico headphones by themselves, they&#x27;re usually $50</li>
            <li> Seller even included a few small gifts!</li>
            <li> +, so I was SHOCKED to find both the wig AND headphones for under $50!!!</li>

            <li> The wig is soft and thick, but the bangs are a little weird... I&#x27;ll probably have to re-cut/style them myself. Also, the headphones are cheap hand-painted plastic/styrofoam. Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I totally love this wig. When I pulled it out of the bag I was a little worried as it appeared very shiny. Turns out it was just the lighting in my room haha. It&#x27;s a little longer than the picture, but that could be because I&#x27;m very short and have a short torso. As for the headphones they are made out of foam, however that comes with the advantage of them being light. I can hear just fine as they rest on the top of my ears, and they won&#x27;t weigh down during a con and will be very comfortable to wear for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Love the wig headphones are cheaply made but over all im very satisfiyed it also came with a few extra gift things... already have my sonico cosplay done!</li>
            <li> This was a great quality wig. It arrived eleven days prior to when we were told the earliest arrival would be. The headphones are fragile, but are light and look pretty nice. The wig is gorgeous, soft, easy to style, and comfortable to wear. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, and would highly  recommend this to anyone considering purchase.</li>
            <li> I  received my package today which I was super excited about and it didn&#x27;t take long for it to come not that I don&#x27;t mind the wait. I have everything in the box that I needed and I loved them all thank you very much  !(^^) I also love the price for it</li>
            <li> this wig is really full and fluffy and the two colors make it look really pretty and the headset is fairly accurate but pretty fragile so be careful with it</li>
            <li> The wig is absolutely stunning and the two toned pink is wonderful. The headset is a bit fragile but as with all cosplay props, just handle with care. Seller even included a few small gifts! Very nice, love it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The wig is two toned in light and slightly darker shades of pink. Great quality! The headphones look great for cosplay! However the headphone prop is mostly made of soft and fragile foam. It appears handmade and mostly true to the Sonico look. Overall the wig itself makes it worth the price! I do wish later versions of the headphones would use more molded plastic for durability.  I am however satisfied with the item!</li>
            <li> If you try to find the Sonico headphones by themselves, they&#x27;re usually $50+, so I was SHOCKED to find both the wig AND headphones for under $50!!! Couldn&#x27;t believe it, bought it without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is cute, it&#x27;s a light pink layered over a layer of darker pink hair. Shiny, whatevs, good quality and netting doesn&#x27;t show, they even cut the bangs the way the pic is styled. (which I add because some sellers sell the wigs with the bangs not cut, you have to do it yourself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 1 less star is because of the delicacy of the headphones. I read the other reviews before purchasing so I was aware I was getting fragile headphones, BUT GOOD LORD ARE THEY FRAGILE. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re borderline styrofoam, because they made styro-scratchy noises when I tried to adjust one of the top wire things. But!! They&#x27;re usable and hopefully nobody slams into my head at a convention. For the price though, it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This wig is fantastic!!! It&#x27;s texture is very soft as well as easy to style. The headphones as everyone else has said, are just plastic however what do you expect for the price? They still look great, and I highly recommend buying this!&lt;br /&gt;Ships out faster than originally told as well, got the product in 4 days compared to the almost two weeks originally stated.</li>
            <li> The wig is great. The color flows nicely and it stays on nicely ( I even walked into a tree and it stayed on). The headphones were a bit small and they were very very VERY fragile. They looked to be made from a headband, foam, and wooden dowels which wasn&#x27;t going to stand up to being worn, poked, touched, and bumped all day, so I couldn&#x27;t use them. The wig is a must for Super Sonico though!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!! The headphones are super delicate, so be careful!</li>
            <li> Wig is wonserful. Headphones are cheaply made but they will do</li>
            <li> Got it just before the delivery date, was just amazing and great quality wig and headset!</li>
            <li> wig is A+ quality. Great for Sonico.&lt;br /&gt;Headphones are craft foam and delicate. I will add worbla to them and make improvements. good for fixing up and having a starting base to work with. They made me drop my rating for this product.</li>
            <li> It came relatively fast, way before the actual quoted delivery date, which is pretty awesome! The wig is two toned, with a more vibrant pink at the ends, and pastel pink at top, super accurate picture. The headphones are a bit filmsy, they are not actual usable headphones, straight prop. Quality wise, youre paying more for the wig, but I&#x27;m happy with both items. I&#x27;m using it for this years Cherry Blossom festival and cant wait to cosplay Sonico :)</li>
            <li> My wig came yesterday. I order this wig for my Super Sonico cosplay I am doing and so far I love this wig ^-^. It is exactly like on the stock pictures. It has a 2 tone colors (dark and light pink). The texture of the wig is very soft. The bangs are pretty long so you might have to cut it short to your desired. It also comes with the headphones and they look cool, but like other people say, they are kinda fragile so if you are looking for a sturdy, well made headphones, you might have to go to a different seller to buy one ^^;. Other than that, I love how it came out and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it (♡ﾟ▽ﾟ♡).</li>
            <li> The wig is true to the colourin the image. It&#x27;s also easy to brush and soft but a little thick. The handmade headphones fell apart really fast.</li>
