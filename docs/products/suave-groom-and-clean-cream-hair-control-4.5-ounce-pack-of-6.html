            <li>Product arrived nicely packed and as advertised.</li>
            <li>Groom &amp; Clean hair control works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will warn that this stuff is VERY strong in smell.  </li>
            <li>VERY strong chemical scent.</li>
            <li>By far the best gel ever!   </li>
            <li>It is by far the best gel I have encountered.  </li>
            <li>What I really love about this product is that it lasts all day and washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>If I use more than a dab of it at once the smell of it chokes me when I&#x27;m in the car.  </li>
            <li>It works great on me too, and I have normal/oily hair that is pin straight.</li>
            <li>I like it and have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff looks like gel holds like grease</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product that hold and</li>
            <li>add more if more hold</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 25 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 15 years</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that they aren&#x27;t making it any more.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended it to many.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite hair care product, he has used it for 50 yrs.</li>
            <li>what else could be better</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>When you have hair and want it to be nice and clean</li>
            <li>Apologies for the long review, but I hope it helps in your search for the best hair product for you.</li>
            <li>After all, people were saying it holds better than Brylcreem but combs through easy unlike pomades.</li>
            <li>Have used many other products and find this one the best from a grooming aspect to the cost.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy catching the occassional whiff of it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light on the hair and washes away easily with water.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years, easy to apply, water soluble</li>
            <li>so it washes out easy and rinses off hands easily.  </li>
            <li>Groom &amp; clean is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Water soluble, it rinses out easily and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE USED GROOM AND CLEAN FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>It works and it comes out easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Mineral oil is part of what makes them so great at what they do, which is make it easy to create well-groomed looking styles with a deep shine.  </li>
            <li>Rather, it&#x27;s a very pleasant fresh, somewhat sweet and spice-like fragrance reminiscent of those Dutch windmill cookies.  </li>
            <li>The product rinses out easily and leaves my hair clean and</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses this stuff regularly and it keeps his hair under control and looking great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dirt cheap too.     </li>
            <li>If you know what you should expect before you buy this product, then you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a light hold.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, your hair will have a light oily feel and look to it.  </li>
            <li>It provides a light, managable control of my hair and provides a light shine to my hair without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it really does keep your hair in healthy condition.</li>
            <li>I wish them much luck !!!                   </li>
            <li>This gel adds a nice shiny effect to my hair, particularly when styled.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too, which is important for a hair gel (particularly if you have someone close to you).</li>
            <li>It smells unique, like spiced pumpkin.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it keeps my hear clean and manageable between shampoo washes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also helps to hide dandruff, which is good for times when appearance is important, such as job interviews.  </li>
            <li>I use Groom &amp; Clean.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews of Groom &amp; Clean before I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet, spicy scent that I recognize from somewhere but can&#x27;t be sure exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve started using Groom &amp; Clean, I don&#x27;t have that issue any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Groom and Clean for a number of years.</li>
            <li>Controls your hair, controls dandruff, doesn&#x27;t build up, not greasy, and washes cleanly off your hands.   </li>
            <li>I have used Groom &amp; Clean for years to keep my hair from blowing all over in the Wyoming wind we &#x27;sometimes&#x27; receive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Groom and Clean for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Groom and Clean for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is very good and a little goes</li>
            <li>Is this true?</li>
            <li>Its smell is about as strong as that of after shave, so you can&#x27;t really use it with after shave, cologne or scented deodorant because the scents clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while the smell is pleasant, it&#x27;s disturbingly similar to the smell of a urinal cake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, holds hair well without being stiff, and smells great too.</li>
            <li>Works great when other products don&#x27;t hold hair in place</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; ingredients that are supposed to clean away dirt and dandruff, but it does feel very light in the hair, never heavy, and dandruff is not visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li>but it will hold everything in place with a more natural, softer oily appearance.</li>
            <li>Price is the lowest on the market and they deliver right on time.  </li>
            <li>Groom &amp; Clean is probably the precursor to modern hair gel.  </li>
            <li>It mixes in your hands and distributes even more easily in the hair; definitely easier than Brylcreem and both modern and vintage creams and pomades.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Groom &amp; Clean to anyone who wants to keep their unruly hair under control and would like it to have a sheen but not greasy look.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells or work in an environment where things like that are frowned upon, it&#x27;s something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t care for this product as I thought the hold was too lax but now use it all the time.</li>
            <li>sure enough it was here in a six pack!</li>
            <li>Enough for a year or more of hair styling.</li>
            <li>My husband has complained for awhile that he has not been able to find Groom &amp; Clean, and it was the only product he liked to use on his hair.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, wish I would have found it a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Now I read several reviews that noted the strong scent, one person even said it was like a pumpkin bread smell.</li>
            <li>Local super market no longer carries this product - AMAZON to the rescue!</li>
            <li>Does what it claims and it got here fast.</li>
            <li>cannot get it much longer....</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s water soluble it came out much easier than pomade and even Brylcreem.</li>
            <li>I would enjoy doing business with this company in the future.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>The length of your hair and how much hold you want will determine how much of the product you should use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t hold it completely straight.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuf.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it washes off with water.  </li>
            <li>Groom and Clean keeps my hair soft, but completely manageable.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair afterwards feels entirely TOO clean.</li>
            <li>Once you work it into your hair, it&#x27;s very easy to achieve a slick and sophisticated style, and like other products of the era, you can recomb (i.e. \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give the high gloss, greasy shine of a pomade</li>
            <li>far as the scent is concerned, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Brylcreem, but Groom and Clean is not greasy, works well keeping hair from being dry and &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Kind of lightly oiled and finger combed back, tucked behind his ear.</li>
            <li>But it might for normal hair.</li>
            <li>Now in regards to the hold: I find that Brylcreem offers much more control over how the hair is styled, but a wee bit less hold once the hair is in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Groom &amp; Clean for many years  but lately could not find it in any of the local stores.  </li>
            <li>The product is now very hard to find in stores, so this is a great deal - especially since it&#x27;s cheaper than it was in the store.</li>
            <li>The dry look was just over the horizon, but nonetheless Groom &amp; Clean positioned itself as a direct alternative to the greasy reputation of creams like Brylcreem and Wildroot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But as with any product like this, the \\&quot;oiliness\\&quot; depends almost entirely on how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough at your local drug store to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a trade-off you have to live with with all of these old school grooms.  </li>
            <li>After washing out Groom and Clean, my hair felt dry and dead and my hands (which I used to apply it and to help wash it out) felt like they do after I clean the bathroom with bleach.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair feeling soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>And after buying it and using it for nearly three months, I like it.  </li>
            <li>It will still be soft and pliable, but will hold in place.  </li>
            <li>As usual, the Amazon experience was easy and shipment was prompt.</li>
            <li>Tried other hair products and always come back to Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female with very curly (not frizzy) blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>This is just personal preference, but I like my hair to have a bit of weight to it, whether the weight comes from natural hair oils or from a product.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for years, works for me, just enough hair control to make it look natural.</li>
            <li>Not grease like alot of others and keeps your hair nice all day without fail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of an odd duck because it came out in the mid-60&#x27;s, right at the tail end of the \\&quot;wet head\\&quot; era.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> But since I&#x27;ve started using Groom &amp; Clean, I don&#x27;t have that issue any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Groom and Clean for a number of years.</li>
            <li> Controls your hair, controls dandruff, doesn&#x27;t build up, not greasy, and washes cleanly off your hands.   </li>
            <li> I have used Groom &amp; Clean for years to keep my hair from blowing all over in the Wyoming wind we &#x27;sometimes&#x27; receive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Groom and Clean for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Groom and Clean for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very good and a little goes</li>
            <li> Is this true?</li>
            <li> Its smell is about as strong as that of after shave, so you can&#x27;t really use it with after shave, cologne or scented deodorant because the scents clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while the smell is pleasant, it&#x27;s disturbingly similar to the smell of a urinal cake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, holds hair well without being stiff, and smells great too.</li>
            <li> Works great when other products don&#x27;t hold hair in place</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; ingredients that are supposed to clean away dirt and dandruff, but it does feel very light in the hair, never heavy, and dandruff is not visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li> but it will hold everything in place with a more natural, softer oily appearance.</li>
            <li> Price is the lowest on the market and they deliver right on time.  </li>
            <li> Groom &amp; Clean is probably the precursor to modern hair gel.  </li>
            <li> It mixes in your hands and distributes even more easily in the hair; definitely easier than Brylcreem and both modern and vintage creams and pomades.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Groom &amp; Clean to anyone who wants to keep their unruly hair under control and would like it to have a sheen but not greasy look.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells or work in an environment where things like that are frowned upon, it&#x27;s something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for this product as I thought the hold was too lax but now use it all the time.</li>
            <li> sure enough it was here in a six pack!</li>
            <li> Enough for a year or more of hair styling.</li>
            <li> My husband has complained for awhile that he has not been able to find Groom &amp; Clean, and it was the only product he liked to use on his hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, wish I would have found it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Now I read several reviews that noted the strong scent, one person even said it was like a pumpkin bread smell.</li>
            <li> Local super market no longer carries this product - AMAZON to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Does what it claims and it got here fast.</li>
            <li> cannot get it much longer....</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s water soluble it came out much easier than pomade and even Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> I would enjoy doing business with this company in the future.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> The length of your hair and how much hold you want will determine how much of the product you should use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t hold it completely straight.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuf.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it washes off with water.  </li>
            <li> Groom and Clean keeps my hair soft, but completely manageable.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair afterwards feels entirely TOO clean.</li>
            <li> Once you work it into your hair, it&#x27;s very easy to achieve a slick and sophisticated style, and like other products of the era, you can recomb (i.e. \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give the high gloss, greasy shine of a pomade</li>
            <li> far as the scent is concerned, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Brylcreem, but Groom and Clean is not greasy, works well keeping hair from being dry and &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Kind of lightly oiled and finger combed back, tucked behind his ear.</li>
            <li> But it might for normal hair.</li>
            <li> Now in regards to the hold: I find that Brylcreem offers much more control over how the hair is styled, but a wee bit less hold once the hair is in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Groom &amp; Clean for many years  but lately could not find it in any of the local stores.  </li>
            <li> The product is now very hard to find in stores, so this is a great deal - especially since it&#x27;s cheaper than it was in the store.</li>
            <li> The dry look was just over the horizon, but nonetheless Groom &amp; Clean positioned itself as a direct alternative to the greasy reputation of creams like Brylcreem and Wildroot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as with any product like this, the \\&quot;oiliness\\&quot; depends almost entirely on how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough at your local drug store to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a trade-off you have to live with with all of these old school grooms.  </li>
            <li> After washing out Groom and Clean, my hair felt dry and dead and my hands (which I used to apply it and to help wash it out) felt like they do after I clean the bathroom with bleach.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair feeling soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> And after buying it and using it for nearly three months, I like it.  </li>
            <li> It will still be soft and pliable, but will hold in place.  </li>
            <li> As usual, the Amazon experience was easy and shipment was prompt.</li>
            <li> Tried other hair products and always come back to Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female with very curly (not frizzy) blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> This is just personal preference, but I like my hair to have a bit of weight to it, whether the weight comes from natural hair oils or from a product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, works for me, just enough hair control to make it look natural.</li>
            <li> Not grease like alot of others and keeps your hair nice all day without fail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of an odd duck because it came out in the mid-60&#x27;s, right at the tail end of the \\&quot;wet head\\&quot; era.  </li>
            <li> It may be a small new compay, but they will go far and do well because they know how to treat a customer.</li>
            <li> keep in mind that it contains mineral oil, so guys with light brown or blond hair might find that their heads look a little oily late in the day.  </li>
            <li> Groom and Clean was hard to work with, and with the slightly improved hold came a reluctance to change once the product met the hair.</li>
            <li> scalp gets dry and itchy if I wash my hair too often, so I only shampoo it once every three days.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : I just wanted to add that my son has long hair</li>
            <li> If you apply a small amount to damp hair and comb it into place it will dry in place and look and feel very natural.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I would say it&#x27;s a little on the strong side, but it&#x27;s unfair to say that it smells like household cleaner or a urinal cake.  </li>
            <li> The primary reasons to purchase this item from Amazon is (1) this product is getting harder to find in stores and (2) it&#x27;s less expensive then in stores</li>
            <li> It has become harder and harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> I partially contribute some of that to other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> No hardening or flaking like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad smell, but it&#x27;s extraordinarily strong.</li>
            <li> This may not be applicable to smaller amounts, but smaller amounts wouldn&#x27;t tame my thick and slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t smell like I should be walking the streets after dark.  </li>
            <li> It has worked for me for over 30 years and never let me down.  </li>
            <li> It has a small amount of mineral oil in it so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes with a medium-large amount (about three inch-long portions) of Groom and Clean in my hair I felt sick.</li>
            <li> Start with a little (1/2 inch),  </li>
            <li> After I put it in my hair I can style it the way I want and my hair stays the way I styled it without being stiff or overly shiny.</li>
            <li> I like it because unlike gel, my hair won&#x27;t be stiff and it won&#x27;t turn into something that looks like dandruff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the products marketed for women because they make my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> To conclude, if you like to have a decent wet look and hate greasy hair, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about</li>
            <li> A small amount is all this is required.</li>
            <li> Start with a small dab then increase the amount until you get the look you want.</li>
            <li> A small amount holds every hair in place.</li>
            <li> Your hair won&#x27;t be hard or stiff.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Does not smell like urinal cakes at all...at least to me</li>
            <li> I find if I use a very small amount (pea size), that helps with the smell, and it&#x27;s all I need anyway.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t get that confused with \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I used to have really bad dandruff and build-up on my scalp.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does what it claims and it got here fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very good and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair short and only need a pea sized dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp gets dry and itchy if I wash my hair too often, so I only shampoo it once every three days.  I like this product because it keeps my hear clean and manageable between shampoo washes.  I can put it in when I get up in the morning, then rinse it out at night.  The product rinses out easily and leaves my hair clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps to hide dandruff, which is good for times when appearance is important, such as job interviews.  If you are prone to dandruff you can put some of this stuff in your hair before you leave for the interview and comb your hair again when you get there.  Any dandruff that was visible won&#x27;t be visible anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that this stuff is VERY strong in smell.  If I use more than a dab of it at once the smell of it chokes me when I&#x27;m in the car.  Its smell is about as strong as that of after shave, so you can&#x27;t really use it with after shave, cologne or scented deodorant because the scents clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while the smell is pleasant, it&#x27;s disturbingly similar to the smell of a urinal cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent for styling.  After I put it in my hair I can style it the way I want and my hair stays the way I styled it without being stiff or overly shiny.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this stuff regularly and it keeps his hair under control and looking great. It smells pretty good too, which is important for a hair gel (particularly if you have someone close to you). He has some of the frizziest hair I&#x27;ve ever seen and this is the only stuff that makes his hair sleek and shiny without it looking like he has dumped oil all over his head. By far the best gel ever!   It works great on me too, and I have normal/oily hair that is pin straight. This gel adds a nice shiny effect to my hair, particularly when styled.</li>
            <li> Very happy to find this product for my husband as for some reason it is no longer sold in stores.</li>
            <li> When you have hair and want it to be nice and clean I use Groom &amp; Clean.  It has worked for me for over 30 years and never let me down.  Not grease like alot of others and keeps your hair nice all day without fail.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, easy to apply, water soluble so it washes out easy and rinses off hands easily.  It is a great product</li>
            <li> cannot get it much longer....had to stock up....good price</li>
            <li> After reading up on this product, I decided to go pick some up. I&#x27;m a fan of Brylcreem and assorted pomades, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. After all, people were saying it holds better than Brylcreem but combs through easy unlike pomades. Now I read several reviews that noted the strong scent, one person even said it was like a pumpkin bread smell. I have to wholeheartedly disagree. To me, this product smells like a cleaning product for the bathroom. VERY strong chemical scent. After about 15 minutes with a medium-large amount (about three inch-long portions) of Groom and Clean in my hair I felt sick. This may not be applicable to smaller amounts, but smaller amounts wouldn&#x27;t tame my thick and slightly wavy hair. Now in regards to the hold: I find that Brylcreem offers much more control over how the hair is styled, but a wee bit less hold once the hair is in place. Groom and Clean was hard to work with, and with the slightly improved hold came a reluctance to change once the product met the hair. Dissatisfied with the smell and look of it in my hair, I washed it out. Because it&#x27;s water soluble it came out much easier than pomade and even Brylcreem. However, my hair afterwards feels entirely TOO clean. This is just personal preference, but I like my hair to have a bit of weight to it, whether the weight comes from natural hair oils or from a product. After washing out Groom and Clean, my hair felt dry and dead and my hands (which I used to apply it and to help wash it out) felt like they do after I clean the bathroom with bleach. To conclude, if you like to have a decent wet look and hate greasy hair, this is the product for you. Apologies for the long review, but I hope it helps in your search for the best hair product for you.</li>
            <li> It may be a small new compay, but they will go far and do well because they know how to treat a customer. I would enjoy doing business with this company in the future. I wish them much luck !!!                   Mort Lasnik  cakeman@sti.net</li>
            <li> It works as advertise, grease-less hair control. I like it because unlike gel, my hair won&#x27;t be stiff and it won&#x27;t turn into something that looks like dandruff. It&#x27;s dirt cheap too.     The only downside is the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad smell, but it&#x27;s extraordinarily strong. I find if I use a very small amount (pea size), that helps with the smell, and it&#x27;s all I need anyway.</li>
            <li> Products like this should be tried out personally and not be bought in bulk on the basis of someone&#x27;s recommendation.  I like it and have used it for many years.  The primary reasons to purchase this item from Amazon is (1) this product is getting harder to find in stores and (2) it&#x27;s less expensive then in stores (I saved at about a dollar a tube).  As usual, the Amazon experience was easy and shipment was prompt.</li>
            <li> Groom &amp; clean is fantastic! Easy to apply, holds hair well without being stiff, and smells great too. What I really love about this product is that it lasts all day and washes out very easily. On top of that it really does keep your hair in healthy condition. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Item as described and fair price</li>
            <li> Love this stuff looks like gel holds like grease couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product that hold and nigh cleans your hair when combing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - excellent delivery!</li>
            <li> Groom &amp; Clean is probably the precursor to modern hair gel.  It&#x27;s a bit of an odd duck because it came out in the mid-60&#x27;s, right at the tail end of the \\&quot;wet head\\&quot; era.  The dry look was just over the horizon, but nonetheless Groom &amp; Clean positioned itself as a direct alternative to the greasy reputation of creams like Brylcreem and Wildroot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the packaging says, it&#x27;s a water-based gel.  You don&#x27;t need much.  It mixes in your hands and distributes even more easily in the hair; definitely easier than Brylcreem and both modern and vintage creams and pomades.  Once you work it into your hair, it&#x27;s very easy to achieve a slick and sophisticated style, and like other products of the era, you can recomb (i.e. \\&quot;reactivate\\&quot;) it throughout the day.  I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; ingredients that are supposed to clean away dirt and dandruff, but it does feel very light in the hair, never heavy, and dandruff is not visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people talk about the scent.  Yeah, I would say it&#x27;s a little on the strong side, but it&#x27;s unfair to say that it smells like household cleaner or a urinal cake.  Rather, it&#x27;s a very pleasant fresh, somewhat sweet and spice-like fragrance reminiscent of those Dutch windmill cookies.  Speed Stick regular deodorant is close as well.  But if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells or work in an environment where things like that are frowned upon, it&#x27;s something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also keep in mind that it contains mineral oil, so guys with light brown or blond hair might find that their heads look a little oily late in the day.  But that&#x27;s a trade-off you have to live with with all of these old school grooms.  Mineral oil is part of what makes them so great at what they do, which is make it easy to create well-groomed looking styles with a deep shine.  But as with any product like this, the \\&quot;oiliness\\&quot; depends almost entirely on how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap enough at your local drug store to give it a shot.  If classic and neat is your thing, this is one of the best ways to achieve that look.of the best ways to achieve that look.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 25 years.  It is by far the best gel I have encountered.  It has a small amount of mineral oil in it so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.  If you apply a small amount to damp hair and comb it into place it will dry in place and look and feel very natural.  No hardening or flaking like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> Groom &amp; Clean is the best combination of shine and control.  Water soluble, it rinses out easily and leaves no residue.  Start with a little (1/2 inch),  add more if more hold and/or shine is desired.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that its water soluble, has a pleasant smell, NOT oily or greasy. It keeps your hair feeling soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 40 years. I use it every day after a shower. I like the texture of the gel and the fact that it is greaseless;&lt;br /&gt;therefore it does not stain pillow covers.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, works for me, just enough hair control to make it look natural. A small amount is all this is required. Applied to damp hair after a shampoo provides good hair control and it works all day. Local super market no longer carries this product - AMAZON to the rescue!</li>
            <li> This has been a great product.  Have used many other products and find this one the best from a grooming aspect to the cost.  Highly recommended.  Purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you know what you should expect before you buy this product, then you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  I read reviews of Groom &amp; Clean before I decided to give it a try.  I knew what to expect.  And after buying it and using it for nearly three months, I like it.  I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a light hold.  Your hair won&#x27;t be hard or stiff.  It will still be soft and pliable, but will hold in place.  The length of your hair and how much hold you want will determine how much of the product you should use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your hair shiny looking because it has mineral oil and lanolin in it.  Therefore, your hair will have a light oily feel and look to it.  But don&#x27;t get that confused with \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.  Because it&#x27;s not.  I know you&#x27;re probably thinking oily and greasy are the same thing...well, when it comes to ingredients, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent is concerned, I really like it.  Does not smell like urinal cakes at all...at least to me it doesn&#x27;t.  It smells spicy.  Can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.  I&#x27;ve heard it compared to zuccini bread or pumpkin pie.  But, that&#x27;s not it.  It&#x27;s a sweet, spicy scent that I recognize from somewhere but can&#x27;t be sure exactly what it is.  Whatever it is, it works for me and I enjoy catching the occassional whiff of it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light on the hair and washes away easily with water.  It leaves no residue.  I&#x27;m not sure what the cleaning properties of this product is supposed to be and what it does exactly, but whatever it does, it has improved my scalp.  I used to have really bad dandruff and build-up on my scalp.  I partially contribute some of that to other products I&#x27;ve used.  But since I&#x27;ve started using Groom &amp; Clean, I don&#x27;t have that issue any more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I like the way this stuff looks and feels.  It provides a light, managable control of my hair and provides a light shine to my hair without feeling greasy.  My hair feels cleaner and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female with very curly (not frizzy) blonde hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 25 years and love it.  I don&#x27;t like the products marketed for women because they make my hair stiff.  Groom and Clean keeps my hair soft, but completely manageable.  The product is now very hard to find in stores, so this is a great deal - especially since it&#x27;s cheaper than it was in the store.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED GROOM AND CLEAN FOR MANY YEARS. AMAZON.COM HAS THE BEST PRICE AROUND.</li>
            <li> Price is the lowest on the market and they deliver right on time.  I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 15 years and it&#x27;s perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find them at any store.  I don&#x27;t have to go to store anymore.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for this product as I thought the hold was too lax but now use it all the time. It won&#x27;t give the high gloss, greasy shine of a pomade but it will hold everything in place with a more natural, softer oily appearance. Start with a small dab then increase the amount until you get the look you want. I kinda had to get a feel for the product until I understood how to get my hair looking the way I wanted. It smells unique, like spiced pumpkin. It&#x27;s a bit oily feeling but it is water based so it washes out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I just wanted to add that my son has long hair and he prefers what I call the \\&quot;Sons of Anarchy\\&quot; look. Kind of lightly oiled and finger combed back, tucked behind his ear. Groom and Clean accomplishes this perfectly. Now he&#x27;s using it every day too.</li>
            <li> It works and it comes out easy. My hair is thicker and curls in the end this doesn&#x27;t hold it completely straight. But it might for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a neighbor of mine he uses this all the time he can&#x27;t  find it in the drugstore was a very good price and he seemed happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great when other products don&#x27;t hold hair in place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Groom &amp; Clean for many years  but lately could not find it in any of the local stores.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s the best hair gel I ever used, and I&#x27;m in my 80&#x27;s.  It makes my white hair gleam and never gets a greasy build-up.  I am always getting compliments on my hair from people I don&#x27;t even know and even from my hairdresser.  I recommend Groom &amp; Clean to anyone who wants to keep their unruly hair under control and would like it to have a sheen but not greasy look.</li>
            <li> I have used Groom and Clean for a number of years. I used to use Brylcreem, but Groom and Clean is not greasy, works well keeping hair from being dry and &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;. I have heard that they aren&#x27;t making it any more. Is this true? I have already recommended it to many.</li>
            <li> Keeps you hair neat without looking greasy.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my dad who likes his out of control hair to be in place. He has used this product forever and was happy to see a bargain price for so many.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  Non-greasy and holds just enough.  It has become scarce in our area so ordered it through Amazon.  It is actually cheaper in price (irregardless of any shipping) than locally.</li>
            <li> Controls your hair, controls dandruff, doesn&#x27;t build up, not greasy, and washes cleanly off your hands.   I like that it is a water based gel.  One tube lasts a couple months, and this is for six tubes.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.    What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This stuff is getting hard to find. It&#x27;s not greasy and works well.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuf.</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than scheduled, intack and at the correct address with everything included.</li>
            <li> NOT GREASEY KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for many years.  I really like the way it washes off with water.  A small amount holds every hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have used Groom &amp; Clean for years to keep my hair from blowing all over in the Wyoming wind we &#x27;sometimes&#x27; receive.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite hair care product, he has used it for 50 yrs.</li>
            <li> excellent product I have used this product for years</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Hard to find in stores.  Tried other hair products and always come back to Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li> My husband has complained for awhile that he has not been able to find Groom &amp; Clean, and it was the only product he liked to use on his hair. So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Groom and Clean for over 40 years.  It holds my hair well in place and I don&#x27;t smell like I should be walking the streets after dark.  It has disappeared from store shelves.  Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li> 6 pack of hair grease. what else could be better</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Groom and Clean for over 10 years.  The local Wal Mart stopped carrying it, so I now order it by the 6-Pak!  :)  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair styling product my father will use. Ever since I was a child I remember the tube being a staple in dads bathroom. It has become harder and harder to find in stores so we turned to Amazon and sure enough it was here in a six pack! Enough for a year or more of hair styling. Product arrived nicely packed and as advertised. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Groom &amp; Clean hair control works great. I have used it for years and my&lt;br /&gt;father before me. I am 77.  I always find a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, wish I would have found it a long time ago.</li>
