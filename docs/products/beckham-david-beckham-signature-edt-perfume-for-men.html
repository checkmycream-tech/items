            <li>Thanxs for package love the product</li>
            <li>This is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Many, many, compliments.</li>
            <li>A more fruity smell.</li>
            <li>, it works for most of what I do.</li>
            <li>it is great, but don&#x27;t expect it to be noticeable through your whole workday.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t say I love it since I have not tried it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love the smell.</li>
            <li>i have bought this product before in sears and am very familiar with the smell.</li>
            <li>super cheap!!</li>
            <li>Its pretty good for just about any situation.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is a good under cologne, but not my first choice for going out or the office.</li>
            <li>is the good stuff which has a decent price tag!</li>
            <li>Ladies take my advice if your looking for a gift for the man in your life that you can also enjoy... let me tell ya&#x27; go for this one you wont regret it, and he&#x27;ll love the gesture.</li>
            <li>Just as I expected, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>Very fresh and appealing..</li>
            <li>Not too musky or manly, more of a unique scent.</li>
            <li>After a few hours it smells even more wonderful</li>
            <li>It is just fabulous.</li>
            <li>i purchased this cologne because of visual affects its nice purple nice bottle and its cheap figured</li>
            <li>This gives a great lasting scent that my husband loves.</li>
            <li>The perfume came in secure box.</li>
            <li>Overall great product still.</li>
            <li>Signature is a light, low-key scent but very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Loved it I have enjoyed this fragrance for a long time.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Dont buy this cologne buy the original</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>so... it must last a good while...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had it on skin or clothing for a full 8 hours without it wearing off.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 6 year old son who wanted his own cologne after watching me use mine.  </li>
            <li>nice for daytime or early evening</li>
            <li>You can tell when a manufacturer wants to sell \\&quot;top shelf\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Not a bad cologne at all, I do like it would def buy again if it stays at this price</li>
            <li>Great smell, not overwhelming,  light and easy to wear on all occasions.</li>
            <li>also a quick tip</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it on here</li>
            <li>Definitely a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I love how this smells on someone I know and am trying to get my husband to branch out and adopt new things.</li>
            <li>D Beck signature cologne says it all this smells sweet and soft and most of all my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li>If you’re looking for cologne that’s fresh, clean, light, fun, and sexy look no further because this is it.</li>
            <li>(and she&#x27;s pregnant; her sense of smell is like a k-9 right now)</li>
            <li>i would be worth chancing it</li>
            <li>even one of my female coworkers liked the smell..</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This cologne is worth 50 dollars in the market</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it .</li>
            <li>We like the perfume and the price is right.</li>
            <li>i have it right now as we speak</li>
            <li>when I purchased this cologne I received it very fast</li>
            <li>Item shipped very fast and in mint condition.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely a pleaser. :)</li>
            <li>the first bottle I bought was at a drug store and paid $42.</li>
            <li>As I continue to write reviews, the longevity element/measure has grown in importance to me and is the element I am most critical.  </li>
            <li>After that you are left with the pure fragrance oil... last longer, and more potent.</li>
            <li>That pretty much says it all, but here comes more:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, but is definitely a manly smell that I would wear if I&#x27;m planning on picking up all the chics.  </li>
            <li>The type of scent that is pleasant to smell, and not overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>She really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>well cant really describe a smell.</li>
            <li>Which to me doesnt matter too much because</li>
            <li>and I believe it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty good, if not a little overpowering  at times (1 small spray should be all you need)</li>
            <li>So, I did what most people would do, I returned the cologne to Sears, and bought the other one from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it, i will recommend to an other buyers.</li>
            <li>manly, charasmatic and stylish, while also cool and subtle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working out what effects it has on the ladies, aside from redness and swelling when applied directly to the eyes, but it has a lot more staying power than I&#x27;d expected, like a fragrant badger under my shirt.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very picky about how musty a cologne smells and doesn&#x27;t want to smell too girly or too much like an old man.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very masculine, but we females want to use it too!</li>
            <li>instead its worth the extra 30 dollars.</li>
            <li>All are great scents, to include Signature, but all are relative weak in longevity.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t original as I expected.</li>
            <li>The rationale is simple, why buy a cologne if there is no projection/sillage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signature offers a fresh scent out of the gates with evergreen, floral, and powdery notes.  </li>
            <li>not sure why but this product has been discontinued and when i found it here i was happy since i had previously bought it for my husband</li>
            <li>Mellow enough for daytime wear , cool enough for a date</li>
            <li>The packaging is below average -I actually notice packaging of the bottle more now.  </li>
            <li>only did it take a very long time to receive my order, but it does not even smell like the genuine Beckham Signature which I purchased at the mall.</li>
            <li>once your around people for a certain amount of time in the same evening they get use to it anyway...</li>
            <li>As far as the smell...</li>
            <li>wonder how old this cologne was, smelled a bit &amp;#34;alcohly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and ive got way more compliments on this cologne than any of my other much more expensive colognes</li>
            <li>The scent fades really quick, almost like its watered down..</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long (as is to be expected with all water-based colognes).</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very unique smell to it, its the poor man high class smell without going over budget.</li>
            <li>I also noticed the color of the fake is a deeper purple color fluid, rather than the genuine light purple color.</li>
            <li>As kind of a field test, I gave a little spritz before doing my usual morning rounds of housework, then a day at non-house-work.</li>
            <li>Major problem - it won&#x27;t last !!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it is great, but don&#x27;t expect it to be noticeable through your whole workday.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t say I love it since I have not tried it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love the smell.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product before in sears and am very familiar with the smell.</li>
            <li> super cheap!!</li>
            <li> Its pretty good for just about any situation.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is a good under cologne, but not my first choice for going out or the office.</li>
            <li> is the good stuff which has a decent price tag!</li>
            <li> Ladies take my advice if your looking for a gift for the man in your life that you can also enjoy... let me tell ya&#x27; go for this one you wont regret it, and he&#x27;ll love the gesture.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Very fresh and appealing..</li>
            <li> Not too musky or manly, more of a unique scent.</li>
            <li> After a few hours it smells even more wonderful</li>
            <li> It is just fabulous.</li>
            <li> i purchased this cologne because of visual affects its nice purple nice bottle and its cheap figured</li>
            <li> This gives a great lasting scent that my husband loves.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in secure box.</li>
            <li> Overall great product still.</li>
            <li> Signature is a light, low-key scent but very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Loved it I have enjoyed this fragrance for a long time.</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Dont buy this cologne buy the original</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> so... it must last a good while...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it on skin or clothing for a full 8 hours without it wearing off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 6 year old son who wanted his own cologne after watching me use mine.  </li>
            <li> nice for daytime or early evening</li>
            <li> You can tell when a manufacturer wants to sell \\&quot;top shelf\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne at all, I do like it would def buy again if it stays at this price</li>
            <li> Great smell, not overwhelming,  light and easy to wear on all occasions.</li>
            <li> also a quick tip</li>
            <li> Luckily I found it on here</li>
            <li> Definitely a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love how this smells on someone I know and am trying to get my husband to branch out and adopt new things.</li>
            <li> D Beck signature cologne says it all this smells sweet and soft and most of all my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> If you’re looking for cologne that’s fresh, clean, light, fun, and sexy look no further because this is it.</li>
            <li> (and she&#x27;s pregnant; her sense of smell is like a k-9 right now)</li>
            <li> i would be worth chancing it</li>
            <li> even one of my female coworkers liked the smell..</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This cologne is worth 50 dollars in the market</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it .</li>
            <li> We like the perfume and the price is right.</li>
            <li> i have it right now as we speak</li>
            <li> when I purchased this cologne I received it very fast</li>
            <li> Item shipped very fast and in mint condition.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely a pleaser. :)</li>
            <li> the first bottle I bought was at a drug store and paid $42.</li>
            <li> As I continue to write reviews, the longevity element/measure has grown in importance to me and is the element I am most critical.  </li>
            <li> After that you are left with the pure fragrance oil... last longer, and more potent.</li>
            <li> That pretty much says it all, but here comes more:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong, but is definitely a manly smell that I would wear if I&#x27;m planning on picking up all the chics.  </li>
            <li> The type of scent that is pleasant to smell, and not overwhelming!  </li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> She really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> well cant really describe a smell.</li>
            <li> Which to me doesnt matter too much because</li>
            <li> and I believe it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good, if not a little overpowering  at times (1 small spray should be all you need)</li>
            <li> So, I did what most people would do, I returned the cologne to Sears, and bought the other one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it, i will recommend to an other buyers.</li>
            <li> manly, charasmatic and stylish, while also cool and subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working out what effects it has on the ladies, aside from redness and swelling when applied directly to the eyes, but it has a lot more staying power than I&#x27;d expected, like a fragrant badger under my shirt.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky about how musty a cologne smells and doesn&#x27;t want to smell too girly or too much like an old man.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very masculine, but we females want to use it too!</li>
            <li> instead its worth the extra 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> All are great scents, to include Signature, but all are relative weak in longevity.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t original as I expected.</li>
            <li> The rationale is simple, why buy a cologne if there is no projection/sillage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signature offers a fresh scent out of the gates with evergreen, floral, and powdery notes.  </li>
            <li> not sure why but this product has been discontinued and when i found it here i was happy since i had previously bought it for my husband</li>
            <li> Mellow enough for daytime wear , cool enough for a date</li>
            <li> The packaging is below average -I actually notice packaging of the bottle more now.  </li>
            <li> only did it take a very long time to receive my order, but it does not even smell like the genuine Beckham Signature which I purchased at the mall.</li>
            <li> once your around people for a certain amount of time in the same evening they get use to it anyway...</li>
            <li> As far as the smell...</li>
            <li> wonder how old this cologne was, smelled a bit &amp;#34;alcohly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and ive got way more compliments on this cologne than any of my other much more expensive colognes</li>
            <li> The scent fades really quick, almost like its watered down..</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long (as is to be expected with all water-based colognes).</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very unique smell to it, its the poor man high class smell without going over budget.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the color of the fake is a deeper purple color fluid, rather than the genuine light purple color.</li>
            <li> As kind of a field test, I gave a little spritz before doing my usual morning rounds of housework, then a day at non-house-work.</li>
            <li> Major problem - it won&#x27;t last !!!</li>
            <li> I have owned several Genuine Beckham Signature colognes over the last 5 years, this one is 100% fake.</li>
            <li> i constantly have women commenting on my smell all night long</li>
            <li> Another thing about this and water based is that it&#x27;s generally not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with me for nearly as long as some others.</li>
            <li> The nearest store to me is 45 miles away money is tight so found it on here for less, with free shipping therefor saving me at least 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> I sweat about as much as the average gym rat after an hour of cardio just from the effort of breathing or allowing my cells to continue replicating, so the fact that I&#x27;m already sweating after stepping out of the shower and toweling off (no exaggeration) makes it hard to find something that will still be noticeable after a day&#x27;s wear, aside from my socks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to find a scent that both complements my natural smell and masks my manly muskiness.</li>
            <li> he has everything from  nautica, juicy, addidas, a wide collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested fragrances from stores like american eagle, hollister, and a few department stores..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last no more than 3 hours</li>
            <li> /&gt;Similar to other comments, the fragrance lasts about an hour.  </li>
            <li> Bought this blind because it was at reasonable price  and have been a fan of Beckham since his Man Utd days.</li>
            <li> It is Good, the worst part is having to tell you that in 19 words.</li>
            <li> I vowed to buy it for the next man I seriously dated, but when that time came, it was out of stock in the store.</li>
            <li> 5 sprays of this Fragrance wears off in less than 10 min; my wife could not tell that I sprayed some on</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this cologne for my boyfriend and was upset when they no longer sold it in the department stores.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my little brother</li>
            <li> My wife is now pregnant, and she still like this product, the smell does not make her feel sick.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a store a few months ago maybe 6 months or longer.</li>
            <li> Colognes and perfumes are oils, and alchohol... squirt a few times into a glass creating a puddle in the bottom.</li>
            <li> Let sit in a window seal for a few days uncovered.</li>
            <li> Not a strong or overpowering smell; kinda woodsy, spicy...but not a musk.  </li>
            <li> After clumsily spilling coffee down my shirt (the result of not having had enough coffee yet, so it&#x27;s a vicious cycle), then having salsa end up in the same area (because I had salsa before hitting my caffeine quota), I came home smelling not of roasted beans, cilantro, and man flesh, but of the signature scent of one of the two soccer players I&#x27;ve heard of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottle is awkwardly designed, making it a challenge to hold and spray in the same motion.  </li>
            <li> Slow delivery</li>
            <li> but I think this can be attributed to the bad east coast weather, currently.  </li>
            <li> Longevity is about 3 to 4 hours and sillage is weak after the opening.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong....</li>
            <li> Fake Beckham Signature</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of the Beckham fragrances blind.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell of this</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling cologne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure how to explain this smell! It is just fabulous. It&#x27;s a guys cologne, but my daughter wanted it for Christmas. It&#x27;s very masculine, but we females want to use it too! (That&#x27;s how I feel about Kirra!) But it&#x27;s definitely a pleaser. :)</li>
            <li> Very good price. My nephew is pleased with this gift</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. After a few hours it smells even more wonderful</li>
            <li> Great Price and Great Smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed. That pretty much says it all, but here comes more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to find a scent that both complements my natural smell and masks my manly muskiness.

            <li> Smells like a sexy watermelon. Haha. Its pretty good for just about any situation.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. Best cologne he has... he has everything from  nautica, juicy, addidas, a wide collection. I&#x27;m all over him lol</li>
            <li> The scent fades really quick, almost like its watered down..</li>
            <li> My husband has not opened this gift yet, but he has tried the cologne out before and he loves it. Buying this product through Amazon saved me about 10 dollars. :) Merry Christmas!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t original as I expected. it barley lasted for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Both my husband and i love how this smells. Great cologne for this price!</li>
            <li> I was in Target one day and came across David Beckham’s Signature Cologne, and “FELL IN LOVE”. I vowed to buy it for the next man I seriously dated, but when that time came, it was out of stock in the store. So I hunted around for a while, and found it at Sears.  I paid $28.00 for a 1.7 ounce bottle, but later found a 2.5 ounce bottle on Amazon for $16.00.  So, I did what most people would do, I returned the cologne to Sears, and bought the other one from Amazon. My boyfriend loves it, and Lord Jesus help me, I love it on him. If you’re looking for cologne that’s fresh, clean, light, fun, and sexy look no further because this is it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance for a birthday gift. He love it, it is one of his favorites. This is a great buy for one that likes the smell of Men&#x27;s Prada cologne.</li>
            <li> i purchased this cologne because of visual affects its nice purple nice bottle and its cheap figured i would be worth chancing it and ive got way more compliments on this cologne than any of my other much more expensive colognes i order 6 bottles so i wont run out for 10 years !! haha</li>
            <li> Major problem - it won&#x27;t last !!!&lt;br /&gt;Feels good, smells good as you spray it on, BUT ask someone to smell you after 5 min, there is nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought a cologne can be so weak.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed big time !</li>
            <li> Beckham Signature is good but Beckham Signature Story is better.&lt;br /&gt;This is the good stuff which has a decent price tag!</li>
            <li> My wife gave me this cologne for Christmas in 2010. She really like it. Now that I am out, I bought it again.  NOTE: My wife is now pregnant, and she still like this product, the smell does not make her feel sick.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance, however it is terribly dilute. Three sprays on my neck and two on each arm and in 15 minutes, not only can&#x27;t I smell it but neither can anyone else!</li>
            <li> Fave cologne, great price</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Not a strong or overpowering smell; kinda woodsy, spicy...but not a musk.  It isn&#x27;t too strong, but is definitely a manly smell that I would wear if I&#x27;m planning on picking up all the chics.  Lol!  I think this fragrance kinda fits with the persona that Beckham seems to have...manly, charasmatic and stylish, while also cool and subtle.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who was wearing this and I loved it!  So I went ahead and purchased a bottle for myself.  I get tons of compliments on the scent!  Great Product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Many thanks! +++</li>
            <li> not sure why but this product has been discontinued and when i found it here i was happy since i had previously bought it for my husband and he wanted another one, amazon came through and you cant beat the price</li>
            <li> when I purchased this cologne I received it very fast it smells okay but it doesn&#x27;t last no more than 3 hours .so I gave it to my little brother</li>
            <li> We like the perfume and the price is right. Give it a try. You can&#x27;t go wrong....My wife loves it...</li>
            <li> Bought this blind because it was at reasonable price  and have been a fan of Beckham since his Man Utd days. Signature is a light, low-key scent but very clean and fresh. An elegant summer juice. Longevity is about 3 to 4 hours and sillage is weak after the opening. At this price point, however, you can afford to use an extra squirt and re-apply later. Overall satisfied with my blind buy and will probably purchase again if price will be between $12-$15</li>
            <li> Smells good.. even one of my female coworkers liked the smell.. this can be used as an every day cologne as well.. i have it right now as we speak</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really good and masculin</li>
            <li> Bought this at a store a few months ago maybe 6 months or longer. I wear it everywhere, the girls i hang around love it. So I ran out of the cologne, put on another one they all said \\&quot;its good but it isnt you\\&quot;. The nearest store to me is 45 miles away money is tight so found it on here for less, with free shipping therefor saving me at least 25 bucks. As far as the smell... well cant really describe a smell. The longevity of the scent seems to last plenty for a night out. Which to me doesnt matter too much because once your around people for a certain amount of time in the same evening they get use to it anyway... btw... i constantly have women commenting on my smell all night long so... it must last a good while... also a quick tip if you want it to last longer. Colognes and perfumes are oils, and alchohol... squirt a few times into a glass creating a puddle in the bottom. Let sit in a window seal for a few days uncovered. After that you are left with the pure fragrance oil... last longer, and more potent. Ladies take my advice if your looking for a gift for the man in your life that you can also enjoy... let me tell ya&#x27; go for this one you wont regret it, and he&#x27;ll love the gesture.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised!</li>
            <li> great scent for the price .. spring and summer is here get it while the weather is nice and warm..</li>
            <li> very good quality, fast shipping</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes out there and the smell does not fade quickly as the day goes by nor does the smell change. Definitely a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> My husband smells wonderful.  Thank You</li>
            <li> Very good. I have used this for a while now the first bottle I bought was at a drug store and paid $42.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Smells great on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy!!! **Fake Beckham Signature cologne**&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it take a very long time to receive my order, but it does not even smell like the genuine Beckham Signature which I purchased at the mall. 5 sprays of this Fragrance wears off in less than 10 min; my wife could not tell that I sprayed some on (and she&#x27;s pregnant; her sense of smell is like a k-9 right now) I also noticed the color of the fake is a deeper purple color fluid, rather than the genuine light purple color. I have owned several Genuine Beckham Signature colognes over the last 5 years, this one is 100% fake.</li>
            <li> Great smell and my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Great smell, not overwhelming,  light and easy to wear on all occasions. Recommend to anyone looking for a great cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this smell on my husband! I&#x27;ve purchased from Gordmans and now Amazon and have no concern about the integrity of the product on Amazon. Smells great!</li>
            <li> GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD . It is Good, the worst part is having to tell you that in 19 words. Geezz it was good, sheww[...]</li>
            <li> Great deal. Purchased as gift.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this clean, fresh scent. Would recommend it to anyone~  Well worth the price and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Slow delivery but I think this can be attributed to the bad east coast weather, currently.  The product itself is pretty good, if not a little overpowering  at times (1 small spray should be all you need) and I&#x27;ve had it on skin or clothing for a full 8 hours without it wearing off.</li>
            <li> I love it, i will recommend to an other buyers. This item has a wonderful smell, and my son loves it. Great Item!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is a good under cologne, but not my first choice for going out or the office.</li>
            <li> Nice cologne ! Mellow enough for daytime wear , cool enough for a date</li>
            <li> Loved it I have enjoyed this fragrance for a long time.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this! Boyfriends favorite cologne and we cant find it ANYWHERE and here it is and super cheap!! AMAZING!!  Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite from the collection</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 6 year old son who wanted his own cologne after watching me use mine.  This smell clean and fresh, very impressed with the sent so I purchased one for myself!  I went from using Lacost and Clarins Happy to this one!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very unique smell to it, its the poor man high class smell without going over budget.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne at all, I do like it would def buy again if it stays at this price</li>
            <li> Scent is very pleasant. Price was great and I believe it is the real deal. Same as the store version I bought. Great buy.</li>
            <li> If it were only stronger and lasted longer.... but it&#x27;s a perfect cologne.  It loves everyone but you the most.</li>
            <li> Great price, great service!</li>
            <li> The type of scent that is pleasant to smell, and not overwhelming!  If you like such a scent this cologne is for you!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based in the review. I can say that the smell is really good. It worths the price. Moreover, the price is low regarding the quality.</li>
            <li> Thanxs for package love the product</li>
            <li> I love how this smells on someone I know and am trying to get my husband to branch out and adopt new things. This is one of them!</li>
            <li> nice for daytime or early evening</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend because he loves the fragrance and we could never find it in a store. It came in a timely manner and was perfect.</li>
            <li> Came quick and great price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of the Beckham fragrances blind.  All are great scents, to include Signature, but all are relative weak in longevity.  As I continue to write reviews, the longevity element/measure has grown in importance to me and is the element I am most critical.  The rationale is simple, why buy a cologne if there is no projection/sillage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signature offers a fresh scent out of the gates with evergreen, floral, and powdery notes.  It settles into a very pleasant fragrance with amber and outdoorsy (I think I just made up a word..!!) finishing notes.  It is very easy on the nose.  That is about all the good comments regarding Signature...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to other comments, the fragrance lasts about an hour.  Yes, I get it - our body chemistry is different, but this fragrance does not last even on clothing.  Following the hour after the initial application, it requires a follow-up dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is awkwardly designed, making it a challenge to hold and spray in the same motion.  The packaging is below average -I actually notice packaging of the bottle more now.  You can tell when a manufacturer wants to sell \\&quot;top shelf\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can pick this up for under $10, and just for the thrill of adding another bottle to your collection, pick it up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered I will give Signature 3 stars out of five.  Ensure you develop tomorrow&#x27;s leaders...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this scent. Well worth the price. I&#x27;ve tested fragrances from stores like american eagle, hollister, and a few department stores.. All of which are repulsive by comparison.. Its not overpowering and is perfect for lightly spraying on my neck after a shower</li>
            <li> wonder how old this cologne was, smelled a bit &amp;#34;alcohly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> excellent product all products sealed as described. thanks</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine. Many, many, compliments.</li>
            <li> This gives a great lasting scent that my husband loves. He&#x27;s very picky about how musty a cologne smells and doesn&#x27;t want to smell too girly or too much like an old man.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product before in sears and am very familiar with the smell. This cologne is worth 50 dollars in the market so it makes sense to dilute this cologne to make profit. Dont buy this cologne buy the original instead its worth the extra 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> skin scent.. not for me</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon, this cologne has been one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> If you like this cologne, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in secure box. It smells great. It&#x27;s definitely worth it . I would recommend this product .I have bought from this seller a couple of times . I have never had any complaints. I would recommend to buy this product .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The perfect Scent. Not too musky or manly, more of a unique scent. Very fresh and appealing.. Chicks Dig it!</li>
            <li> I liked the product beckhan signature for men edt spray 2.5 oz . Good smell. And the price is nice.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this cologne for my boyfriend and was upset when they no longer sold it in the department stores.  Luckily I found it on here and it was great value.  I LOVE the smell of this cologne!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. A more fruity smell. great price as well. It is my signature scent. Every girl I meet, they compliment the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as expected. I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long (as is to be expected with all water-based colognes). Another thing about this and water based is that it&#x27;s generally not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it works for most of what I do. If it is just for a dinner or short outing it is great, but don&#x27;t expect it to be noticeable through your whole workday.</li>
            <li> It is for men and am a lady so I couldn&#x27;t say I love it since I have not tried it. But it was shipped in a timely manner</li>
            <li> D Beck signature cologne says it all this smells sweet and soft and most of all my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves this spray.  IT arrived when promised and my a nice Christmas presewnt</li>
            <li> Item shipped very fast and in mint condition. The scent is very nice but not as strong as I&#x27;d hoped. Doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with me for nearly as long as some others. Overall great product still.</li>
            <li> Smells great! My husband loves this cologne. Found it here for a great price. Last time I bought it at the store it cost over $50.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a birthday gift for my husband. Very nice smelling cologne. My husband and I both love the smell.</li>
