            <li>Nice, matte finish.</li>
            <li>It seems to me that this is an \\&quot;One size fits all\\&quot; kind of bronzer.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this bronzer isn&#x27;t chalky AT ALL.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear very easily and does quite well on its own, without finishing powder, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hun, you&#x27;re buying drugstore not high-end :) If you want a really good bronzer, go get yourself one :) FOR 30 DOLLARS.</li>
            <li>I personally love this, and it&#x27;s quite a buy, for the bronzer on its own.</li>
            <li>It came quick and packaged great:)</li>
            <li>I absoloutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a brown tone since that&#x27;s what it looks like</li>
            <li>people love it</li>
            <li>and I love the color.  </li>
            <li>and they are my favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li>love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>She is pretty fair.</li>
            <li>The colour is pretty good on this</li>
            <li>I love them, and they are so easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Very good product, silky, does not wear off quickly and most important; it did not cause my very sensitive skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>I also find that it&#x27;s really easy to work with and blend.</li>
            <li>although high quality for drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;•Being a fair skinned girl</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t enhance fine lines.</li>
            <li>It came quickly!</li>
            <li>Just need a little but works great!</li>
            <li>and so cheap under 7bucks</li>
            <li>Good color palette, natural look</li>
            <li>Love, love this bronzer, stays matte all day, but looks natural!</li>
            <li>Good, but I expected more gold tones than it has.  </li>
            <li>although of course you can make your own combo depending on your skin color (which I love because you can customize your bronzer shade year long, whereas buying two bronzers for summer and winter).</li>
            <li>This turned out to be a really good buy because I could not get it locally.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to blend as well.</li>
            <li>i bought this item since i needed a matte bronzer quickly and all of youtube was raving about it.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews about the Revlon Photo Ready Bronzing Kit, Bronzed and Chic and it is amazing, looks very natural and the quality is comparable to high end brands.</li>
            <li>the product blends in just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li>and you can use it many ways - contouring high-lightening and eyeshadow -- for a pretty natural look.</li>
            <li>It blends pretty wellinto your skin (I use just on it&#x27;s own at times, because my skin is not all that bad) and it does a very good Job.</li>
            <li>It has no weird smell, it&#x27;s got four different colors which makes it perfect for an all year round bronzer and</li>
            <li>If you want a bit more coverage, just put a second layer on it!</li>
            <li>•Not quite comparable to higher end matte bronzers,</li>
            <li>Revlon...bring it back!!!!!!, and learn how to market this better.</li>
            <li>The first top two shades for the lightest, and last bottom two for darkest,  </li>
            <li>I use this for my contouring and it works very well!</li>
            <li>This may be more true bronze than other bronzers are, but because of that, I didn&#x27;t quite expect this color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a decent little brush which is good for contouring your cheek bones and sides of your nose</li>
            <li>You must be careful if you have very light skin like me though.</li>
            <li>, fortunately I don&#x27;t use it much - too orangey for me - but that does not excuse the damage during shipping and the carelessness of the seller.</li>
            <li>Warms my daughters face very well.</li>
            <li>I don know  much about this procuct</li>
            <li>like how there are four shades, darker ones for contouring and swirled together to add color to my whole face</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>i also think it is really overpriced for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li>Overall I recommend it if your skin is not too fair or dark.</li>
            <li>The product also doesn&#x27;t seem to be protected overly well and my powder cracked pretty early on.</li>
            <li>and second because the brush it the of the thick kind you&#x27;d probably find at the dollar store that no one but really cheap beauty junkies would buy - they&#x27;re just un-useful</li>
            <li>A real professional look.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone who wants a natural not shimmery bronzed look.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the packaging.  </li>
            <li>other user commented on how cheap and \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; this bronzer is.</li>
            <li>The first one (top-left) is an orange-y color, while the rest are different types of browns that darken shades clockwise</li>
            <li>, this bronzer is matte (which means you can use to both contour and bronze - I do), and has 4 (clearly seen) shades, each covering about 25% of the circle-shaped palette.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very hard to find I&#x27;m glad I found it here</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be returning simply because I think its somewhat fixable with a little cleaning, however it&#x27;s very discouraging, won&#x27;t be buying from them anymore!</li>

            <li> This \\&quot;kit\\&quot; also comes with a brush and a mirror, either of which I hardly ever use, first because I dont carry my bronzer around to contour day long</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous post that it works as well as the more expensive bronzers.  </li>
            <li> limited edition</li>
            <li> After hearing some reviews from some youtubers, I decided to give it a go, even though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what I usually go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope Revlon continues to manufacture it, i am so tired of finding products that I like, only to hear they are discontinued by the time I need a new.</li>
            <li> different shades, blends well, not too dark!</li>
            <li> The brush provided is rough</li>
            <li> The powder had broken off and gone very literally EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> Darker than expected.</li>
            <li> however, i found the product to be very chalky with little color payoff and poor staying power.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this being too dark for my complexion and then in result looking muddy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does run kinda dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m a light-skinned Latina with really oily skin and a weird skin shade where it&#x27;s not really light but not medium</li>
            <li> This bronzer is my everyday &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; make-up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking ONE STAR OFF because of the shipping damage (a piece of the \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; color was missing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh or orange.</li>
            <li> I bought this from US Mall Shop, and sad to say I opened the box (all excitedly) only to find out the Bronzer was heavily damaged.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a small mirror inside also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only bronzer on the market that doesn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
            <li> i find it hard to blend!</li>
            <li> (I mean who does that?!)</li>
            <li> soooo sad it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Revlon doesn&#x27;t make it any longer.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love them, and they are so easy to blend. This is the only bronzer I use from now on l.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is my everyday &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; make-up.  I use it as a bronzer, eye shadow, countouring powder and even blusher.  I&#x27;ve purchased it&lt;br /&gt;several times now.</li>
            <li> Warms my daughters face very well. She is pretty fair.</li>
            <li> I absoloutely love this product.

            <li> It&#x27;s a great bronzer.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more of a brown tone since that&#x27;s what it looks like but it comes out orange on skin.</li>
            <li> I don know  much about this procuct but I ve heard its a good but</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! Only found it on Amazon,  I will definitely purchase this item once i run out</li>
            <li> different shades, blends well, not too dark! If you want a bit more coverage, just put a second layer on it! I like that it doesn&#x27;t have shimmer!</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a really good buy because I could not get it locally. Gives a good finish  to  the make up. A real professional look. time for delivery was also  excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer its the best for the summer!!! It came quick and packaged great:) soooo sad it&#x27;s limited edition it&#x27;s very hard to find I&#x27;m glad I found it here and so cheap under 7bucks I last saw it when it was in store for 13bucks!!!!</li>

            <li> The colour is pretty good on this and so is the quality! The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the packaging.  The brush provided is rough and I don&#x27;t like to use it.  The product also doesn&#x27;t seem to be protected overly well and my powder cracked pretty early on.</li>
            <li> nice color to it and it is not shiney. I dont like the shiney kinds.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only bronzer on the market that doesn&#x27;t look fake! And great if your not 18 anymore because it is a matte finish so it won&#x27;t enhance fine lines. Unfortunately Revlon doesn&#x27;t make it any longer.&lt;br /&gt; Revlon...bring it back!!!!!!, and learn how to market this better.</li>
            <li> Love, love this bronzer, stays matte all day, but looks natural! Can even be used as an natural-looking eyeshadow, beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and in excellent condition.  This is the product I have been looking for and I love the color.  I was out in the sun a lot this summer and I tanned some on my face and the product blends in just right for my skin.  Would recommend this for any one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Beautiful color and you can use it many ways - contouring high-lightening and eyeshadow -- for a pretty natural look.</li>
            <li> This is Luis A&#x27;s wife: Good color palette, natural look</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I could not find this product any longer in the store. Glad I found it here and for a great price.</li>
            <li> i bought this item since i needed a matte bronzer quickly and all of youtube was raving about it. however, i found the product to be very chalky with little color payoff and poor staying power. i also think it is really overpriced for a drugstore product.</li>
            <li> Great color and it comes with a square brush, perfect for contouring!!</li>
            <li> I cannot find these in stores anymore and they are my favorite bronzer. I bought 2 so I have backup.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews about the Revlon Photo Ready Bronzing Kit, Bronzed and Chic and it is amazing, looks very natural and the quality is comparable to high end brands. I will recommend this to anyone who wants a natural not shimmery bronzed look.</li>
            <li> This product works well with mty skin tone, no grease. 24 hrs coverage. Beautiful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love it. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice....</li>
            <li> Great for shading and doing contrast. You must be careful if you have very light skin like me though. It does run kinda dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this from US Mall Shop, and sad to say I opened the box (all excitedly) only to find out the Bronzer was heavily damaged. The powder had broken off and gone very literally EVERYWHERE. Won&#x27;t be returning simply because I think its somewhat fixable with a little cleaning, however it&#x27;s very discouraging, won&#x27;t be buying from them anymore! :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m a light-skinned Latina with really oily skin and a weird skin shade where it&#x27;s not really light but not medium either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ON THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, this bronzer is matte (which means you can use to both contour and bronze - I do), and has 4 (clearly seen) shades, each covering about 25% of the circle-shaped palette. The first one (top-left) is an orange-y color, while the rest are different types of browns that darken shades clockwise (each shade darker than the last). It seems to me that this is an \\&quot;One size fits all\\&quot; kind of bronzer. The first top two shades for the lightest, and last bottom two for darkest,  although of course you can make your own combo depending on your skin color (which I love because you can customize your bronzer shade year long, whereas buying two bronzers for summer and winter). This \\&quot;kit\\&quot; also comes with a brush and a mirror, either of which I hardly ever use, first because I dont carry my bronzer around to contour day long (I mean who does that?!) and second because the brush it the of the thick kind you&#x27;d probably find at the dollar store that no one but really cheap beauty junkies would buy - they&#x27;re just un-useful okay? I personally love this, and it&#x27;s quite a buy, for the bronzer on its own. It doesn&#x27;t smear very easily and does quite well on its own, without finishing powder, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other user commented on how cheap and \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; this bronzer is. Hun, you&#x27;re buying drugstore not high-end :) If you want a really good bronzer, go get yourself one :) FOR 30 DOLLARS. Honestly, this bronzer isn&#x27;t chalky AT ALL. It blends pretty wellinto your skin (I use just on it&#x27;s own at times, because my skin is not all that bad) and it does a very good Job. I&#x27;m taking ONE STAR OFF because of the shipping damage (a piece of the \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; color was missing, fortunately I don&#x27;t use it much - too orangey for me - but that does not excuse the damage during shipping and the carelessness of the seller.</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone so to contour I need some deeper colors. After hearing some reviews from some youtubers, I decided to give it a go, even though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what I usually go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having these four different colors gives you a lot of options in terms of how to use it. With a big brush you can swirl all of them and add overall color to your face for a sun-kissed look. In addition, I use the bottom two to contour my face. It&#x27;s not too harsh or orange. I also find that it&#x27;s really easy to work with and blend. Overall I recommend it if your skin is not too fair or dark.</li>
            <li> Bought this for contouring my cheek bones.  Just need a little but works great!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like the product itself! i find it hard to blend!</li>
            <li> Just okay. Darker than expected.</li>
            <li> Comes with a brush and it is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I use this for my contouring and it works very well!</li>
            <li> It came quickly! Love it</li>
