            <li>nice..</li>
            <li>These came into a package of four and a nice price which was nice.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality and an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;You will save a lot of money over buying them from a major pharmacy chain.</li>
            <li>I love the hook and loop closure which makes them very easy to use.</li>
            <li>So now I need to go and buy more and pay more than I need.</li>
            <li>Velcro on both ends and better than clips...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great quality</li>
            <li>Love that you do not have to use clips or tape to hold them on.</li>
            <li>Use these as kind of a light support for abdominal area.</li>
            <li>The wider bandage covers more area quickly and the Velcro is safer and easier to use than pins.</li>

            <li>Nice product - exactly as expected</li>
            <li>We use this to help immobilize our 1 year old granddaughter&#x27;s &#x27;good&#x27; arm so that she will get used to using the other!</li>
            <li>These bandages work very wee.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Okay but not like the thick ones from the hospital.</li>
            <li>NOT a perfect substitute, but good enough until the injury is healed.  </li>

            <li> Doctor suggest I use the large size but was unable to find in stores in my area</li>

            <li> Nice product - exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Great item to use instead of compression stockings.  An injury prevents the patient from wearing the stockings, so her legs are wrapped in these instead.  NOT a perfect substitute, but good enough until the injury is healed.  Also: Washable.  Excellent!!</li>
            <li> These bandages work very wee. I HAVE TO WASH THEM REPEATEDLY AND l do not think they will hold up very long.</li>
            <li> Purchased a 4 pack and only received 2.... So now I need to go and buy more and pay more than I need.</li>
            <li> Great price on this item. What a great deal this Is. I would recommend this item In a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I had knee surgery in 1996 and 1997 and trhey used these bandages to control swelling,  mine have long worn out,  I thought these would be the same of at least close.  However after only one use they are getting stretched out and worn out like mine took over ten years/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always crack a rib trying to gaff a big fish.  But when I do, velcro closures are much better than the old metal type.</li>
            <li> Great! Used after delivery for binding my belly worked wonders !</li>
            <li> A little less stretchy than the last ones I got.. and a little wrinkly.. not good wrapping  husband&#x27;s legs with these.. wonder what happened to the quality.</li>
            <li> Okay but not like the thick ones from the hospital.</li>
            <li> Velcro on both ends and better than clips...&lt;br /&gt;Very nice..</li>
            <li> It wrap me up skintight!</li>
            <li> Second order of these bandages.  I love the hook and loop closure which makes them very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great quality</li>
            <li> I have a home care nurse that wraps my legs because of a medical condition. She recommended the 6&amp;#34; bandages with Velcro on each end. The wider bandage covers more area quickly and the Velcro is safer and easier to use than pins.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Needed this right away.  Doctor suggest I use the large size but was unable to find in stores in my area so had to send away for them.  These came into a package of four and a nice price which was nice.  They work out great.  Love that you do not have to use clips or tape to hold them on.</li>
            <li> Use these as kind of a light support for abdominal area.</li>
            <li> We use this to help immobilize our 1 year old granddaughter&#x27;s &#x27;good&#x27; arm so that she will get used to using the other! (she had a stroke either before or just after birth). It works well and she does not mind having it on!  The bandage has velcro on each end so we have cut the length we need and just wrap it around and press it on...and voila&#x27; it holds perfectly! The velcro on the other end makes possible for two (in this case 3&#x27; each) &#x27;slings&#x27; from one roll!</li>
            <li> Works well and does the job.  Holding up well.</li>
            <li> If you use these bandages often, this is the way to buy them!&lt;br /&gt;4 to a pack. Excellent quality and an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;You will save a lot of money over buying them from a major pharmacy chain.</li>
