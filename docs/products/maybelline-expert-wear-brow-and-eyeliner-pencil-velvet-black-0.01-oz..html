            <li>Love Love Love this pencil!</li>
            <li>Very smooth</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t make them any more.  </li>
            <li>What a shame that a product that clearly satisfied so many customers has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Water proof for sure  </li>
            <li>It works okay for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I  intend to order more of this product.</li>

            <li>so glad i have can find  what i am used to .</li>
            <li>Not my favorite maybelline product.</li>
            <li>do you have more?  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, looks nice, &amp; washes off easily as well.  </li>
            <li>They did allow me to return the 2 with full credit and a return shipping label!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best brow filler!</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is fine</li>
            <li>This is the best for an eyebrow pencil, however it isn&#x27;t very dark for eyeliner use.</li>
            <li>Great standard beauty product that you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has a built in sharpener.</li>
            <li>Dependable and cheap.</li>
            <li>I love this brow liner so much!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need to sharpen, unless to like a very fine point.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good eyebrow liner but not such a hot eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>This pencil, even though black, is soft and perfect</li>
            <li>I get the right shape everytime.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to see that Amazon had it in my color and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>it used to come with 2 extra leads and had a sharpener in the top of the pencil for a finer line.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this eyebrow pencil for more than 20 years , and all of a sudden  I didn!t see it  in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Packaging wasn&#x27;t right and product is not like the real product.</li>
            <li>This liner is very light and doesn&#x27;t stay on for long at all.  </li>
            <li>But good eyeliner for a teenage who starting out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply for brows, not so much for eyeliner, but the duo pack they sell now isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows aren&#x27;t very dark, so I use this and its amazing.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had save a couple of sharpeners from earlier purchases from the brand retailer before the product was discontinued.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34;, my eyebrows have become much thinner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why Maybelline decided to discontinue.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>Self sharpening keeps it ready to go.</li>
            <li>so this is my new go to place to get ahold of one when i run out, thxs!</li>
            <li>I normally wear MAC stud eyebrow pencil, but they run out a lot.</li>
            <li>and I am trying to hold on to the one I have to sharpenen the new ones.  </li>
            <li>, THEY ALL HAD THE NEW MAYBELLINE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>This is one product to order while the new ones fall by the wayside.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, stays put &amp; looks so natural, unlike other pencils.  </li>
            <li>im 60 years old &amp; been wearing these from day one?  </li>
            <li>not same thing in the picture I used to buy it many years ago, the one that I have is plain red....</li>
            <li>It is also true black, no silly black.</li>
            <li>Unless you know what the  sharpener looks like, a small light band near the tip of the red plastic pencil, they appear to be identical.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will soon be extinct.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 15 of these eye brow pencils and spent lots of $ based on the Amazon order page that contains a photo which clearly showed packaging that said they came with a sharpener attached.  </li>

            <li> Was so excited when I first found these listed on Amazon and so disappointed when they arrived.</li>
            <li> sad to see it no longer available.</li>
            <li> I used to this a long time ago it&#x27;s been years, here it was on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use it every day to cover the grey in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon, for giving me a source for however long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> as i wear make up every single day,&lt;br /&gt;i have to fill in my brows  as i used to shave them years ago  haaa&lt;</li>
            <li> I finally found them here in dark brown.  </li>
            <li> There are several 1, 2, &amp; 3 star revues stating this has happened repeatedly to other Amazon Shoppers!</li>
            <li> Minimal pressure is needed to apply, and it lasts for around six hours before it could need any sort of touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and recently had trouble finding it.</li>
            <li> I have bought other brands and had to in up giving them away.  </li>
            <li> I LOOKED AT WALMART  AND OTHER STORES</li>
            <li> WHILE I WAS SEARCHING FOR OTHER THINGS  </li>
            <li> I looked for half a year before I found out</li>
            <li> and I still will even through she stressed she would like the 151 velvet black with sharpener.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I WAS HURT WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT MAYBELLINE NO LONGER CARRIED THE VELVET BLACK EYE LINER EYE BROW PENCIL.  </li>
            <li> Black gooey.  </li>
            <li> few more,&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> Amazon please do something about these shoddy practices of outside vendors, otherwise it&#x27;s nothing better than ebay at its worst!</li>
            <li> It is now impossible to find in the local stores, so I purchased online through Amazon several pencils just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is very hard to get ahold of in wichita,ks due to the fact its ALWAYS SOLD OUT ALWAYs in velvet black tried maby stores</li>
            <li> I was shocked and very puzzled to find out</li>
            <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore...</li>
            <li> Not sure how to sharpen the pencil since it has no sharpener... Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had known</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard and waxy.  </li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in the stores in this color.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Love this liner...have used it for years and am disappointed that it seems to be disappearing and is now very difficult to find and purchase.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that Amazon allows misleading ads from independent sellers.  </li>
            <li> Since I have thin eye brows</li>
            <li> maybelline&#x27;s new pencil is awful.</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered it, so sad this product has been discontinued by Maybelline</li>
            <li> The item received did not have a sharpener..very disappointing</li>
            <li> /&gt;they don&#x27;t look to bad now,  </li>
            <li> AGAIN, have to look &amp; buy &amp; try it out  Grrrr</li>
            <li> I wish they wouldn&#x27;t have discontinued :(</li>
            <li> Anyways, this pencil is sick!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it</li>
            <li> I was SO DISAPPOINTED to learn that Maybelline decided not to manufacture it any longer!!!  </li>

            <li> I used this pencil for over 20 yrs it used to come with 2 extra leads and had a sharpener in the top of the pencil for a finer line.  I looked for half a year before I found out they don&#x27;t make them any more.  I finally found them here in dark brown.  I bought 2 last time.  I hoping to hoard about 6 of them.  What a shame that a product that clearly satisfied so many customers has been discontinued.  FYI the wooded version is nothing like this one it&#x27;s hard and waxy.  Love Love Love this pencil!</li>
            <li> i orderd 4  at first,&lt;br /&gt;then i think  few more,&lt;br /&gt;Did you know.. im 60 years old &amp; been wearing these from day one?  YEP !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;they stayed on getting me threw a divorce crying,&lt;br /&gt;there Water proof for sure  LOL&lt;br /&gt;These are the best.&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t remember the year they came out,&lt;br /&gt;but i tell ya,  i was almost the first one to try it out &amp; loved it &amp; nothing eles since then !!&lt;br /&gt;i suppose theres others out there,&lt;br /&gt;but AGAIN, have to look &amp; buy &amp; try it out  Grrrr&lt;br /&gt;These Im buying should last  Ummmm  Hopefully a year?&lt;br /&gt;kinda doubt  it as i wear make up every single day,&lt;br /&gt;i have to fill in my brows  as i used to shave them years ago  haaa&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t look to bad now,  LOL&lt;br /&gt;its just im used to USING  Eye liners for a great Look !!&lt;br /&gt;  Why in the world r they leaving  ?</li>
            <li> This liner is very light and doesn&#x27;t stay on for long at all.  It works okay for eyebrows. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this liner!  I have used it since I started wearing makeup over 30 years ago.  My mom has used it all of her life also. It goes on smoothly, looks nice, &amp; washes off easily as well.  I was SO DISAPPOINTED to learn that Maybelline decided not to manufacture it any longer!!!  I&#x27;m glad I stocked up through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I ordered 15 of these eye brow pencils and spent lots of $ based on the Amazon order page that contains a photo which clearly showed packaging that said they came with a sharpener attached.  NOT THE CASE AS EACH CAME WITHOUT A SHARPENER!  Fortunately, I had save a couple of sharpeners from earlier purchases from the brand retailer before the product was discontinued. Was so excited when I first found these listed on Amazon and so disappointed when they arrived. Disappointed that Amazon allows misleading ads from independent sellers.  Buyer Beware!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with this product.  I  intend to order more of this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for filling in brows, and not a bad eyeliner either! Minimal pressure is needed to apply, and it lasts for around six hours before it could need any sort of touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  As I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34;, my eyebrows have become much thinner.  This helps to give them shape and fill in the &amp;#34;blanks&amp;#34;.  Have tried other products; however, nothing seems to work as well as this old standby for me.</li>
            <li> I normally wear MAC stud eyebrow pencil, but they run out a lot. This is an EXCELLENT substitute. It&#x27;s a bit waxier than what i&#x27;m used to, but boy is it easy to put on and it stays! It is also true black, no silly black.</li>
            <li> I did not receive what I ordered.  It is not the item shown here.  There is no removable sharpener as stated on the item I ordered.  I purchased this for my sister because she it is a discontinued item and no longer on the store shelves so I was going to surprise her with the item and I still will even through she stressed she would like the 151 velvet black with sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Bivins-Shepherd</li>
            <li> I use this as eyebrow and underneath my eyes as a liner. I have been using this for several years and i do not want  any others. I have bought other brands and had to in up giving them away.  Blessings!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I love it. I was happy to be able to find it since the stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this item, but I can get these anywhere.  I was wanting the liner that comes with the sharpner on the opposite end. I don&#x27;t think they make these anymore and I am trying to hold on to the one I have to sharpenen the new ones.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> i have been using this eyebrow pencil for more than 20 years , and all of a sudden  I didn!t see it  in the stores anymore. I got in touch with Maybelline and I was told that this item has been discontiued. So HELLO AMAZON... so glad i have can find  what i am used to .</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. I have been using it for years. Was very pleased to find it at Amazon as it has been discontinued. I was shocked and very puzzled to find out I had been charged $199. dollars for shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a knock off. Packaging wasn&#x27;t right and product is not like the real product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for decades. Thought I used my last one when I couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores. So happy you found it for me!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I received one without the sharpener - not the one pictured.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is very hard to get ahold of in wichita,ks due to the fact its ALWAYS SOLD OUT ALWAYs in velvet black tried maby stores always allgone so this is my new go to place to get ahold of one when i run out, thxs!</li>
            <li> I love this brow liner so much! It&#x27;s all I have used for years. Not sure why I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore...thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in the stores in this color. I was excited to see that Amazon had it in my color and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I used to this a long time ago it&#x27;s been years, here it was on Amazon so I bought it, it didn&#x27;t come with the sharpener as described in the picture.  I was very disappointed it not same thing in the picture I used to buy it many years ago, the one that I have is plain red....😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫</li>
            <li> Not my favorite maybelline product. But good eyeliner for a teenage who starting out. I&#x27;ll  stick with my CoverGirl eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I WAS HURT WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT MAYBELLINE NO LONGER CARRIED THE VELVET BLACK EYE LINER EYE BROW PENCIL.  I LOOKED AT WALMART  AND OTHER STORES, THEY ALL HAD THE NEW MAYBELLINE PRODUCT.  I DECIDED TO LOOK IN AMAZON WHILE I WAS SEARCHING FOR OTHER THINGS  IN THE MAKEUP AREA AND THEIR IT WAS.  I WAS SO HAPPY I ORDERED 4 AND PLAN ON ORDERING MORE BEFORE THEY RUN OUT.  THANKS AMAZON...</li>
            <li> works great for me  the only reason I bought it on line was because cvs and rightaide stopped carrying it- been using this all my life</li>
            <li> Great standard beauty product that you can&#x27;t beat! This is one product to order while the new ones fall by the wayside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this forever and Maybelline doesn&#x27;t make it anymore. It&#x27;s easy to apply for brows, not so much for eyeliner, but the duo pack they sell now isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way of sharpening this!  And though it is packaged and encased well, it&#x27;s not a product I would buy again.  I will just stick with what works: the brow pencil.</li>
            <li> No sharpener included, as pictured. That&#x27;s the only reason I ordered them to get the built in sharpener. Still use the eyeliner though.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and recently had trouble finding it. It is the only liner that works for my brows also.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is good for eyebrows. Doesn&#x27;t show as an eyeliner. I am a bit puzzled why so many liked it.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is fine but I purchased this specific item because it shows that a sharpener is included. The one I received did not have a sharpener.</li>
            <li> What you see is not what you will get.... What I got was a pencil only.... No sharpener no compartment (w another crayon) ... Not sure how to sharpen the pencil since it has no sharpener... Wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had known</li>
            <li> Hands down the best brow filler!</li>
            <li> wish this product wasn&#x27;t obsolete...I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years. sad to see it no longer available.</li>
            <li> This is the best for an eyebrow pencil, however it isn&#x27;t very dark for eyeliner use. My eyebrows aren&#x27;t very dark, so I use this and its amazing. Its unfortunate the price skyrocketed, I used to be able to order it for 5 bucks. Anyway, great product, great seller, thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The item shown has a sharpener attached and my reason to order.  The item received did not have a sharpener..very disappointing</li>
            <li> Since I have thin eye brows I have used this product for at least 30 years.  It is now impossible to find in the local stores, so I purchased online through Amazon several pencils just to have on hand.  I am sure they will soon be extinct.  One of the best features is the pencil screws up revealing more pencil.  Don&#x27;t really need to sharpen, unless to like a very fine point.  I really don&#x27;t understand why Maybelline decided to discontinue.</li>
            <li> Had looked all over town. maybelline&#x27;s new pencil is awful. Black gooey.  This pencil, even though black, is soft and perfect</li>
            <li> I think this is a good eyebrow liner but not such a hot eyeliner.  I use it every day to cover the grey in my eyebrows.  I&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product is not what is pictured.  I wanted a sharpener like it shows but it is just an eyeliner.  Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> do you have more?  I have used these pencils for years and they are the only ones I like.  Very smooth</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner. It goes on smoothly and has a built in sharpener. Best value for the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. Can&#x27;t get it in the retail stores anymore. My wife says it&#x27;s the best eye liner ever. Why in the world did they stop making this product?  If it ain&#x27;t broke keep making it!</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered it, so sad this product has been discontinued by Maybelline</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice brah! I remember back in 7th grade I used to smear my mascara across my eyebrows to make them fuller haha.  Anyways, this pencil is sick! I get the right shape everytime.  I brought it last year of October, and I still have it as of September!  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil ever! I wish they wouldn&#x27;t have discontinued :(</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of the pictured Brow &amp; Eye Liners WITH the BUILT IN Sharper FOR the built-in Sharpener! What I got were 1 with and 2 without! Shame on this vendor for such practices and on Maybellene themselves for such deceptive identical packaging. Unless you know what the  sharpener looks like, a small light band near the tip of the red plastic pencil, they appear to be identical. There are several 1, 2, &amp; 3 star revues stating this has happened repeatedly to other Amazon Shoppers! So Buyer beware! Amazon please do something about these shoddy practices of outside vendors, otherwise it&#x27;s nothing better than ebay at its worst! We can get ripped off anywhere but I TRUST Amazon! They did allow me to return the 2 with full credit and a return shipping label!</li>
            <li> I wish they wouldn&#x27;t have discontinued this pencil.  It is the best ever.  It goes on smoothly, stays put &amp; looks so natural, unlike other pencils.  I wish they&#x27;d bring it  back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Maybelline product for over 50 years now and wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it.  Dependable and cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Self sharpening keeps it ready to go. I have used this product for years and years and get plenty of compliments even at my age. I hope they never stop making it, it is that great!!!!!</li>
            <li> Was not as pictured - no sharpener on end.  Not as pictured - no sharpener. Not as pictures no sharpener.</li>
            <li> Love this liner...have used it for years and am disappointed that it seems to be disappearing and is now very difficult to find and purchase.  Thank you, Amazon, for giving me a source for however long it lasts.  This is great stuff!</li>
