            <li>This product is awesome.</li>
            <li>One of the best hair products on the market.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best product</li>
            <li>This product is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>This works great!</li>
            <li>Was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works great on my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>(my hairstyle is like phil keoghan, host to the amazing race</li>
            <li>Great holding power works best with short to medium hair.</li>
            <li>I was glad when I first used it because it definitely is a great elastic paste.  </li>
            <li>Okay stuff</li>
            <li>just more too so its</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>this product comes off very easily, but it also holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product while shopping without knowing if it would work.  </li>
            <li>I would get it if it came with more but honestly gonna stick with gastby because gastby is just slightly cheaper and you get more</li>
            <li>but this is some good stuff overall</li>
            <li>If you feel like you have too much in one spot, gradually add more water to that spot and spread it around.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for those of us with short or fine hair...  </li>
            <li>have a shorter haircut on the sides and slightly longer on top, I mostly use it on the top and on the transition/corners of my head.</li>
            <li>No waiting for it to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;  or having to trick it into place then spray it with hairspray quickly and hope you don&#x27;t encounter a breeze before it dries...  </li>
            <li>This product is great for lying down edges...</li>
            <li>but the price is rough because for the under price of one of these I could get a 3pack of gastby which works just as good</li>
            <li>This paste arrived promptly and was fresh.  </li>
            <li>not dry out the hair at all and is very easy to wash off&lt;br</li>
            <li>i only use a little bit at a time but make sure to get it all over my hair and it holds great.</li>
            <li>product not only has great holding power but has a very matte finish, so you can barely tell that it is there.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have thicker hair that is hard to control</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It holds better than both the bedhead and the L.A look products (does not flake at all)&lt;br /&gt;-Stays in my hair longer than American crew products</li>
            <li>It work awesome definitely work on African American hair.</li>
            <li>Has a long shelf life and easy to use on any length of hair!</li>
            <li>he said a lot of products aren&#x27;t easy to clean off your hair/scalp, which causes dry scalp and what not.</li>
            <li>So this is how I break this Product down for my own hairstyle in particular</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s by far worth it</li>
            <li>It is simply the only product I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m metro sexual as heck)</li>
            <li>but not great holds the hair good and styles</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products that works for my fine hair-  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money especially if you have thick hair that needs a strong and natural looking hold.</li>
            <li>only time you are able to tell is if you are sweating and you run your hands through your hair, then you will get a little bit of a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I think it may even help my hair shine, not greasy shine but a natural hair shine&lt;</li>
            <li>I am glad my hairstylist recommended the product to me since I was really in a struggle to find out what kind of hair holding product I wanted since all of the other ones have bad traits to them.</li>
            <li>I bought this two years ago when i first cut my hair short, I had no rhyme or reason to buy this particular product other than it was at the salon i got my hair cut at.  </li>
            <li>The product was old and dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this two years ago when i first cut my hair short, I had no rhyme or reason to buy this particular product other than it was at the salon i got my hair cut at.  </li>
            <li> The product was old and dry.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I have tried 2 others, and none are like this.  </li>
            <li> hair is still flexible a lilttle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t wet like gel or other pastes so your hair looks really natural not greasy or wet.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and one can (or tub, or whatever this is) will last me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> if your hair shouldn&#x27;t be too dry or too wet (unless you like the wet (but not Shiney) look when applying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it stays white, which shows in my dark hair if you don&#x27;t get it rubbed in well enough.</li>
            <li> , others not really ya can try it without then try it with.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Since you only have to use a small amount at a time, this little tub can easily last over a month or two.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep one just because I opened it, but I returned the other one.</li>
            <li> Just one tiny dab will do ya, gives you a flexible hold, and one small canister lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it from other places in the past where it was old and hard.  </li>
            <li> lot of other products are either too weak to really make thicker hair do what you want, or they result in very stiff and unnatural looking</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s firm but</li>
            <li> Nope, it plain works.  </li>
            <li> not easy to find at b&amp;m.</li>
            <li> The paste is firm and will hold up thick hair.  </li>
            <li> after all that business, apply the thick paste in a small amount on \\&quot;damp\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> use little at a time, that is the secret.</li>
            <li> once you get it at least once to see how it is.</li>
            <li> Holds well even when my thick hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t get crusty/flaky/any other adjective that you use to describe bad hair products.</li>
            <li> When you have thinish hair, it can be difficult to find a product that will hold your hair in place for those edgier styles you want to achieve.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Okay stuff but the price is rough because for the under price of one of these I could get a 3pack of gastby which works just as good but this is some good stuff overall I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again tho knowing I could get 3x of gastby for a cheaper price and its just more too so its okay but not great holds the hair good and styles well dunno what else I would say bout this I would get it if it came with more but honestly gonna stick with gastby because gastby is just slightly cheaper and you get more</li>
            <li> Great flexibility and hold for a man&#x27;s hair! Has a long shelf life and easy to use on any length of hair!</li>
            <li> leaves a white residue</li>
            <li> i bought this paste on the recommendation of a hairstylist. he said a lot of products aren&#x27;t easy to clean off your hair/scalp, which causes dry scalp and what not. this product comes off very easily, but it also holds pretty well. i only use a little bit at a time but make sure to get it all over my hair and it holds great. all day hold. i looked for this product at several beauty supply stores before i found it on amazon. not easy to find at b&amp;m. use little at a time, that is the secret.</li>
            <li> So this is how I break this Product down for my own hairstyle in particular (my hairstyle is like phil keoghan, host to the amazing race t.v. show)&lt;br /&gt;-It holds better than both the bedhead and the L.A look products (does not flake at all)&lt;br /&gt;-Stays in my hair longer than American crew products&lt;br /&gt;-does not dry out the hair at all and is very easy to wash off&lt;br /&gt;-I think it may even help my hair shine, not greasy shine but a natural hair shine&lt;br /&gt;-This product looks small but lasts a LONG time, just as long as those full bottle of gels ya can by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a bit pricey but it&#x27;s by far worth it once you get it at least once to see how it is. Then if ya dont like it, simply never buy it again, simple as that. I am glad my hairstylist recommended the product to me since I was really in a struggle to find out what kind of hair holding product I wanted since all of the other ones have bad traits to them. Axe drys out your hair, wont leave your hair feeling greasy... This product is awesome. My buddies are calling me mr.hollywood now ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way to apply:&lt;br /&gt;shampoo + condition hair with whatever ya use. Then I like to put in leave-in conditioner which for some people its needed, others not really ya can try it without then try it with.&lt;br /&gt;Then after all that business, apply the thick paste in a small amount on \\&quot;damp\\&quot; hair. If you feel like you have too much in one spot, gradually add more water to that spot and spread it around.</li>

            <li> The only wax that works for my mother&#x27;s short hair. She refuses to leave the house without it! I bought it as a gift for her.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it stays white, which shows in my dark hair if you don&#x27;t get it rubbed in well enough. Holds well even when my thick hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that works for my fine hair-  it stays in place and I don&#x27;t have to fuss with my hair during the day</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products on the market.  Need only a tiny bit.  Great holding power works best with short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product while shopping without knowing if it would work.  I was glad when I first used it because it definitely is a great elastic paste.  The paste is firm and will hold up thick hair.  I have thick hair I spike up in the front.  It isn&#x27;t wet like gel or other pastes so your hair looks really natural not greasy or wet.  Since you only have to use a small amount at a time, this little tub can easily last over a month or two.  It&#x27;s worth the money especially if you have thick hair that needs a strong and natural looking hold.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> I am still learning to work with this product. I like that it leaves no build up on my hair and think its going to work for my short spikey hairstyle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for those of us with short or fine hair...  It is simply the only product I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m metro sexual as heck) that can instantly mold your hair, and it will never move.  No waiting for it to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;  or having to trick it into place then spray it with hairspray quickly and hope you don&#x27;t encounter a breeze before it dries...  Nope, it plain works.  FYI if your hair shouldn&#x27;t be too dry or too wet (unless you like the wet (but not Shiney) look when applying.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It work awesome definitely work on African American hair. Love this product! I would definitely recommend  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This paste arrived promptly and was fresh.  I&#x27;ve ordered it from other places in the past where it was old and hard.  Was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is great for lying down edges...I&#x27;m an BW no perm ever and this is the best product no flaking and it&#x27;s firm but hair is still flexible a lilttle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have thicker hair that is hard to control and you don&#x27;t want the crunchy shininess of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of other products are either too weak to really make thicker hair do what you want, or they result in very stiff and unnatural looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product not only has great holding power but has a very matte finish, so you can barely tell that it is there. It also lets you adjust throughout the day to get back the shape that you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time you are able to tell is if you are sweating and you run your hands through your hair, then you will get a little bit of a greasy feel. Otherwise, this stuff is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a shorter haircut on the sides and slightly longer on top, I mostly use it on the top and on the transition/corners of my head. A little bit goes a long way, and one can (or tub, or whatever this is) will last me about 3 months. Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> The product was old and dry.  I had to keep one just because I opened it, but I returned the other one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Just one tiny dab will do ya, gives you a flexible hold, and one small canister lasts forever.</li>
            <li> When you have thinish hair, it can be difficult to find a product that will hold your hair in place for those edgier styles you want to achieve.  This product is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This works great! All my friends want to know where I got it because it&#x27;s now discontinued!</li>
