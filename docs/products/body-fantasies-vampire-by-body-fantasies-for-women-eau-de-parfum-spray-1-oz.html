            <li>Pretty satisfied with the product !!!</li>
            <li>smells amazing.</li>
            <li>but when i got it it didn&#x27;t tell me what kind of perfume it was(ingredients).</li>
            <li>i thought it was going to be kind of like a musk, woody smell, but it had  alittle bit of a vanilla smell to it</li>
            <li>However, I find this brand to be superior to most &amp;#34;top tier&amp;#34; perfumes.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is sweet yet spicy, and great for evening or daytime.</li>
            <li>Also, most perfumes do not smell right on me, but my boyfriend says this one smells delicious :)</li>
            <li>It goes on very strong, but mellows out after about 15 minutes and the scent stays with you all day and lingers.</li>
            <li>So far Amazon&#x27;s track record for finding, ordering, shipping and returning has been awesome for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s by far the best smelling perfume I have had</li>

            <li>I used to be able to buy it at a Meijer (it&#x27;s like a WalMart but exclusive to Michigan)</li>

            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s light and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It is more subtle,and that&#x27;s what I like about it.</li>
            <li>So I knew I loved it all ready.</li>
            <li>It just brought sexy back lol.</li>
            <li>Not to strong and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Very pleased at how fast it came in</li>
            <li>It is so sweet smelling, that is my favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li>I love this sweet smell.</li>
            <li>i ordered it right away because i love vampires and it very unique.</li>
            <li>The perfume is great, smells amazing, and comes in a small cute bottle.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when, as a cheer-me-up present, a family member bought me a full sized bottle!</li>
            <li>A very provocative, exotic scent!</li>
            <li>It is great for any woman, I am in my early thirites and my mom wants to steal it from me, so there is your proof! :)</li>
            <li>fantastic, i need to say no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the only place I can find it great quality</li>
            <li>It smells so cheap and stingy</li>
            <li>It has sweet top notes of fresh florals and and lows that have a hint of spice and chocolate.</li>
            <li>It was love at first sniff</li>
            <li>i was looking for a unique perfume and this product came up.</li>
            <li>since the first day i used this perfume i fell in love with it, when i have it on wherever i go people</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a warm, sultry, sexy scent.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to apply it every day to myself, and in my hair for special occasions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definetly a 5 star product thanks.:).  </li>
            <li>but I gave this to my mother and she seems to really like it :)</li>
            <li>The smell is semi sweet</li>
            <li>So cool.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume the shipping to me was fast</li>
            <li>Glad I can still find it at decent prices on-line.</li>
            <li>admit to being one of the many lovers of supernatural things (vampires, werewolves, faeries, etc) and therefore wanted this as soon as I saw it.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and hot!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li>A new favorite.</li>
            <li>musky like cheap old lady perfume with a strong alcohol hint.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of scents, but do well with the earthly, exotic tones of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the perfume was just right and not a overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>this perfume is a very intimate fragrance, my husband loves it on me.</li>
            <li>amazon ps sounds odd but smells delicious with a single spray of farenheit</li>
            <li>And the smell last all day, I don&#x27;t need to reapply more through out the day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the seller was faster and the bottle and presentation is first</li>
            <li>I had first purchased this at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a Viva La Juicy fan, but this has been my favorite perfume over the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>This is one of my personal favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes and it came earlier than I thought!</li>
            <li>i love this perfume, one of my favorites to wear regularly.</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought when i first saw it.</li>
            <li>Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future everyone should try this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, so long after I found the samples, I was able to purchase a bottle, and I wear it ALL the time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the smell which lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Love the Vampire Perfume, it has a nice faint floral earthy scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  </li>
            <li>I had all ready been introduced to this product before I bought it off Amazon.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I REALLY like</li>
            <li>Body fantasies has really outdone themselves.</li>
            <li>to me vanilla had a very nauseoing(sick) smell.</li>
            <li>Light, sultry, earthy, woodsy and deep.</li>
            <li>then you think it will smell like, and it is very feminine.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>It smells good and it last longer than some other perfume.</li>
            <li>It is Super different</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this item to any vampire or lover of such,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good experience will drive my man crazy i can tell</li>
            <li>Im a bit confused by the reviews being so good.</li>
            <li>really like this because it is not real heavy</li>
            <li>Love this scent and it&#x27;s so hard to find this in the stores where I live</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>and you can wear it from early day to evening.</li>
            <li>Or like an old basement.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if its called vampire cuz it smells like someone thousands of years old.</li>
            <li>I have bought many different kinds of perfume, from very expensive to very cheap.  </li>
            <li>I bought the small travel one a few years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it in a bin at goodwill in the little spray can for fifty cents.  </li>

            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  </li>

            <li> My favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy it at a Meijer (it&#x27;s like a WalMart but exclusive to Michigan)</li>
            <li> You may be able to find this in a WalMart or any like store.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I always spray this one when I want to strut my stuff and feel sexy and empowered.</li>
            <li> I recommed this spray to any woman who wants to smell great all day.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It is more subtle,and that&#x27;s what I like about it.</li>
            <li> So I knew I loved it all ready.</li>
            <li> It just brought sexy back lol.</li>
            <li> Not to strong and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Very pleased at how fast it came in</li>
            <li> It is so sweet smelling, that is my favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li> I love this sweet smell.</li>
            <li> i ordered it right away because i love vampires and it very unique.</li>
            <li> The perfume is great, smells amazing, and comes in a small cute bottle.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when, as a cheer-me-up present, a family member bought me a full sized bottle!</li>
            <li> A very provocative, exotic scent!</li>
            <li> It is great for any woman, I am in my early thirites and my mom wants to steal it from me, so there is your proof! :)</li>
            <li> fantastic, i need to say no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the only place I can find it great quality</li>
            <li> It smells so cheap and stingy</li>
            <li> It has sweet top notes of fresh florals and and lows that have a hint of spice and chocolate.</li>
            <li> It was love at first sniff</li>
            <li> i was looking for a unique perfume and this product came up.</li>
            <li> since the first day i used this perfume i fell in love with it, when i have it on wherever i go people</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a warm, sultry, sexy scent.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to apply it every day to myself, and in my hair for special occasions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definetly a 5 star product thanks.:).  </li>
            <li> but I gave this to my mother and she seems to really like it :)</li>
            <li> The smell is semi sweet</li>
            <li> So cool.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume the shipping to me was fast</li>
            <li> Glad I can still find it at decent prices on-line.</li>
            <li> admit to being one of the many lovers of supernatural things (vampires, werewolves, faeries, etc) and therefore wanted this as soon as I saw it.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and hot!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> A new favorite.</li>
            <li> musky like cheap old lady perfume with a strong alcohol hint.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of scents, but do well with the earthly, exotic tones of this perfume.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume was just right and not a overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> this perfume is a very intimate fragrance, my husband loves it on me.</li>
            <li> amazon ps sounds odd but smells delicious with a single spray of farenheit</li>
            <li> And the smell last all day, I don&#x27;t need to reapply more through out the day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the seller was faster and the bottle and presentation is first</li>
            <li> I had first purchased this at the mall.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a Viva La Juicy fan, but this has been my favorite perfume over the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> This is one of my personal favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes and it came earlier than I thought!</li>
            <li> i love this perfume, one of my favorites to wear regularly.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought when i first saw it.</li>
            <li> Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future everyone should try this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, so long after I found the samples, I was able to purchase a bottle, and I wear it ALL the time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the smell which lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Love the Vampire Perfume, it has a nice faint floral earthy scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  </li>
            <li> I had all ready been introduced to this product before I bought it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I REALLY like</li>
            <li> Body fantasies has really outdone themselves.</li>
            <li> to me vanilla had a very nauseoing(sick) smell.</li>
            <li> Light, sultry, earthy, woodsy and deep.</li>
            <li> then you think it will smell like, and it is very feminine.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> It smells good and it last longer than some other perfume.</li>
            <li> It is Super different</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this item to any vampire or lover of such,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very good experience will drive my man crazy i can tell</li>
            <li> Im a bit confused by the reviews being so good.</li>
            <li> really like this because it is not real heavy</li>
            <li> Love this scent and it&#x27;s so hard to find this in the stores where I live</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> and you can wear it from early day to evening.</li>
            <li> Or like an old basement.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if its called vampire cuz it smells like someone thousands of years old.</li>
            <li> I have bought many different kinds of perfume, from very expensive to very cheap.  </li>
            <li> I bought the small travel one a few years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> I first discovered it in a bin at goodwill in the little spray can for fifty cents.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting especially when applied with body lotion and tends to last all day on me.</li>
            <li> am thrilled that it is not too expensive!</li>
            <li> I just wish the price could go down cause I&#x27;m a young teen with no job or money.</li>
            <li> It is similar to Jessica Simpson Fancy in my opinion but not exactly the same just similar.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I used it every single day</li>
            <li> This spray is very long lasting, spray a little bit, and it will linger on your body for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not having a credit card to use makes it a bit harder to shop on line.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s my long black cape?</li>
            <li> A little will go a long ways when it comes to this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other perfumes, but I do wear body</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t overpower or linger like others that just seem heavy and linger too long.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come in the box shown</li>
            <li> I just got this and put it on over Black Amethyst lotion from Bath and Bodyworks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically like perfume, but I like this one a lot.</li>
            <li> It is femenine, yet not so sweet smelling that you get sick at your stomach.  </li>
            <li> I tried the little tester I found at a CVS and just about died from the realization...</li>
            <li> I hated not having more of the samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I am slightly over 50!</li>
            <li> I even choose it above my expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> After looking on Amazon I realized that this is not a &amp;#34;top tier&amp;#34; perfume meaning it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg for one small bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not flirty, not cute, not girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to buy it at least every three months.</li>
            <li> oh so hard to find!</li>
            <li> Very hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I got it for christmas and it smells NASTY!</li>
            <li> and even he snarled his nose and was disgusted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cologne, smells wonderful and the bottle is awesome.</li>
            <li> I get compliments in this perfume EVERY TIME I WEAR IT, no joke. It smells divine.</li>
            <li> I have bought many different kinds of perfume, from very expensive to very cheap.  Out of all the perfumes I have bought this is my favorite, I have got so many compliments when I wear it. And the smell last all day, I don&#x27;t need to reapply more through out the day.  I hope they continue making this scent, I will always repurchase.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what some guy said to me in passing, wow. I was speechless.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this because it is not real heavy and you can wear it from early day to evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for a while</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, but oh so hard to find! I am sensitive to a lot of scents, but do well with the earthly, exotic tones of this perfume. Also, most perfumes do not smell right on me, but my boyfriend says this one smells delicious :) It goes on very strong, but mellows out after about 15 minutes and the scent stays with you all day and lingers. Love it! A very provocative, exotic scent!</li>
            <li> fantastic, i need to say no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the seller was faster and the bottle and presentation is first rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this item to any vampire or lover of such,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like to bite</li>
            <li> I had first purchased this at the mall.  Then they stopped carrying it.  So I found it online through Amazon. I have ordered this before and loved it.  These are just the same.  I love them!  Hope you keep carrying it!</li>
            <li> I had all ready been introduced to this product before I bought it off Amazon. So I knew I loved it all ready. I just could not find it at Retail stores anymore. Not having a credit card to use makes it a bit harder to shop on line. But I found it and got it immediately. So far Amazon&#x27;s track record for finding, ordering, shipping and returning has been awesome for me.</li>
            <li> I simply love this fragrance and the fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. It lasts a long time as well. I received a gift set of the 1oz. and the &amp;#34;bite size&amp;#34; and had to buy another 1oz. because I like the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and it&#x27;s so hard to find this in the stores where I live I thought it got discontinued thanks amazon ps sounds odd but smells delicious with a single spray of farenheit</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells so, so,so good!!! Only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come in the box shown</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  really wonderful  :-)</li>

            <li> Just wish it did not cost a fortune to buy. $10 tops It should be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of this and this is the only place I can find it great quality</li>
            <li> i love this brand its one of the fav that I like&lt;br /&gt;the smell burst out and everyone that&#x27;s around&lt;br /&gt;you can smell it</li>
            <li> This parfum spray is intoxicating, that is the only word to describe it.  My husband loves it, and when I where it at work I get a lot of compliments.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent and has made it her signature scent.  I have bought this for both her birthday and Christmas.  I will be buying more of it this year.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Viva La Juicy fan, but this has been my favorite perfume over the last couple of years. My husband loves it too.  I often wonder if it has pheromones in it by the way he reacts to it...lol.  I first discovered it in a bin at goodwill in the little spray can for fifty cents.  It was love at first sniff and I have been a customer since.  :)</li>
            <li> My girl was very pleased, all is good, and she was very happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other perfumes, but I do wear body sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a spray I REALLY like and at the time the bottles had samples of this perfume attached to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED IT! I hated not having more of the samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, so long after I found the samples, I was able to purchase a bottle, and I wear it ALL the time!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my coat so I don&#x27;t have to apply it every day to myself, and in my hair for special occasions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that it is not too expensive!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this smell on me, it smells so good. I have to buy it at least every three months.</li>
            <li> Vampire perfume by body fantasies smells great. It is more of a musk but still has a hint of flowers. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wish i had realized this is not to attract vampires but to deter them.  It smells like garlic, and wooden stakes.  Good news though, no one has come to my door and asked to be invited in.</li>
            <li> great item at a wonderful price</li>
            <li> This product has not arrived yet. But I am sure it  will be on it&#x27;s way soon!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my sister will like!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and can&#x27;t find it out in the marketplace.  I will keep ordering and hope to never run out.</li>
            <li> this perfume is a very intimate fragrance, my husband loves it on me. i wish the bottle came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume! Very sexy, but very strong! A little will go a long ways when it comes to this.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume! It sells amazing! Not to strong and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Im a bit confused by the reviews being so good. And wondering if they actually smell this perfume. I got it for christmas and it smells NASTY! It smells so cheap and stingy musky like cheap old lady perfume with a strong alcohol hint. Or like an old basement. I had my boyfriend who is a cologne freak smell it and even he snarled his nose and was disgusted. Makes me wonder if its called vampire cuz it smells like someone thousands of years old.</li>
            <li> i love this!!!!! bought a smaller size to put in my purse so I would have it when ever I would need it.  Love the smell which lasts a long time.  Even the boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase as someone else had bought this fragrance for me. It smells good in the bottle and on me. I would recommend this to others if asked.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent.  Well worth the price.  It has a very light and pleasant smell and won&#x27;t overpower the room as others do.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Vampire Perfume\\&quot; is wonderful!!!! The smell is sweet and hot! I love it! I just wish the price could go down cause I&#x27;m a young teen with no job or money.</li>
            <li> This is my go to fragrence! I even choose it above my expensive perfumes. Body fantasies has really outdone themselves. It&#x27;s such a warm, sultry, sexy scent. Also check it out in the \\&quot;bite size\\&quot; bottle for your purse or travel. I get so many compliments when I wear it. And best of all my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this fragrance years ago.  Glad I can still find it at decent prices on-line.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this for my Girlfriend because she can&#x27;t find it anywhere at stores anymore and it&#x27;s her favorite!! Very pleased at how fast it came in and she&#x27;s happy!!! Definetly a 5 star product thanks.:).  Bruce</li>
            <li> i was looking for a unique perfume and this product came up. i ordered it right away because i love vampires and it very unique. but when i got it it didn&#x27;t tell me what kind of perfume it was(ingredients). i thought it was going to be kind of like a musk, woody smell, but it had  alittle bit of a vanilla smell to it and i had to stop wearing it because i started to get nauseous from it. i don&#x27;t mind vanilla in cooking, but i can&#x27;t stand vanilla in beauty products or even cleaning products. to me vanilla had a very nauseoing(sick) smell. i love the bottle it came in but i wished they would of print the perfume ingredients on the box and on their website.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Vampire. It has sweet top notes of fresh florals and and lows that have a hint of spice and chocolate. It&#x27;s long lasting especially when applied with body lotion and tends to last all day on me. I love the scent and have literally had friends smell it spend forever trying to figure out what the wonderful scent is.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and lasts along time love the packaging! very good experience will drive my man crazy i can tell</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved Vampire.  I tried the little tester I found at a CVS and just about died from the realization...&amp;#34;I have just found my perfect scent&amp;#34;.  After looking on Amazon I realized that this is not a &amp;#34;top tier&amp;#34; perfume meaning it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg for one small bottle.  However, I find this brand to be superior to most &amp;#34;top tier&amp;#34; perfumes.  Beautiful price, and it&#x27;s the perfect match for me.</li>
            <li> since the first day i used this perfume i fell in love with it, when i have it on wherever i go people i ask me what i have on, since 2011 that was my perfume until the day i couldn&#x27;t find at the place where i used to buy and i have been looking for it everywhere and one day i had an idea to try online and i found it, im so glad to have it now. really love this perfume!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and I think it smells great. That&#x27;s all that needs to be said</li>
            <li> This is one of my personal favorite perfumes. I wish I could buy it in the store. I absolutely love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and in great condition. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes and it came earlier than I thought!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It smells so good and lasts for a long time! It is similar to Jessica Simpson Fancy in my opinion but not exactly the same just similar. I love it for fall and winter or night anytime of the year. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume, one of my favorites to wear regularly. I get so many compliments. I just wish the price would stop going up.</li>
            <li> I love Body Fantasies Vampire Perfume!! It is an amazing scent! I just can&#x27;t get enough! It&#x27;s definitely my go-to scent.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it last longer than some other perfume. All the people I know said it smelled real good als</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It is femenine, yet not so sweet smelling that you get sick at your stomach.  It has a very nice suductive smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for Prom one year at Wal Mart and I fell in love with it. I used it every single day and now I wish I could have it again. It&#x27;s such a wonderful thing.</li>
            <li> Love the Vampire Perfume, it has a nice faint floral earthy scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  I have received many compliments since I started wearingit.  The delivery service was super excellent.  Although I was told 7 to 10 days, it arrived within 4 days. Awesome!!! Try it.

            <li> I just got this and put it on over Black Amethyst lotion from Bath and Bodyworks. I smell like the second coming of the Queen of the Damned! Love it. A new favorite. And I am slightly over 50! It just brought sexy back lol. Light, sultry, earthy, woodsy and deep. Where&#x27;s my long black cape? Hehehe!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday present for a friend and she love it. The smell of the perfume was just right and not a overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> I never heard of this perfume before, but I am sure glad I found it here on Amazon. This perfume is sweet yet spicy, and great for evening or daytime. It is great for any woman, I am in my early thirites and my mom wants to steal it from me, so there is your proof! :)</li>
            <li> If you have not smelled this, you should.  It is Super different then you think it will smell like, and it is very feminine.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume of all time. I used to be able to buy it at a Meijer (it&#x27;s like a WalMart but exclusive to Michigan) all the time, but they stopped. You may be able to find this in a WalMart or any like store. The perfume is great, smells amazing, and comes in a small cute bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells really good I wished it lasted longer but I gave this to my mother and she seems to really like it :) so if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy ! Pretty satisfied with the product !!!</li>
            <li> The smell is semi sweet&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would had never pulled this off store shelves&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s by far the best smelling perfume I have had and by far the best I have ever smelled</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is exactly what I wanted. To test it, I tried it out on both my sister and myself to see if it would smell different. 1.5 hours later, she smells fruity and I smell musky. So cool.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance. Very hard to come by. I bought when i first saw it. Definitely will order more. Shipped fast and my husband loves it. Last for hours. I fall asleep wake up still smelling it. Comes off in a shower. Im so happy!! Just wish i could find the sister brand midnight</li>
            <li> There is only one way to desrcibe this perfume: sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not flirty, not cute, not girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, deep, sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit to being one of the many lovers of supernatural things (vampires, werewolves, faeries, etc) and therefore wanted this as soon as I saw it. I was so happy when, as a cheer-me-up present, a family member bought me a full sized bottle! I always spray this one when I want to strut my stuff and feel sexy and empowered. I feel like it was made for me, it fits me perfectly. This is one I&#x27;ll be keeping in my collection for years.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had found a sample of this body spray at Walmart and I have been looking for it ever since. This is by far the best smelling body spray I have ever had. It is so sweet smelling, that is my favorite scent of all time. This spray is very long lasting, spray a little bit, and it will linger on your body for a long time. I am so glad I was able to find this body spray, I love love love it! I recommed this spray to any woman who wants to smell great all day.</li>
            <li> I love this sweet smell. I can&#x27;t get enough of this perfume. I will be getting this item.</li>
            <li> Great scent and  I can&#x27;t find it in stores around me, love it!</li>
            <li> Great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume the shipping to me was fast I can&#x27;t find it in stores and the price is awesome I&#x27;m always having people tell me how wonderful I smell I will be buying more in the future everyone should try this it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically like perfume, but I like this one a lot. I tried to find it after my last one ran out to no avail. I like it because it&#x27;s light and smells nice. It doesn&#x27;t overpower or linger like others that just seem heavy and linger too long. It is more subtle,and that&#x27;s what I like about it.</li>
            <li> Smells good she loved it</li>
