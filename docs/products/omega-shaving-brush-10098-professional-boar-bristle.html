            <li>very nice!</li>

            <li>Great quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>The handle is plastic, and if you don&#x27;t care about that then you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great seller.  </li>
            <li>so this brush is great for that</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>The brush quality is there and it works great as a brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great.</li>
            <li>A great addition to my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>Great brush and does the job well.</li>
            <li>The brush is great.  </li>
            <li>but it has a great backbone.  </li>
            <li>, the ends were already split (and feel great), and there was no funky smell.  </li>
            <li>Still works great.  </li>
            <li>One of the great things about boar is how the bristles split over time, making for a softer brush that holds the lather.</li>
            <li>This brush works great for lathering shave soap pucks.</li>
            <li>It builds lather in a bowl and on the face very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I see Omega brushes get generally good reviews and, after using this one, I can see why.</li>
            <li>A good value</li>
            <li>Good for people with arthritis.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up good and hols water.</li>
            <li>it is holding up very nicely, lathers up well and feels nice.</li>
            <li>I can work the lather into the beard and stand up my whiskers for a great &amp;#34;baby smooth &amp;#34; shave with this brush, and I should mention that the price make this a great value .</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Omega!</li>
            <li>but once they do you&#x27;ll be satisfied!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of shaving enjoyment with this one!</li>
            <li>For the price this brush is great, omega makes a fantastic boar hair brush.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li>it was nice to upgrade from a badger to a Omega brand boar brush.</li>
            <li>handle shape is nice, but plastic.</li>
            <li>n its not any kind of a hobby of mine or as a collector of them.</li>
            <li>Nice handle for a man size hand.</li>
            <li>This is the biggest brush I own now.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, and very cheap.    </li>
            <li>Nice brush for the money, just more brush than bargained for.  </li>
            <li>I have been so pleased with this brush and mug that I wanted to leave some kind of legacy to the men in my family</li>
            <li>That brush seemed to do an ok job, but i wasn&#x27;t getting the kind of lather I was led to expect.</li>
            <li>All in all, a great product from Omega, and definitely worth more than you&#x27;ll pay for it.  </li>
            <li>That seemed pretty great for about a year.</li>
            <li>No prickly feeling, very smooth against my face.  </li>
            <li>It builds a lather beautifully, and performs particularly well with pucks.</li>
            <li>I think this exfoliated better than any brush I have ever owned before.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite brush..</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful boar brush and can deal with the longer length of this Omega, look no further.</li>
            <li>The handle allows for a better grip, which I found allows for a better lather.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I could be very happy with it as my only brush.    </li>
            <li>I will be buying more Omega brushes.</li>
            <li>One of the things I noticed immediately was the brush&#x27;s ability to make lather, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>It is longer than most which works for my shaving mug.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than most badger brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>The Boar bristles do requires a bit more break-in</li>
            <li>To my knowledge this brush has not lost more than a couple of hairs in these 20 years.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have them</li>
            <li>However, this Omega Boar Bristle brush has become the one I use the most.</li>
            <li>Great lather maker and very well made.</li>
            <li>I love this brush-</li>
            <li>I like it better than the badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite for soaping up.</li>
            <li>I would love to use it as my every day brush</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll just have to travel more.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this specific brush was because the handle fits perfectly with the razor and brush stand</li>
            <li>Felt ALOT better than my 50 dollar Thater badger brush.  </li>
            <li>If you want to spend 100 dollars or more for a badger brush that&#x27;s not going to do anything better than this, have at it.  </li>
            <li>I expect that this brush will become more luxurious in feel as I use it</li>
            <li>22 mm knots are much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>This brush is ideal for mug lathering, but you&#x27;d be pleasantly surprised how well it works with a brush lathering method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>And it gets better and softer</li>
            <li>the more you use it.</li>
            <li>I was looking at silver badger and glad I chose this.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>the more I use it.  </li>
            <li>The overall height of the hair and handle make this brush the perfect size for the soup mug</li>
            <li>The price is right and it is a good investment.</li>
            <li>It also retains the exact amount of water you need for a superior lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard the Omega brushes were pretty good</li>
            <li>A pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say this is a quality brush and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Loads very easily, feels great on my face, easy to control, holds ALOT of water (especially if soaked for about 10 minutes), and very cheap compared to badger brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love how long it is and the firmness is absolutely impeccable!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for travel because the longer handle allows it to fit the space provided in my dop kit perfectly and discovered the long handle makes it easier to hold on to and the boar bristles give me better lather control than the floppy badger bristles.  </li>
            <li>Its works well, but it takes a lot of soap to get a good lather from it as it seems the large knot absorbs quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Great professional grade brush.</li>
            <li>But I was able to work up enough lather to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Great brush, not too stiff, softens with use, builds good lather.</li>
            <li>It is soft to the face and makes the most wonderful lather using this old Duffs&#x27; \\&quot;Williams Mug Soap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s new, it has the distinctive smell that all good boar bristle brushes have.</li>
            <li>I have a grade A silvertip brush which is super soft &amp; makes great lather, esp.</li>
            <li>It is a huge brush, however.</li>
            <li>This brush is HUGE.</li>
            <li>I left mine at my parents house and ordered this as a plan B. Great product, I have been using Omega for 15+ years.</li>
            <li>This brush feels fabulous on my face when applying the lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the biggest I can find relatively cheaply.</li>
            <li>Omega makes great brushes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as regularly as my badger brushes but it&#x27;s still a great brush.</li>
            <li>but I would be surprised if any brush of any kind was much better than this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on the face since I got the ends good and frayed</li>
            <li>This particular long handled brush is excellent and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Clean it, prep it and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Boar will develop split ends during the first 30 or so shaves, making the brush softer and more luxurious, while still retaining stiffness for a scrubby feel, without scratchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a deep Old Spice Shaving Mug &amp; this brush is perfect for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very soft, which makes it nice to use.  </li>
            <li>This is an obscenely good deal, and will last for years and years.</li>
            <li>The stiffer boar hair works the puck nicely &amp; the handle/ loft length makes it easy to get in the deep mug.</li>
            <li>Within a month of first use, the bristle ends split nicely (like boar bristle is supposed to do), making it a very comfortable brush with enough backbone to lather all the soaps I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have that strong of an animal smell at first like some boar brushes can.</li>
            <li>is great for that (just use a large bowl or a big soup mug or you will have lather everywhere).</li>
            <li>The boar hair has more ridgidity which is great for loading from hard soaps but the length of the bristles keep it from feeling too scrubby on your face.</li>
            <li>Super resilient bristles.</li>
            <li>Handle is very comfortable, not hard to control at all.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very easily and is soft with no scritch.</li>
            <li>Nice long handle makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The shape and material are easy to grasp with wet and soapy fingers, so it is a very secure and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In short, this is a quality brush which performs as good as a higher end luxury brush.</li>
            <li>I have found that putting both the mug and brush under the hot water and letting it run for a few minutes ,then pouring it out and immedately whipping up your lather results in a very good lather and will stay warm for even your second pass.  </li>
            <li>, very full, high quality.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>far as performance, it seemed okay.</li>
            <li>,however,my old standby will be the good old boar hair .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a VDH deluxe soap (part of the starter kit I bought), and I was having trouble getting a good lather with my old brush.</li>
            <li>If I had to choose one brush out of the several I own, this would be it.</li>
            <li>Not that this is a big deal, but it&#x27;s nice not to worry about that.</li>
            <li>This is a very large brush.</li>
            <li>Nice long brush too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will get softer after it breaks in a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I can really whip up a nice lather without constantly banging the bush handle against the sides of the mug.  </li>
            <li>For the price, who can complain though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife and the size really helps lather-up her legs quickly.</li>
            <li>I gave mine a good washing in dawn detergent and warm water, let it air-dry, then shampooed it and built a lather with it every day for about a week and a half (again, letting it air dry overnight in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush itself has a nice spring to it when you flick the excess water off of it which is nice, but it can get messy if you&#x27;re not careful about it.</li>
            <li>This is the third Omega Boar Bristle Brush I have ordered (and used) and like it much better than my Badger Brush or Synthetic Brush.  </li>
            <li>and it took forever to first get rid of the smell and</li>
            <li>I let it soak in piping hot water for probably 10 minutes while I was prepping my face.</li>
            <li>But, with the Omega brush it lathers like magic in just a second or 2.</li>
            <li>I have, I didn&#x27;t like having to put the part next to the knot into the holder, as it looks cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing when hanged by the handle.</li>
            <li>On the first shave the tips are softer than the \\&quot;pure\\&quot; badger brush I have.  </li>
            <li>I soak for several minutes before loading the brush to make sure the bristle is softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the lather is great and generates much faster than my small badger brush</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend without reservation!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite boar brush for several reasons.</li>
            <li>how much softer it was right out of the box compared to the VDH piece of junk.</li>
            <li>He really likes the larger handle and feels the boar bristle works a lather way better than silvertip badger.  </li>
            <li>You can expect to make more lather than you will need with this brush so to save even more money and put the remaining cream in an empty shaving cream jar and mix it in with your next lather!</li>
            <li>You can expect to make more lather than you will need with this brush so to save even more money and put the remaining cream in an empty shaving cream jar and mix it in with your next lather!</li>
            <li>By far, Omega is much superior than all other brand brushes I had and have.  </li>
            <li>I read up on breaking in a boar and it usually takes up to 30 lathers to fully break in a good boar brush, along with de-skunking it</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Both the handle and brush are fairly large.</li>
            <li>A large brush that provides a lot of lather for large faces.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend sticking to a normal, shorter brush unless you already have a good one and think it&#x27;s too short.</li>
            <li>It was somewhat stiff at first but loosened up nicely.</li>
            <li>I would just recommend a smaller brush to people first getting into wet shaving because they&#x27;re more precise and allow you to move the cream through your face without getting it all over your nose and ears.</li>
            <li>Nice and stiff without being abrasive, the long loft is great for bowl lather, and that &#x27;wet dog&#x27; smell you expect out of a boar brush</li>
            <li>It is my first Omega brush but having read reviews on them over the years my expectations were high</li>
            <li>I initially decided to take the &amp;#34;don&#x27;t pay too much in case you don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; route and bought an inexpensive shaving set, that included a cheap boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>soon as I got rid of the smell, this brush performed like an absolute champ.</li>
            <li>This brush performs very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a boar brush who doesn&#x27;t want to shell out twice as much money for a badger.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.----jim nelson</li>
            <li>and they were priced reasonably, so I took a chance.</li>
            <li>It had a very feint animal smell</li>
            <li>I wanted to put this brush on a fast track to breaking it in</li>
            <li>This brush has quite a bit of backbone compared to my badger and felt like I was really massaging my face when lathering</li>
            <li>What else could you really need?  </li>
            <li>it does it very well.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that since this is a boar brush, you&#x27;ll need to soak it longer before lathering and you won&#x27;t need to shake out as much water before you load it with soap or cream.</li>
            <li>and I cannot work up as much lather as I can with a shorter one.  </li>
            <li>The main con is that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water so I often have to run a little extra onto the brush to get the perfect lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to shorten or replace the handle myself, but I&#x27;ll try it a few more times to see if I can figure out the right way to hold it for bristle</li>
            <li>Being that it is a large brush I expected to have to use more than normal cream and soap to get sufficient lather from it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handle is big, for a start and keeps my hand  clean during the lathering process.</li>
            <li>The Omega paint brush is really really nice for everyday use!</li>
            <li>Plus it is a better brush than I previously had so</li>
            <li>Boar will absorb water where as badger will not, which I think equates to making more lather with less fuss.</li>
            <li>B00C6CCF9E RazoRock Classic Shave Cream 150ml]], the Omega 10098</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t soak the brush over night like others have said that they needed to do and this brush is soft, very comfortable and I highly recommend it to any regular person that merely needs a good shave...</li>
            <li>Great brush, had a little hair loss which is normal in the first few uses.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I b ought the Marvy 4p omega brush and the Marvy green rubber mug more than 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>I have had  several badger brushes down through the years and they are nice</li>
            <li>The large bristles really hold onto later and cover the face effortlessly.</li>
            <li>(of course), my [[ASIN:B001LY7GEM Merkur HD Slant Safety Razor 37C]] and a new [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>[99% of all boar brushes &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; when new]</li>
            <li>Brand new out of the box, about 10 hairs came out (one since)</li>
            <li>I really like the handle&#x27;s shape, but I&#x27;m not super excited about the plastic handle.</li>
            <li>I tried holding it several different ways but just couldn&#x27;t get a comfortable grip that allowed me control the bristles.</li>
            <li>It is very long and works great with a deep mug, that being said those bristles are stiff as all get out.</li>
            <li>Adding to the kudos here for this Omega boar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree, though that there is a break-in period for this brush, and it really does have a foul smell at first, particularly when you wet it.</li>
            <li>I did not find it too stiff and it had no bad odor on first use.  </li>
            <li>read that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and I was very surprised to find that was true... until it got wet.</li>
            <li>dog\\&quot; smell new natural bristle (hair) brushes tend to have.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just stiff enough to get a good lather going and soft enough for the face.</li>
            <li>Long handle makes the brush comfortable to use, including those with big hands.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this is that the lather can be a bit dry, but I just add water to the brush and the lather puffs up fine.</li>
            <li>I use the Shaving Factory Apothecary mug which is very deep with Classic Brand Premium Lime scent soap .I was using a smaller badger brush with some success.  </li>
            <li>It only lost a couple of the hairs early on and now holds pretty well.  </li>
            <li>(just use a large bowl or a big soup mug or you will have lather everywhere).</li>
            <li>the handle is exactly 3 inches long.</li>
            <li>I find the stiffer bristles make it much easier to whip up the lather whether your soap is in a traditional mug</li>
            <li>/&gt;It probably shed 3 or 4 bristles on first use; we&#x27;ll see how it holds up in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are wanting a brush with that old barbershop feel then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li>If you use a deep mug like an apothecary, I highly recommend this style brush!  </li>
            <li>so I soaked it in a nearly boiling  cup of water</li>
            <li>, then I used a cheap cake of shaving soap and did 7 lathers and blow dried it after each lather.</li>
            <li>but since the shiney razor, brush, and stand that I currently use along with the stainless steel shaving soap bowl were a gift from my wife that won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with Stirling and How to Grow A Mustache brand soaps so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes, including badger brushes, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I soaked it first thing with Dr. Bronners soap and hot water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li>The new bristles are softer than a new badger (regular clipped to size badger hair brush).</li>
            <li>the idea of a long, large handled brush appealed to me.</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;d rather spend the money on other things considering how satisfactorily this brush performs right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>or maybe they&#x27;re being overly critical of a brush that&#x27;s not the highest of high end brushes.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too big; I can&#x27;t see any advantage of using such a large brush ; except to use up  the shave cream faster.</li>
            <li>If you go with a different boar brush make SURE it has the longest possible hairs (loft) and the biggest knot size (diameter at brush hair base) and the tips of the brush have not been trimmed/cut to shape it - all of these factors have a huge impact on how prickly a boar brush is or isn&#x27;t, how much water/heat it holds and how much lather it makes</li>
            <li>If you go with a different boar brush make SURE it has the longest possible hairs (loft) and the biggest knot size (diameter at brush hair base) and the tips of the brush have not been trimmed/cut to shape it - all of these factors have a huge impact on how prickly a boar brush is or isn&#x27;t, how much water/heat it holds and how much lather it makes</li>
            <li>If you are a new wetshaver I would recommend this brush, a 12 pack of arko shave stick and a 100 pack of personna blue blades or Astra blades to start, along with the DE razor of your choice.</li>
            <li>The added length over a more common handle shape is helpful for lathering in a deep vessel.  </li>
            <li>At first it felt pretty soft, but as I swirled it on my face, it started to feel a little rough.</li>
            <li>Like other boar brushes, when you run it under water for the first time it WILL smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the loft being as long as it is, but that&#x27;s a personal preference and no reason to ding it.  </li>
            <li>Actually this may not be as soft as the badger</li>
            <li>Much softer than expected.</li>
            <li>When the brush arrived I was surprised how big it was (</li>
            <li>Outstanding brush for tough beards in combination with a deep mug.</li>
            <li>I can lather my entire cheek without barely moving this thing.</li>
            <li>I have used an Omega Brush for the past year (twice a day) and rarely find any bristles falling out.  </li>
            <li>First of all this brush creates a huge amount of thick, slick lather with a tiny amt. of cream or soap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush, haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle yet, been using it daily now for a few months!  </li>
            <li>Very solid, no loose bristles.</li>
            <li>Previously I used the little boar brush from the cheap Walmart VanDer Hagen box.</li>
            <li>Might be a little large for some.</li>
            <li>but you really need a little bit of assertiveness to exfoliate your stubborn chin hairs.</li>

            <li> very nice!</li>

            <li> I face lather and it feels great and lathers everything with ease.    </li>
            <li> Great quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> The handle is plastic, and if you don&#x27;t care about that then you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  </li>
            <li> so this brush is great for that</li>

            <li> This brush is great.</li>
            <li> A great addition to my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Great brush and does the job well.</li>
            <li> The brush is great.  </li>
            <li> but it has a great backbone.  </li>
            <li> , the ends were already split (and feel great), and there was no funky smell.  </li>
            <li> Still works great.  </li>
            <li> One of the great things about boar is how the bristles split over time, making for a softer brush that holds the lather.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for lathering shave soap pucks.</li>
            <li> It builds lather in a bowl and on the face very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I see Omega brushes get generally good reviews and, after using this one, I can see why.</li>
            <li> A good value</li>
            <li> Good for people with arthritis.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up good and hols water.</li>
            <li> it is holding up very nicely, lathers up well and feels nice.</li>
            <li> I can work the lather into the beard and stand up my whiskers for a great &amp;#34;baby smooth &amp;#34; shave with this brush, and I should mention that the price make this a great value .</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Omega!</li>
            <li> but once they do you&#x27;ll be satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of shaving enjoyment with this one!</li>
            <li> For the price this brush is great, omega makes a fantastic boar hair brush.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li> it was nice to upgrade from a badger to a Omega brand boar brush.</li>
            <li> handle shape is nice, but plastic.</li>
            <li> n its not any kind of a hobby of mine or as a collector of them.</li>
            <li> Nice handle for a man size hand.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest brush I own now.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, and very cheap.    </li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money, just more brush than bargained for.  </li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with this brush and mug that I wanted to leave some kind of legacy to the men in my family</li>
            <li> That brush seemed to do an ok job, but i wasn&#x27;t getting the kind of lather I was led to expect.</li>
            <li> All in all, a great product from Omega, and definitely worth more than you&#x27;ll pay for it.  </li>
            <li> That seemed pretty great for about a year.</li>
            <li> No prickly feeling, very smooth against my face.  </li>
            <li> It builds a lather beautifully, and performs particularly well with pucks.</li>
            <li> I think this exfoliated better than any brush I have ever owned before.</li>
            <li> it is my favorite brush..</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful boar brush and can deal with the longer length of this Omega, look no further.</li>
            <li> The handle allows for a better grip, which I found allows for a better lather.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I could be very happy with it as my only brush.    </li>
            <li> I will be buying more Omega brushes.</li>
            <li> One of the things I noticed immediately was the brush&#x27;s ability to make lather, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> It is longer than most which works for my shaving mug.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than most badger brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> The Boar bristles do requires a bit more break-in</li>
            <li> To my knowledge this brush has not lost more than a couple of hairs in these 20 years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have them</li>
            <li> However, this Omega Boar Bristle brush has become the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> Great lather maker and very well made.</li>
            <li> I love this brush-</li>
            <li> I like it better than the badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite for soaping up.</li>
            <li> I would love to use it as my every day brush</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll just have to travel more.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this specific brush was because the handle fits perfectly with the razor and brush stand</li>
            <li> Felt ALOT better than my 50 dollar Thater badger brush.  </li>
            <li> If you want to spend 100 dollars or more for a badger brush that&#x27;s not going to do anything better than this, have at it.  </li>
            <li> I expect that this brush will become more luxurious in feel as I use it</li>
            <li> 22 mm knots are much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> This brush is ideal for mug lathering, but you&#x27;d be pleasantly surprised how well it works with a brush lathering method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> And it gets better and softer</li>
            <li> the more you use it.</li>
            <li> I was looking at silver badger and glad I chose this.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> the more I use it.  </li>
            <li> The overall height of the hair and handle make this brush the perfect size for the soup mug</li>
            <li> The price is right and it is a good investment.</li>
            <li> It also retains the exact amount of water you need for a superior lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard the Omega brushes were pretty good</li>
            <li> A pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say this is a quality brush and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Loads very easily, feels great on my face, easy to control, holds ALOT of water (especially if soaked for about 10 minutes), and very cheap compared to badger brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love how long it is and the firmness is absolutely impeccable!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for travel because the longer handle allows it to fit the space provided in my dop kit perfectly and discovered the long handle makes it easier to hold on to and the boar bristles give me better lather control than the floppy badger bristles.  </li>
            <li> Its works well, but it takes a lot of soap to get a good lather from it as it seems the large knot absorbs quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Great professional grade brush.</li>
            <li> But I was able to work up enough lather to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Great brush, not too stiff, softens with use, builds good lather.</li>
            <li> It is soft to the face and makes the most wonderful lather using this old Duffs&#x27; \\&quot;Williams Mug Soap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s new, it has the distinctive smell that all good boar bristle brushes have.</li>
            <li> I have a grade A silvertip brush which is super soft &amp; makes great lather, esp.</li>
            <li> It is a huge brush, however.</li>
            <li> This brush is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I left mine at my parents house and ordered this as a plan B. Great product, I have been using Omega for 15+ years.</li>
            <li> This brush feels fabulous on my face when applying the lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the biggest I can find relatively cheaply.</li>
            <li> Omega makes great brushes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as regularly as my badger brushes but it&#x27;s still a great brush.</li>
            <li> but I would be surprised if any brush of any kind was much better than this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the face since I got the ends good and frayed</li>
            <li> This particular long handled brush is excellent and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Clean it, prep it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Boar will develop split ends during the first 30 or so shaves, making the brush softer and more luxurious, while still retaining stiffness for a scrubby feel, without scratchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a deep Old Spice Shaving Mug &amp; this brush is perfect for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very soft, which makes it nice to use.  </li>
            <li> This is an obscenely good deal, and will last for years and years.</li>
            <li> The stiffer boar hair works the puck nicely &amp; the handle/ loft length makes it easy to get in the deep mug.</li>
            <li> Within a month of first use, the bristle ends split nicely (like boar bristle is supposed to do), making it a very comfortable brush with enough backbone to lather all the soaps I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have that strong of an animal smell at first like some boar brushes can.</li>
            <li> is great for that (just use a large bowl or a big soup mug or you will have lather everywhere).</li>
            <li> The boar hair has more ridgidity which is great for loading from hard soaps but the length of the bristles keep it from feeling too scrubby on your face.</li>
            <li> Super resilient bristles.</li>
            <li> Handle is very comfortable, not hard to control at all.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very easily and is soft with no scritch.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The shape and material are easy to grasp with wet and soapy fingers, so it is a very secure and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In short, this is a quality brush which performs as good as a higher end luxury brush.</li>
            <li> I have found that putting both the mug and brush under the hot water and letting it run for a few minutes ,then pouring it out and immedately whipping up your lather results in a very good lather and will stay warm for even your second pass.  </li>
            <li> , very full, high quality.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> far as performance, it seemed okay.</li>
            <li> ,however,my old standby will be the good old boar hair .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a VDH deluxe soap (part of the starter kit I bought), and I was having trouble getting a good lather with my old brush.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose one brush out of the several I own, this would be it.</li>
            <li> Not that this is a big deal, but it&#x27;s nice not to worry about that.</li>
            <li> This is a very large brush.</li>
            <li> Nice long brush too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will get softer after it breaks in a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I can really whip up a nice lather without constantly banging the bush handle against the sides of the mug.  </li>
            <li> For the price, who can complain though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife and the size really helps lather-up her legs quickly.</li>
            <li> I gave mine a good washing in dawn detergent and warm water, let it air-dry, then shampooed it and built a lather with it every day for about a week and a half (again, letting it air dry overnight in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush itself has a nice spring to it when you flick the excess water off of it which is nice, but it can get messy if you&#x27;re not careful about it.</li>
            <li> This is the third Omega Boar Bristle Brush I have ordered (and used) and like it much better than my Badger Brush or Synthetic Brush.  </li>
            <li> and it took forever to first get rid of the smell and</li>
            <li> I let it soak in piping hot water for probably 10 minutes while I was prepping my face.</li>
            <li> But, with the Omega brush it lathers like magic in just a second or 2.</li>
            <li> I have, I didn&#x27;t like having to put the part next to the knot into the holder, as it looks cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing when hanged by the handle.</li>
            <li> On the first shave the tips are softer than the \\&quot;pure\\&quot; badger brush I have.  </li>
            <li> I soak for several minutes before loading the brush to make sure the bristle is softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the lather is great and generates much faster than my small badger brush</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend without reservation!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite boar brush for several reasons.</li>
            <li> how much softer it was right out of the box compared to the VDH piece of junk.</li>
            <li> He really likes the larger handle and feels the boar bristle works a lather way better than silvertip badger.  </li>
            <li> You can expect to make more lather than you will need with this brush so to save even more money and put the remaining cream in an empty shaving cream jar and mix it in with your next lather!</li>
            <li> You can expect to make more lather than you will need with this brush so to save even more money and put the remaining cream in an empty shaving cream jar and mix it in with your next lather!</li>
            <li> By far, Omega is much superior than all other brand brushes I had and have.  </li>
            <li> I read up on breaking in a boar and it usually takes up to 30 lathers to fully break in a good boar brush, along with de-skunking it</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Both the handle and brush are fairly large.</li>
            <li> A large brush that provides a lot of lather for large faces.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend sticking to a normal, shorter brush unless you already have a good one and think it&#x27;s too short.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat stiff at first but loosened up nicely.</li>
            <li> I would just recommend a smaller brush to people first getting into wet shaving because they&#x27;re more precise and allow you to move the cream through your face without getting it all over your nose and ears.</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff without being abrasive, the long loft is great for bowl lather, and that &#x27;wet dog&#x27; smell you expect out of a boar brush</li>
            <li> It is my first Omega brush but having read reviews on them over the years my expectations were high</li>
            <li> I initially decided to take the &amp;#34;don&#x27;t pay too much in case you don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; route and bought an inexpensive shaving set, that included a cheap boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> soon as I got rid of the smell, this brush performed like an absolute champ.</li>
            <li> This brush performs very well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a boar brush who doesn&#x27;t want to shell out twice as much money for a badger.</li>
            <li> Thanks for listening.----jim nelson</li>
            <li> and they were priced reasonably, so I took a chance.</li>
            <li> It had a very feint animal smell</li>
            <li> I wanted to put this brush on a fast track to breaking it in</li>
            <li> This brush has quite a bit of backbone compared to my badger and felt like I was really massaging my face when lathering</li>
            <li> What else could you really need?  </li>
            <li> it does it very well.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that since this is a boar brush, you&#x27;ll need to soak it longer before lathering and you won&#x27;t need to shake out as much water before you load it with soap or cream.</li>
            <li> and I cannot work up as much lather as I can with a shorter one.  </li>
            <li> The main con is that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water so I often have to run a little extra onto the brush to get the perfect lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to shorten or replace the handle myself, but I&#x27;ll try it a few more times to see if I can figure out the right way to hold it for bristle</li>
            <li> Being that it is a large brush I expected to have to use more than normal cream and soap to get sufficient lather from it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handle is big, for a start and keeps my hand  clean during the lathering process.</li>
            <li> The Omega paint brush is really really nice for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Plus it is a better brush than I previously had so</li>
            <li> Boar will absorb water where as badger will not, which I think equates to making more lather with less fuss.</li>
            <li> B00C6CCF9E RazoRock Classic Shave Cream 150ml]], the Omega 10098</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t soak the brush over night like others have said that they needed to do and this brush is soft, very comfortable and I highly recommend it to any regular person that merely needs a good shave...</li>
            <li> Great brush, had a little hair loss which is normal in the first few uses.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I b ought the Marvy 4p omega brush and the Marvy green rubber mug more than 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have had  several badger brushes down through the years and they are nice</li>
            <li> The large bristles really hold onto later and cover the face effortlessly.</li>
            <li> (of course), my [[ASIN:B001LY7GEM Merkur HD Slant Safety Razor 37C]] and a new [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> [99% of all boar brushes &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; when new]</li>
            <li> Brand new out of the box, about 10 hairs came out (one since)</li>
            <li> I really like the handle&#x27;s shape, but I&#x27;m not super excited about the plastic handle.</li>
            <li> I tried holding it several different ways but just couldn&#x27;t get a comfortable grip that allowed me control the bristles.</li>
            <li> It is very long and works great with a deep mug, that being said those bristles are stiff as all get out.</li>
            <li> Adding to the kudos here for this Omega boar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree, though that there is a break-in period for this brush, and it really does have a foul smell at first, particularly when you wet it.</li>
            <li> I did not find it too stiff and it had no bad odor on first use.  </li>
            <li> read that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and I was very surprised to find that was true... until it got wet.</li>
            <li> dog\\&quot; smell new natural bristle (hair) brushes tend to have.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just stiff enough to get a good lather going and soft enough for the face.</li>
            <li> Long handle makes the brush comfortable to use, including those with big hands.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that the lather can be a bit dry, but I just add water to the brush and the lather puffs up fine.</li>
            <li> I use the Shaving Factory Apothecary mug which is very deep with Classic Brand Premium Lime scent soap .I was using a smaller badger brush with some success.  </li>
            <li> It only lost a couple of the hairs early on and now holds pretty well.  </li>
            <li> (just use a large bowl or a big soup mug or you will have lather everywhere).</li>
            <li> the handle is exactly 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> I find the stiffer bristles make it much easier to whip up the lather whether your soap is in a traditional mug</li>
            <li> /&gt;It probably shed 3 or 4 bristles on first use; we&#x27;ll see how it holds up in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are wanting a brush with that old barbershop feel then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> If you use a deep mug like an apothecary, I highly recommend this style brush!  </li>
            <li> so I soaked it in a nearly boiling  cup of water</li>
            <li> , then I used a cheap cake of shaving soap and did 7 lathers and blow dried it after each lather.</li>
            <li> but since the shiney razor, brush, and stand that I currently use along with the stainless steel shaving soap bowl were a gift from my wife that won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with Stirling and How to Grow A Mustache brand soaps so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes, including badger brushes, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I soaked it first thing with Dr. Bronners soap and hot water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a good brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The new bristles are softer than a new badger (regular clipped to size badger hair brush).</li>
            <li> the idea of a long, large handled brush appealed to me.</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;d rather spend the money on other things considering how satisfactorily this brush performs right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> or maybe they&#x27;re being overly critical of a brush that&#x27;s not the highest of high end brushes.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too big; I can&#x27;t see any advantage of using such a large brush ; except to use up  the shave cream faster.</li>
            <li> If you go with a different boar brush make SURE it has the longest possible hairs (loft) and the biggest knot size (diameter at brush hair base) and the tips of the brush have not been trimmed/cut to shape it - all of these factors have a huge impact on how prickly a boar brush is or isn&#x27;t, how much water/heat it holds and how much lather it makes</li>
            <li> If you go with a different boar brush make SURE it has the longest possible hairs (loft) and the biggest knot size (diameter at brush hair base) and the tips of the brush have not been trimmed/cut to shape it - all of these factors have a huge impact on how prickly a boar brush is or isn&#x27;t, how much water/heat it holds and how much lather it makes</li>
            <li> If you are a new wetshaver I would recommend this brush, a 12 pack of arko shave stick and a 100 pack of personna blue blades or Astra blades to start, along with the DE razor of your choice.</li>
            <li> The added length over a more common handle shape is helpful for lathering in a deep vessel.  </li>
            <li> At first it felt pretty soft, but as I swirled it on my face, it started to feel a little rough.</li>
            <li> Like other boar brushes, when you run it under water for the first time it WILL smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the loft being as long as it is, but that&#x27;s a personal preference and no reason to ding it.  </li>
            <li> Actually this may not be as soft as the badger</li>
            <li> Much softer than expected.</li>
            <li> When the brush arrived I was surprised how big it was (</li>
            <li> Outstanding brush for tough beards in combination with a deep mug.</li>
            <li> I can lather my entire cheek without barely moving this thing.</li>
            <li> I have used an Omega Brush for the past year (twice a day) and rarely find any bristles falling out.  </li>
            <li> First of all this brush creates a huge amount of thick, slick lather with a tiny amt. of cream or soap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush, haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle yet, been using it daily now for a few months!  </li>
            <li> Very solid, no loose bristles.</li>
            <li> Previously I used the little boar brush from the cheap Walmart VanDer Hagen box.</li>
            <li> Might be a little large for some.</li>
            <li> but you really need a little bit of assertiveness to exfoliate your stubborn chin hairs.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be less rough on my face than it did at first.  </li>
            <li> All new brushes shed but in my experience quality brushes tend to shed less - for example  the VDH brush shed 4-6 hairs EACH lather.</li>
            <li> All new brushes shed but in my experience quality brushes tend to shed less - for example  the VDH brush shed 4-6 hairs EACH lather.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am pleased with with this brush and could care less that the handle is plastic and not gold or some wild creatures horn.</li>
            <li> (supposedly when new it smells like wet dog when its wet)</li>
            <li> The brush does smell after the first use which is common and I would recommend washing it with shampoo and conditioner, which will lessen the smell.</li>
            <li> I usually just apply way too much lather on each pass for a truly luxurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try using a scented soap with it at least the first time around</li>
            <li> Yes, it does smell when new - use a heavily scented soap and the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; disappears in a week.  </li>
            <li> Finally, this brush does not seem to shed, I haven&#x27;t lost a single hair.     </li>
            <li> smell was a little funny for a little bit.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like (just my personal preference) is that it is a longer than average brush</li>
            <li> measures 5 1/2 inches long and</li>
            <li> Still think the long loft causes somewhat unwieldy control.</li>
            <li> did give it a soak, shampoo, and condition before using it to improve the initial feel and reduce the \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li> I do like the long handle-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really into all theses different kinds of brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews where people complain that the handle is too long</li>
            <li> The brush works well enough that I&#x27;ll use it with other mugs &amp; shaving soaps/creams.</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned, it smelled kind of bad after it was wet, but it wasn&#x27;t awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The firm backbone combined with an assertive but comfortable bristle (once its broken in) are a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I got this Omega brush after reading positive reviews here and on other shaving sites but was skeptical because when I first started wet shaving 3 years ago I got a horrid little boar brush that was included in a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 1/20/2013: after about a year of shaving on average twice a week, this brush still continues to shed a bristle or two each time I shave, but it still has plenty of bristles left.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s firm yet soft and contrary to other reviews that claimed it smells like the rear end of an Arkansas Razor</li>
            <li> Now for the only down side.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding, I would suggest breaking in by lathering and leaving brush with lather over night.</li>
            <li> Yep I expected some stink</li>
            <li> The tip of the brush is about 2 inches wide after use</li>
            <li> This brush is what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> A thick, assertive, but soft set of bristles.</li>
            <li> It is obviously cast to finished size, and there is a plainly visible line.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how long this brush is, and it took a little practice to stop hitting the side of my mug with the handle.</li>
            <li> Mine did not have any odors unlike other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with the other reviewers&#x27; brushes.</li>
            <li> I was not let down at all.</li>

            <li> I used previously.</li>
            <li> Very few loose or lost bristles</li>
            <li> Just remember that boar brushes take a little bit of time to break in.</li>
            <li> The knot is dense, the bristles are longer than usual and the brush is softer than your usual boar brush but with enough backbone to lather hard soaps.</li>

            <li> , sooo, I bought them all the Omega brush and the Marvy green mug.</li>
            <li> brush makes a gobload of lather in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I can fill the brush with lather in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t waste 50 bucks on a Thater badger</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas he says it to stiff..</li>
            <li> bristles are too stiff and have an odor.</li>
            <li> I use regular shaving soap and add a dab of expensive shaving cream that gives me a ton of lather!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, the handle is quite light meaning that it doesn&#x27;t balance terribly well in your hand.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t notice that bad of a scent from this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my face toughened up or if the bristles got broken in, but I&#x27;m inclined to say the bristles just needed to get broken in.</li>
            <li> I then tried a badger brush which sucks unless you use them with creams (they&#x27;re useless with soaps unless you work it for 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> When I lathered up I was shocked that it was nearly as soft as my expensive badger brush and its not even fully broken in!</li>
            <li> Makes a lot of lather even before it&#x27;s broken in.</li>
            <li> and I have some expensive badgers...    </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Outstanding brush for tough beards in combination with a deep mug. (I.E. Marvy Green) Minimal shedding, I would suggest breaking in by lathering and leaving brush with lather over night.</li>
            <li> A woman here...bought it to use on my legs.  Wanted a larger brush and this was it!  Mine did not have any odors unlike other reviewers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too big; I can&#x27;t see any advantage of using such a large brush ; except to use up  the shave cream faster.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  Might be a little large for some.</li>
            <li> This is my backup shaving brush. I left mine at my parents house and ordered this as a plan B. Great product, I have been using Omega for 15+ years.</li>
            <li> Previously I used the little boar brush from the cheap Walmart VanDer Hagen box. That seemed pretty great for about a year. I then tried a badger brush which sucks unless you use them with creams (they&#x27;re useless with soaps unless you work it for 10 minutes). I then tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and I was very surprised to find that was true... until it got wet. Yep I expected some stink but I swear they got these bristles from the ugly part of the boar. Don&#x27;t let this discourage you - in enough time the smell will disappear and it will be a neutral odor brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how long this brush is, and it took a little practice to stop hitting the side of my mug with the handle. I love how long it is and the firmness is absolutely impeccable!  I think this exfoliated better than any brush I have ever owned before. It also retains the exact amount of water you need for a superior lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It measures 5 1/2 inches long and the handle is exactly 3 inches long. The tip of the brush is about 2 inches wide after use and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Omega!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this and absolutely loves it.  He really likes the larger handle and feels the boar bristle works a lather way better than silvertip badger.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> This is the third Omega Boar Bristle Brush I have ordered (and used) and like it much better than my Badger Brush or Synthetic Brush.  I find the stiffer bristles make it much easier to whip up the lather whether your soap is in a traditional mug or however it comes in a plastic or metal container. This particular long handled brush is excellent and easy to use. My wife also uses my shaving soap for her legs and also finds this easier to use. I have used an Omega Brush for the past year (twice a day) and rarely find any bristles falling out.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat Omega brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, and very cheap.    I bought this a while back and it took forever to first get rid of the smell and second to fully break in, BUT now that is has been broken in it is my favorite brush.. and I have some expensive badgers...    I face lather and it feels great and lathers everything with ease.    It shed a bit in the beginning but has not shed at all in a while.    It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas he says it to stiff..</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money, just more brush than bargained for.  Both the handle and brush are fairly large.</li>
            <li> I used this brush the same day I received it. I let it soak in piping hot water for probably 10 minutes while I was prepping my face. Once I got around to applying the shaving cream, I had trouble using the two-fingers-in-bristles technique to control where the shaving cream went. I tried holding it several different ways but just couldn&#x27;t get a comfortable grip that allowed me control the bristles. I would definitely recommend sticking to a normal, shorter brush unless you already have a good one and think it&#x27;s too short. I&#x27;m tempted to shorten or replace the handle myself, but I&#x27;ll try it a few more times to see if I can figure out the right way to hold it for bristle control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance, it seemed okay. At first it felt pretty soft, but as I swirled it on my face, it started to feel a little rough. I suppose it&#x27;ll take a while to break in. As someone else mentioned, it smelled kind of bad after it was wet, but it wasn&#x27;t awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably shed 3 or 4 bristles on first use; we&#x27;ll see how it holds up in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/20/2013: after about a year of shaving on average twice a week, this brush still continues to shed a bristle or two each time I shave, but it still has plenty of bristles left.  It does seem to be less rough on my face than it did at first.  I&#x27;m not sure if my face toughened up or if the bristles got broken in, but I&#x27;m inclined to say the bristles just needed to get broken in.</li>
            <li> Adding to the kudos here for this Omega boar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree, though that there is a break-in period for this brush, and it really does have a foul smell at first, particularly when you wet it. I gave mine a good washing in dawn detergent and warm water, let it air-dry, then shampooed it and built a lather with it every day for about a week and a half (again, letting it air dry overnight in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got rid of the smell, this brush performed like an absolute champ. I have big hands and am a big guy, and appreciate the longer &#x27;paintbrush&#x27; style of this brush. It builds a lather beautifully, and performs particularly well with pucks. The firm backbone combined with an assertive but comfortable bristle (once its broken in) are a pleasure to use. I find I&#x27;m reaching for this brush instead of my badger on a regular basis now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful boar brush and can deal with the longer length of this Omega, look no further.</li>
            <li> Great brush, had a little hair loss which is normal in the first few uses. For the price this brush is great, omega makes a fantastic boar hair brush. The handle allows for a better grip, which I found allows for a better lather. The brush does smell after the first use which is common and I would recommend washing it with shampoo and conditioner, which will lessen the smell.</li>
            <li> Great quality product for an affordable price. It is a lot better than my expensive Badger brush. Actually this may not be as soft as the badger but you really need a little bit of assertiveness to exfoliate your stubborn chin hairs. I use regular shaving soap and add a dab of expensive shaving cream that gives me a ton of lather!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product and the seller. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Much softer than expected. Big, big brush, and took some getting used to the size and weight, but lathers well and lives up to Omega name.</li>
            <li> This brush performs very well. Within a month of first use, the bristle ends split nicely (like boar bristle is supposed to do), making it a very comfortable brush with enough backbone to lather all the soaps I&#x27;ve used.  This is my go-to brush for mug lathering, since it keeps my knuckles out of the lather. It works well with soaps and creams alike.  It&#x27;s an excellent face-lathering brush, as well. I could be very happy with it as my only brush.    Now for the only down side. When it&#x27;s new, it has the distinctive smell that all good boar bristle brushes have. It goes away quickly enough with proper use and break-in.   I will be buying more Omega brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is what I expected it to be. It is my first Omega brush but having read reviews on them over the years my expectations were high I was not let down at all. Being that it is a large brush I expected to have to use more than normal cream and soap to get sufficient lather from it but that&#x27;s not the case. If you are wanting a brush with that old barbershop feel then this brush is for you. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes, including badger brushes, and this is my favorite. The handle is plastic, and if you don&#x27;t care about that then you&#x27;ll be happy with it. Long handle makes the brush comfortable to use, including those with big hands. If you&#x27;ve been lathering in a mug and your brushes feel short then this may be what you need.    The knot is dense, the bristles are longer than usual and the brush is softer than your usual boar brush but with enough backbone to lather hard soaps. One of the things I noticed immediately was the brush&#x27;s ability to make lather, better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.    Finally, this brush does not seem to shed, I haven&#x27;t lost a single hair.     In short, this is a quality brush which performs as good as a higher end luxury brush. I see Omega brushes get generally good reviews and, after using this one, I can see why.</li>
            <li> IMO, this is the best boar brush on the market. It is longer than most which works for my shaving mug. It was somewhat stiff at first but loosened up nicely. It isn&#x27;t bad about losing bristles. It also holds water well for a boar brush.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush.  It is well constructed, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.  The main con is that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water so I often have to run a little extra onto the brush to get the perfect lather. It doesn&#x27;t have a funky animal smell.  It&#x27;s very very soft, which makes it nice to use.  It&#x27;s softer than most badger brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a boar brush who doesn&#x27;t want to shell out twice as much money for a badger.</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff without being abrasive, the long loft is great for bowl lather, and that &#x27;wet dog&#x27; smell you expect out of a boar brush is gone in no time.  All in all, a great product from Omega, and definitely worth more than you&#x27;ll pay for it.  After almost a year of daily shaving, it hasn&#x27;t even shed a strand!</li>
            <li> I use the Shaving Factory Apothecary mug which is very deep with Classic Brand Premium Lime scent soap .I was using a smaller badger brush with some success.  I recently received the Omega # 10098.  What a difference the additional brush and handle length makes!  I can really whip up a nice lather without constantly banging the bush handle against the sides of the mug.  If you use a deep mug like an apothecary, I highly recommend this style brush!  The Boar bristles do requires a bit more break-in but once they do you&#x27;ll be satisfied!</li>
            <li> I b ought the Marvy 4p omega brush and the Marvy green rubber mug more than 20 years ago. The Marvy 4p appears to be the same as the Omega 10098, both made by Omega in Italy. When I bought these at a local barber supply they told me the brush would last a life time and the mug would never break. To my knowledge this brush has not lost more than a couple of hairs in these 20 years.It is soft to the face and makes the most wonderful lather using this old Duffs&#x27; \\&quot;Williams Mug Soap\\&quot;. I have been so pleased with this brush and mug that I wanted to leave some kind of legacy to the men in my family, sooo, I bought them all the Omega brush and the Marvy green mug. Needless to say I am pleased with with this brush and could care less that the handle is plastic and not gold or some wild creatures horn. I have had  several badger brushes down through the years and they are nice and I&#x27;m glad I have them ,however,my old standby will be the good old boar hair . I have found that putting both the mug and brush under the hot water and letting it run for a few minutes ,then pouring it out and immedately whipping up your lather results in a very good lather and will stay warm for even your second pass.  Thanks for listening.----jim nelson</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Never use Omega shaving brush before, had plenty of badger brush made in Spain.  By far, Omega is much superior than all other brand brushes I had and have.  Must try it to believe, because the price can be deceiving.  Excellent product by Omega.</li>
            <li> I am returning to shaving with a safety razor after years of using cartridge types. I initially decided to take the &amp;#34;don&#x27;t pay too much in case you don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; route and bought an inexpensive shaving set, that included a cheap boar bristle brush. That brush seemed to do an ok job, but i wasn&#x27;t getting the kind of lather I was led to expect. So, I decided to buy an upgraded brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this big boy and i was intrigued. I&#x27;d heard the Omega brushes were pretty good and they were priced reasonably, so I took a chance. I&#x27;m a big guy with big hands and the idea of a long, large handled brush appealed to me. The brush arrived about a week ago. I took it out of the box and immediately shampooed and conditioned it. It had a very feint animal smell and I wanted to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; it out. I used the brush the next morning and it was a revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush makes a gobload of lather in just a few seconds. I&#x27;m using a VDH deluxe soap (part of the starter kit I bought), and I was having trouble getting a good lather with my old brush. But, with the Omega brush it lathers like magic in just a second or 2. I can fill the brush with lather in just a few seconds. The only problem with this is that the lather can be a bit dry, but I just add water to the brush and the lather puffs up fine. This brush feels fabulous on my face when applying the lather. It is actually a pleasure shaving with this brush. It wakes me up every day it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to use a badger brush of any sort but I would be surprised if any brush of any kind was much better than this one. It does everything a shaving brush can do, and it does it well, and it feels great on my face! I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of shaving enjoyment with this one!</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Like the product.</li>
            <li> I have a grade A silvertip brush which is super soft &amp; makes great lather, esp. w cream. I wanted to get another brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend $80-$150 for another quality badger brush. I got this Omega brush after reading positive reviews here and on other shaving sites but was skeptical because when I first started wet shaving 3 years ago I got a horrid little boar brush that was included in a [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] set - all I can say about that brush is that it wouldn&#x27;t have been much different using a wire brush to lather with! When the brush arrived I was surprised how big it was (Almost 6 inches) AND how much softer it was right out of the box compared to the VDH piece of junk. I definitely wanted to break this brush in before shaving with it. I read up on breaking in a boar and it usually takes up to 30 lathers to fully break in a good boar brush, along with de-skunking it (supposedly when new it smells like wet dog when its wet) I actually didn&#x27;t notice that bad of a scent from this brush. I wanted to put this brush on a fast track to breaking it in so I soaked it in a nearly boiling  cup of water w a half teaspoon of borax &amp; a drop of Dawn, then I used a cheap cake of shaving soap and did 7 lathers and blow dried it after each lather. Then I lathered it up to shave (for my shave I used [[ASIN:B00C6CCF9E RazoRock Classic Shave Cream 150ml]], the Omega 10098 (of course), my [[ASIN:B001LY7GEM Merkur HD Slant Safety Razor 37C]] and a new [[ASIN:B001PEZNA2 Bic Chrome Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades - 30 Ct]] blade. First of all this brush creates a huge amount of thick, slick lather with a tiny amt. of cream or soap. When I lathered up I was shocked that it was nearly as soft as my expensive badger brush and its not even fully broken in! This brush has quite a bit of backbone compared to my badger and felt like I was really massaging my face when lathering AND it was NOT prickly. I like to bowl lather so this brush is great for that (just use a large bowl or a big soup mug or you will have lather everywhere). While breaking it in I lost 3 hairs after 7 lathers. All new brushes shed but in my experience quality brushes tend to shed less - for example  the VDH brush shed 4-6 hairs EACH lather. As for the amount of lather this brush generates I could have done a 5 pass shave!  Hint: You can expect to make more lather than you will need with this brush so to save even more money and put the remaining cream in an empty shaving cream jar and mix it in with your next lather! You cannot beat this brush for the price! If you go with a different boar brush make SURE it has the longest possible hairs (loft) and the biggest knot size (diameter at brush hair base) and the tips of the brush have not been trimmed/cut to shape it - all of these factors have a huge impact on how prickly a boar brush is or isn&#x27;t, how much water/heat it holds and how much lather it makes (these factors may not apply if you strictly face lather). You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brush!brush is great for that (just use a large bowl or a big soup mug or you will have lather everywhere). While breaking it in I lost 3 hairs after 7 lathers.

            <li> I have brushes that cost several hundred dollars. However, this Omega Boar Bristle brush has become the one I use the most. Great lather maker and very well made.</li>
            <li> A large brush that provides a lot of lather for large faces. Great brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush- it is holding up very nicely, lathers up well and feels nice. Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> The brush quality is there and it works great as a brush.  I would just recommend a smaller brush to people first getting into wet shaving because they&#x27;re more precise and allow you to move the cream through your face without getting it all over your nose and ears.</li>
            <li> For the money this isn&#x27;t a bad brush at all. It is very long and works great with a deep mug, that being said those bristles are stiff as all get out. I&#x27;m sure it will get softer after it breaks in a little bit more. Very solid, no loose bristles. A pretty good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I like it better than the badger hair brushes. The bristles are just stiff enough to get a good lather going and soft enough for the face. i will be ordering another one for my travel kit. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> A great addition to my shaving needs. Great brush and does the job well. It&#x27;s my favorite for soaping up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel because the longer handle allows it to fit the space provided in my dop kit perfectly and discovered the long handle makes it easier to hold on to and the boar bristles give me better lather control than the floppy badger bristles.  I would love to use it as my every day brush but since the shiney razor, brush, and stand that I currently use along with the stainless steel shaving soap bowl were a gift from my wife that won&#x27;t happen. Guess I&#x27;ll just have to travel more.</li>
            <li> bristles are too stiff and have an odor.</li>
            <li> The brush is great.  It only lost a couple of the hairs early on and now holds pretty well.  It&#x27;s soft on the face since I got the ends good and frayed but it has a great backbone.  Will pick up and hold a lot of lather, enough for about 6-7 passes if you need them.  I usually just apply way too much lather on each pass for a truly luxurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great brush for the best price you&#x27;re gonna find.</li>
            <li> Like other boar brushes, when you run it under water for the first time it WILL smell. Try using a scented soap with it at least the first time around and you shouldn&#x27;t have the smell later on. The brush itself has a nice spring to it when you flick the excess water off of it which is nice, but it can get messy if you&#x27;re not careful about it. The reason I bought this specific brush was because the handle fits perfectly with the razor and brush stand I have, I didn&#x27;t like having to put the part next to the knot into the holder, as it looks cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing when hanged by the handle. Plus it is a better brush than I previously had so it was nice to upgrade from a badger to a Omega brand boar brush.</li>
            <li> Delivered a different model.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose one brush out of the several I own, this would be it. Yes, it does smell when new - use a heavily scented soap and the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; disappears in a week.  [99% of all boar brushes &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; when new]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with the other reviewers&#x27; brushes. Maybe they got a dud or maybe they&#x27;re being overly critical of a brush that&#x27;s not the highest of high end brushes.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about two weeks.  Brand new out of the box, about 10 hairs came out (one since), the ends were already split (and feel great), and there was no funky smell.  Felt ALOT better than my 50 dollar Thater badger brush.  No prickly feeling, very smooth against my face.  Handle is very comfortable, not hard to control at all.  I don&#x27;t really care for the loft being as long as it is, but that&#x27;s a personal preference and no reason to ding it.  Loads very easily, feels great on my face, easy to control, holds ALOT of water (especially if soaked for about 10 minutes), and very cheap compared to badger brushes.  What else could you really need?  If you want to spend 100 dollars or more for a badger brush that&#x27;s not going to do anything better than this, have at it.  For me, I&#x27;d rather spend the money on other things considering how satisfactorily this brush performs right out of the box.  And don&#x27;t waste 50 bucks on a Thater badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After 8 months, my opinion stands the same.  Only maybe 1 hair every 20 shaves or so comes out.  Still works great.  Still think the long loft causes somewhat unwieldy control.</li>
            <li> The Omega boar has plenty of backbone to load soap and scrub the face for a wonderful massage feel.  It builds lather in a bowl and on the face very nicely.  On the first shave the tips are softer than the \\&quot;pure\\&quot; badger brush I have.  I expect that this brush will become more luxurious in feel as I use it and it breaks in.  Boar will develop split ends during the first 30 or so shaves, making the brush softer and more luxurious, while still retaining stiffness for a scrubby feel, without scratchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it a soak, shampoo, and condition before using it to improve the initial feel and reduce the \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; smell new natural bristle (hair) brushes tend to have. I soak for several minutes before loading the brush to make sure the bristle is softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle shape is nice, but plastic. The added length over a more common handle shape is helpful for lathering in a deep vessel.  For face lathering, the extra length does not seem to affect performance.  If I was exclusively a face lathering man, I would have selected a shorter handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic handle is... well... plastic.  It is obviously cast to finished size, and there is a plainly visible line.  The shape and material are easy to grasp with wet and soapy fingers, so it is a very secure and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are comparing an inexpensive badger brush to an Omega Boar at the same price point, do yourself a favor and buy the Omega Boar brush.</li>
            <li> This is a big brush.  Did I say thing is a big brush?  Its works well, but it takes a lot of soap to get a good lather from it as it seems the large knot absorbs quite a bit.  I would not recommend for beginners- 22 mm knots are much more manageable.  I do like the long handle- it works well with mug lathering.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles. The new bristles are softer than a new badger (regular clipped to size badger hair brush). I really like the handle&#x27;s shape, but I&#x27;m not super excited about the plastic handle. For the price, who can complain though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my wife and the size really helps lather-up her legs quickly. It&#x27;s the biggest I can find relatively cheaply. It&#x27;s probably too big for your face, unless you know you want a big brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy another Omega brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is ideal for mug lathering, but you&#x27;d be pleasantly surprised how well it works with a brush lathering method. A thick, assertive, but soft set of bristles. One of the great things about boar is how the bristles split over time, making for a softer brush that holds the lather. This is an obscenely good deal, and will last for years and years.</li>
            <li> I like this brush n have been using a brush since my teens as I&#x27;m 60 now. I&#x27;m not really into all theses different kinds of brushes n its not any kind of a hobby of mine or as a collector of them. I just use it to do its job n it does it very well. I&#x27;m Pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> The title says it. And it gets better and softer the more you use it. Makes a lot of lather even before it&#x27;s broken in. Just keep in mind that since this is a boar brush, you&#x27;ll need to soak it longer before lathering and you won&#x27;t need to shake out as much water before you load it with soap or cream.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say this is a quality brush and does a good job.  I did not find it too stiff and it had no bad odor on first use.  The only thing I do not like (just my personal preference) is that it is a longer than average brush and I cannot work up as much lather as I can with a shorter one.  But I was able to work up enough lather to get a great shave.  If you want a quality longer brush then this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush. I was looking at silver badger and glad I chose this. Super resilient bristles. Nice handle for a man size hand. Boar will absorb water where as badger will not, which I think equates to making more lather with less fuss. Clean it, prep it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great brush, not too stiff, softens with use, builds good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews where people complain that the handle is too long and they don&#x27;t know how to hold it... It&#x27;s a brush, hold it in your hand... I&#x27;ve read that some say the brush had a bad odor... Mine didn&#x27;t come with a bad odor, but if it did, I would wash it... It IS made from boars hair, after all.... I didn&#x27;t soak the brush over night like others have said that they needed to do and this brush is soft, very comfortable and I highly recommend it to any regular person that merely needs a good shave... If you are a shaving snob, keep looking.. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very few loose or lost bristles</li>
            <li> smell was a little funny for a little bit. Finally breaking it in. Also would like for there to be a hanger for it so the water could drop out.</li>
            <li> Works well does the job..</li>
            <li> Perfect price and very nice!</li>
            <li> This is the biggest brush I own now. It lathers very easily and is soft with no scritch.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for over 8 years. I&#x27;ve found boar brushes from Omega and Semogue much better for me than expensive badger brushes. If you are a new wetshaver I would recommend this brush, a 12 pack of arko shave stick and a 100 pack of personna blue blades or Astra blades to start, along with the DE razor of your choice. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> This is a very large brush. It might take you quite a while to break it in. Once you do you will find your lathering is excellent. The price is right and it is a good investment. It is the fourth brush in my collection and is in my permanent rotation.</li>
            <li> Omega makes great brushes, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve had this one for maybe 2 years now. I don&#x27;t use it as regularly as my badger brushes but it&#x27;s still a great brush. It is a huge brush, however. It stands almost 6\\&quot; tall. Also, the handle is quite light meaning that it doesn&#x27;t balance terribly well in your hand. Still, it&#x27;s a good brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it. Just remember that boar brushes take a little bit of time to break in.</li>
            <li> I have come to appreciate this brush the more I use it.  A good value</li>
            <li> I think the bristles could be shorter but it works well for the purpose.</li>
            <li> Ive collected a dozen brushes this year.  If you are using creams go with a ShaveMac D01.  If you&#x27;re using soaps the Omega 10098 is unrivaled!!!  Each is the best choice for function and cost effectiveness.  The Omega paint brush is really really nice for everyday use!</li>
            <li> This brush works great for lathering shave soap pucks. I&#x27;ve used it with Stirling and How to Grow A Mustache brand soaps so far and the lather is great and generates much faster than my small badger brush I used previously. The boar hair has more ridgidity which is great for loading from hard soaps but the length of the bristles keep it from feeling too scrubby on your face. Didn&#x27;t have that strong of an animal smell at first like some boar brushes can. I soaked it first thing with Dr. Bronners soap and hot water for a few minutes. The overall height of the hair and handle make this brush the perfect size for the soup mug I use for a lathering bowl. highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush, haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle yet, been using it daily now for a few months!  Nice long brush too, very full, high quality.  Would absolutely recommend without reservation!</li>
            <li> This brush is HUGE. I can lather my entire cheek without barely moving this thing. I personally like the handle on it as I don&#x27;t get lather all over my hands. Not that this is a big deal, but it&#x27;s nice not to worry about that.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle makes it easy to use.  Especially with a deep mug or bowl.  Good for people with arthritis.  Lathers up good and hols water. Great professional grade brush.</li>
            <li> very nice! I do like it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent Brush...Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a bunch of loft to it.. Holds heat and water well makes awesome lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s firm yet soft and contrary to other reviews that claimed it smells like the rear end of an Arkansas Razor Back, my brush was 100% hog emanations free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, I&#x27;m really impressed by the quality if this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a shaving snob, you&#x27;ll probably miss out on a excellent investment in your shaving arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a snob. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a deep Old Spice Shaving Mug &amp; this brush is perfect for it. The stiffer boar hair works the puck nicely &amp; the handle/ loft length makes it easy to get in the deep mug. The brush works well enough that I&#x27;ll use it with other mugs &amp; shaving soaps/creams.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite boar brush for several reasons. It&#x27;s handle is big, for a start and keeps my hand  clean during the lathering process. The large bristles really hold onto later and cover the face effortlessly. I can work the lather into the beard and stand up my whiskers for a great &amp;#34;baby smooth &amp;#34; shave with this brush, and I should mention that the price make this a great value .</li>
            <li> This brush is a lather-producing wonder.  Highly recommended.</li>
