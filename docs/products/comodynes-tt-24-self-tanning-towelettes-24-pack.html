            <li> i found the towels to go on evenly without the mess.</li>
            <li> The color does not look fake, orange, or streaked, it is very natural looking for your skin type.</li>
            <li> The reasons I gave only 4 stars - since they leave no contact color like tinted creams, it still can be difficult to know you are applying evenly.</li>
            <li> The other brand doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as bad and the tan last longer.</li>
            <li> All self tanning products have an unpleasant smell but this one is worse than normal.  </li>
            <li> The bad part is they give very little color and</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a self tanner that does not smell bad, or leave you looking orange.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t hate them.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> These towelettes may be my favorite tanning towel.  Sometimes they bunch up, but after using them for a couple years I have learned how to make them work.  Good for me</li>
            <li> All self tanning products have an unpleasant smell but this one is worse than normal.  It smells horrible.  The tan doesn&#x27;t last as long as other products I&#x27;ve used.  I won&#x27;t buy them again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use make-up....I use these tan towels to give me some face color...simple to use..dries quickly never wipes off on my clothes...I hope I will always be able to find these....</li>
            <li> I order these all year long and keep an even natural looking tan.  They never stain my hands and the towelettes are easy to use.  I think everyone would love these.</li>
            <li> I have been using these towels for years,also had excellent results.Lotions for me always seem to streak i found the towels to go on evenly without the mess.I suggest you wash your hands immediately after you done,ladies may prefer to wear disposable gloves.Once you apply the towels wait few minutes until dry before putting your clothes on,then your ready to go.I generally wait until evening take shower then apply,results look better next day.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a self tanner that does not smell bad, or leave you looking orange. This product I give 4 stars because so far it has been the best one that I have found but still has a slight smell. But other then that the product is good, and I have used sseveral times.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are the easiest way to get a natural tan. They don&#x27;t have the usual strong smell and aren&#x27;t messy like sprays or creams. It dries super fast and I never looks orange or streaky. I also love the fact that they are portable. I&#x27;ve brought the towelettes on vacation when I know I&#x27;m going to the beach, that way I know I will always be tan!</li>
            <li> The great part about these tanning towelettes is the fact there is no noxious odor at all, unlike any other similar product I&#x27;ve tried, and the color they give is a natural pale brown with no tinge of orange. The bad part is they give very little color and what color they give is short-lived. Applying multiple days in a row is a must. I only use it on my face, neck, chest, and arms, and there is just about enough tanner per towelette to do the job. Missed spots are possible because there is no way to tell if you&#x27;ve missed a spot, so you need to be careful to apply it evenly. It is a good product to use to give you a hint of color if you just can&#x27;t bear the thought of applying a more effective, but unpleasant-smelling, product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times before &amp; I love them. My friends can&#x27;t believe my tan is from a self-tanner. It looks very natural. I do put cream on first then apply the wipes.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every form of self tanner there is.  I do find these towelettes faster and easier to use than creams. They have a light pleasant smell  instead of that AWFUL \\&quot;non smell\\&quot; smell of the creams. The reasons I gave only 4 stars - since they leave no contact color like tinted creams, it still can be difficult to know you are applying evenly. I find I make a mess around my feet the most. Despite what all self tanners claim for color I still find them all on the orangey side. It could be just my skin&#x27;s reaction overall. I say give them a shot if you are undecided. There are pros and cons.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and find these towelettes the best on the market. The color does not look fake, orange, or streaked, it is very natural looking for your skin type. I love them.</li>
            <li> I have tried many faux tanners ever since they were invented.  This Comodynes TT-24 is by far the BEST I have ever used!!  There was no streaking, the color is fascinating and it lasted more than just a few days!  I will have to comment about the people underestimating it.. they DID NOT FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!  It shows on the package.. MOISTURIZE BEFORE APPLYING!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have so many compliments with this tan.. friends thought I went to the beach. Also, I use it on my entire body, not just my face. The only complaint I have is what I call the \\&quot;chemical sweat\\&quot; fragrance while it is doing it&#x27;s thing... making you beautiful!!  I will definitely throw away all my other faux tanners (and I spent a lot of money) and just order Comodynes TT-24!!!!</li>
            <li> I am glad that the coloring is gradual.  I don&#x27;t want a garish tan and I think I can do it with this product.</li>
            <li> Have used these for several years.  Great to keep a safe tan during the summer.</li>
            <li> These tan towels are very nice, they dont have a strong odor and go on nicely. Color looks natural and last a long time. i will buy these again!</li>
            <li> Love these.  These are the best sunless at home tanning I have ever tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I think I even like these better than a spray tan.  The color lasts for about 3-5 days, and isn&#x27;t orangy.  I use two for each application.  One for above the waist and one for my legs.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS FAIR SKINNED BUT LOVES A TAN.  I THINK I JUST SAVED HIS LIFE!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  No streaking.  Slight  odor.  Color of tan looks very natural.  Recommend this product  for a quick way to instant tan.</li>
            <li> I bought these because one review stated they liked them just as much as the Tan Towel brand. I have been buying Tan Towels for years and thought I&#x27;d give these a try. The other brand doesn&#x27;t seem to smell as bad and the tan last longer. They are okay and I don&#x27;t hate them. I just would recommend the other brand</li>
            <li> Gentle light natural tan, imperceptible scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have used these towelettes before, great for healthy glowing face colour during winter.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful, I have been using this product for five years.  No odor,even color,very easy to use .  As always the service from the vendor was fantastic.</li>
