            <li>Its perfect!</li>
            <li>best colour match Ive ever had.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>good online retailer of these is NaturalJoyBeauty(DOT)com !</li>
            <li>good online retailer of these is NaturalJoyBeauty(DOT)com !</li>
            <li>What I do like is the brand&#x27;s great safe-ingredient rating on EWG.org.</li>
            <li>I just thought to myself, for my skin to look its best surely ,</li>
            <li>I have fair olive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best part is, it feels good, not greasy.</li>
            <li>this products light feel is perfect.</li>
            <li>and that was especially true for any kind of foundation or even just tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my skin no longer needs full coverage most of the time, so the tinted moisturizer is perfect.</li>
            <li>I bought the Creme shade, the color to be more orange rather than the fair beige in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve found so far, and I use it instead of foundation because I haven&#x27;t found a good foundation for my skin at this age.  </li>
            <li>It provides wonderful coverage and it doesn&#x27;t melt off my face - even when I&#x27;m gardening in high humid temps.  </li>
            <li>im getting that nice glowy look that ive always wanted :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report that the color blends nicely, and helps give a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found this product on the Good Guide and love the light consistency but the pump doesn&#x27;t work so</li>
            <li>and Ive seen so many youtube videos where everyone enjoyed this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tinted moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give this brand a try.</li>
            <li>(Powder does help set it better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be a bit of a challenge to fish out</li>
            <li>I am using two colors blended together, but would like to do a better match.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most chemicals and this makeup works so well for me.</li>
            <li>Used this before (ordered from QVC, where it costs more) and I still like it.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is great and the service very timely.  </li>
            <li>I love this, but the color is off.</li>
            <li>White peach concealer is perfect for me, but had to go with Creme in this product.</li>
            <li>So now i have all minimal readable ingredients and am very happy with the way my skin is looking.</li>
            <li>have oily/combination skin prone to breakouts, and felt more secure with something that staid put for hours.  </li>
            <li>since Id changed my moisturisers etc, to organic, I didnt want to then put a foundation full of chemicals on top.</li>
            <li>Over all 100% pure is an amazing line.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it feels light.</li>
            <li>The coverage is nice, hiding any imperfections reasonably well (after all, its not foundation).</li>
            <li>feel that, what one puts ON their skin, is as important as what one puts into their mouths!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was really trepidatious-</li>
            <li>In the foundation creme is just a *tad* too light for me, and when I wore the TM people asked if I&#x27;d been tanning.</li>
            <li>It seems to melt into my skin and blends perfectly (I have extremely pale skin, hence the lightest color in their collection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their Bisque foundation shade is perfect for my pale, freckled skin, and their &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade for the moisturizer is supposed to match that.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer for my lips and the little bit of color is great too.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I love that these products are 100% pure.</li>
            <li>Not  Like 100% Pure Healthy Skin Foundation With Super Fruits (Full Coverage / Satin Finish) in Creme shade.</li>
            <li>have very pale skin, and found the color to be more orange rather than the fair beige in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been in search for a non-greasy, light to medium coverage tinted moisturizer that didn&#x27;t cause me breakouts and through much trial and error</li>
            <li>so in the end it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait though.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish that they&#x27;d have a couple more colors and perhaps even one that is lighter than the creme color for those with ridiculously pale skin -</li>
            <li>It also dries pretty quickly, so you need to blend right away to avoid orange streaks.</li>
            <li>Theyve never been quite right.</li>
            <li>Its almost just like another layer of my own skin only much smoother!</li>
            <li>Natural oils, essential oils , really good smelling stuff, oil cleansers.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a tint, with just a light coverage but enough to give a smooth look.</li>
            <li>And while the price is about 3 times as much as I was used to, I do understand that natural ingredients are going to cost more than synthetic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde with fair skin, so I chose \\&quot;creme\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I actually like the fact that tinted moisturizers have light coverage, but this was so light that it didn&#x27;t cover anything</li>
            <li>Im a first time user.</li>
            <li>It is however, lighter than I thought it would be but it is a pretty color anyway...</li>
            <li>, I feel light and natural using your products.</li>
            <li>Fast service!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be coming back for more and that may be the first time in years I have said that about any tinted moisturizer or foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The first winter ever</li>
            <li>I would think that a younger person would like this Pur product even more.  </li>
            <li>( see my review of white peach tinted moisturizer for more info)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel amazing and with continued use of this and other products</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend trying this out though, even if it takes a couple of purchases to get the shade right.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend trying this out though, even if it takes a couple of purchases to get the shade right.</li>
            <li>I normally just pick something in the store, painstakingly trying to get the right colour, then i get it home</li>
            <li>This product provides an easy way to moisturize and even out the complexion a bit, all at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The tint is just enough and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>thankyou 100% pure</li>
            <li>The top was loose.</li>
            <li>white peach concealer compact, however, seems fine.</li>
            <li>really regrettable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t make much sense to swap your skin care line, without also changing the makeup along with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, with the help of an at home microdermabrasion system, I&#x27;m finding I no longer need as much coverage that I once did.  </li>
            <li>but I do really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to 100 PP</li>
            <li>I really like this line.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a tinted moisturizer for everyday, and this is quite good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to finally try a 100% pure</li>
            <li>The color is not so pink as I would prefer (I am still a natural blonde with the fair coloring which goes w/</li>
            <li>This gives just the right amount of coverage..not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this foundation.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off throughout the day and my favorite thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>It was really smooth and not thick like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re someone looking for a decent natural product to replace their chemical laden foundations/creams/concealers- please check this line out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use several other of their products and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>You have to pump it more than usual before it comes up out the bottle.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have developed sensitive skin that would break out at just about any product I used</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin seems to have improved considerably - it just glows.</li>
            <li>It possibly looks a bit yellow right out of the bottle, but it seems to just melt into my skin when I blend it.</li>
            <li>I can barely feel it on my face yet it covers up some spots I dont like on my face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it especially since it is really natural.</li>
            <li>Ive recently switched all my body/face products over to organic and natural.</li>
            <li>Within the last year, I have made a concerted effort to change my skin care, and makeup items to as natural a state as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want to avoid natural parabens like Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract</li>
            <li>...could have saved a few lines ;)even if you have different coloured skin to me , pick a colour you think will work....</li>
            <li>one real complaint is the fact that the inside of the pump, it doesn&#x27;t have a long enough extractor straw, so in the future when it doesn&#x27;t want to pump anything more</li>

            <li> I have fair olive skin. This is too orange. The white peach is a darker orange, so that wouldn&#x27;t work. It also dries pretty quickly, so you need to blend right away to avoid orange streaks. Otherwise, it feels light. What I do like is the brand&#x27;s great safe-ingredient rating on EWG.org. Too bad their poor color matching (tinted moisturizer, foundation) makes that a moot point and this purchase, at $35, really regrettable.&lt;br /&gt;The white peach concealer compact, however, seems fine.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed by this tinted moisturizer. I was excited to finally try a 100% pure and Ive seen so many youtube videos where everyone enjoyed this but I found the color to be a bit odd for me (I am pale) and also it would clump up or not even absorb or blend in with my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Im a first time user. It was really smooth and not thick like other moisturizers. I can barely feel it on my face yet it covers up some spots I dont like on my face. I would recommend it especially since it is really natural. It is however, lighter than I thought it would be but it is a pretty color anyway...so it is a non issue for me.</li>
            <li> Im nearly forty, dark blond, pale-ish skin. Ive recently switched all my body/face products over to organic and natural. Natural oils, essential oils , really good smelling stuff, oil cleansers. I just thought to myself, for my skin to look its best surely , pasting on all these chemical filled anti aging creams has got to make it worse in the long run. So now i have all minimal readable ingredients and am very happy with the way my skin is looking. I absolutely love this tinted moisturiser. since Id changed my moisturisers etc, to organic, I didnt want to then put a foundation full of chemicals on top. I was looking for a tint, with just a light coverage but enough to give a smooth look. I picked the white peach online , due to the colour match picture and reviews. Its perfect! best colour match Ive ever had. Its almost just like another layer of my own skin only much smoother! I normally just pick something in the store, painstakingly trying to get the right colour, then i get it home and it looks completely different due to the fluorescant lights. Theyve never been quite right. Anyway ...thankyou 100% pure, I feel light and natural using your products. (I also use both cream blushes, the peach pot and baby pink on different areas of my cheeks and the mascara) I feel like im getting that nice glowy look that ive always wanted :) just wish id done all this years ago...could have saved a few lines ;)even if you have different coloured skin to me , pick a colour you think will work....and i bet it will!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Fast service!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product provides an easy way to moisturize and even out the complexion a bit, all at the same time.  I&#x27;ve found that my personal preference is for a little foundation powder, as it feels lighter on my face.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have developed sensitive skin that would break out at just about any product I used and that was especially true for any kind of foundation or even just tinted moisturizer. So, I&#x27;ve been in search for a non-greasy, light to medium coverage tinted moisturizer that didn&#x27;t cause me breakouts and through much trial and error I finally found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of the claims but I can say I&#x27;ve been using it now daily for over a month and it has not caused a single breakout. In fact, my skin seems to have improved considerably - it just glows. The coverage is nice, hiding any imperfections reasonably well (after all, its not foundation). It seems to melt into my skin and blends perfectly (I have extremely pale skin, hence the lightest color in their collection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is, it feels good, not greasy. I have combination skin and so I do use a serum underneath for those areas of my skin that are drier as this just doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing enough to wear alone on the driest skin. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give this brand a try. I will be coming back for more and that may be the first time in years I have said that about any tinted moisturizer or foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for over a year now and I can honestly say I cannot live without it. It makes my skin feel amazing and with continued use of this and other products my skin no longer needs full coverage most of the time, so the tinted moisturizer is perfect. I use several other of their products and my skin has never looked better. I rave about this company&#x27;s products to anyone who will listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those reviewers who have found this shade to have an orange tint. I am extremely pale with freckles and my undertone is cool/neutral. I do not find that it has an orange tint. It possibly looks a bit yellow right out of the bottle, but it seems to just melt into my skin when I blend it. I&#x27;ve never seen an orange tint or makeup lines when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being cool toned, I find that the slight yellow base to this moisturizer evens out my skin tone. If you prefer your foundation with a pinker base, then this probably wouldn&#x27;t be the right shade for you. I highly, highly recommend trying this out though, even if it takes a couple of purchases to get the shade right. I think if you find it&#x27;s too orange you could dilute it with another moisturizer to tone down the color so you at least won&#x27;t waste your money.l toned, I find that the slight yellow base to this moisturizer evens out my skin tone.

            <li> Within the last year, I have made a concerted effort to change my skin care, and makeup items to as natural a state as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that, what one puts ON their skin, is as important as what one puts into their mouths!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it just doesn&#x27;t make much sense to swap your skin care line, without also changing the makeup along with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Honestly, I was really trepidatious- being that I had been accustomed to wearing a specific brand of foundation for years (Revlon Color Stay).&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin prone to breakouts, and felt more secure with something that staid put for hours.  But I finally had to face the facts (literally), that I was never going to match a synthetic chemicals sticktoitiveness, with something natural.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, with the help of an at home microdermabrasion system, I&#x27;m finding I no longer need as much coverage that I once did.  (Powder does help set it better though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me some searching before I decided upon this one.  And while the price is about 3 times as much as I was used to, I do understand that natural ingredients are going to cost more than synthetic chemicals-- so in the end it was worth it.  I&#x27;m a natural blonde with fair skin, so I chose \\&quot;creme\\&quot;. I&#x27;m pleased to report that the color blends nicely, and helps give a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it has SPF protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one real complaint is the fact that the inside of the pump, it doesn&#x27;t have a long enough extractor straw, so in the future when it doesn&#x27;t want to pump anything more out- I&#x27;m sure it will be a bit of a challenge to fish out manually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re someone looking for a decent natural product to replace their chemical laden foundations/creams/concealers- please check this line out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to avoid natural parabens like Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract (article: organicconsumers(DOT)org/articles/article_17679.cfm ), you may want to check out these brands:&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Lauren Brooke Cosmetiques\\&quot;-- which boasts an extensive line of lovely natural/organic makeup&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Raw Skin Ceuticals\\&quot; Cosme Ceuticals matte creme foundation&lt;br /&gt;A good online retailer of these is NaturalJoyBeauty(DOT)com !t these brands:&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Lauren Brooke Cosmetiques\\&quot;-- which boasts an extensive line of lovely natural/organic makeup&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Raw Skin Ceuticals\\&quot; Cosme Ceuticals matte creme foundation&lt;br /&gt;A good online retailer of these is NaturalJoyBeauty(DOT)com !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of mineral make-up, so I chose this as my non-toxic alternative to regular foundations.  It provides wonderful coverage and it doesn&#x27;t melt off my face - even when I&#x27;m gardening in high humid temps.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off throughout the day and my favorite thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy as the day goes on.  Every other foundation I&#x27;ve tried feels awful after I&#x27;ve worn it for a few hours.  I kind of wish that they&#x27;d have a couple more colors and perhaps even one that is lighter than the creme color for those with ridiculously pale skin - but I do really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love that these products are 100% pure. I adore their lipsticks, blushes, eye creamsticks and hair products. I thought I&#x27;d give the tinted moisturizer a try but the color is too dark-especially considering this is the lightest color (creme). The other issue I had with it is coverage-there is not enough. I actually like the fact that tinted moisturizers have light coverage, but this was so light that it didn&#x27;t cover anything, the tint just disappeared into my skin.</li>
            <li> This gives just the right amount of coverage..not too heavy and not too light. You have to pump it more than usual before it comes up out the bottle. Worth the wait though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for their store to open in the local mall...I am using two colors blended together, but would like to do a better match. I wanted a tinted moisturizer for everyday, and this is quite good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer for my lips and the little bit of color is great too.  Highly recommend.  The first winter ever that my lips didn&#x27;t dry up and crack.  Thanks to 100 PP</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I can&#x27;t stand feeling like I have make-up pasted on my face and this products light feel is perfect. The tint is just enough and it washes off easily. I don&#x27;t have to wonder what I&#x27;m rubbing off on my baby when his face rubs mine. I just recently starting using any type of foundation and like that this is sun protection, tint and moisturizer all in one. Absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with TechOne&#x27;s review. The chart of tinted moisturizer colors is misleading. The creme shade appeared to be a very pale with a pink undertone, but instead it&#x27;s less than one shade lighter than white peach (which I also got by mistake, so I did compare them), and quite orange. It actually stains my skin so it keeps an obvious orange tint after I wash the moisturizer off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed, because otherwise I love everything about the moisturizer (except the pump initially didn&#x27;t working because it is really, really short, and there was an air pocket between the moisturizer and the pump end-- it&#x27;s needs a longer tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only creme was actually as pale as the charts shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate having to return products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is having the same problem- and you&#x27;re not allergic to shea butter (sadly I am)- you might want to consider Jane Iredale&#x27;s tinted moisturizer. Their Bisque foundation shade is perfect for my pale, freckled skin, and their &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade for the moisturizer is supposed to match that.</li>
            <li> I bought the Creme shade, the color to be more orange rather than the fair beige in the picture. Not  Like 100% Pure Healthy Skin Foundation With Super Fruits (Full Coverage / Satin Finish) in Creme shade. Bad purchase, don&#x27;t buy that again.</li>
            <li> I really like this line.  I am allergic to most chemicals and this makeup works so well for me.</li>
            <li> Used this before (ordered from QVC, where it costs more) and I still like it. The color is not so pink as I would prefer (I am still a natural blonde with the fair coloring which goes w/ that, but my skin coloring is uneven w/ some redness and brown spots, in my 60&#x27;s).  It&#x27;s the best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve found so far, and I use it instead of foundation because I haven&#x27;t found a good foundation for my skin at this age.  I would think that a younger person would like this Pur product even more.  No irritation, some coverage, no sunburn, so it must be working.  The price on Amazon is great and the service very timely.  Will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I received my order and was reluctant to try it.  Once i opened it, I was pumping it wondering why nothing came out. The top was loose. I opened it to look to discover the tube to pump the product up wasn&#x27;t inside or had became loose and fell out. Now I can&#x27;t use it, if any I want to look for a piece to attach it.  I don&#x27;t want to waste the product and my money. Over all 100% pure is an amazing line. Just this product had an error is the only reason I gave it a 3 out of 5</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this foundation.  I purchased the Creme shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale skin, and found the color to be more orange rather than the fair beige in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have expensive foundation that can&#x27;t be used. :(</li>
            <li> I love this, but the color is off. If you&#x27;re creme in the foundation there isn&#x27;t a TM color for you, this is a shade darker unfortunately. It&#x27;s extra sucky because you get almost 2 ounces of the TM! So if you&#x27;re any of the darker colors in the foundation just go one lighter. In the foundation creme is just a *tad* too light for me, and when I wore the TM people asked if I&#x27;d been tanning.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the tinted moisturizer colors are much different than say the concealers. White peach concealer is perfect for me, but had to go with Creme in this product. ( see my review of white peach tinted moisturizer for more info)</li>
            <li> I found this product on the Good Guide and love the light consistency but the pump doesn&#x27;t work so it is very difficult to apply.</li>
