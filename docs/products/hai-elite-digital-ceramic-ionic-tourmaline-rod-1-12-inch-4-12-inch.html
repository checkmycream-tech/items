            <li>&#x3D;D</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and think this is an excellent deal for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>It also works incredibly well on extensions.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>This curling rod has given great results.  </li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron because I heard great reviews from a friend.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>The price was so good that I was worried that there might be a &#x27;catch&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>A good iron, but way too pricey for the end results.</li>
            <li>but once you get a hang of it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Maybe practice with it off, or with the heat shield in place before using (your ideal) full heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing,</li>
            <li>She had a very easy time with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my hair type, but watch out, it is hot and there isn&#x27;t a clip to hold your hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good, quality curling rod!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t trade this one for any iron out there :)</li>
            <li>It is tricky at the beginning cuz you want to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself</li>
            <li>This product is just okay.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on my hair since I decided to start going wavy again.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling rod.</li>
            <li>I have checked every outlet in my house to make sure that it was the iron and not the plug.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this curling rod.</li>
            <li>The best part is that the curl stays all day long, even in a humid environment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy customer so far!</li>
            <li>Although it is very easy to burn yourself, having model worthy glamorous hair is worth it!</li>
            <li>you can still burn your arm (which I did &amp; it was very hot)!</li>
            <li>When plugged to the outlet, made a popping sound and didn&#x27;t start.</li>
            <li>The second shipment was great and works well.</li>
            <li>This wand gets very hot, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I have not had it long, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>My original died after 5 years.</li>
            <li>Original made in China.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and makes fantastic curls.  </li>
            <li>The rubber nub helps you from burning your fingers, but it isn&#x27;t that cool.</li>
            <li>Instead I will continue using my technique with curly iron, to get beautiful curls just use curly iron upside down without using clamp.   </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best hair rod out there.</li>
            <li>Positives: it heats quickly.   </li>
            <li>The first time I burned myself a couple of times, but learned better ways of curling fast.</li>
            <li>Though it sounds like tricky work to twist without burning yourself, it has really been easy and worth the results.      </li>
            <li>So I insist it&#x27;s the lack of any useful instruction.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment...</li>
            <li>I have very fine and damaged wavy hair, and my sister has buckets of incredibly thick pin straight hair that refuses to hold a curl, the hai-elite rod is amazing on both of us and holds both of our curls for up to three days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work better using it on other people.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>The unit died completely in less than a year - not so good considering the cost.</li>
            <li>It heats up to a very hot temperature FAST.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I have since learned how to use it better but the potential to get burned is still there.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot.</li>
            <li>The first shipment I rec&#x27;d did not work</li>
            <li>Hot, Hot, Hot.  </li>
            <li>Be sure that it&#x27;s properly sized strand , and to move from the shoulder-not the wrist, or you&#x27;ll either (maybe both)get burnt or carpel tunnel.  </li>
            <li>well, it shouldn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>We have three college degrees, and part of a masters (most credits in sci/engineering related fields) between us.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually good with hair styling tools, I got burned a few times.</li>
            <li>This item works great as far as performance on the hair, but it is soooooooooo hot and they did not provide a glove (which I had to do myself) because due to it not having a clamp you have to get your hand very close to the wand</li>
            <li>It is tough to wrap your own hair around it and touching your arms or wrists</li>
            <li>the next day it still looks good enough to just touch up and head out the door.</li>
            <li>Be certain of your technique, not to twist the strand, lay it like a ribbon.  </li>
            <li>-he&#x27;s a smart guy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use, and you can do everything from little sausage curls to big gorgeous natural looking waves.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very thick straight asian hair and this curler works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use continuously for a whole head.  </li>
            <li>I searched for it online (knowing that it is typically very pricey) to add to my holiday &#x27;</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The iron works and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very well made...</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using my Hot Tools more and paid way less.</li>
            <li>Left is original.</li>
            <li>She did tell me to be certain to turn down the temperature on it though as it heats up to a very high temp and with my hair being baby fine it might cause issues for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this curling wand to anyone who is in the market for a new curler.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t turn on, brand new out of the box.</li>
            <li>I have natually curly hair, but have a hard time making it look good without spending the entire morning trying to get that \\&quot;Natural look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I burnt myself several times the first time that I used it</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of practice if new to using one, and may have a couple finger tip burns, but once you get the hang of it, it gives natural looking waves.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I liked that the rod was large and thin at the same time.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, if you&#x27;re inexperienced with hair rods, this will most likely give you inconsistent results.  </li>
            <li>professional looking and size, for hairdresser</li>
            <li>It does get very hot, so be very careful using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the cover to put on (which it comes with) after using so little kids wondering around won&#x27;t touch and get hurt while it&#x27;s cooling down.</li>
            <li>You really have to practice to get it down so that they hair doesn&#x27;t slip off the barrel, but once you have it perfected, you can create amazing spirals, beachy waves and &#x27;Vitoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27; model hair.  </li>
            <li>b/c even with the heat pertectant gloves (if not careful)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly give me the options in the size of the curls since it slips down the barrel to the smallest point.</li>

            <li> I took the advice of my friend and I always wear long sleeves when using it.  </li>
            <li> it just slips down to thinner side so this defeats the purpose, my hair is long and wavy.</li>
            <li> not hot waves.</li>
            <li> is easy to do...and painful.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I burned my arm while using it since its a bit longer than the average barrel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because I did enjoy it, while it lasted.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little difficult to use but after a few tries I became a pro!</li>
            <li> Yes, I let her be the test subject.</li>
            <li> I have used other curlers in the past and they do not produce the results that this one does.</li>
            <li> I read the description over and over and wondered if I was missing something.  </li>
            <li> Negatives: It&#x27;s not easy to use</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep your hair wrapped around the base of the rod (the thick end), but I am getting better at it.  </li>
            <li> and they were bad burns due to the extreme temperature of the item.............</li>
            <li> Fake in Korea.</li>
            <li> ...felt like a shmo, but my hubby took a while too, so I don&#x27;t feel quite so bad</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible appliance.</li>

            <li> Terrible appliance. Didn&#x27;t work from the start. When plugged to the outlet, made a popping sound and didn&#x27;t start.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling rod I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It heats up to a very hot temperature FAST.  The only problem is, if you&#x27;re inexperienced with hair rods, this will most likely give you inconsistent results.  You really have to practice to get it down so that they hair doesn&#x27;t slip off the barrel, but once you have it perfected, you can create amazing spirals, beachy waves and &#x27;Vitoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27; model hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade this one for any iron out there :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl, just makes wavy</li>
            <li> I looked specifically for this brand and model of curling rod because I had used a friend&#x27;s.  My hair never holds curl, so she had me try her HAI Rod.  It is the only styling tool that I have ever used that curls my hair so well.  My curl held all day.  I loved it.  I searched for it online (knowing that it is typically very pricey) to add to my holiday &#x27;wish list&#x27;.  I could not believe the price I found on Amazon.  I ordered it right away.  The price was so good that I was worried that there might be a &#x27;catch&#x27;.  I read the description over and over and wondered if I was missing something.  I took a chance anyway.  I am happy that I did.  It was exactly as described.  I read some reviews that said it stopped working after a short amount of time.  Granted, I have not had it long, but it works great.  It does get very hot, so be very careful using it.  I thought about buying a glove for it, but I haven&#x27;t yet. I took the advice of my friend and I always wear long sleeves when using it.  It is tough to wrap your own hair around it and touching your arms or wrists is easy to do...and painful.  It is hard to keep your hair wrapped around the base of the rod (the thick end), but I am getting better at it.  It just takes practice.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good, quality curling rod!</li>
            <li> This item works great as far as performance on the hair, but it is soooooooooo hot and they did not provide a glove (which I had to do myself) because due to it not having a clamp you have to get your hand very close to the wand and I burnt myself several times the first time that I used it and they were bad burns due to the extreme temperature of the item.............I have since learned how to use it better but the potential to get burned is still there.  Use a glove    Thanks</li>
            <li> The iron works and heats up really fast. It doesn&#x27;t exactly give me the options in the size of the curls since it slips down the barrel to the smallest point. Like the other reviewers, I burned my arm while using it since its a bit longer than the average barrel. I&#x27;m using my Hot Tools more and paid way less. I&#x27;m sure it would work better using it on other people. A good iron, but way too pricey for the end results.</li>
            <li> This curling rod is the best appliance I have ever used on my hair. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use, and you can do everything from little sausage curls to big gorgeous natural looking waves. Although it is very easy to burn yourself, having model worthy glamorous hair is worth it! I am so happy with this product and think this is an excellent deal for what you&#x27;re getting. I have very fine and damaged wavy hair, and my sister has buckets of incredibly thick pin straight hair that refuses to hold a curl, the hai-elite rod is amazing on both of us and holds both of our curls for up to three days! It also works incredibly well on extensions.</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron! I LOVE IT!! At first it&#x27;s a little difficult to use but after a few tries I became a pro! It curls my hair and my daughters hair beautifully! I highly recommend it! It is tricky at the beginning cuz you want to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself but once you get a hang of it, you&#x27;ll love it! It&#x27;s also very well made...excellent quality! And fancy!!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hair rod out there. I bought a second one because i accidentally broke the tip off the last one and kept burning myself. my hair lasts for like 3 days with this.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay. Positives: it heats quickly.   Negatives: It&#x27;s not easy to use and I&#x27;m usually good with hair styling tools, I got burned a few times. I purchased this product because I liked that the rod was large and thin at the same time. However, once you roll hair on larger end it just slips down to thinner side so this defeats the purpose, my hair is long and wavy. Instead I will continue using my technique with curly iron, to get beautiful curls just use curly iron upside down without using clamp.   Returned product.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot. The rubber nub helps you from burning your fingers, but it isn&#x27;t that cool. beware. I am used to burning my fingers because I am a hairdresser, but you may wanna get the glove. Also, make sure you use tension when using any wand or you will get sad waves. not hot waves.</li>
            <li> This curling rod has given great results.  Takes a bit of practice if new to using one, and may have a couple finger tip burns, but once you get the hang of it, it gives natural looking waves.  I have had so many compliments on my hair since I decided to start going wavy again.  I have not purchased a heat glove, but may soon in order to maneuver faster without worry of burning a finger/hand.     I have not used another brand or type so nothing to compare this one too, however I&#x27;m short (with short arms) so some of the wrapping around I have to watch the length of this rod so it doesn&#x27;t hit my arm etc.  Though it sounds like tricky work to twist without burning yourself, it has really been easy and worth the results.      It&#x27;s nice to have the cover to put on (which it comes with) after using so little kids wondering around won&#x27;t touch and get hurt while it&#x27;s cooling down. I&#x27;m a happy customer so far!</li>
            <li> The first shipment I rec&#x27;d did not work so I had to return the iron. The second shipment was great and works well.</li>
            <li> Great product! Heats up quickly and makes fantastic curls.  Shipping was extremely fast. I would recommend this curling wand to anyone who is in the market for a new curler.  I have used other curlers in the past and they do not produce the results that this one does.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick straight asian hair and this curler works perfectly.  The only reason I took a star off it b/c even with the heat pertectant gloves (if not careful) you can still burn your arm (which I did &amp; it was very hot)!</li>
            <li> Love it!  professional looking and size, for hairdresser</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t turn on, brand new out of the box. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hot, Hot, Hot.  I consciously adjust temp down.  Be certain of your technique, not to twist the strand, lay it like a ribbon.  Be sure that it&#x27;s properly sized strand , and to move from the shoulder-not the wrist, or you&#x27;ll either (maybe both)get burnt or carpel tunnel.  It&#x27;s light enough to use continuously for a whole head.  Maybe practice with it off, or with the heat shield in place before using (your ideal) full heat. The instructions are dismal.  There was a sleeve over the barrel, maybe I&#x27;m styling tool illiterate, but it took me 5 mins to figure out what the lock/unlock was all about, and why it wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  Heads up, its for the heat shield case, and well, it shouldn&#x27;t get hot.  Thats what the case is for...felt like a shmo, but my hubby took a while too, so I don&#x27;t feel quite so bad-he&#x27;s a smart guy.  We have three college degrees, and part of a masters (most credits in sci/engineering related fields) between us.  How embarrassing.  So I insist it&#x27;s the lack of any useful instruction. Look online to set the perfect temp for your hair type, and use a heat protective styling spray!</li>
            <li> I have natually curly hair, but have a hard time making it look good without spending the entire morning trying to get that \\&quot;Natural look\\&quot;. I love this curling rod. It&#x27;s great for my hair type, but watch out, it is hot and there isn&#x27;t a clip to hold your hair. The first time I burned myself a couple of times, but learned better ways of curling fast. My husband loves my hair and I get compliments all the time on my curly do. It&#x27;s amazing, the next day it still looks good enough to just touch up and head out the door. Great price too! Well worth the investment...</li>
            <li> Worked well for a bit. The iron rod started to turn brown-ish. The unit died completely in less than a year - not so good considering the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because I heard great reviews from a friend. If I had known it was only going to last for 12 months, I would have bought a different brand. One day when I went to plug it in, nothing happened. I have checked every outlet in my house to make sure that it was the iron and not the plug. I want a curling iron that is going to last! It&#x27;s too bad, because I did enjoy it, while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this curling rod. My daughter has used it. She had a very easy time with it. She did tell me to be certain to turn down the temperature on it though as it heats up to a very high temp and with my hair being baby fine it might cause issues for me. Yes, I let her be the test subject. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> My original died after 5 years. I ordered a replacement. Compared the two. Left is original. Original made in China. Fake in Korea.</li>
            <li> This wand gets very hot, very quickly.  The best part is that the curl stays all day long, even in a humid environment. I can create soft waves or tight ringlet curls.</li>
