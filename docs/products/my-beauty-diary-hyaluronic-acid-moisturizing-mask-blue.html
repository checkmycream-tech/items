            <li>but Amazon does a great job creating a channel to buy things from all over the world.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for putting moisturizer on afterwards since it helps it absorb it in..</li>

            <li>Its magical for my skin type!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>As an esthetician I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The HL sheet masks are amazingly moisturizing, but their prices ($15 for 4) makes my wallet weep.</li>
            <li>i understand why this stuff if so popular in asia.</li>
            <li>you deserve to own it.</li>
            <li>I think i love all the my beauty diary mask!&lt;br /&gt;They are so good</li>
            <li>I prefer sheet masks over mask in a jar that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>My Beauty Diary Masks is popular in my friends.</li>
            <li>It comes as described and I liked the cooling feel it provided but</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why these masks aren&#x27;t more popular here.  </li>
            <li>This mask does the most amazing things.</li>
            <li>i used it a lot and buying it on amazon is so convienance nothing more to say good product rich in moisturize</li>
            <li>At first I was nervous trying this product but the reviews were great</li>
            <li>I love it, which feels very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also it is amazing what it does to fine lines.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something new to try that was a quality product, and fairly inexpensive,  and I found it!</li>
            <li>The counterfeit ones have a more pungent smell and the shape of the nose</li>
            <li>is more rounded on the bottom, whereas my beauty diary have a boxlike rectangular shape nose.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this mask, I thought I was ordering the authentic &amp;#34;My Beauty Diary&amp;#34; (MBD) masks.  </li>
            <li>I tend to like the aloe one better</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>I used it once or twice per week during the most stressful time in college:</li>
            <li>Well I think it is authentic.</li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with the experience.</li>
            <li>The price is okay.</li>
            <li>it helps my face getting better.</li>
            <li>It turned out that most of them burn my skin so all are wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>esthetician told me to try it), I&#x27;ve tried the most \\&quot;intense\\&quot; moisturizers I could possibly find which temporarily help, but its not the best solution</li>
            <li>After using the mask for 30 minutes, I then rub argon oil and another moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d love to see how it works on aging when I&#x27;m not dealing with winter.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I can get 3 uses out of each mask.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling this gives you</li>
            <li>Love the masks.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in perfect condition and works well on my face in the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li>and I got many compliments on how smooth my skin started looking.  </li>
            <li>that the skin care industry in places like Korea and Japan is more advanced than the US.  </li>
            <li>As titled, the mask is really effective and you can feel it, like, right after you applied.</li>
            <li>(i changed up routine) easy to use.</li>
            <li>wish I could get more brave to try American products.....</li>
            <li>smooth out the wrinkles, feel lovely going on and make my skin smooth....</li>
            <li>We all like it for its easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out easily</li>
            <li>I received this purchase very quickly, as always Amazon delivers.</li>
            <li>Well, I am very glad to find out that not only are the MBD HA masks cheaper ($14 for 10), but better!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products too! :D</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid and Black pearl work the best.</li>
            <li>but I feel it&#x27;s important for others to know this</li>
            <li>Scent is light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li>Any cheap face cream could do what this did.</li>
            <li>This product has been working wonderfully, saving my skin from the harsh winter weather in Colorado.  </li>
            <li>you do not have sensitive skin, then these masks are indeed good for the price.</li>
            <li>it really unbeatable!!!</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and while my skin is still looking pretty good, I do love the sun and am...</li>
            <li>But upon opening the package I discovered it was not the original product.  </li>
            <li>There was a more noticeable plumpness, and the mask really made my skin feel rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>good ,next i buy this to.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>good ,next i buy this to.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>good ,next i buy this to.</li>
            <li>I heard from my friends, I used it and found it not bad.</li>
            <li>I think it is even better than some high end masks.</li>
            <li>I thought it was more suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my mouth area, and I bought many boxes of My Beauty Diary series.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and the packaging looks exactly like the original.  </li>
            <li>They are very hydrating and cooling!!</li>
            <li>I used these little beauties 2-3 times a week, and wow the difference is incredible!</li>
            <li>I can see why these masks would be popular in the third world, but why here?  </li>
            <li>I liked this mask so much that I went ahead and ordered another one, along with three different masks from the My Beauty Diary line.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I&#x27;ve recently discovered the trend of &amp;#34;sheet masks&amp;#34; (popular in Asia) as well as the use of hyaluronic acid for moisturizing skin.</li>
            <li>next morning my skin definitely looked and felt great.</li>
            <li>First, because it came in just the day before this happened and I kind of wanted to wait till all the dry skins are gone because once they started peeling off there&#x27;s no way to reverse the process.</li>
            <li>this taiwanese mask is too famous in asian</li>
            <li>Seller ships fast!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be filling up my cart with more MBD sheet masks.</li>
            <li>If you want a refreshing 15 minute break from your daily routine, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I also use the lotion left in the bag on my leg... :)</li>
            <li>I place mine in the fridge, then after a hot shower, and a deep cleaning with a Clarisonic, I place this on my face and it&#x27;s the most soothing product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>thing that I like it about is the box.&lt;br /&gt;Korean made pad is much better with about same price.</li>
            <li>Used this twice a week and although at first not used to \\&quot;gooey sheet style\\&quot; mask</li>
            <li>Immediately after using it for the first time my skin left smooth, soft, and somehow it made my make look better and stay on longer.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this mask once, but I’m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of information out there, you just have to be willing to look for it.</li>
            <li>There is more serum on the mask and in the pouch than is necessary.</li>
            <li>So if you count just rubbing it on as a turn, you actually get 4 uses :-)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good facial but doesn&#x27;t have the time to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>As good as usual~</li>
            <li>The mask did nothing for my skin, in fact, my skin felt more dry than before I applied the mask.  </li>
            <li>Most masks dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and definitely saw results!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the good rating, i did not find anything special about it, its very average mask, not one english word all in chinies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on using the mask once a week as a nice refresher for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A side note: Since the product is Asian, you should be aware that the directions are NOT in English.</li>
            <li>The seller was very efficient and the product arrived professionally packaged and quickly.  </li>
            <li>(let me just say, I don&#x27;t care HOW ridiculous I look like in the name of beauty in my own home!).  </li>
            <li>Perfect for dull dry skin!!</li>
            <li>it did not feel like the essence of the real MBD mask which is very moisturizing once you apply.</li>
            <li>It still is really moist by the time I remove it.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly!  </li>
            <li>The shipment is fast.</li>
            <li>but I still found it worked really well</li>
            <li>and after 1 use, I noticed my skin looked really refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I compared it with the real products</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>I got the Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Mask because I was in need of a intense hydrating mask.</li>
            <li>These masks give me a real lift after using them....</li>
            <li>I could really see it&#x27;s effect.</li>
            <li>I cannot remember how much time I bought beauty diary.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and this brand!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about My Beauty Diary masks and decided to give the Hyaluronic Acid one a try since it claims to gently refresh and moisturize skin without clogging your pores.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my skin felt very moist and cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really helps with my skin</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I always trust My Beauty Diary products and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this new mask.</li>
            <li>The next day, you will immediately tell the difference... while you don&#x27;t feel like your skin is stimulated by super artificial-chemical thingy..</li>
            <li>Actually the mask felt good and my skin looked full, however about two days later I developed a red irritated spot at the corner of my left eye.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, my skin is so soft!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne, I just have super dry skin, so I really need something that is designed for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with many face masks (exfoliating, peeling, etc) and they really pale in comparison to sheet masks.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, but not as wet initially as some other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t used to cloth type masks it might take some getting used to as it is essentially a true mask and it doesn&#x27;t dry like other more western style face masks.</li>
            <li>.will definitely be ordering more and can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other treatments.</li>
            <li>and after another 30 minutes it returns to normal color and looks the same as it did before the ordeal, with maybe just a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>Right now it seems to be getting me \\&quot;back\\&quot; to my dry skin that I have 9 months out of the year,</li>
            <li>I place a mask and rub the excess serum on my neck and chest and let me tell you within the 30 minutes of wearing the mask the pimples no longer hurt and are completely gone within a day.</li>
            <li>but if feels really soft afterward.</li>
            <li>What I found is that hyaluronic acid is used in healing and is naturally found the body.  </li>
            <li>Never waste.</li>
            <li>and I look like a character from an early &amp;#34;Doctor Who&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it fits sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(naturally, I didn&#x27;t rip them off).</li>
            <li>and my skin was soft and moisturized like before.</li>
            <li>The skin feels soft and relieved.</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;d say I like it.</li>
            <li>It is still too early to say how it works.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and oily with clogged pores.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and firm, without any dryness or flakiness.</li>
            <li>If you really need assistance just read over the reviews on Amazon about applying the mask or check out basic videos on YouTube about applying sheet masks.</li>
            <li>and it definitely HELPS my skin as much as anything else has at</li>
            <li>a lot of Asian cream and masks aim at whitening ur skin since in Asia every girl wants lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li>Speaking of cultural differences...</li>
            <li>I used the mask for several days straight</li>
            <li>Helped my dry skin be extra soft, not sure if this is the main reason why my skin is better</li>
            <li>but I still get patches of dry flaky skin on certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve gotten my skin under control by using various La Roche Posay products, but I still have some dryness in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also it didn&#x27;t fit every well the mouth piece was a little too big</li>
            <li>alas, that is all fairly short lived, but so nice for just relaxing in the tub for 40 minutes with the mask and then looking all perky for the evening.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have the usual fragrance as the original masks either....</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>The liquid(essence) on the mask was very watery and the mask itself was very dry.</li>
            <li>(Usually when I use intense moisturizers they just make my skin very oily.)</li>
            <li>But later, I found it just make my skin soft and moistured but not oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem to be both similar as far as moisturizing, but the aloe one has a bit of a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>Dry patches of skin disappeared within minutes, fine lines disappeared, and deep age lines were less about 50%.  </li>
            <li>A package of the mask holds so much serum that I usually squeeze out much of the liquid into a little jar when I use it the first time.  </li>
            <li>It can definitely be a little messy when you take it out of the packet, but I was able to wipe it up and apply the excess serum to my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry skin and a lot of products give me breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The mask never really gets dry, so once the time is up, you just remove the sheet and gently rub in any excess serum that&#x27;s left on your face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good,,good good</li>
            <li> This mask is good for girl&#x27;s skin, it can keep the water inside.</li>
            <li> Good product, and</li>
            <li> It smells good.  </li>
            <li> Price is great, quality is great...wish we (Americans) had more access to these genius products in the US</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and good!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m recommending it to all my family and friends :)!</li>
            <li> so many amazing mask i can buy!</li>
            <li> Its magical for my skin type!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> As an esthetician I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The HL sheet masks are amazingly moisturizing, but their prices ($15 for 4) makes my wallet weep.</li>
            <li> i understand why this stuff if so popular in asia.</li>
            <li> you deserve to own it.</li>
            <li> I think i love all the my beauty diary mask!&lt;br /&gt;They are so good</li>
            <li> I prefer sheet masks over mask in a jar that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> My Beauty Diary Masks is popular in my friends.</li>
            <li> It comes as described and I liked the cooling feel it provided but</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why these masks aren&#x27;t more popular here.  </li>
            <li> This mask does the most amazing things.</li>
            <li> i used it a lot and buying it on amazon is so convienance nothing more to say good product rich in moisturize</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous trying this product but the reviews were great</li>
            <li> I love it, which feels very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Also it is amazing what it does to fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something new to try that was a quality product, and fairly inexpensive,  and I found it!</li>
            <li> The counterfeit ones have a more pungent smell and the shape of the nose</li>
            <li> is more rounded on the bottom, whereas my beauty diary have a boxlike rectangular shape nose.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this mask, I thought I was ordering the authentic &amp;#34;My Beauty Diary&amp;#34; (MBD) masks.  </li>
            <li> I tend to like the aloe one better</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> I used it once or twice per week during the most stressful time in college:</li>
            <li> Well I think it is authentic.</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with the experience.</li>
            <li> The price is okay.</li>
            <li> it helps my face getting better.</li>
            <li> It turned out that most of them burn my skin so all are wasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> esthetician told me to try it), I&#x27;ve tried the most \\&quot;intense\\&quot; moisturizers I could possibly find which temporarily help, but its not the best solution</li>
            <li> After using the mask for 30 minutes, I then rub argon oil and another moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d love to see how it works on aging when I&#x27;m not dealing with winter.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I can get 3 uses out of each mask.  </li>
            <li> I love the feeling this gives you</li>
            <li> Love the masks.  </li>
            <li> The product comes in perfect condition and works well on my face in the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> and I got many compliments on how smooth my skin started looking.  </li>
            <li> that the skin care industry in places like Korea and Japan is more advanced than the US.  </li>
            <li> As titled, the mask is really effective and you can feel it, like, right after you applied.</li>
            <li> (i changed up routine) easy to use.</li>
            <li> wish I could get more brave to try American products.....</li>
            <li> smooth out the wrinkles, feel lovely going on and make my skin smooth....</li>
            <li> We all like it for its easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out easily</li>
            <li> I received this purchase very quickly, as always Amazon delivers.</li>
            <li> Well, I am very glad to find out that not only are the MBD HA masks cheaper ($14 for 10), but better!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products too! :D</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid and Black pearl work the best.</li>
            <li> but I feel it&#x27;s important for others to know this</li>
            <li> Scent is light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> Any cheap face cream could do what this did.</li>
            <li> This product has been working wonderfully, saving my skin from the harsh winter weather in Colorado.  </li>
            <li> you do not have sensitive skin, then these masks are indeed good for the price.</li>
            <li> it really unbeatable!!!</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and while my skin is still looking pretty good, I do love the sun and am...</li>
            <li> But upon opening the package I discovered it was not the original product.  </li>
            <li> There was a more noticeable plumpness, and the mask really made my skin feel rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> good ,next i buy this to.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> good ,next i buy this to.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> good ,next i buy this to.</li>
            <li> I heard from my friends, I used it and found it not bad.</li>
            <li> I think it is even better than some high end masks.</li>
            <li> I thought it was more suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my mouth area, and I bought many boxes of My Beauty Diary series.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and the packaging looks exactly like the original.  </li>
            <li> They are very hydrating and cooling!!</li>
            <li> I used these little beauties 2-3 times a week, and wow the difference is incredible!</li>
            <li> I can see why these masks would be popular in the third world, but why here?  </li>
            <li> I liked this mask so much that I went ahead and ordered another one, along with three different masks from the My Beauty Diary line.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I&#x27;ve recently discovered the trend of &amp;#34;sheet masks&amp;#34; (popular in Asia) as well as the use of hyaluronic acid for moisturizing skin.</li>
            <li> next morning my skin definitely looked and felt great.</li>
            <li> First, because it came in just the day before this happened and I kind of wanted to wait till all the dry skins are gone because once they started peeling off there&#x27;s no way to reverse the process.</li>
            <li> this taiwanese mask is too famous in asian</li>
            <li> Seller ships fast!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be filling up my cart with more MBD sheet masks.</li>
            <li> If you want a refreshing 15 minute break from your daily routine, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I also use the lotion left in the bag on my leg... :)</li>
            <li> I place mine in the fridge, then after a hot shower, and a deep cleaning with a Clarisonic, I place this on my face and it&#x27;s the most soothing product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> thing that I like it about is the box.&lt;br /&gt;Korean made pad is much better with about same price.</li>
            <li> Used this twice a week and although at first not used to \\&quot;gooey sheet style\\&quot; mask</li>
            <li> Immediately after using it for the first time my skin left smooth, soft, and somehow it made my make look better and stay on longer.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mask once, but I’m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of information out there, you just have to be willing to look for it.</li>
            <li> There is more serum on the mask and in the pouch than is necessary.</li>
            <li> So if you count just rubbing it on as a turn, you actually get 4 uses :-)</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good facial but doesn&#x27;t have the time to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> As good as usual~</li>
            <li> The mask did nothing for my skin, in fact, my skin felt more dry than before I applied the mask.  </li>
            <li> Most masks dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and definitely saw results!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good rating, i did not find anything special about it, its very average mask, not one english word all in chinies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using the mask once a week as a nice refresher for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A side note: Since the product is Asian, you should be aware that the directions are NOT in English.</li>
            <li> The seller was very efficient and the product arrived professionally packaged and quickly.  </li>
            <li> (let me just say, I don&#x27;t care HOW ridiculous I look like in the name of beauty in my own home!).  </li>
            <li> Perfect for dull dry skin!!</li>
            <li> it did not feel like the essence of the real MBD mask which is very moisturizing once you apply.</li>
            <li> It still is really moist by the time I remove it.</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly!  </li>
            <li> The shipment is fast.</li>
            <li> but I still found it worked really well</li>
            <li> and after 1 use, I noticed my skin looked really refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I compared it with the real products</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I got the Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Mask because I was in need of a intense hydrating mask.</li>
            <li> These masks give me a real lift after using them....</li>
            <li> I could really see it&#x27;s effect.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how much time I bought beauty diary.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and this brand!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about My Beauty Diary masks and decided to give the Hyaluronic Acid one a try since it claims to gently refresh and moisturize skin without clogging your pores.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my skin felt very moist and cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall my skin looks refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really helps with my skin</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I always trust My Beauty Diary products and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this new mask.</li>
            <li> The next day, you will immediately tell the difference... while you don&#x27;t feel like your skin is stimulated by super artificial-chemical thingy..</li>
            <li> Actually the mask felt good and my skin looked full, however about two days later I developed a red irritated spot at the corner of my left eye.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , my skin is so soft!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, I just have super dry skin, so I really need something that is designed for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many face masks (exfoliating, peeling, etc) and they really pale in comparison to sheet masks.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but not as wet initially as some other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to cloth type masks it might take some getting used to as it is essentially a true mask and it doesn&#x27;t dry like other more western style face masks.</li>
            <li> .will definitely be ordering more and can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other treatments.</li>
            <li> and after another 30 minutes it returns to normal color and looks the same as it did before the ordeal, with maybe just a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> Right now it seems to be getting me \\&quot;back\\&quot; to my dry skin that I have 9 months out of the year,</li>
            <li> I place a mask and rub the excess serum on my neck and chest and let me tell you within the 30 minutes of wearing the mask the pimples no longer hurt and are completely gone within a day.</li>
            <li> but if feels really soft afterward.</li>
            <li> What I found is that hyaluronic acid is used in healing and is naturally found the body.  </li>
            <li> Never waste.</li>
            <li> and I look like a character from an early &amp;#34;Doctor Who&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it fits sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (naturally, I didn&#x27;t rip them off).</li>
            <li> and my skin was soft and moisturized like before.</li>
            <li> The skin feels soft and relieved.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;d say I like it.</li>
            <li> It is still too early to say how it works.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and oily with clogged pores.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and firm, without any dryness or flakiness.</li>
            <li> If you really need assistance just read over the reviews on Amazon about applying the mask or check out basic videos on YouTube about applying sheet masks.</li>
            <li> and it definitely HELPS my skin as much as anything else has at</li>
            <li> a lot of Asian cream and masks aim at whitening ur skin since in Asia every girl wants lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> Speaking of cultural differences...</li>
            <li> I used the mask for several days straight</li>
            <li> Helped my dry skin be extra soft, not sure if this is the main reason why my skin is better</li>
            <li> but I still get patches of dry flaky skin on certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve gotten my skin under control by using various La Roche Posay products, but I still have some dryness in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also it didn&#x27;t fit every well the mouth piece was a little too big</li>
            <li> alas, that is all fairly short lived, but so nice for just relaxing in the tub for 40 minutes with the mask and then looking all perky for the evening.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the usual fragrance as the original masks either....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> The liquid(essence) on the mask was very watery and the mask itself was very dry.</li>
            <li> (Usually when I use intense moisturizers they just make my skin very oily.)</li>
            <li> But later, I found it just make my skin soft and moistured but not oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem to be both similar as far as moisturizing, but the aloe one has a bit of a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Dry patches of skin disappeared within minutes, fine lines disappeared, and deep age lines were less about 50%.  </li>
            <li> A package of the mask holds so much serum that I usually squeeze out much of the liquid into a little jar when I use it the first time.  </li>
            <li> It can definitely be a little messy when you take it out of the packet, but I was able to wipe it up and apply the excess serum to my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin and a lot of products give me breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The mask never really gets dry, so once the time is up, you just remove the sheet and gently rub in any excess serum that&#x27;s left on your face.</li>
            <li> have a small face, so the mask doesn&#x27;t fit right unless I take a small pair of scissors and make small cuts around the edges of the eyes, mouth and nose of the mask.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t read much about the product on the packaging itself unless you speak Korean, which I do not, but a small label with English instructions is attached.  </li>
            <li> I then can fold the cuts slightly over each other to ensure a tight fit over every area of my face.</li>
            <li> And there are so much essence in one package, usually I will apply the rest in it on body.</li>
            <li> Lately my skin is acting out and forming large acne around my chin and neck area.</li>
            <li> no major impact, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I had just landed from CO (DRY, dehydrated skin) and it instantly perked me up.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my chin started to dry out and peel off several days ago for no reason.</li>
            <li> It takes a looongggg time for my skin to absorb all the goodies that it has, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing, but sometimes it gives me a few small pimples to my sensitive dry/oily combo skin</li>
            <li> The mask kept falling off my face because it wasn&#x27;t wet enough.  </li>
            <li> this one had a strange smell which I can&#x27;t describe.  </li>
            <li> After long hours working in a air-condition rooms ,I always put it on and relax on chair when I go home.</li>
            <li> I have very Sahara desert dry skin and winter is not kind to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> The smell and material are definitely the same as those previously bought from Taiwan.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find high quality things that other women use outside of the U.S.  </li>
            <li> I used this at the end of the peeling when the dry skins are almost all peeled off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the BLUE hyalurunic &amp; GREEN aloe</li>
            <li> (The skin on my neck is very sensitive, but it did not have any negative reactions to the serum).</li>
            <li> I felt my face very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> All year long if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on within a minute of washing my face, it gets tight and starts to hurt its so dry.  </li>
            <li> It says to wear for 20-30 minutes until dry, but it takes about an hour and a half to completely dry</li>
            <li> I use the mask in the privacy of my bedroom with the door closed as the mask is literally a mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mask twice, but I&#x27;m already a firm believer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try out the other My Beauty Diary masks</li>
            <li> I bought other products, wine mask and Natto mask from My Beauty Diary too.</li>
            <li> Would buy again, also like to try out the other masks from this brand.</li>
            <li> Proactive was a bust and any other of its ilk.</li>
            <li> I will try other My Beauty Diary products.</li>
            <li> the product is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I then applied the mask and laid down for about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other ones!</li>
            <li> However, everything, and I mean everything inside and out is in Chinese...</li>
            <li> Seems that they are all marketing and little results.  </li>
            <li> My face gets dry, red and flaky and is so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> .no messy goop . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also allergic to aloe, which makes it very difficult for me to find &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; face products since they all evidently contain aloe.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap...</li>
            <li> I was starting to see some around the outside of my eyes and with just 5 uses my lines have decreased dramatically!!</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is doing anything to my skin</li>
            <li> I have no more choice in there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this yet.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it leaves gaps around those areas which tend to be where small lines tend to start.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try this after winter to see if it helps with small lines.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with my usual face wash and then waited 5 to 10 minutes before applying the sheet mask.</li>
            <li> No more flakiness and my skin look so dewy all the time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews</li>
            <li> And everyone, I mean everyone uses my beauty diary.</li>
            <li> So, when I moved to the East coast and now deal with cold dry winters, it has wrecked havoc on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost impossible to find any other mask in my price range (under 20 maybe?)</li>
            <li> but I have worse effect than my friend&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Pad is too thin and too tiny.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Due to stress and bad eating habits I started breaking out a lot at the beginning of this school year.</li>
            <li> sorry I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> and I think this one is fake.</li>
            <li> Its an unpleasantly gooey, cold, weird cloth mask with holes for eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> Then I moved to the US, to my disappointment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these masks and after doing some research, have realized that they are counterfeit. Do not buy, my beauty diary makes their masks different than the counterfeit ones. The counterfeit ones have a more pungent smell and the shape of the nose is more rounded on the bottom, whereas my beauty diary have a boxlike rectangular shape nose. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> When I ordered this mask, I thought I was ordering the authentic &amp;#34;My Beauty Diary&amp;#34; (MBD) masks.  It arrived on time and the packaging looks exactly like the original.  But upon opening the package I discovered it was not the original product.  The liquid(essence) on the mask was very watery and the mask itself was very dry. The mask kept falling off my face because it wasn&#x27;t wet enough.  it did not feel like the essence of the real MBD mask which is very moisturizing once you apply. It didn&#x27;t have the usual fragrance as the original masks either.... this one had a strange smell which I can&#x27;t describe.  The mask did nothing for my skin, in fact, my skin felt more dry than before I applied the mask.  I&#x27;m really disappointed and sorry I purchased this product.  I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews but I feel it&#x27;s important for others to know this so they don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> this taiwanese mask is too famous in asian i used it a lot and buying it on amazon is so convienance nothing more to say good product rich in moisturize</li>
            <li> Moisturizing mask! I tried this based on the reviews, it works great! I was looking for something new to try that was a quality product, and fairly inexpensive,  and I found it! Seller ships fast! Thank you!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to cloth type masks it might take some getting used to as it is essentially a true mask and it doesn&#x27;t dry like other more western style face masks. Nonetheless, the product is amazing. Lately my skin is acting out and forming large acne around my chin and neck area. What do I do? I place a mask and rub the excess serum on my neck and chest and let me tell you within the 30 minutes of wearing the mask the pimples no longer hurt and are completely gone within a day. Also it is amazing what it does to fine lines. I was starting to see some around the outside of my eyes and with just 5 uses my lines have decreased dramatically!! Don&#x27;t hesitate and just try it!!!</li>
            <li> I have these and the aloe one. I tend to like the aloe one better but I am switching between the two once every week. Not really sure if it is doing anything to my skin but if feels really soft afterward. I put it on and leave it for an hour or so while watching tv or reading. It still is really moist by the time I remove it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try out the other My Beauty Diary masks but I must say that this one deserves an excellent rating. I was trying to find a substitute for the Hada Labo hyaluronic acid sheet masks that I have been using. The HL sheet masks are amazingly moisturizing, but their prices ($15 for 4) makes my wallet weep. Well, I am very glad to find out that not only are the MBD HA masks cheaper ($14 for 10), but better! They feel cooler than the Hada Labo masks and do not give you that sticky feeling once the mask comes off. Of course, once the MBD mask comes off, my skin looks like a baby&#x27;s skin again with tighter pores and a smoother texture (Hada Labo ones gives the same results but with the sticky feeling). I&#x27;ve experimented with many face masks (exfoliating, peeling, etc) and they really pale in comparison to sheet masks. I will definitely be filling up my cart with more MBD sheet masks.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product.  I used it once or twice per week during the most stressful time in college: Finals Season, and I got many compliments on how smooth my skin started looking.  You should definitely consider purchasing this product. I loved it and I&#x27;m recommending it to all my family and friends :)!</li>
            <li> I have no more choice in there or i wont buy this，so i tried it;Just soso.I like the life in China,so many amazing mask i can buy!</li>
            <li> I heard from my friends, I used it and found it not bad. but I have worse effect than my friend&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I ordered these because of all the great reviews.  I have to say that I was not dissapointed!  These are wonderful and refreshing.  I recommend them highly!  If you want a refreshing 15 minute break from your daily routine, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I read up on the ingredients for allergy possibilities.  What I found is that hyaluronic acid is used in healing and is naturally found the body.  Dry patches of skin disappeared within minutes, fine lines disappeared, and deep age lines were less about 50%.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this item after seeing a lot of asians gurus on youtube mentionning this brand. And, like i was expecting, this box is amazinnnng! i understand why this stuff if so popular in asia.Its magical for my skin type!</li>
            <li> I never tried this product before. I thought it was more suitable for dry skin. But later, I found it just make my skin soft and moistured but not oily. And there are so much essence in one package, usually I will apply the rest in it on body. Never waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the BLUE hyalurunic &amp; GREEN aloe masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be both similar as far as moisturizing, but the aloe one has a bit of a cooling sensation. Scent is light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: after opening the package, but prior to removing the mask--squeeze some of the excess fluid out otherwise it is too drippy on your face. If you have larger features (eyes, nose) it helps to cut the openings larger prior to removing the plastic backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a concern with one of the packages I ordered and the vendor was &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; in ameliorating the situation!</li>
            <li> Stumbled upon this great item while cruising around for Skincare products. I use the mask in the privacy of my bedroom with the door closed as the mask is literally a mask and I look like a character from an early &amp;#34;Doctor Who&amp;#34; episode during the 30 minute application process. The mask is excellent and very effective, with a list of quality ingredients and priced well.</li>
            <li> Well I think it is authentic. The smell and material are definitely the same as those previously bought from Taiwan.</li>
            <li> The product feels so good on my face. I bought other products, wine mask and Natto mask from My Beauty Diary too. Hyaluronic acid and Black pearl work the best. But the effect only limits to hydration, no whitening or others.</li>
            <li> After long hours working in a air-condition rooms ,I always put it on and relax on chair when I go home. Refresh again.</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with the experience. The price is okay. The shipment is fast. And I am surprise that I can get this mask in the U.S.. this is a really nice mask for moisturizing your skin! The next day, you will immediately tell the difference... while you don&#x27;t feel like your skin is stimulated by super artificial-chemical thingy.. and I use twice a week, my skin is so soft!! I also use the lotion left in the bag on my leg... :)</li>
            <li> I love it, which feels very comfortable. And does what I need. Bought it for the second time. No.1 product of the series.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why these masks aren&#x27;t more popular here.  I place mine in the fridge, then after a hot shower, and a deep cleaning with a Clarisonic, I place this on my face and it&#x27;s the most soothing product I&#x27;ve ever used and I can&#x27;t believe how visibly smaller my pores are afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the convenience . . .no messy goop . . .will definitely be ordering more and can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other treatments.</li>
            <li> I can see why these masks would be popular in the third world, but why here?  Its an unpleasantly gooey, cold, weird cloth mask with holes for eyes, nose and mouth. You put in on your face for 30 minutes, hoping no one will knock on your door and see you like this.  When you take it off, your face looks temporarily whiter and ghost-like and after another 30 minutes it returns to normal color and looks the same as it did before the ordeal, with maybe just a little more moisture. Any cheap face cream could do what this did.</li>
            <li> Helped my dry skin be extra soft, not sure if this is the main reason why my skin is better (i changed up routine) easy to use. good quality, good price. will repurchase.</li>
            <li> it is on time, and this products are very good. it helps my face getting better. I think is you like it, then buy it.</li>
            <li> also it didn&#x27;t fit every well the mouth piece was a little too big but I still found it worked really well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle and moisturizes very well. it fits sensitive skin. it was a good buy. you deserve to own it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good moisturizing mask. Most masks dry my skin out. I don&#x27;t have acne, I just have super dry skin, so I really need something that is designed for moisturizing. These work wonderfully! Great price too!</li>
            <li> that the skin care industry in places like Korea and Japan is more advanced than the US.  I personally don&#x27;t appreciate mass brands like Estee Lauder and such because I question the quality of the ingredients.  Seems that they are all marketing and little results.  Plus, they dominate everything so it&#x27;s hard to find high quality things that other women use outside of the U.S.  The seller was very efficient and the product arrived professionally packaged and quickly.  You can&#x27;t read much about the product on the packaging itself unless you speak Korean, which I do not, but a small label with English instructions is attached.  The mask smells amazing (!!) and after 1 use, I noticed my skin looked really refreshed.  I had just landed from CO (DRY, dehydrated skin) and it instantly perked me up.  Price is great, quality is great...wish we (Americans) had more access to these genius products in the US but Amazon does a great job creating a channel to buy things from all over the world.</li>
            <li> This product is quite different from products I purchased before. I compared it with the real products and I think this one is fake. The mask emits pungent smell and it doesn&#x27;t rehydrate your skin at all. I felt my face very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I trust this brand. never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I could get more brave to try American products..... H.A is the best for the desert here.</li>
            <li> Due to stress and bad eating habits I started breaking out a lot at the beginning of this school year. I used these little beauties 2-3 times a week, and wow the difference is incredible! I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone! It says to wear for 20-30 minutes until dry, but it takes about an hour and a half to completely dry so just sleep in it. I&#x27;m also allergic to aloe, which makes it very difficult for me to find &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; face products since they all evidently contain aloe. But this does not and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I Love these masks!! They are very hydrating and cooling!! Perfect for dull dry skin!! Also helps brighten the skin. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Pad is too thin and too tiny.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that I like it about is the box.&lt;br /&gt;Korean made pad is much better with about same price.</li>
            <li> I think i love all the my beauty diary mask!&lt;br /&gt;They are so good and they do a good job in hydrating my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but not as wet initially as some other brands I have tried. Still a great product though!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my mouth area, and I bought many boxes of My Beauty Diary series.&lt;br /&gt;I should have just bought one and give it a try. It turned out that most of them burn my skin so all are wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you have sensitive skin as I do, be careful trying out these masks.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have sensitive skin, then these masks are indeed good for the price.</li>
            <li> I prefer sheet masks over mask in a jar that kind of thing. This is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve ever found. I got the Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Mask because I was in need of a intense hydrating mask. The skin on my chin started to dry out and peel off several days ago for no reason. I used this at the end of the peeling when the dry skins are almost all peeled off (naturally, I didn&#x27;t rip them off). First, because it came in just the day before this happened and I kind of wanted to wait till all the dry skins are gone because once they started peeling off there&#x27;s no way to reverse the process. I used this once and my skin was soft and moisturized like before. It is amazing! I think it is even better than some high end masks.</li>
            <li> As titled, the mask is really effective and you can feel it, like, right after you applied. The skin feels soft and relieved.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and while my skin is still looking pretty good, I do love the sun and am...well ...51! These masks give me a real lift after using them....smooth out the wrinkles, feel lovely going on and make my skin smooth....alas, that is all fairly short lived, but so nice for just relaxing in the tub for 40 minutes with the mask and then looking all perky for the evening. They are not cheap...but I like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this yet. (let me just say, I don&#x27;t care HOW ridiculous I look like in the name of beauty in my own home!).  I have very Sahara desert dry skin and winter is not kind to my skin at all.  All year long if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on within a minute of washing my face, it gets tight and starts to hurt its so dry.  So, when I moved to the East coast and now deal with cold dry winters, it has wrecked havoc on my skin.  My face gets dry, red and flaky and is so uncomfortable.  I tried vaseline (no joke, and esthetician told me to try it), I&#x27;ve tried the most \\&quot;intense\\&quot; moisturizers I could possibly find which temporarily help, but its not the best solution and I still have red patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small face, so the mask doesn&#x27;t fit right unless I take a small pair of scissors and make small cuts around the edges of the eyes, mouth and nose of the mask. I then can fold the cuts slightly over each other to ensure a tight fit over every area of my face. Otherwise it leaves gaps around those areas which tend to be where small lines tend to start.  After using the mask for 30 minutes, I then rub argon oil and another moisturizer on top.  It does seem to give some extra moisture and has helped reduce some of the redness. I&#x27;m not as diligent about putting on the mask as I should.  But, I do notice the night after I use it my skin feels better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try this after winter to see if it helps with small lines. Right now it seems to be getting me \\&quot;back\\&quot; to my dry skin that I have 9 months out of the year, so I&#x27;d love to see how it works on aging when I&#x27;m not dealing with winter.</li>
            <li> The product comes in perfect condition and works well on my face in the dry winter weather. Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Actually the mask felt good and my skin looked full, however about two days later I developed a red irritated spot at the corner of my left eye. I have no idea if that was the cause. Haven&#x27;t used it since. My eye is now clear(after a month) and will try it again. Will update after use</li>
            <li> My Beauty Diary Masks is popular in my friends. We all like it for its easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li> It takes a looongggg time for my skin to absorb all the goodies that it has, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing, but sometimes it gives me a few small pimples to my sensitive dry/oily combo skin</li>
            <li> This mask does the most amazing things. There was a more noticeable plumpness, and the mask really made my skin feel rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve only used this mask twice, but I&#x27;m already a firm believer. I liked this mask so much that I went ahead and ordered another one, along with three different masks from the My Beauty Diary line. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other ones!</li>
            <li> Used this twice a week and although at first not used to \\&quot;gooey sheet style\\&quot; mask I could really see it&#x27;s effect. I use it before I go to bed and I wake up with pores visibly minimized, softer. It&#x27;s great for putting moisturizer on afterwards since it helps it absorb it in.. Would buy again, also like to try out the other masks from this brand.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how much time I bought beauty diary. As good as usual~ I love it. It&#x27;s cheap and good!</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous trying this product but the reviews were great and I&#x27;m happy that I did. Immediately after using it for the first time my skin left smooth, soft, and somehow it made my make look better and stay on longer. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good facial but doesn&#x27;t have the time to go to the salon. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products too! :D</li>
            <li> the product is not worth it.  it did not reach my expectations.  i would not recommend it to anyone. not worth the money.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician I love this product! Easy to use and definitely saw results! Highly recommend this product and this brand!</li>
            <li> good,,good good&lt;br /&gt;very good ,next i buy this to.&lt;br /&gt;very good ,next i buy this to.&lt;br /&gt;very good ,next i buy this to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good rating, i did not find anything special about it, its very average mask, not one english word all in chinies. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> This mask is good for girl&#x27;s skin, it can keep the water inside. I like it. I will ask my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change of the skin, but after 45 minutes mask, face does feel juicy. So far i&#x27;d say I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this face mask at the same time as the Collagen Essence face mask. This one is a lot easier to use and pull apart. It is still too early to say how it works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product b/c of the + feedback and rightfully so- this was a perfect addition to the 30% glycolic peel if been doing.After my peel I apply this mask for approx.35 min.It does exactly what it states.I recommened this to anyone!!!! Please dont hesitate to use-You will be happy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mask once, but I’m really pleased with the results. Thanks to Amazon I&#x27;ve recently discovered the trend of &amp;#34;sheet masks&amp;#34; (popular in Asia) as well as the use of hyaluronic acid for moisturizing skin. My skin is fairly sensitive and oily with clogged pores. My skin breaks out easily but I still get patches of dry flaky skin on certain areas of my face. Overall I&#x27;ve gotten my skin under control by using various La Roche Posay products, but I still have some dryness in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about My Beauty Diary masks and decided to give the Hyaluronic Acid one a try since it claims to gently refresh and moisturize skin without clogging your pores. I washed my face with my usual face wash and then waited 5 to 10 minutes before applying the sheet mask. It can definitely be a little messy when you take it out of the packet, but I was able to wipe it up and apply the excess serum to my neck and chest. (The skin on my neck is very sensitive, but it did not have any negative reactions to the serum). I then applied the mask and laid down for about 40 minutes. The mask never really gets dry, so once the time is up, you just remove the sheet and gently rub in any excess serum that&#x27;s left on your face. Afterwards my skin felt very moist and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning my skin definitely looked and felt great. It was smooth and firm, without any dryness or flakiness. And it didn&#x27;t feel oily at all. (Usually when I use intense moisturizers they just make my skin very oily.) Overall my skin looks refreshed and smooth. I&#x27;m planning on using the mask once a week as a nice refresher for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A side note: Since the product is Asian, you should be aware that the directions are NOT in English. If you really need assistance just read over the reviews on Amazon about applying the mask or check out basic videos on YouTube about applying sheet masks. There&#x27;s a lot of information out there, you just have to be willing to look for it.</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome!!!  I have very sensitive dry skin and a lot of products give me breakouts.  This product has been working wonderfully, saving my skin from the harsh winter weather in Colorado.  A package of the mask holds so much serum that I usually squeeze out much of the liquid into a little jar when I use it the first time.  So when I&#x27;m finished with the mask, I dunk it into the jar for use.  Most of the time, I can get 3 uses out of each mask.  It makes such a difference when I put on makeup these days.  No more flakiness and my skin look so dewy all the time.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin. Nothing has ever really worked. Proactive was a bust and any other of its ilk. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure. I still have acne, but that&#x27;s just what God intended I suppose. I love the feeling this gives you and it definitely HELPS my skin as much as anything else has at it&#x27;s very low cost. I use 1 mask about 3 times until the mask itself falls apart. 43 cents a use it really unbeatable!!! There is more serum on the mask and in the pouch than is necessary. So if you count just rubbing it on as a turn, you actually get 4 uses :-)</li>
            <li> Very good masks! My skin feels silky and refreshed after using this mask. I always trust My Beauty Diary products and this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this new mask. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I lived in Hong Kong for two yrs, as a college student. And everyone, I mean everyone uses my beauty diary. Then I moved to the US, to my disappointment, it&#x27;s almost impossible to find any other mask in my price range (under 20 maybe?) that can sub this one.  I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon! I saw another review that said it whitened her skin and it didn&#x27;t do anything to her skin, well a lot of Asian cream and masks aim at whitening ur skin since in Asia every girl wants lighter skin tone. Speaking of cultural differences...lol</li>
            <li> Really helps with my skin and it&#x27;s moisture.&lt;br /&gt;It is really great to put it on my face every night after studying.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyable facial masks~</li>
            <li> Good product, and it arrived faster than I imaged before.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will buy it next time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I received this purchase very quickly, as always Amazon delivers. However, everything, and I mean everything inside and out is in Chinese...Not one word of English...I thought I was buying a product I could actually use. There is no information or directions, let alone ingredient list that is not in Chinese. Can you say misrepresentation?</li>
            <li> I used the mask for several days straight and I didn&#x27;t see it making any difference for my skin. it didn&#x27;t do anything harmful either. It comes as described and I liked the cooling feel it provided but no major impact, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love the masks.  I  used it once a week to keep my skin moist.  Works very well for me. It smells good.  I will try other My Beauty Diary products.</li>
