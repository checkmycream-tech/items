            <li>This is by far the best nail polish remover I have used.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I was looking for something a bit better</li>
            <li>This is good for the cheap price, though.</li>
            <li>The best nail polish remover especially for their own polishes</li>
            <li>Much better than lower priced remover.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>however it costs substantially more.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI products.</li>
            <li>So much better than drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Sooooooooo much better than that stuff you buy at Family Dollar or Walmart</li>
            <li>Yes the product costs more</li>
            <li>This polisher remover is simply the best!</li>
            <li>I think I will start using this product from now on :)</li>
            <li>Removes the darkest nail polish quickly, so much better than Cutex, Revlon, etc.  </li>
            <li>it! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping could have been better.</li>
            <li>I will gladly recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>and it takes more to get the polish off.</li>
            <li>i love it, takes off a nail polish so easily from now on</li>
            <li>Leaves them healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>Does the job of removing quick, nails are clean and feel good.</li>
            <li>Always love this nail polish remover, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and easy to remove and protects my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Removes polish quick and easily!</li>
            <li>It easily removed my glitter nail polish with ease, without soaking.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This polish remover works well and does not seem to be too strong on the nails.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT someone who will go for branded products when generics (e.g. drugstore polish remover) will do just fine.</li>
            <li>Scent just fine too.</li>
            <li>Removes polish quickly as well as thoroughly and without a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and you use less because its so good!</li>
            <li>Love OPI Polish remover because it works extremely well and also because the scent is much more appealing than most polish removers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used  OPI for years and am usually never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Also the odor is good, not like many other polish remover.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special from a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>of course so the good news is it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li>This product does the job so well and pretty quickly, saving time and my nails, unlike the ones that claim to be easy on your nails but take forever to remove the polish.</li>
            <li>Also leaves my nails looking and feeling great... not stripped and frail like other polish removers.</li>
            <li>Luckily it hadn&#x27;t leaked a lot.</li>
            <li>Good nail polish remover, does what it supposed to do and lasts long (for someone who changes her nail color every 2-3 days)</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new favorite polish remover.</li>
            <li>The remover works very well and gets polish off very quickly.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails all the time, sometimes multiple times a week, so that means I go through a LOT of nail polish.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My husband is happy because the smell is not as intense as other polish removers.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>you get polish on skin around your nail, it doesn&#x27;t really come off easily unless you&#x27;re very persistent.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>The smell is good unlike other removers that are really, ugh.</li>
            <li>I love this remover, it really takes polish off quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my nails feeling totally stripped and brittle.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to pay more, then this is a solid choice that you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li>That pretty much sums it up, but it&#x27;s the truth!  </li>
            <li>I tried every type of brand imaginable, but OPI&#x27;s polish remover not only smells fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t ruin my nails!</li>
            <li>So much better than generic products.</li>
            <li>Have never been able to remove all old polish w/ what is available in the local stores.  </li>
            <li>the bottle was so hot it was bulging</li>
            <li>It may work on light colors, but if you&#x27;ve got two or more coats of a dark color, forget it.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong and it doesn&#x27;t leave my nails dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell much and the speed of taking off polish is super fast..,..</li>
            <li>You barely have to apply pressure for it to work, which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is the only polish remover I use because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Large bottle</li>
            <li>I hestiated to buy this large bottle of Polish remover because I&#x27;d never used it before.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but well worth it, I guess, because it sure removes all the polish quickly and completely ...</li>
            <li>and when they do break or split, it&#x27;s not down to the quick.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the cheap stuff at the store and decided to spend some extra money to see if there really was a difference</li>
            <li>I really like this polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Works really well...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought cheap polish removers until I tried this.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one as it works fast and removes everything.  </li>
            <li>does its job very well.  </li>
            <li>This one is just so gentle in removing the polish as well as the smell.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really any smell</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks again OPI for another quality product.</li>
            <li>However, I felt this didn&#x27;t get the nail polish off very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>Protect nails very well.</li>
            <li>Will repurchase &amp; would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like that this remover has aloe in it, it helps keeps my skin and cuticles from drying out too much.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this and the purple bottle, nail remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s better than the national brand as far as polish removal, but it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a scent.</li>
            <li>This does not smear those and leaves the nail clean and ready for the next color.</li>
            <li>It takes glitter off better than any other remover I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth paying a little more for &amp; I&#x27;m not a brand conscious person at all.</li>
            <li>I priced this in my salon and it was higher priced than ordering on line, also they were frequently out of it.</li>
            <li>It was a little pricy, came in a huge bottle but was well worth it</li>
            <li>It removes even thick layers of nail polish very easily and smoothly without leaving any white residue afterwards.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my nails were becoming soft, brittle and extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a smell as the other removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The cost was much higher than normal remover, but since I don&#x27;t need hardly any to get polish off then in the end the cost isn&#x27;t that much more.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>and I am sure it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not that different than regular polish, but not quite as strong.</li>
            <li>And I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li>It gets glitter nail polish off better than anything else I&#x27;ve experienced, and glitter nail polish really is the worst to take off!</li>
            <li>it is amazing a little bit does go along way!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle so it will last a very long time</li>
            <li>A little spendy, but it saves time over the crappy, cheap stuff you get in the stores.  </li>
            <li>The other polish removers had such a strong odor it</li>
            <li>, it actually seems to be gentler since my nails aren&#x27;t peeling much anymore.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It does really well with regular nail polish, lacquer and the ones with glitter without having to use a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I mean, it is moisturizing enought for me thou :)</li>
            <li>This nail polish remover removes my dark polish quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the  regular kind you can get anywhere from cvs or heck even the dollar store which can give the same (if not better results)</li>
            <li>--I had to put it in the fridge for half an hour before I dared open it, and don&#x27;t care to think what would have happened if it had arrived much later--it really looked ready to pop.</li>
            <li>It would normally take several Cotton swabs saturated with the dime store removers and lots of rubbing to make a dent in my old polish.  </li>
            <li>This polish remover takes the nail polish right off my nails without drying out my cuticles or any other part of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit more expensive than generic brands you can pick up at the drugstore, but for me, as a nail polish junkie, the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Work quickly with little effort.</li>
            <li>NOT with this Opi - works fast and doesn&#x27;t completely dry out the nail or the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy the dollar tree nail polish remover, it took forever to get my polish off and was super messy and drying.</li>
            <li>It might be a bit pricey than other polish removers b ut if you really want to take care of your nails, this has to be it!</li>
            <li>However, this products doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out nails quite as much--so it may be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other drug store brands such as Cutex in the past and this OPI polish remover is amazing.</li>
            <li>A little costly but worth it for a remover.</li>
            <li>While the cheap stuff gets the job done eventually, this works at least three times faster.</li>
            <li>It works very well and removes the polish as expected.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t leave nails as dry and brittle as basic acetone.</li>
            <li>The difference I noticed was I didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I do with other nail polish removers.</li>
            <li>and it works to remove any nail polish - which is nice because trying to take off the sparkly top coats was very ANNOYING before.  </li>
            <li>In all my years, doing my nails this is one nail polish remover that does not dry out my nails.</li>
            <li>Takes off stubborn nail polish easily and even dark colors with a few layers.</li>
            <li>I struggle with nail polish removers especially because I use dark or vibrant colors for polish.  </li>

            <li> Removes polish quick and easily!</li>
            <li> It easily removed my glitter nail polish with ease, without soaking.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This polish remover works well and does not seem to be too strong on the nails.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT someone who will go for branded products when generics (e.g. drugstore polish remover) will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Scent just fine too.</li>
            <li> Removes polish quickly as well as thoroughly and without a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and you use less because its so good!</li>
            <li> Love OPI Polish remover because it works extremely well and also because the scent is much more appealing than most polish removers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used  OPI for years and am usually never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also the odor is good, not like many other polish remover.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing special from a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> of course so the good news is it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> This product does the job so well and pretty quickly, saving time and my nails, unlike the ones that claim to be easy on your nails but take forever to remove the polish.</li>
            <li> Also leaves my nails looking and feeling great... not stripped and frail like other polish removers.</li>
            <li> Luckily it hadn&#x27;t leaked a lot.</li>
            <li> Good nail polish remover, does what it supposed to do and lasts long (for someone who changes her nail color every 2-3 days)</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new favorite polish remover.</li>
            <li> The remover works very well and gets polish off very quickly.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails all the time, sometimes multiple times a week, so that means I go through a LOT of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband is happy because the smell is not as intense as other polish removers.</li>
            <li> and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> you get polish on skin around your nail, it doesn&#x27;t really come off easily unless you&#x27;re very persistent.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle.</li>
            <li> The smell is good unlike other removers that are really, ugh.</li>
            <li> I love this remover, it really takes polish off quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my nails feeling totally stripped and brittle.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to pay more, then this is a solid choice that you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> That pretty much sums it up, but it&#x27;s the truth!  </li>
            <li> I tried every type of brand imaginable, but OPI&#x27;s polish remover not only smells fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t ruin my nails!</li>
            <li> So much better than generic products.</li>
            <li> Have never been able to remove all old polish w/ what is available in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> the bottle was so hot it was bulging</li>
            <li> It may work on light colors, but if you&#x27;ve got two or more coats of a dark color, forget it.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong and it doesn&#x27;t leave my nails dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell much and the speed of taking off polish is super fast..,..</li>
            <li> You barely have to apply pressure for it to work, which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is the only polish remover I use because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Large bottle</li>
            <li> I hestiated to buy this large bottle of Polish remover because I&#x27;d never used it before.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but well worth it, I guess, because it sure removes all the polish quickly and completely ...</li>
            <li> and when they do break or split, it&#x27;s not down to the quick.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the cheap stuff at the store and decided to spend some extra money to see if there really was a difference</li>
            <li> I really like this polish remover.  </li>
            <li> Works really well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought cheap polish removers until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one as it works fast and removes everything.  </li>
            <li> does its job very well.  </li>
            <li> This one is just so gentle in removing the polish as well as the smell.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really any smell</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks again OPI for another quality product.</li>
            <li> However, I felt this didn&#x27;t get the nail polish off very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> Protect nails very well.</li>
            <li> Will repurchase &amp; would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like that this remover has aloe in it, it helps keeps my skin and cuticles from drying out too much.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this and the purple bottle, nail remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s better than the national brand as far as polish removal, but it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a scent.</li>
            <li> This does not smear those and leaves the nail clean and ready for the next color.</li>
            <li> It takes glitter off better than any other remover I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth paying a little more for &amp; I&#x27;m not a brand conscious person at all.</li>
            <li> I priced this in my salon and it was higher priced than ordering on line, also they were frequently out of it.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricy, came in a huge bottle but was well worth it</li>
            <li> It removes even thick layers of nail polish very easily and smoothly without leaving any white residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my nails were becoming soft, brittle and extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a smell as the other removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The cost was much higher than normal remover, but since I don&#x27;t need hardly any to get polish off then in the end the cost isn&#x27;t that much more.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> and I am sure it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not that different than regular polish, but not quite as strong.</li>
            <li> And I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li> It gets glitter nail polish off better than anything else I&#x27;ve experienced, and glitter nail polish really is the worst to take off!</li>
            <li> it is amazing a little bit does go along way!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle so it will last a very long time</li>
            <li> A little spendy, but it saves time over the crappy, cheap stuff you get in the stores.  </li>
            <li> The other polish removers had such a strong odor it</li>
            <li> , it actually seems to be gentler since my nails aren&#x27;t peeling much anymore.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> It does really well with regular nail polish, lacquer and the ones with glitter without having to use a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I mean, it is moisturizing enought for me thou :)</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover removes my dark polish quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the  regular kind you can get anywhere from cvs or heck even the dollar store which can give the same (if not better results)</li>
            <li> --I had to put it in the fridge for half an hour before I dared open it, and don&#x27;t care to think what would have happened if it had arrived much later--it really looked ready to pop.</li>
            <li> It would normally take several Cotton swabs saturated with the dime store removers and lots of rubbing to make a dent in my old polish.  </li>
            <li> This polish remover takes the nail polish right off my nails without drying out my cuticles or any other part of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit more expensive than generic brands you can pick up at the drugstore, but for me, as a nail polish junkie, the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Work quickly with little effort.</li>
            <li> NOT with this Opi - works fast and doesn&#x27;t completely dry out the nail or the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy the dollar tree nail polish remover, it took forever to get my polish off and was super messy and drying.</li>
            <li> It might be a bit pricey than other polish removers b ut if you really want to take care of your nails, this has to be it!</li>
            <li> However, this products doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out nails quite as much--so it may be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other drug store brands such as Cutex in the past and this OPI polish remover is amazing.</li>
            <li> A little costly but worth it for a remover.</li>
            <li> While the cheap stuff gets the job done eventually, this works at least three times faster.</li>
            <li> It works very well and removes the polish as expected.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t leave nails as dry and brittle as basic acetone.</li>
            <li> The difference I noticed was I didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I do with other nail polish removers.</li>
            <li> and it works to remove any nail polish - which is nice because trying to take off the sparkly top coats was very ANNOYING before.  </li>
            <li> In all my years, doing my nails this is one nail polish remover that does not dry out my nails.</li>
            <li> Takes off stubborn nail polish easily and even dark colors with a few layers.</li>
            <li> I struggle with nail polish removers especially because I use dark or vibrant colors for polish.  </li>
            <li> This polish remover is no different, as far as I can tell, from any other polish remover.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I just spent 10 minutes trying to remove some deep red with this and can&#x27;t get it off!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> The speed is the biggest benefit in my opinion, since I wear a lot of saturated colors and it would sometimes take so long to remove that my fingertips would get soaked and wrinkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OPI Polish remover helps keep my nails moist...not dry.  </li>
            <li> works well and does not over dry my nails and skin.</li>
            <li> My nails and cuticles aren&#x27;t overly dry</li>
            <li> Does not seem to dry out my nails.  </li>
            <li> I like this polish remover because it doesn&#x27;t dry my nails out.</li>
            <li> I can also use a single cotton ball for each hand, whereas I used to need two each.</li>
            <li> I only need a little to go a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so even though I paint my nails several times a week</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t leave my nails/skin extremely dry after using this!</li>
            <li> I always wash my hands after using nail polish remover, &amp; put on lotion, but my nails still felt stripped and dry after other removers.</li>
            <li> Has the same odor as other polish removers but not very strong.</li>
            <li> The fumes aren&#x27;t as bad as most others.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> I wear a lot of glitter nail polish which is harder to get off.  </li>
            <li> This works find on regular polish, but I started buying plain acetone which is cheaper.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> some of my other polish rmvr don&#x27;t get all of the color off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your nail bed and fingers white and dried out!</li>
            <li> I would never use a nail polish remover from any brand other than OPI.</li>
            <li> Only complaint that I do have is with the sealing of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this polish, but it dries my nails just as badly as the cheaper stuff</li>
            <li> After the use my nails didn&#x27;t feel dried out or brittle,  unlike some other removers.</li>
            <li> My nails have never looked better-they break and split less.</li>
            <li> Some nail polishs take me half the bottle to get it off.</li>
            <li> Even stubborn reds and dark pinks!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many polish removers which are rough on nails and smell awful.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear dark nail polish.</li>
            <li> I let the soaked cotton ball sit on my toe nails one at a time for a few seconds</li>
            <li> This took a few passes to get the polish fully off.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m never going back to the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> not much more to say.</li>
            <li> (my two choices in my small town).  </li>
            <li> Ill save my money next time.</li>
            <li> This one is the least drying one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> this 16oz bottle lasts me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> but it is not effective at removing OPI metallic glittery polish - seriously, you have to scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub (get the idea)</li>
            <li> This does not smell like regular nail polish remover or any of the ones that claim that the smell isn&#x27;t as bad.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as unpleasant as a lot of other polish removers which is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> It works don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> it smells so bad to me,that i have not worn polish in 7 months...looking for something that doesnt yuk me out,</li>
            <li> This is the worst polish remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price and works great.  Much better than lower priced remover.  Worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I really like this polish remover.  It doesn&#x27;t stink like others and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash my hands even though I do.</li>
            <li> I love OPI products and this is no exception. I only need a little to go a long way and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it overdrying my cuticles or not getting all the polish.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many polish removers which are rough on nails and smell awful.  This product does the job so well and pretty quickly, saving time and my nails, unlike the ones that claim to be easy on your nails but take forever to remove the polish.</li>

            <li> it smells so bad to me,that i have not worn polish in 7 months...looking for something that doesnt yuk me out,</li>
            <li> Great remover but the OPI purple stuff is better- however it costs substantially more. If you don&#x27;t want to pay more, then this is a solid choice that you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> That pretty much sums it up, but it&#x27;s the truth!  This polish remover takes the nail polish right off my nails without drying out my cuticles or any other part of my nails.  I just love it.  And I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other drug store brands such as Cutex in the past and this OPI polish remover is amazing. I don&#x27;t have to scrub my nails anymore trying to get polish off and use one cotton pad per hand/foot instead of three. Like other reviewers have mentioned, a little really does go a long way. Also leaves my nails looking and feeling great... not stripped and frail like other polish removers.</li>
            <li> Works really well... some of my other polish rmvr don&#x27;t get all of the color off. This one does</li>
            <li> Love OPI Polish remover because it works extremely well and also because the scent is much more appealing than most polish removers.</li>

            <li> Removes polish quick and easily! Even stubborn reds and dark pinks! Large bottle so it should last a while! Scent just fine too.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but well worth it, I guess, because it sure removes all the polish quickly and completely ... and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your nails!</li>
            <li> This is the only polish I have ever used since I discovered it.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I usually wear dark nail polish. This nail polish remover removes my dark polish quickly. I love OPI products.</li>
            <li> So much better than drugstore brands. Salon quality polish removal.</li>
            <li> I really like this one as it works fast and removes everything.  OPI makes good products and I&#x27;ll reorder when I need more!</li>
            <li> I paint my nails a good bit, about 2 times per week, and this is the best nail polish remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  Its a bit more expensive than generic brands you can pick up at the drugstore, but for me, as a nail polish junkie, the price is worth it.  It takes glitter off better than any other remover I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I struggle with nail polish removers especially because I use dark or vibrant colors for polish.  This does not smear those and leaves the nail clean and ready for the next color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy because this removed does a good job.  My husband is happy because the smell is not as intense as other polish removers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big time nail art fan and use nail polish remover as a weekly process.  I noticed that my nails were becoming soft, brittle and extremely dry.  I tried every type of brand imaginable, but OPI&#x27;s polish remover not only smells fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t ruin my nails!</li>
            <li> does its job very well.  not much more to say. good price too.</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover does the trick. It easily removed my glitter nail polish with ease, without soaking. After the use my nails didn&#x27;t feel dried out or brittle,  unlike some other removers. Has the same odor as other polish removers but not very strong. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought it to remove nail polish in a gentile way. The remover doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t burn at all. I am very pleased and will buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sooooooooo much better than that stuff you buy at Family Dollar or Walmart (my two choices in my small town).  It&#x27;s worth paying a little more for &amp; I&#x27;m not a brand conscious person at all.</li>
            <li> This works find on regular polish, but I started buying plain acetone which is cheaper.  However, this products doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out nails quite as much--so it may be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> OPI Polish remover helps keep my nails moist...not dry.  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone who has need of polish remover.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.  It was a little pricy, came in a huge bottle but was well worth it and I am sure it will last a long time.  It works very well and removes the polish as expected.  I let the soaked cotton ball sit on my toe nails one at a time for a few seconds and it comes right off.  Nice smell.  This will be my go-to polish remover from here on out.</li>
            <li> The proof of a removers efficiency was demonstrated for me by the removal of red polish!  It would normally take several Cotton swabs saturated with the dime store removers and lots of rubbing to make a dent in my old polish.  Yes the product costs more but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Good nail polish remover, does what it supposed to do and lasts long (for someone who changes her nail color every 2-3 days)</li>
            <li> This is the only polish remover I use because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. The other polish removers had such a strong odor it Wouls drive me nuts.</li>
            <li> As expected.  Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t leave nails as dry and brittle as basic acetone.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails all the time, sometimes multiple times a week, so that means I go through a LOT of nail polish. This nail polish is by far the best I have ever used. It gets glitter nail polish off better than anything else I&#x27;ve experienced, and glitter nail polish really is the worst to take off! I like how my nails feel afterwards. I always wash my hands after using nail polish remover, &amp; put on lotion, but my nails still felt stripped and dry after other removers. This one is the least drying one I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it!</li>
            <li> Really effective polish remover. You barely have to apply pressure for it to work, which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> This polish remover works well and does not seem to be too strong on the nails.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best nail polish remover I have used.  It does really well with regular nail polish, lacquer and the ones with glitter without having to use a lot of it.  This does not smell like regular nail polish remover or any of the ones that claim that the smell isn&#x27;t as bad.  This one is just so gentle in removing the polish as well as the smell.  Only complaint that I do have is with the sealing of the bottle.  When I opened the shipping box, the bottle showed it had been leaking.  Luckily it hadn&#x27;t leaked a lot.</li>
            <li> The best nail polish remover especially for their own polishes</li>
            <li> This polisher remover is simply the best! It removes even thick layers of nail polish very easily and smoothly without leaving any white residue afterwards. The smell is good unlike other removers that are really, ugh. It might be a bit pricey than other polish removers b ut if you really want to take care of your nails, this has to be it!</li>
            <li> good nail polish remover, works just like its supposed to.  The difference I noticed was I didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I do with other nail polish removers.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong and it doesn&#x27;t leave my nails dry. I think I will start using this product from now on :)</li>
            <li> But it takes a lot of effort to remove the polish.</li>
            <li> works great.  A little spendy, but it saves time over the crappy, cheap stuff you get in the stores.  Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this nail remover saw it on YouTube and had to buy it works great fantastic plan to buy more!</li>
            <li> Removes the darkest nail polish quickly, so much better than Cutex, Revlon, etc.  Non-drying on cuticles, and has a nice scent, to boot.</li>
            <li> works well and does not over dry my nails and skin.</li>
            <li> The remover works very well and gets polish off very quickly. There isn&#x27;t really any smell so that&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get polish on skin around your nail, it doesn&#x27;t really come off easily unless you&#x27;re very persistent.</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover is the best! It works very well. It&#x27;s a big bottle, of course so the good news is it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Does the job of removing quick, nails are clean and feel good. Smell is not overpowering. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> good as always. love opi!</li>
            <li> i love it, takes off a nail polish so easily from now on I will only buy this product</li>
            <li> So much better than generic products.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but OPI nail polish so I use this polish remover.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt my nails.</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover is awesome! I used to buy the cheap stuff at the store and decided to spend some extra money to see if there really was a difference and there is! I used to need several cotton balls to get my polish off, but with this OPI nail polish remover I can use 1 cotton ball on all of my nails, fingers and toes! The smell is not that different than regular polish, but not quite as strong. The cost was much higher than normal remover, but since I don&#x27;t need hardly any to get polish off then in the end the cost isn&#x27;t that much more.</li>
            <li> Have never been able to remove all old polish w/ what is available in the local stores.  This stuff actually works, 9 times out of 10.</li>
            <li> Great and strong. Removes glitter too.</li>
            <li> My nails have never looked better-they break and split less.My nails and cuticles aren&#x27;t overly dry and when they do break or split, it&#x27;s not down to the quick.</li>
            <li> I just used it with my nails to remove some nail polish and they are looking good. I mean, it is moisturizing enought for me thou :)</li>
            <li> I hestiated to buy this large bottle of Polish remover because I&#x27;d never used it before.  This stuff is terrific!  I wear a lot of glitter nail polish which is harder to get off.  Some nail polishs take me half the bottle to get it off. NOT with this Opi - works fast and doesn&#x27;t completely dry out the nail or the cuticle.  A great product with a great mix - effective and not too harmful to the nail and skin!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good polish remover! Doesn&#x27;t leave your nail bed and fingers white and dried out! A little costly but worth it for a remover. Thanks again OPI for another quality product.</li>
            <li> Aside from the lack of a strong odor, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this nail polish remover. I think I may have over paid for it just because its OPI. I&#x27;ve used  OPI for years and am usually never disappointed. However, I felt this didn&#x27;t get the nail polish off very well. Honestly I was looking for something a bit better and I think I could of done so with a smaller bottle of nail polish remover from cvs or something. It works don&#x27;t get me wrong but it&#x27;s nothing special from a cheaper brand. This took a few passes to get the polish fully off. I&#x27;ll use it till it runs out (which will be a while) but I won&#x27;t get it again. I&#x27;ll stick to the  regular kind you can get anywhere from cvs or heck even the dollar store which can give the same (if not better results)</li>
            <li> This nail polish is good.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s better than the national brand as far as polish removal, but it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a scent.</li>
            <li> Always love this nail polish remover, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and easy to remove and protects my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Love it! :)</li>
            <li> Good polish remover. The fumes aren&#x27;t as bad as most others. Still have to work to get glitter polish off, but overall it works well and manages to be neither greasy nor drying. Also, cheaper polish removers give me a blistering rash (contact dermatitis), and this doesn&#x27;t -- so yay!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping could have been better. It took almost a week and when it arrived (middle of summer afternoon in the desert) the bottle was so hot it was bulging and the liquid was up to the very top--I had to put it in the fridge for half an hour before I dared open it, and don&#x27;t care to think what would have happened if it had arrived much later--it really looked ready to pop.</li>
            <li> Nice nail polish remover but it is not effective at removing OPI metallic glittery polish - seriously, you have to scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub (get the idea)</li>
            <li> This polish remover is one of the best. The polish comes off effortlessly. The smell isn&#x27;t as unpleasant as a lot of other polish removers which is a plus as well. Also doesn&#x27;t leave my nails/skin extremely dry after using this! I love it! This bottle is going to last a long time. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it IS just nail polish remover. This is good for the cheap price, though.</li>
            <li> This is the worst polish remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It may work on light colors, but if you&#x27;ve got two or more coats of a dark color, forget it.  I just spent 10 minutes trying to remove some deep red with this and can&#x27;t get it off!</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well. It doesn&#x27;t smell much and the speed of taking off polish is super fast..,..a little goes a long way. This bottle will last years.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Protect nails very well. Also the odor is good, not like many other polish remover. I will gladly recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this remover, it really takes polish off quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my nails feeling totally stripped and brittle.  A little goes a long way so even though I paint my nails several times a week this 16oz bottle lasts me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST polish remover on the market!  Will repurchase &amp; would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Removes polish quickly as well as thoroughly and without a strong odor.  Will definitely order this product again.  Thank you Opi.</li>
            <li> I priced this in my salon and it was higher priced than ordering on line, also they were frequently out of it.</li>
            <li> Works like you&#x27;d expect it to.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the dollar tree nail polish remover, it took forever to get my polish off and was super messy and drying. This is magical compared to that!! Easy to use, and you use less because its so good!</li>
            <li> I like it because it isn&#x27;t drying to my nails. It is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I like that this remover has aloe in it, it helps keeps my skin and cuticles from drying out too much.</li>
            <li> In all my years, doing my nails this is one nail polish remover that does not dry out my nails. They dont feel stripped, there is no offensive scent, and it does the job.  I really, really like this and the purple bottle, nail remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to use anything else, cause it works.....</li>
            <li> I would never use a nail polish remover from any brand other than OPI.</li>
            <li> Very good, quality is very good.</li>
            <li> this big bottle lasted me 3 months it is amazing a little bit does go along way!!! thank you for providing this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that works quickly, without even drenching the cotton pad.</li>
            <li> This polish remover is no different, as far as I can tell, from any other polish remover.  Does not seem to dry out my nails.  Does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> product as advertised</li>
            <li> Work quickly with little effort.</li>
            <li> great product, nail polish comes very easily and leaves nails feeling good</li>
            <li> best remover of all time</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this polish, but it dries my nails just as badly as the cheaper stuff and it takes more to get the polish off. Ill save my money next time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work real good.</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new favorite polish remover. I didn&#x27;t even know there was a such thing! You don&#x27;t need a lot of product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this polish remover because it doesn&#x27;t dry my nails out. Leaves them healthy and strong. The best I&#x27;ve used yet and have been using it for years.</li>
