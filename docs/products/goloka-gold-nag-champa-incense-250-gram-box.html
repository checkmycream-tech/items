            <li>Great seller..</li>
            <li>Always a great smell.</li>
            <li>Great scent, great value.</li>
            <li>love the incense and the bulk price is excellent</li>
            <li>Good price for this size box.</li>
            <li>Price was good</li>
            <li>Poop free!!</li>
            <li>the incense and the cause are great and it is easy to support</li>
            <li>good price, great product, quick delivery, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice variety of scents.</li>
            <li>my favorite nag champa</li>
            <li>The more I have been burning this, though the more I like it.</li>
            <li>Nice sweet smell as opposed to per-fumy.</li>
            <li>Long burn and a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Better than Satya Nag Champa and Satya Super Hit!</li>
            <li>the incense is great and natural it arrived quickly .</li>
            <li>This is an excellent variety of Nag Champa, lighter and cleaner in an almost astringent way -- a tad less opulent than Satya SuperHit, but perhaps more purifying and intellectually stimulating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types but incense made by Goloka is far best incense out there!</li>
            <li>Light, airy, and very cleansing!!</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time absolute favorite incenses.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this incense, it&#x27;s milder and lighter than the regular Nag Champa, slightly more floral, maybe?</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>arrived exactly as described</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to cheap perfume or any perfume</li>
            <li>A sweet and light scent that brings back memories of India.</li>
            <li>You know you are getting a good product, but the bigger boxes actually come with a customs approval sticker on the box stating that it was inspected and approved.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>I got these for my wife who is by nature very demanding.</li>
            <li>What I really think is these incense have been &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>it is completely dried out and smells more like the wood stick burning than Goloka incense.</li>
            <li>I can recommend it only if you find a fresh supply.</li>
            <li>spend extra money and get the classic nag.</li>
            <li>The incense is great, but like other reviewers I could say that they go out often and they seem stale.  </li>

            <li> The incense is great, but like other reviewers I could say that they go out often and they seem stale.  </li>
            <li> I was almost afraid to order because she would blame me for sure if she didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Keep a stash of Nag gold (goloka), black (superhit) and blue (traditional) all together.</li>
            <li> I order based on the same image on the box as a box I had from a previous purchase from another supplier at home.</li>
            <li> In the past I have preferred the red (shanthimalai) and the blue (sai baba) nag champa over this.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money totally on this order.</li>
            <li> Received the box of Incense with it open on one end and 49 sticks missing so sent it back!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go back to my old supplier and see if the coating is so thin.  </li>
            <li> see other reviews.</li>
            <li> This box is hard to find, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Box was slightly damaged and I was worried about the contents being damaged as well, but having used around 30 of the sticks I haven&#x27;t had any damaged ones yet.</li>
            <li> They are all so narrow, as if the coating has been sanded off, nearly down to the bamboo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to this brand being so skinny and weak.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just as described no complaints at all</li>
            <li> my favorite nag champa</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife who is by nature very demanding. I was almost afraid to order because she would blame me for sure if she didn&#x27;t like the smell. Well, now I&#x27;m a hero.</li>
            <li> This box is hard to find, especially for the price. Smells amazing. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The box smelled great. Once a stick is lit is starts smelling like Nag Champa, then it changes to a burnt sugar smell and it ends up with the smell of burnt paper. Wasted my money totally on this order. I order based on the same image on the box as a box I had from a previous purchase from another supplier at home. Will NEVER purchase from these people again.</li>
            <li> Great seller.. I&#x27;ll b back</li>
            <li> arrived exactly as described</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to cheap perfume or any perfume this is a no go. spend extra money and get the classic nag. see other reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell as opposed to per-fumy. Prefer Goloka to Sataya Sai Baba, but is totally subjective. Good price for this size box. Found it to be the best deal around.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent variety of Nag Champa, lighter and cleaner in an almost astringent way -- a tad less opulent than Satya SuperHit, but perhaps more purifying and intellectually stimulating. Goloka and Satya SuperHit are both mandatory in our house.</li>
            <li> Keep a stash of Nag gold (goloka), black (superhit) and blue (traditional) all together. Creates a nice variety of scents.</li>
            <li> Received the box of Incense with it open on one end and 49 sticks missing so sent it back!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the Goloka Incense it is one of the best!</li>
            <li> love the incense and the bulk price is excellent</li>
            <li> Always a great smell. Price was good</li>
            <li> Great scent, great value. Box was slightly damaged and I was worried about the contents being damaged as well, but having used around 30 of the sticks I haven&#x27;t had any damaged ones yet. Will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Get the bigger box. You know you are getting a good product, but the bigger boxes actually come with a customs approval sticker on the box stating that it was inspected and approved.&lt;br /&gt;From India to the U.K., to here... Hand rolled awesomeness..</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Quality product. Long burn and a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> the incense is great and natural it arrived quickly . the incense and the cause are great and it is easy to support</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance!! Light, airy, and very cleansing!! All oil and plant matter based!! Poop free!!</li>
            <li> Came in a different box than the one pictured (red and gold and not blue and gold in case anyone else gets it), but I have burned this incense before and believe it is the same stuff -- also the same manufacturer. In the past I have preferred the red (shanthimalai) and the blue (sai baba) nag champa over this. The more I have been burning this, though the more I like it. For nag champa &amp;#34;fiends&amp;#34;, lol, like me this unequivocally good stuff!</li>
            <li> good price, great product, quick delivery, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this incense, it&#x27;s milder and lighter than the regular Nag Champa, slightly more floral, maybe? But every time I&#x27;ve ordered it from here it is completely dried out and smells more like the wood stick burning than Goloka incense. I can recommend it only if you find a fresh supply.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time absolute favorite incenses. A sweet and light scent that brings back memories of India.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types but incense made by Goloka is far best incense out there! Better than Satya Nag Champa and Satya Super Hit! Don&#x27;t hesitate and buy it immediately! This is my all-time favorite!!!</li>
            <li> The incense is great, but like other reviewers I could say that they go out often and they seem stale.  What I really think is these incense have been &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34;.  They are all so narrow, as if the coating has been sanded off, nearly down to the bamboo.  I&#x27;m going to go back to my old supplier and see if the coating is so thin.  I&#x27;m not used to this brand being so skinny and weak.</li>
