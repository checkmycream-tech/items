            <li>( I love not having to wait around for orders :D )</li>
            <li>It has brought remarkable healing and comfort to my face.</li>
            <li>Tamanu Oil by Cammile Q is my top favorite!!!</li>
            <li>I think the smell is pleasant and woodsy.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is very good for treating many skin conditions.</li>
            <li>I loved the oil.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it felt and also ended up using it in my hair and on my face.  </li>
            <li>but once you learn how to use it works really good.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, I wanted to try it</li>

            <li>This oil good, but it takes a while to see some results.</li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>I can continue to rave about this and tell you my skin literally glows and looks flawless immediately after use, but it seems too good to be true which is why I urge everyone, even skeptics,to just give it a try...</li>

            <li>Excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I have heard so many good things about Tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It was quite effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li>(my husband NEVER notices this kind of thing, so it was a shock).  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have discovered it.  </li>
            <li>It dries your skin kind out which is wierd because it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li>Nice oil, really nice.</li>
            <li>I found it to be comforting, to be honest.</li>
            <li>To give a try I started my search for a nice brand which I could trust.</li>
            <li>My skin has been loving it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this.</li>
            <li>To the seller thank you for delievering on time wonderful service thanks.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make my own cleansing oil without any additives</li>
            <li>Both of us are thrilled.</li>
            <li>I ordered this Tamanu Oil to make my own face oils instead of using store bought moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and i think the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>nice product and company.</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a drying oil, so I do find I need to apply a good moisturiser on top (cocoa butter, shea butter or even just olive oil/coconut oil).</li>
            <li>Great consistency, great smell, and it makes my skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>The company sent the product quickly and it came in great shape.</li>
            <li>I do have a very strong sense of smell, so this may not bother everyone.</li>
            <li>VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had great results!</li>
            <li>her face  looked like she&#x27;d been sleeping better without him, and he never notices this kind of thing either.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed at the fast, efficient service I received from Cammile Q, as well as a follow up inquiry to be sure I was satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I were so pleased with this amazing product that I placed another order of two.</li>
            <li>I think this one is the most effective for healing scars.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft, moisturized, non greasy, and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>If you intend to use this oil for scarring, please note that it is most effective when used to prevent a wound from leaving a scar.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent, works well to avoid stretch marks, I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for clear skin and reduce marks.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;d be best added to a carrier oil because it is pretty powerful!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Smell is strong but if it works for you, why complain?!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good, but i recently read that this oil is very good for inflammation</li>
            <li>Not only is this Tamanu Oil is Amazing, but their customer service is Excellent!  </li>
            <li>Great product...heals the skin amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>product arrived in a box and bubble wrapped very securely.</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs very quickly into your skin and gives it a nice glow, not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and skin absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, well wrapped, good condition.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this oil a week ago and it has already made a huge improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s in a glass bottle, which preserve the quality of the unfiltered oil.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product</li>
            <li>I mostly use it at night.</li>
            <li>I think it would be okay for the day as well</li>

            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This oil was either almost expired or doesn&#x27;t have shelf life more than 2 months.</li>

            <li>I am so glad that I found out about the use of oils</li>
            <li>Most products won&#x27;t touch this area.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t at all sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of Tamanu.  </li>
            <li>so it spreads better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad things worked out this way, because after purchasing another brand of tamanu oil, I found the smell stronger and more curry-like.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>Every Sunday I slather this oil all over my hair for an hour or more before my shower.</li>
            <li>and I will find even more ways in which it will help my family.</li>
            <li>Love the suttle nutty scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elliep</li>

            <li>There are so many on Amazon choose from</li>
            <li>I love this oil, even the earthy smell.</li>
            <li>Though I am still fighting the acne, it has gotten significantly better.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is famous for its anti-aging and moisturizing qualities.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I did purchase the oil in another brand which had a spray nozzle that worked much better.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I highly recommended for skin problems even for lips works great.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week my hormonal acne along my jaw line had improved a good deal with lightening of acne marks.</li>
            <li>Original review, still applicable!:    </li>
            <li>I wish I took pictures, but I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed Tamanu Oils popularity hasn&#x27;t grown more over the years, it honestly is the natural and effective cure to so many ailments.</li>
            <li>My skin tone, fine lines, and acne have improved more</li>
            <li>Working with various oil, I found this oil to be very good.  </li>
            <li>I use it as part of a combination of oils for my face and is is amazingly smooth and my skin has been so much softer, better hydrated, and bright.  </li>
            <li>I still get bumps and clogged pores, but the tamanu oil prevents them from becoming inflamed.</li>
            <li>after shaving my hair grows without becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Yay, so glad I can enjoy this oil again.</li>
            <li>So far 3 members of my family have been using this product and have all had great reactions.</li>
            <li>that was really good for inflammations, and I needed for my knee, because I put to much pressure on it during a workout.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly, very well packaged and fair priced.</li>
            <li>Absorbed quickly by the skin you can use sparingly and still get good results.  </li>
            <li>How cool are they?!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what it will do with longer use. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried two other brands, but this one is truly the best and seems to be the purest.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs very quickly, non-sticky.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into the skin very quickly, without shine/grease.  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>so it will spread around easily.</li>
            <li>It is viscous, yellow-ish in color and has a strong scent (which I do not find offensive).</li>
            <li>It does smell strongly</li>
            <li>I was able to see a difference in my skin and hair right away!  </li>
            <li>Liz was excellent at following up with me as a new customer and making sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>great product not much else to say  good price  quick service , smooth regenerating use this in all my lotions &amp; ointment</li>
            <li>Love to mix it with sweet almond oil for my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for my acneic skin and has dramatically reduced my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes mix it with grape seed oil if I want something lighter, but most of the time I use it full strength.  </li>
            <li>Good for all skin problems, creates new skin.  </li>
            <li>, it seems to be minimizing my fine lines.....</li>
            <li>I love the walnut fragrance that dissipates quickly after having it applied.</li>
            <li>This companies oil is super high-quality!</li>
            <li>love the product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>These oils can be quite pricey, but they are a worthy investment!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>I am an AA with melanin rich skin that scars easily.</li>
            <li>I use it once and week and have noticed a huge increase in the healthiness and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>It is great to purchase a great product, from a company that stands behind their product.</li>
            <li>and I already see a HUGE improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Great customer service,Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>this has shown great results for the last two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nga P. Pham.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a moisturizer on my face.  </li>
            <li>, it helps to smooth the oil on your face evenly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy tamanu oil, I  sue it for my toe infection .</li>
            <li>It is fantastic -</li>
            <li>Skin should feel silky smooth with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>This will leave your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It is basically scent-less, and it&#x27;s not to &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; but not to light either.</li>
            <li>I also use a few drops to moisturize my face and neck and it&#x27;s wonderful for that too!  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no oily residue and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>and I hope they continue to be such a great experience.</li>
            <li>To heavy to wear in the daytime,but wonderful overnight.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>In the morning I moisturize with Tamanu while my skin is damp, wait about 15 minutes for it to absorb and then apply a light coverage of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Great product and the company went above and beyond....</li>
            <li>but my mom did enjoy this a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, but since I have only used it once a day for about a week now, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will be beneficial to my scars.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>, I appreciated the follow up phone call to make sure I was satisfied &amp; received my order.</li>
            <li>It smells very nutty and earthy, kind of like butterscotch but not as sweet.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Good, small bottle good travel size.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for those who still looking for a perfect skin care products, the answer is simple, the more natural products you use, the better are the results.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this oil and the results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I have changed my original 3 star rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It has soften my laugh lines and has helped with lightening my scars!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I started using this product on my face a couple of weeks ago and noticed that my skin started to feel more soft and look more smooth.</li>
            <li>So exciting!</li>
            <li>Great for healing minor cuts and scrapes as well!</li>
            <li>I have also begun making my own lotions and soap and have incorporated this oil in my new mixtures.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when skin is really dry.</li>
            <li>Great for healing dry scaling skin and reducing nail fungus.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and its amazing for my oily skin keeping it soft and supple and still oil free.</li>
            <li>Yet, once the Tamanu oil is applied to the skin, it is non greasy, light weight, and the smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>it feels great on dry cuticles, acne prone skin, scars etc.</li>
            <li>At night I apply Tamanu to my clean face and neck and go to sleep while it does</li>
            <li>You may want to select pleasant smelling oils with complementary medicinal qualities if you will be using enough that you might be offended by the odor.</li>
            <li>The quality is superb, far better than what I was using previously.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking healthier and certainly feels better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for my skin, and the oil has for the most part worked really well.</li>
            <li>My husband even looked at me differently and said my face looked good</li>
            <li>It is too early to give my honest opinion about the shelf life</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this oil on my face since the consistency seemed a bit thick but to my surprise it was a wonderful addition to my oil cleansing method.</li>
            <li>I just had a full hip replacement and used Tamanu Oil to reduce the scarring on my leg.  </li>
            <li>My hands are much softer and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>but I love how non-greasy and gentle it is.</li>
            <li>I honestly almost gave up hope for clear skin bc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it full strength</li>
            <li>Fast shipping , love this oil for my skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li>I have since found many other uses for this exceptional oil.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a dropper which makes it so easy to get out and not waste any product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a strong smell at first, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>it is kind of like a strong nut smell mixed with butterscotch.</li>
            <li>It is unique, I like the smell, it is good for dry and damaged skin, it is a good carrier for essential oils.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell at first, but it smells almost nutty to me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tamanu oil has a pretty strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff makes my skin smooth soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>I now use this with some of my essential oils as a &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34; and natural &amp;#34;sunscreen.&amp;#34;  Seems to do the trick wonderfully and my skin really likes it!  </li>
            <li>It smells a bit earthy but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Since it absorbs so quickly, I mix it with acne medicine in the morning and at night which helps the medication sink in to my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read about a lot of sellers on sites like this selling fake tamanu oil, but this one appears to be authentic and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>His skin is clearer and looks a lot more healthy overall</li>
            <li>I use after a mild cleanser (phisoderm) and rub all over my face, neck and chest with my finger.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped quickly, and arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li>I absorbs quickly and I like the aroma.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and was packages well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using mild chemical peels at home.</li>
            <li>I have been using for 2 weeks and have seen tremendous improvement to my skin and have had no breakouts.</li>
            <li>WHERE HAVE I BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve suffered and continue to suffer from mild acne and therefore have some acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li>When I put it on, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help my mild scarring and not clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>I love this Tamanu oil particularly for my eczema.</li>
            <li>The review the lady posted about wetting your face first was a huge help as well</li>
            <li>Like others have said the most important thing is to be sure your skin is wet</li>
            <li>I love how soft and clean my skin feels after using this every night.</li>
            <li>good for overnight or super dry skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle top broke on my shipment and the seller immediately sent out a new bottle</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a bit of a strong, wood smell, but nothing I really mind</li>
            <li>Be warned the smell is quite strong so I wouldn&#x27;t use a whole lot of it.  </li>
            <li>Good for curly &amp; dry hair.</li>
            <li>and i noticed the fine lines  are faded and it improved my large pores as well and acne scar..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to mix with your favorite essential oils or use on its own.</li>
            <li>Smells kinda funny!</li>
            <li>I apply it under my eyes as well, but can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s doing anything for my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if any of the fine lines are diminishing, but I wasn&#x27;t really worried about it.  </li>
            <li>Great little product.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice medium weight oil, mixes well with a drop of essential oil for fragrance,  and I also combine a dime size amount with a very light face lotion like Kiels for a night moisturizer for my 50 year old skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>care should be fun and make you feel good, but one should not expect miracles - that is at least my personal philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to the kind and most helpful staff at Cammile Q for shipping the oil so quickly.</li>
            <li>so it really helps to have health &amp; smooth skin .</li>
            <li>I do not  use anything else at this time and my skin is very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast leaving smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I recommend strongly this particular brand</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is employed by Polynesian women for promoting healthy, clear, blemish-free skin, and is also used on babies to prevent diaper rash and skin eruptions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Larger bottles would be nice too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$$</li>
            <li>Try getting a teenage boy to follow anything you want him to, but he saw the great results and asks to use it a lot more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this oil because it was light enough to use by itself during the day.</li>
            <li>It cannot remove scars completely but it is able to reduce their appearance over time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Superior to any other Tamanu oil that I have used.</li>
            <li>family member used it on shingles lesions with other oils and had good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it is high quality and works very well</li>
            <li>When I got my product, I used it right away.</li>
            <li>I received my bottle in 2 days and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>thank goodness I purchase two right from the start.</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>This oil dries it right up, takes away the itch and burn and heals the eczema patch.</li>
            <li>I also use it on some scars and stretch marks (which are years old) and although they have not completely disappeared there is great improvement.</li>
            <li>It smells very natural and goes away very quickly</li>
            <li>The new oil is good but it has only been 2 weeks since, I have started using the newer bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to wash out like coconut oil and leaves my hair suuuuper shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used it a few months with great results... until I began wearing bronzer and other makeup that was causing breakouts (but I began using bentonite clay on my face: liberally, under and on top of makeup, or as a touchup to get rid of the oily face look, on clean skin before bed, etc.</li>
            <li>However my skin feels very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised myself, fine wrinkles were gone, the skin color improved and my skin was not dry any more.</li>
            <li>Happened to me overnight, but a light rinse in the morning fixed it right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently cleansing my body, which is very important.    </li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin which was getting dry and irritated, causing more breakouts because of the harsh winter we&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and somewhat nutty, doesn&#x27;t bother me and disappears pretty quickly, but then I&#x27;m used to herbs and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>but my goal was to find one that is pure,, cold pressed, no added filler ingredients,  at a good price, from a seller with a good reputation.  </li>
            <li>Also i stop breaking out so much and feeling a little more confident with out makeup.</li>
            <li>Guys, I&#x27;ve literally only had this for THREE days and my acne is dissolved and my scars are already fading:)</li>
            <li>Smells like &#x27;plant&#x27; when you first apply</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love the oil and use it mixed in with my homemade lotion.</li>
            <li>and this is with him not using it consistently as he should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For many years the back of one of my ears has sort of kept something like eczema.</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this wonderful oil.</li>
            <li>When I placed my order, there were many different manufacturers and retailers to choose from.  </li>
            <li>Either you&#x27;ll love it, or you&#x27;ll get your money back.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would add is that once you apply the oil, wipe your hands with a paper towel (wiping your hands gets rid of excess oil) and apply more water.</li>
            <li>Try alternating with 100% organic aloe for extra magical healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wake up with soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It really does improve my complexion!</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve finally found a product that is helping with my scar.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>There is a scent when first applied, but it soon dissipates.  </li>
            <li>At this point I was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in learning more about DoTerra Essential Oils - you can visit my site</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell it at all during the day when I wear it, but when I use more at night, I&#x27;ll catch whiffs of it the next morning.</li>
            <li>Helped so much with my eczema!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to try Tamanu Oil since the idea of putting oil over oily skin seemed like a breeding ground for clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and it is clearing my acne scars!</li>
            <li>I have sun damage from living in FL all my life, the Tamanu oil makes my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>couple things I might have wanted to know about this oil in the description for a first time</li>
            <li>My husband first purchased this item for a skin problem he was having.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice and really absorbed into my skin and left it feeling soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>They have a high quality product, it&#x27;s delivered quickly, and their customer service is beyond compare.</li>
            <li>I received this order super fast, thanks Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on the more aggravated spots (you really don&#x27;t need more than 1-2 fingertips&#x27; worth for your whole face).</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good size for first time buyers to try, but you can get same quality at cheaper price if you search around.</li>
            <li>It has a very slight scent which is pleasant, washes out easily the next morning,  and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like others oils</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real greasy, so it&#x27;s great for hair and next</li>
            <li>and it helps mild red turn to tan pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and 99% were positive and both of us agreed.</li>
            <li>If your skin continues to feel oily, you put too much oil on your first application.</li>
            <li>I use a bit of it w the other essential oils I used to wash my face as I had heard of its acne-fighting properties and saw a great improvement in my breakouts.</li>
            <li>It impressed my doctor enough to mention how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; my incision was looking and how minimal the scarring was during my last post-operative appointment.</li>
            <li>Maybe with a few drops of a nice smelling essential oil it would be better.</li>
            <li>The smell is different, but not bad at all... takes some getting used to (like tea tree or lavender essential oil scents), but has actually become an attractive smell to me (and again you don&#x27;t use much at a time).    </li>
            <li>Not sure what the long-term effects will be, but it does so well on the post-Curaderm area that it must be good.</li>
            <li>After just three weeks I have seen a great improvement in dark marks left by acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have my sister try this for her super hyper sensitive skin, maybe it will help.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;great, thick oil, with a bit of a nutty, curry smell, which is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed a positive difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t cured it, but it certainly helps to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t use it over large areas of my body non-diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to order a new bottle ASAP!!    </li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted much longer than I expected and I love the nutty smell.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived extremely quick and after a few days the eczema was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple days and have seen an improvement in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>If you can use the entire bottle within month or two is fine</li>
            <li>I previously ordered two my first time because I read so many positive printed reviews.</li>
            <li>I smooth a few drops on my face after cleansing and it makes my skin sooo smooth, takes care of peeling and severe dryness issues, all without causing break-outs.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I could cry tears of joy because I no longer have to hide behind makeup.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped heal my skin.</li>
            <li>I have an oily skin but this product made my skin feel very matte.</li>
            <li>I hope I can get a bottle with it not broken.</li>
            <li>I have even used it straight</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate your customer service.</li>
            <li>product is very oily</li>
            <li>and I have to say it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin so much.  </li>
            <li>My husband has also used the oil on his shingles and says that it really helps the itching pain.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I think it really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very nutty.</li>
            <li>We both found this product to be very beneficial for us.</li>
            <li>The water helps so much in the application of the oil.</li>
            <li>Product really does work on scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night for a month now, and my skin is SO much smoother.</li>
            <li>Who wants that?  </li>
            <li>I discovered this product, and it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me.</li>
            <li>It is helping my skin to recover really fast and burned mark is almost gone.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but have been using this as a day moisturizer and under my night cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>(very nutty)--but</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t overdo it; you really don&#x27;t need as much oil as you might think you need.</li>
            <li>She hasnt seen too much of a result, but these are very hefty scars.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Tamanu oil on my face and neck for a month and my skin literally glows, feels smooth and looks younger.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the smell</li>
            <li>I use it in the face oil I make and it seems to be very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Used daily, fantastic Results - Drew H</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Tamanu oil to anyone that will listen!</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve only used this once so far...</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this tamanu oil and love it so far.</li>
            <li>Being older and active as a runner, biker, and generally spending my fair share of time in the gym working out.  </li>
            <li>his face nearly cleared up right away while using this.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that is both oily and dry, I get agitation bumps if I put on anything that has too many chemicals or ingredients (for this reason I have been looking for more natural alternatives to facial cleansers/healers/moisturizers.)</li>
            <li>I love this oil, the other brand I had been using was sold out</li>
            <li>I use the product every other day or so, and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I will be trying it in my face masks after reading the other reviews :)</li>
            <li>I stop useing  my other moisturizers and use the tamanu oil mornings and night.my skin is more even</li>
            <li>You will probably also benefit from blending with other oils that absorb better.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it for stubborn scars and then realized so many other purposes when I got it.</li>
            <li>It smells like really strong Tea Tree Oil, but this Tamanu Oil helped my dry and cracked elbows and my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s with fair, sensitive skin and it makes my skin looks more refreshed, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore.  </li>
            <li>Having oily skin, Tamanu oil is one of the few oils that I use on my skin, since its is so light weight and skin absorbs it quickly</li>
            <li>caution for those interested in using tamanu oil: this product&#x27;s bottle says it can be applied up to three times daily, but I find using too much oil could dry out your skin and cause more skin problems.</li>
            <li>My skin started feeling soft after the first use itself.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a dispenser, so I&#x27;m using small glass pipette (to avoid germs), it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s not good oil, it just isn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li>otherwise it will turn dark (blackish) and the smell will get more stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many Tamanu oils and hands down my skin loves this oil.</li>
            <li>As an adult it is pretty mild and definitely hormonal.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I personally like the earthly scent of the oil which seems to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>- they used to last for months, but my most recent &amp;#34;ghost pimple&amp;#34; disappeared in about a week.  </li>
            <li>The order from a second party was sent quickly and arrived</li>
            <li>Fell in love with Tamanu oil while vacationing in French Polynesia recently.</li>
            <li>I selected this product because I was looking for a natural, healing oil for my face at night and had read positive things about Tamanu Oil.  </li>
            <li>It does have a natural earthy scent but it fades pretty quickly especially if you are heading out into fresh air.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely high quality tanamu oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it to anyone looking for tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>On occasions when I feel a little pimple would come up I would put this oil before bed and like magic the pimple disappears in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin that tends to break out around the chin and jawline, and I am sensitive to many skin care products.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs so fast and leaves your face soft not greasy.  </li>
            <li>This oil really does help fade old blemishes, softens and smoothes skin.  </li>
            <li>and I had read a few things about Tamanu oil being able to reduce scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had success with using Tamanu oil on chigger and mosquito bites (it didn&#x27;t help the itching, but the red marks went away faster).  </li>
            <li>did your skin eventually return to normal??</li>
            <li>He keeps it, not in the bathroom, but right next to his recliner, so he&#x27;ll remember to put it on....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Tamanu oil and Cammile Q!</li>
            <li>All I know is the generosity of this company and that they genuinely believe that their product is high enough quality that they back it with a guarantee.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new bottle immediatly and refunded my account.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair growing back in the balding spots, but my hair is growing super fast.</li>
            <li>However, I was left SPEECHLESS not only by how much the color/tone of my skin changed but how quickly the effects took place.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; when I get a burn or a cut, the scar stays for years.</li>
            <li>I also use Tamanu oil on my scalp and hair, and it leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out with products and</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re at all interested in skin care oils I definitely recommend trying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes, but so far it&#x27;s been a miracle for my scarring!</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other Cammile Q products such as Argan oil and Castor oil, both of which are supposed to have a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several weeks now, and within the first week I noticed that my skin was clearer.</li>
            <li>A little too strong on the scent side.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Tamanu Oil (mixed with Jojoba, Vitamin E, and Lavender EO) on a clean face for a couple of months, twice a day, and have definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I could go on and on about how much Tamanu Oil has saved my self esteem after years of acne nearly destroyed it, but I have also used the oil for other purposes with just as much success...</li>
            <li>- Lightened old scars and new blemishes  </li>
            <li>Such an amazing product I usually don&#x27;t believe in the stuff</li>
            <li>I wanted to stop using products that have an extensive list of ingredients (most of which are difficult to pronounce) and decided to make my own facial moisturizer utilizing natural oils.</li>
            <li>been using for about 2 weeks and starting to see positive effects from this product.</li>
            <li>Finally, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was very professional.</li>
            <li>I am certain that this oil will become a standard in our home</li>
            <li>Seems to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>He was all clear within 3 days.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I might have a reaction to the oil because i have sensitive skin, but i haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>As for the Tamanu Oil, it really helped with my psoriasis and I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of adult acne</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily instead of moisturizer and it works really well at fading acne scars.</li>
            <li>the itching is completely gone</li>
            <li>I spend a couple of minutes gently rubbing it into my scalp to ensure proper absorption.</li>
            <li>and she was surprised to notice a difference as well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this oil because I read that it is a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks, the itching was gone and the patches completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>It has a natural, woodsy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for natural solutions for my adult acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any acne outbreaks</li>
            <li>I was surprised to learn that Tamanu oil has a natural SPF of 20.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m really the only one who can smell it.  </li>
            <li>I covered his affected areas with this oil twice per day and notice a marked improvement in just 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I have been using this as a carrier for my essential oils to use on a scaly dermatitis on my face and it is really helping it heal a lot.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin incredibly soft and not too oily.</li>
            <li>I have been using for one month and have noticed marked improvement.  </li>
            <li>UPDATE- A recommendation: do NOT put this anywhere near the eyes or on wounds/burns.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin is soft and moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it on an old scar I&#x27;ve had for about 9 years.</li>
            <li>As far as acne since using this it has cleared my skin a bit.</li>
            <li>-Soft skin    </li>
            <li>The burn healed completely after about a week without scarring.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any improvement on old scars and post-acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been applying it for about a month month in the morning &amp; night..</li>
            <li>After 24-48hrs, pimples had nearly vanished.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed softer skin so far.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 nights and now my skin texture has completely changed..</li>
            <li>I bought another bottle from an often-used company and did not like it nearly as well.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would advise against this product.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it is natural and not masked by perfumes.</li>
            <li>this oil keeps my skin soft, not greasy and clear.</li>
            <li>I have been rubbing it into my lower back everyday for about a week now and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My only advice is that they add a dropper top cause pouring it out waste oil for me.</li>
            <li>I often break out around my mouth and chin, but even the most gentle, natural spot treatments irritate my skin and make the area look worse.</li>
            <li>I only use natural, high quality products on my face and hair now, and this tamanu oil is a new staple in my DIY natural products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already addicted to this oil despite the pretty strong smell (it goes sort of earthy butterscotch on me; not a fan of butterscotch).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly a bad smell, but it is a very sharp, earthy smell.</li>
            <li>The dropper allows me to better control how many drops I use, making it less wasteful and less messy.  </li>
            <li>far this has helped to rid my skin of black heads and pull white heads out, making what was once bumpy skin now smooth and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problems I had was after the first time I opened it, the inner part of the cap fell out which made it to where it had no seal.</li>
            <li>11/24/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller quickly contacted and informed me that the oil turned black because of dropper.</li>
            <li>I was excited for the good results, but I received the opposite. :(  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to just apply a small amount because otherwise it will feel greasy and not absorb.</li>
            <li>I have used Tamanu Oil in the past on a cut and received fabulous results.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to a friend who&#x27;s in her mid 50&#x27;s with darker normal skin</li>
            <li>It is a thicker, deeper in color oil with a very distinct scent that I&#x27;m not sure how to explain.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li>low and behold her spot has sprouts of new hair</li>
            <li>I like that this oil absorbs into my skin fairly quickly and then doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and other oils with the same characteristics and think this brand Cammile Q is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Seems to be higher quality than other sources of Tamanu oil I have tried</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell that takes a little bit of time to get used to, but I still appreciate the product for it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li>Q Tamanu Oil smells noticeably more subtle and feels different, besides.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply a small amount to your pimples and let it sit!!</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I was surprised a little by the smell</li>
            <li>My face is not only clear, but glowing.</li>
            <li>While looking for natural moisturizers, I came across Tamanu oil and read about its various benefits.</li>
            <li>So far (but having it used only for 2 weeks) I cannot say that my brown spots have improved, but I am also not expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and deeply moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve found the combination to be helpful in clearing my skin, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me look any brighter or younger</li>
            <li>and i can actually see my skin healing old marks i had from sun damage</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this has not caused any irritation or breakouts so far with several weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>The oil is thick so start out light.</li>
            <li>My favorite use so far is putting a few drops on my hands and rubbing into scalp and then smoothing down hair shaft, occasionally putting 1-2 additional drops from mid-shaft to ends.  </li>
            <li>It works very well as a carrier oil for my natural face serums and it has been thoroughly researched and has been found to heal damaged skin, treat scarring, stretch marks, minor cuts and burns, abrasions, rashes, sores, dry skin, eczema, etc.  </li>
            <li>It seems pure and smells just as other reviewers said - to me</li>
            <li>I use a few drops on my face every morning and right before bed.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, dry in some areas and normal in others and this helps balance everything out.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant based on other reviews and the scent, but the scent is not offensive or strong.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is now I have some half used bottles of lotions that aren&#x27;t going to get used because this works so much better!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a little funky, but you can&#x27;t really complain about the smell of a natural oil...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive african american oily skin.</li>
            <li>I had been using commercial lotions and moisturizers all my life until recently when I stumbled upon an article about the benefits of using natural oils for hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I first notice the solid black particles around the droplet</li>
            <li>But the day after I applied the tamanu oil to my sunburn, it barely hurt when, just the day prior, I was wincing with every movement of my arms, every time my shirt shifted slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after a long day in the sun to prevent sun burns, on a jellyfish sting rash, and even to reduce old scars and sun damage/sun spots.     </li>
            <li>This is a useful product, however i cannot get past the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks and it has really gone down.  </li>
            <li>I currently have two minor oven burns that are 3 years old.</li>
            <li>After showering I use it on my toes my face, my arms, and sensitive areas especially after a long bike ride or run.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I have very normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tamanu oil has a tint to it, and used alone it will slightly color light colored skin a yellowish green tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve loved it and am looking forward to incorporating it into my long term skin care regimen, although I may go back to a traditional night cream once the weather gets cold again.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have said the oil is way too heavy for use during the day, which may be true for oily skin types.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this stuff goes a long way and the dropper makes it easy to apply to the skin without making a mess.</li>
            <li>I place just a little bit on existing scars, and initial breakouts to help get rid of them fast.</li>

            <li> love this product it is the best!</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely loving it!</li>
            <li> ( I love not having to wait around for orders :D )</li>
            <li> It has brought remarkable healing and comfort to my face.</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil by Cammile Q is my top favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I think the smell is pleasant and woodsy.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is very good for treating many skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I loved the oil.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it felt and also ended up using it in my hair and on my face.  </li>
            <li> but once you learn how to use it works really good.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, I wanted to try it</li>
            <li> If you are set out to buy a good oil and you are comparing this with another brand, just go with this one.</li>
            <li> Also loved the oil.</li>
            <li> These oils are also good for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality but it burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about this oil</li>

            <li> Then I found out that was good for skin</li>
            <li> My wife had a good experience for using tamanu oil for years.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> but she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elmo</li>
            <li> This oil good, but it takes a while to see some results.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.</li>
            <li> I can continue to rave about this and tell you my skin literally glows and looks flawless immediately after use, but it seems too good to be true which is why I urge everyone, even skeptics,to just give it a try...</li>
            <li> The quality is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great packaging and wonderful product.</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I accidently stumbled across this oil and am so glad I did!</li>

            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have heard so many good things about Tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It was quite effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li> (my husband NEVER notices this kind of thing, so it was a shock).  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have discovered it.  </li>
            <li> It dries your skin kind out which is wierd because it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, really nice.</li>
            <li> I found it to be comforting, to be honest.</li>
            <li> To give a try I started my search for a nice brand which I could trust.</li>
            <li> My skin has been loving it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this.</li>
            <li> To the seller thank you for delievering on time wonderful service thanks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make my own cleansing oil without any additives</li>
            <li> Both of us are thrilled.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Tamanu Oil to make my own face oils instead of using store bought moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and i think the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> nice product and company.</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a drying oil, so I do find I need to apply a good moisturiser on top (cocoa butter, shea butter or even just olive oil/coconut oil).</li>
            <li> Great consistency, great smell, and it makes my skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> The company sent the product quickly and it came in great shape.</li>
            <li> I do have a very strong sense of smell, so this may not bother everyone.</li>
            <li> VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had great results!</li>
            <li> her face  looked like she&#x27;d been sleeping better without him, and he never notices this kind of thing either.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed at the fast, efficient service I received from Cammile Q, as well as a follow up inquiry to be sure I was satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I were so pleased with this amazing product that I placed another order of two.</li>
            <li> I think this one is the most effective for healing scars.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft, moisturized, non greasy, and beautiful!  </li>
            <li> If you intend to use this oil for scarring, please note that it is most effective when used to prevent a wound from leaving a scar.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent, works well to avoid stretch marks, I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for clear skin and reduce marks.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;d be best added to a carrier oil because it is pretty powerful!</li>

            <li> I am so glad that I found out about the use of oils</li>
            <li> Most products won&#x27;t touch this area.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t at all sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of Tamanu.  </li>
            <li> so it spreads better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad things worked out this way, because after purchasing another brand of tamanu oil, I found the smell stronger and more curry-like.</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> Every Sunday I slather this oil all over my hair for an hour or more before my shower.</li>
            <li> and I will find even more ways in which it will help my family.</li>

            <li> My mom honestly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Im glad i did.</li>

            <li> I love this oil, even the earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Though I am still fighting the acne, it has gotten significantly better.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is famous for its anti-aging and moisturizing qualities.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I did purchase the oil in another brand which had a spray nozzle that worked much better.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I highly recommended for skin problems even for lips works great.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week my hormonal acne along my jaw line had improved a good deal with lightening of acne marks.</li>
            <li> Original review, still applicable!:    </li>
            <li> I wish I took pictures, but I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed Tamanu Oils popularity hasn&#x27;t grown more over the years, it honestly is the natural and effective cure to so many ailments.</li>
            <li> My skin tone, fine lines, and acne have improved more</li>
            <li> Working with various oil, I found this oil to be very good.  </li>
            <li> I use it as part of a combination of oils for my face and is is amazingly smooth and my skin has been so much softer, better hydrated, and bright.  </li>
            <li> I still get bumps and clogged pores, but the tamanu oil prevents them from becoming inflamed.</li>
            <li> after shaving my hair grows without becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Yay, so glad I can enjoy this oil again.</li>
            <li> So far 3 members of my family have been using this product and have all had great reactions.</li>
            <li> that was really good for inflammations, and I needed for my knee, because I put to much pressure on it during a workout.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly, very well packaged and fair priced.</li>
            <li> Absorbed quickly by the skin you can use sparingly and still get good results.  </li>
            <li> How cool are they?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what it will do with longer use. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried two other brands, but this one is truly the best and seems to be the purest.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs very quickly, non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin very quickly, without shine/grease.  </li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> so it will spread around easily.</li>
            <li> It is viscous, yellow-ish in color and has a strong scent (which I do not find offensive).</li>
            <li> It does smell strongly</li>
            <li> I was able to see a difference in my skin and hair right away!  </li>
            <li> Liz was excellent at following up with me as a new customer and making sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> great product not much else to say  good price  quick service , smooth regenerating use this in all my lotions &amp; ointment</li>
            <li> Love to mix it with sweet almond oil for my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for my acneic skin and has dramatically reduced my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes mix it with grape seed oil if I want something lighter, but most of the time I use it full strength.  </li>
            <li> Good for all skin problems, creates new skin.  </li>
            <li> , it seems to be minimizing my fine lines.....</li>

            <li> this has shown great results for the last two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nga P. Pham.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a moisturizer on my face.  </li>
            <li> , it helps to smooth the oil on your face evenly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy tamanu oil, I  sue it for my toe infection .</li>
            <li> It is fantastic -</li>
            <li> Skin should feel silky smooth with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> This will leave your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It is basically scent-less, and it&#x27;s not to &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; but not to light either.</li>
            <li> I also use a few drops to moisturize my face and neck and it&#x27;s wonderful for that too!  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no oily residue and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> and I hope they continue to be such a great experience.</li>
            <li> To heavy to wear in the daytime,but wonderful overnight.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> In the morning I moisturize with Tamanu while my skin is damp, wait about 15 minutes for it to absorb and then apply a light coverage of makeup.  </li>
            <li> Great product and the company went above and beyond....</li>
            <li> but my mom did enjoy this a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, but since I have only used it once a day for about a week now, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will be beneficial to my scars.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> , I appreciated the follow up phone call to make sure I was satisfied &amp; received my order.</li>
            <li> It smells very nutty and earthy, kind of like butterscotch but not as sweet.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Good, small bottle good travel size.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>

            <li> So far I am very pleased with this oil and the results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I have changed my original 3 star rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It has soften my laugh lines and has helped with lightening my scars!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on my face a couple of weeks ago and noticed that my skin started to feel more soft and look more smooth.</li>
            <li> So exciting!</li>
            <li> Great for healing minor cuts and scrapes as well!</li>
            <li> I have also begun making my own lotions and soap and have incorporated this oil in my new mixtures.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when skin is really dry.</li>
            <li> Great for healing dry scaling skin and reducing nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and its amazing for my oily skin keeping it soft and supple and still oil free.</li>
            <li> Yet, once the Tamanu oil is applied to the skin, it is non greasy, light weight, and the smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> it feels great on dry cuticles, acne prone skin, scars etc.</li>
            <li> At night I apply Tamanu to my clean face and neck and go to sleep while it does</li>
            <li> You may want to select pleasant smelling oils with complementary medicinal qualities if you will be using enough that you might be offended by the odor.</li>
            <li> The quality is superb, far better than what I was using previously.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking healthier and certainly feels better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my skin, and the oil has for the most part worked really well.</li>
            <li> My husband even looked at me differently and said my face looked good</li>
            <li> It is too early to give my honest opinion about the shelf life</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this oil on my face since the consistency seemed a bit thick but to my surprise it was a wonderful addition to my oil cleansing method.</li>
            <li> I just had a full hip replacement and used Tamanu Oil to reduce the scarring on my leg.  </li>
            <li> My hands are much softer and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> but I love how non-greasy and gentle it is.</li>
            <li> I honestly almost gave up hope for clear skin bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it full strength</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , love this oil for my skin</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li> I have since found many other uses for this exceptional oil.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a dropper which makes it so easy to get out and not waste any product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong smell at first, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> it is kind of like a strong nut smell mixed with butterscotch.</li>
            <li> It is unique, I like the smell, it is good for dry and damaged skin, it is a good carrier for essential oils.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell at first, but it smells almost nutty to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tamanu oil has a pretty strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff makes my skin smooth soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> I now use this with some of my essential oils as a &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34; and natural &amp;#34;sunscreen.&amp;#34;  Seems to do the trick wonderfully and my skin really likes it!  </li>
            <li> It smells a bit earthy but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Since it absorbs so quickly, I mix it with acne medicine in the morning and at night which helps the medication sink in to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about a lot of sellers on sites like this selling fake tamanu oil, but this one appears to be authentic and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> His skin is clearer and looks a lot more healthy overall</li>
            <li> I use after a mild cleanser (phisoderm) and rub all over my face, neck and chest with my finger.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly, and arrived well packaged.</li>
            <li> I absorbs quickly and I like the aroma.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was packages well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using mild chemical peels at home.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 weeks and have seen tremendous improvement to my skin and have had no breakouts.</li>
            <li> WHERE HAVE I BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve suffered and continue to suffer from mild acne and therefore have some acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help my mild scarring and not clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> I love this Tamanu oil particularly for my eczema.</li>
            <li> The review the lady posted about wetting your face first was a huge help as well</li>
            <li> Like others have said the most important thing is to be sure your skin is wet</li>
            <li> I love how soft and clean my skin feels after using this every night.</li>
            <li> good for overnight or super dry skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle top broke on my shipment and the seller immediately sent out a new bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a bit of a strong, wood smell, but nothing I really mind</li>
            <li> Be warned the smell is quite strong so I wouldn&#x27;t use a whole lot of it.  </li>
            <li> Good for curly &amp; dry hair.</li>
            <li> and i noticed the fine lines  are faded and it improved my large pores as well and acne scar..</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to mix with your favorite essential oils or use on its own.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funny!</li>
            <li> I apply it under my eyes as well, but can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s doing anything for my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if any of the fine lines are diminishing, but I wasn&#x27;t really worried about it.  </li>
            <li> Great little product.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice medium weight oil, mixes well with a drop of essential oil for fragrance,  and I also combine a dime size amount with a very light face lotion like Kiels for a night moisturizer for my 50 year old skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> care should be fun and make you feel good, but one should not expect miracles - that is at least my personal philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to the kind and most helpful staff at Cammile Q for shipping the oil so quickly.</li>
            <li> so it really helps to have health &amp; smooth skin .</li>
            <li> I do not  use anything else at this time and my skin is very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast leaving smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I recommend strongly this particular brand</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is employed by Polynesian women for promoting healthy, clear, blemish-free skin, and is also used on babies to prevent diaper rash and skin eruptions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Larger bottles would be nice too.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> Try getting a teenage boy to follow anything you want him to, but he saw the great results and asks to use it a lot more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this oil because it was light enough to use by itself during the day.</li>
            <li> It cannot remove scars completely but it is able to reduce their appearance over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Superior to any other Tamanu oil that I have used.</li>
            <li> family member used it on shingles lesions with other oils and had good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it is high quality and works very well</li>
            <li> When I got my product, I used it right away.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle in 2 days and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> thank goodness I purchase two right from the start.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> This oil dries it right up, takes away the itch and burn and heals the eczema patch.</li>
            <li> I also use it on some scars and stretch marks (which are years old) and although they have not completely disappeared there is great improvement.</li>
            <li> It smells very natural and goes away very quickly</li>
            <li> The new oil is good but it has only been 2 weeks since, I have started using the newer bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to wash out like coconut oil and leaves my hair suuuuper shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used it a few months with great results... until I began wearing bronzer and other makeup that was causing breakouts (but I began using bentonite clay on my face: liberally, under and on top of makeup, or as a touchup to get rid of the oily face look, on clean skin before bed, etc.</li>
            <li> However my skin feels very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised myself, fine wrinkles were gone, the skin color improved and my skin was not dry any more.</li>
            <li> Happened to me overnight, but a light rinse in the morning fixed it right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently cleansing my body, which is very important.    </li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin which was getting dry and irritated, causing more breakouts because of the harsh winter we&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and somewhat nutty, doesn&#x27;t bother me and disappears pretty quickly, but then I&#x27;m used to herbs and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> but my goal was to find one that is pure,, cold pressed, no added filler ingredients,  at a good price, from a seller with a good reputation.  </li>
            <li> Also i stop breaking out so much and feeling a little more confident with out makeup.</li>
            <li> Guys, I&#x27;ve literally only had this for THREE days and my acne is dissolved and my scars are already fading:)</li>
            <li> Smells like &#x27;plant&#x27; when you first apply</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love the oil and use it mixed in with my homemade lotion.</li>
            <li> and this is with him not using it consistently as he should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For many years the back of one of my ears has sort of kept something like eczema.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> When I placed my order, there were many different manufacturers and retailers to choose from.  </li>
            <li> Either you&#x27;ll love it, or you&#x27;ll get your money back.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would add is that once you apply the oil, wipe your hands with a paper towel (wiping your hands gets rid of excess oil) and apply more water.</li>
            <li> Try alternating with 100% organic aloe for extra magical healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wake up with soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It really does improve my complexion!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve finally found a product that is helping with my scar.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> There is a scent when first applied, but it soon dissipates.  </li>
            <li> At this point I was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re interested in learning more about DoTerra Essential Oils - you can visit my site</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell it at all during the day when I wear it, but when I use more at night, I&#x27;ll catch whiffs of it the next morning.</li>
            <li> Helped so much with my eczema!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to try Tamanu Oil since the idea of putting oil over oily skin seemed like a breeding ground for clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and it is clearing my acne scars!</li>
            <li> I have sun damage from living in FL all my life, the Tamanu oil makes my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> couple things I might have wanted to know about this oil in the description for a first time</li>
            <li> My husband first purchased this item for a skin problem he was having.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice and really absorbed into my skin and left it feeling soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> They have a high quality product, it&#x27;s delivered quickly, and their customer service is beyond compare.</li>
            <li> I received this order super fast, thanks Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on the more aggravated spots (you really don&#x27;t need more than 1-2 fingertips&#x27; worth for your whole face).</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good size for first time buyers to try, but you can get same quality at cheaper price if you search around.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight scent which is pleasant, washes out easily the next morning,  and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like others oils</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real greasy, so it&#x27;s great for hair and next</li>
            <li> and it helps mild red turn to tan pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> and 99% were positive and both of us agreed.</li>
            <li> If your skin continues to feel oily, you put too much oil on your first application.</li>
            <li> I use a bit of it w the other essential oils I used to wash my face as I had heard of its acne-fighting properties and saw a great improvement in my breakouts.</li>
            <li> It impressed my doctor enough to mention how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; my incision was looking and how minimal the scarring was during my last post-operative appointment.</li>
            <li> Maybe with a few drops of a nice smelling essential oil it would be better.</li>
            <li> The smell is different, but not bad at all... takes some getting used to (like tea tree or lavender essential oil scents), but has actually become an attractive smell to me (and again you don&#x27;t use much at a time).    </li>
            <li> Not sure what the long-term effects will be, but it does so well on the post-Curaderm area that it must be good.</li>
            <li> After just three weeks I have seen a great improvement in dark marks left by acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have my sister try this for her super hyper sensitive skin, maybe it will help.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;great, thick oil, with a bit of a nutty, curry smell, which is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a positive difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t cured it, but it certainly helps to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t use it over large areas of my body non-diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need to order a new bottle ASAP!!    </li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted much longer than I expected and I love the nutty smell.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived extremely quick and after a few days the eczema was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple days and have seen an improvement in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> If you can use the entire bottle within month or two is fine</li>
            <li> I previously ordered two my first time because I read so many positive printed reviews.</li>
            <li> I smooth a few drops on my face after cleansing and it makes my skin sooo smooth, takes care of peeling and severe dryness issues, all without causing break-outs.  </li>
            <li> Will absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I could cry tears of joy because I no longer have to hide behind makeup.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped heal my skin.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin but this product made my skin feel very matte.</li>
            <li> I hope I can get a bottle with it not broken.</li>
            <li> I have even used it straight</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate your customer service.</li>
            <li> product is very oily</li>
            <li> and I have to say it really made a difference.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin so much.  </li>
            <li> My husband has also used the oil on his shingles and says that it really helps the itching pain.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I think it really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very nutty.</li>
            <li> We both found this product to be very beneficial for us.</li>
            <li> The water helps so much in the application of the oil.</li>
            <li> Product really does work on scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night for a month now, and my skin is SO much smoother.</li>
            <li> Who wants that?  </li>
            <li> I discovered this product, and it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> It is helping my skin to recover really fast and burned mark is almost gone.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, but have been using this as a day moisturizer and under my night cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> (very nutty)--but</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overdo it; you really don&#x27;t need as much oil as you might think you need.</li>
            <li> She hasnt seen too much of a result, but these are very hefty scars.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tamanu oil on my face and neck for a month and my skin literally glows, feels smooth and looks younger.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the smell</li>
            <li> I use it in the face oil I make and it seems to be very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Used daily, fantastic Results - Drew H</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Tamanu oil to anyone that will listen!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve only used this once so far...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this tamanu oil and love it so far.</li>
            <li> Being older and active as a runner, biker, and generally spending my fair share of time in the gym working out.  </li>
            <li> his face nearly cleared up right away while using this.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is both oily and dry, I get agitation bumps if I put on anything that has too many chemicals or ingredients (for this reason I have been looking for more natural alternatives to facial cleansers/healers/moisturizers.)</li>
            <li> I love this oil, the other brand I had been using was sold out</li>
            <li> I use the product every other day or so, and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying it in my face masks after reading the other reviews :)</li>
            <li> I stop useing  my other moisturizers and use the tamanu oil mornings and night.my skin is more even</li>
            <li> You will probably also benefit from blending with other oils that absorb better.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it for stubborn scars and then realized so many other purposes when I got it.</li>
            <li> It smells like really strong Tea Tree Oil, but this Tamanu Oil helped my dry and cracked elbows and my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s with fair, sensitive skin and it makes my skin looks more refreshed, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore.  </li>
            <li> Having oily skin, Tamanu oil is one of the few oils that I use on my skin, since its is so light weight and skin absorbs it quickly</li>
            <li> caution for those interested in using tamanu oil: this product&#x27;s bottle says it can be applied up to three times daily, but I find using too much oil could dry out your skin and cause more skin problems.</li>
            <li> My skin started feeling soft after the first use itself.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a dispenser, so I&#x27;m using small glass pipette (to avoid germs), it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s not good oil, it just isn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li> otherwise it will turn dark (blackish) and the smell will get more stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many Tamanu oils and hands down my skin loves this oil.</li>
            <li> As an adult it is pretty mild and definitely hormonal.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I personally like the earthly scent of the oil which seems to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> - they used to last for months, but my most recent &amp;#34;ghost pimple&amp;#34; disappeared in about a week.  </li>
            <li> The order from a second party was sent quickly and arrived</li>
            <li> Fell in love with Tamanu oil while vacationing in French Polynesia recently.</li>
            <li> I selected this product because I was looking for a natural, healing oil for my face at night and had read positive things about Tamanu Oil.  </li>
            <li> It does have a natural earthy scent but it fades pretty quickly especially if you are heading out into fresh air.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely high quality tanamu oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it to anyone looking for tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> On occasions when I feel a little pimple would come up I would put this oil before bed and like magic the pimple disappears in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin that tends to break out around the chin and jawline, and I am sensitive to many skin care products.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs so fast and leaves your face soft not greasy.  </li>
            <li> This oil really does help fade old blemishes, softens and smoothes skin.  </li>
            <li> and I had read a few things about Tamanu oil being able to reduce scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had success with using Tamanu oil on chigger and mosquito bites (it didn&#x27;t help the itching, but the red marks went away faster).  </li>
            <li> did your skin eventually return to normal??</li>
            <li> He keeps it, not in the bathroom, but right next to his recliner, so he&#x27;ll remember to put it on....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Tamanu oil and Cammile Q!</li>
            <li> All I know is the generosity of this company and that they genuinely believe that their product is high enough quality that they back it with a guarantee.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new bottle immediatly and refunded my account.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair growing back in the balding spots, but my hair is growing super fast.</li>
            <li> However, I was left SPEECHLESS not only by how much the color/tone of my skin changed but how quickly the effects took place.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; when I get a burn or a cut, the scar stays for years.</li>
            <li> I also use Tamanu oil on my scalp and hair, and it leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out with products and</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at all interested in skin care oils I definitely recommend trying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes, but so far it&#x27;s been a miracle for my scarring!</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other Cammile Q products such as Argan oil and Castor oil, both of which are supposed to have a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks now, and within the first week I noticed that my skin was clearer.</li>
            <li> A little too strong on the scent side.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Tamanu Oil (mixed with Jojoba, Vitamin E, and Lavender EO) on a clean face for a couple of months, twice a day, and have definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about how much Tamanu Oil has saved my self esteem after years of acne nearly destroyed it, but I have also used the oil for other purposes with just as much success...</li>
            <li> - Lightened old scars and new blemishes  </li>
            <li> Such an amazing product I usually don&#x27;t believe in the stuff</li>
            <li> I wanted to stop using products that have an extensive list of ingredients (most of which are difficult to pronounce) and decided to make my own facial moisturizer utilizing natural oils.</li>
            <li> been using for about 2 weeks and starting to see positive effects from this product.</li>
            <li> Finally, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was very professional.</li>
            <li> I am certain that this oil will become a standard in our home</li>
            <li> Seems to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> He was all clear within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I might have a reaction to the oil because i have sensitive skin, but i haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As for the Tamanu Oil, it really helped with my psoriasis and I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of adult acne</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily instead of moisturizer and it works really well at fading acne scars.</li>
            <li> the itching is completely gone</li>
            <li> I spend a couple of minutes gently rubbing it into my scalp to ensure proper absorption.</li>
            <li> and she was surprised to notice a difference as well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I read that it is a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks, the itching was gone and the patches completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> It has a natural, woodsy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for natural solutions for my adult acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any acne outbreaks</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn that Tamanu oil has a natural SPF of 20.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m really the only one who can smell it.  </li>
            <li> I covered his affected areas with this oil twice per day and notice a marked improvement in just 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a carrier for my essential oils to use on a scaly dermatitis on my face and it is really helping it heal a lot.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin incredibly soft and not too oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using for one month and have noticed marked improvement.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE- A recommendation: do NOT put this anywhere near the eyes or on wounds/burns.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin is soft and moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on an old scar I&#x27;ve had for about 9 years.</li>
            <li> As far as acne since using this it has cleared my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> -Soft skin    </li>
            <li> The burn healed completely after about a week without scarring.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement on old scars and post-acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been applying it for about a month month in the morning &amp; night..</li>
            <li> After 24-48hrs, pimples had nearly vanished.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed softer skin so far.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 nights and now my skin texture has completely changed..</li>
            <li> I bought another bottle from an often-used company and did not like it nearly as well.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would advise against this product.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it is natural and not masked by perfumes.</li>
            <li> this oil keeps my skin soft, not greasy and clear.</li>
            <li> I have been rubbing it into my lower back everyday for about a week now and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> My only advice is that they add a dropper top cause pouring it out waste oil for me.</li>
            <li> I often break out around my mouth and chin, but even the most gentle, natural spot treatments irritate my skin and make the area look worse.</li>
            <li> I only use natural, high quality products on my face and hair now, and this tamanu oil is a new staple in my DIY natural products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already addicted to this oil despite the pretty strong smell (it goes sort of earthy butterscotch on me; not a fan of butterscotch).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly a bad smell, but it is a very sharp, earthy smell.</li>
            <li> The dropper allows me to better control how many drops I use, making it less wasteful and less messy.  </li>
            <li> far this has helped to rid my skin of black heads and pull white heads out, making what was once bumpy skin now smooth and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problems I had was after the first time I opened it, the inner part of the cap fell out which made it to where it had no seal.</li>
            <li> 11/24/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller quickly contacted and informed me that the oil turned black because of dropper.</li>
            <li> I was excited for the good results, but I received the opposite. :(  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to just apply a small amount because otherwise it will feel greasy and not absorb.</li>
            <li> I have used Tamanu Oil in the past on a cut and received fabulous results.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to a friend who&#x27;s in her mid 50&#x27;s with darker normal skin</li>
            <li> It is a thicker, deeper in color oil with a very distinct scent that I&#x27;m not sure how to explain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li> low and behold her spot has sprouts of new hair</li>
            <li> I like that this oil absorbs into my skin fairly quickly and then doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and other oils with the same characteristics and think this brand Cammile Q is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Seems to be higher quality than other sources of Tamanu oil I have tried</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell that takes a little bit of time to get used to, but I still appreciate the product for it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> Q Tamanu Oil smells noticeably more subtle and feels different, besides.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply a small amount to your pimples and let it sit!!</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I was surprised a little by the smell</li>
            <li> My face is not only clear, but glowing.</li>
            <li> While looking for natural moisturizers, I came across Tamanu oil and read about its various benefits.</li>
            <li> So far (but having it used only for 2 weeks) I cannot say that my brown spots have improved, but I am also not expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and deeply moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found the combination to be helpful in clearing my skin, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me look any brighter or younger</li>
            <li> and i can actually see my skin healing old marks i had from sun damage</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this has not caused any irritation or breakouts so far with several weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick so start out light.</li>
            <li> My favorite use so far is putting a few drops on my hands and rubbing into scalp and then smoothing down hair shaft, occasionally putting 1-2 additional drops from mid-shaft to ends.  </li>
            <li> It works very well as a carrier oil for my natural face serums and it has been thoroughly researched and has been found to heal damaged skin, treat scarring, stretch marks, minor cuts and burns, abrasions, rashes, sores, dry skin, eczema, etc.  </li>
            <li> It seems pure and smells just as other reviewers said - to me</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my face every morning and right before bed.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry in some areas and normal in others and this helps balance everything out.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant based on other reviews and the scent, but the scent is not offensive or strong.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is now I have some half used bottles of lotions that aren&#x27;t going to get used because this works so much better!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a little funky, but you can&#x27;t really complain about the smell of a natural oil...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive african american oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had been using commercial lotions and moisturizers all my life until recently when I stumbled upon an article about the benefits of using natural oils for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I first notice the solid black particles around the droplet</li>
            <li> But the day after I applied the tamanu oil to my sunburn, it barely hurt when, just the day prior, I was wincing with every movement of my arms, every time my shirt shifted slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after a long day in the sun to prevent sun burns, on a jellyfish sting rash, and even to reduce old scars and sun damage/sun spots.     </li>
            <li> This is a useful product, however i cannot get past the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks and it has really gone down.  </li>
            <li> I currently have two minor oven burns that are 3 years old.</li>
            <li> After showering I use it on my toes my face, my arms, and sensitive areas especially after a long bike ride or run.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have very normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tamanu oil has a tint to it, and used alone it will slightly color light colored skin a yellowish green tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve loved it and am looking forward to incorporating it into my long term skin care regimen, although I may go back to a traditional night cream once the weather gets cold again.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said the oil is way too heavy for use during the day, which may be true for oily skin types.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way and the dropper makes it easy to apply to the skin without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I place just a little bit on existing scars, and initial breakouts to help get rid of them fast.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened out, the dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable, and the fine wrinkles are my eyes and mouth are less apparent as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark green color, like olive oil, and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Over the past 5 years I have tried many different brands of Tamanu Oil and this is by far one of the best/top quality, pure, 100% cold pressed, options that you will find out there.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth trying out, though, as this facial blend is the first thing that&#x27;s helped after countless other more expensive solutions that failed.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic product, I saw dramatic improvement for a variety of skin ailments within our family.</li>
            <li> While I feel I haven&#x27;t seen ultimate results yet, I do notice a marked improvement in breakout inflammation and overall skin condition: less redness, softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so one bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You really only need a teensy bit, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin itch slightly the first few times I used it, but it didn&#x27;t cause redness or obvious irritation</li>
            <li> I developed tons of black heads after using it for about 10 days.</li>
            <li> Finally got something to help with my dry itchy scalp, I have used everything from Tea tree &amp; Rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin soft but after several days it is not a miracle worker (I put a few drops on my face once/day).</li>
            <li> The key is starting with wet skin.</li>
            <li> A few months later I developed rosacea and was having difficulty finding any product that I could use on my face that didn&#x27;t hurt and sting.</li>
            <li> I bought the tamanu oil to mix together with other essential oils to make an oil based facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He used this oil in the past and on his left knee the psoriasis is completely healed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brightening as well, no more old acne scars left on this face!</li>
            <li> It does have a strange smell that will not appeal to everyone.</li>
            <li> And the moisture lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also noticed minor abrasions heal quicker when Tamanu Oil is applied.</li>
            <li> Give EO&#x27;s a try if you have been battling acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;lastly my mother recently had open heart surgery and has one gnarly scar down her chest and across her arm from the incisions.</li>
            <li> After reading various reviews on amazon and other websites I found this one and it was exactly what I was looking for, 100% pure and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my son with a pretty bad psoriasis breakout that covered much of his upper body.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils (almond, coconut, olive), but THIS ONE , I could see the difference in inflammation on my face, &amp; the difference the day after I put it on (night prior).</li>
            <li> I was constantly fighting off attacks to my feet and other areas.  </li>
            <li> All the commercial fungal treatments were too harsh for me and only cycled through relief and wasn’t long when another outbreak would occur.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I actually have some contact dermatitis with other brands</li>
            <li> I use it daily or every other day on both face and hands.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I had an extremely painful sunburn on most of my upper body because I forgot to put on sunblock before garden for about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by an aesthetician for dry scaly patches around my forehead hair line.  </li>
            <li> My face used too get dry all the time.</li>
            <li> I used to get ingrown hairs on my face all the time.because of my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin under my beard, which results in flaky beard.</li>
            <li> but it helped with some of my dry skin issues here in Colorado.</li>
            <li> It would heal and a few days later come back.</li>
            <li> My active eczema didn&#x27;t go away, but I noticed the scars definitely got lighter.</li>
            <li> Still using the oil- will post back in the next few weeks and update on results</li>
            <li> He issued me a full refund for the bad bottle and shipped me a brand new one with the assurance that the problem has been remedied.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way so this bottle will last a long time, another plus.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil to help lighten some dark, &#x27;sun spots&#x27; on my upper chest.  </li>
            <li> It definitely moisturize the skin, and it has evened out dark tones.</li>
            <li> I had tried every prescriptive topical and oral treatment which either left my with dry red skin or in one case hives, yet everything always failed to reduce the breakouts and give me natural looking skin.</li>
            <li> so your head is upside down, and massage your entire scalp for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use it for acne &amp; for dry skin on my joints!</li>
            <li> recently, I have notice that there are black particles in the oil.</li>
            <li> The area becomes less red and smoother every day.</li>
            <li> I actually have less breakouts and I am seeing some results with the wrinkles, a softening where they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are minute issues like needing to wet your face first because the oil is a little thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little while, and just on my face, but already I&#x27;m seeing pores shrink, redness in the cheeks and forehead diminishing, and my skin isn&#x27;t dry and irritated anymore.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on my hands at night and wet with water and rub it in and then dry my hands and enough is still on.  </li>
            <li> and i want an extra acne fighting method i add melaluca with this oil and a little bit of water after cleaning my face</li>
            <li> and it is a little red.</li>
            <li> still using this product very slowly, it helps with the itch but do not help the real problem.</li>
            <li> But be careful not get it into your eyes because it stings.</li>
            <li> I spent days searching online for ways to restore my hairline, and Tamanu Oil kept coming up.</li>
            <li> use a few drops along my entire hairline twice per day.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil a few months ago to help treat my ATROPHIC acne scars on my face (not just red marks).</li>
            <li> This is an oil that I have used minimally.  </li>
            <li> I do really appreciate the seller and company behind it since they took care of all my issues and contacted me in the matter of no time.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops are needed.  </li>
            <li> The oil is concentrated, so I only use a few drops.  </li>
            <li> Ive only used it a few days now and because of the smell</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I wet it all over again, put two drops on my finger, and apply it to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> At night, I wet my face and apply four drops to my face and décolletage.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly on wet skin and helps with flakiness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it really seems to be helping my skin - especially with this dry, cold winter.  </li>
            <li> Especially since it is Non-staining, and has little or no scent - yet lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A Little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with other oils--jojoba if I want to dilute it a bit,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having skin problems, this may help, but you also may need to adjust other habits (diet, exercise, etc.).</li>
            <li> It is neutral or smells like other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> (Not sure how to describe it, I just have some white spots)</li>
            <li> but just seemed like any other oil to us.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s the middle of summer, I substituted this for my usual night cream, which is heavier.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> and like I said, I mix it with other products.</li>
            <li> Clears up skin in only a few days!</li>
            <li> In the summer, it was maybe every other day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other Tamanu oil products, but I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your money on other product .Highly</li>
            <li> Other products, including some other oils, make it very difficult to apply makeup smoothly, but the tamanu oil seems to act like a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little of this oil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have noticed I&#x27;m healing beautifully due to this product.</li>
            <li> I had this same issue with one other brand that I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on the affected area twice daily and noticed improvement within days.  </li>
            <li> Although the bottle is small, I use it daily and can get any where from 3-4 mo on just one bottle.     </li>
            <li> I have taken to applying it to other sun-damaged areas of my neck, face and arms.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils-</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I prefer my other odorless products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This oil was not only pure, but also cold pressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle for healing active breakouts, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but it does make scars heal faster and reduces redness.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but it really isn&#x27;t a bad scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks now along with a few drops of another essential oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I usually have dry spots on my chin, using this method the dry spots are gone!</li>
            <li> Oil not so much - hard to pour out, and use, and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything any differently than any other oil we already had around the house.  </li>
            <li> I had two huge painful cystic pimples on my chin and within 24hrs of use they were gone.</li>
            <li> I ran across this oil and finally decided to try it after some pretty bad acne scars.</li>
            <li> She has a few &#x27;hot spots&#x27; that have flared up and giving us a difficult time.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years my hairline has receded, and being a female, I was beyond devastated.</li>
            <li> The oil is changing color and turning into dark shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lessening of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> a dark spot is soon to follow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to have found something natural verse using steroid creams that make the skin so thin.</li>
            <li> Skin type: acne prone, sensitive, irritating and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see down the road</li>
            <li> any other improvements to come with my hair &amp; skin!  </li>
            <li> I started adding this Tamanu oil to help fade the scars on my face due to acne, when I realized it also helps fight the acne!</li>
            <li> I mix it with a few other oils to moisturise my face.</li>
            <li> My skin now tends to show only a very small patch of oily skin around 3.00 - 4:30 pm.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily so I only use a very small amount with a SPF moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is calmer and less irritated, and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Will reorder as soon as it&#x27;s half done.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a slight difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it alone because it&#x27;s slightly drying all by itself.</li>
            <li> I had printed previous reviews so my sister could read them also</li>
            <li> The inflamed skin around the scar is also less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I had edited my review to reflect the fact that the black rubber lid had \\&quot;melted\\&quot; into the oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tamanu oil has a slightly unattractive smell.</li>
            <li> Skin breaks out less and stays hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have less shine and an even tone, while my friend has moisturized skin all day, smoother texture and evened tone.  </li>
            <li> My hair appears to be a bit fuller already and has much less frizz.  </li>
            <li> Also the rubber from the dropper disintegrated into the oil after it reached about half</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for anyone who has troubled skin.</li>
            <li> I refuse to go down that dreaded road of harsh chemicals and pills from a physician.</li>
            <li> My skin is less angry, very soft and my scars are fading.</li>
            <li> It has a little smell but not to bad it desapates really quick.</li>
            <li> The smell takes getting used to but the result on my skin outweighs the burden of a little nutty smell. 😀</li>
            <li> Just got it today and put a little on my hand</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for little over a month.  </li>
            <li> and I use a little</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I put the mixture in a little dropper bottle, but before that I would use about 2 drops of Tamanu and 3 drops of hemp seed oil in my hand and would massage it into my face and neck.</li>
            <li> but my search stopped when I happened upon this little gem.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a nutty smell but goes away after a little while.</li>
            <li> There was no significant difference after using product</li>
            <li> but I am beyond passionate about this product and hate to keep such an amazing secret, secret!</li>
            <li> I wish I had this a few years ago but in a month your skin will legit look like a VS Model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a night-time moisturizer for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I have been using a few drops on my face after my retinol moisturizer every night</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a bid difference in the redness and uneven skin gone on my face.</li>
            <li> I had bought a bottle and misplaced it</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my moisturizer</li>
            <li> use it every day in the morning after having washed, dried and moisturized my face.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this oil almost everyday</li>
            <li> Used it everyday with camillia oil.</li>
            <li> I even threw a few drops into the bathtub to soften up my skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, on a cotton round pad, I add a 2 drops of Tamanu Oil, 2 drops of Jojoba oil &amp; 2 drops of Peppermint Oil.  </li>
            <li> Every time I change the dressing, I put a few drops on along with the bacitracin and it seems to have accelerated the healing process.</li>
            <li> At night, I combine a few drops of this with a few drops of marula oil.</li>
            <li> I use Tamanu oil every day mixing up with a couple of drops of Frankincense oil instead of everyday cream.</li>
            <li> It has also helped with less breakage after I have bleached ends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the product and find the dark marks on my face seem to be slowly fading after a few weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> I been having some skin issues for the past few months.</li>
            <li> Even though I have a few small pimples my skin is evening out.</li>
            <li> the only thing I could say that is weird is that it does smell a little like curry.</li>
            <li> I do this after an exfoliating yogurt and honey mask that gets washed off (I use organic nonfat yogurt and raw organic</li>
            <li> It seems to help my eyebrows grow a little thicker!</li>
            <li> I use a small amount on all of my problem areas morning and night, after applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I was putting the lid back on, it broke.</li>
            <li> It does not feel oily at all and the small acne bumps on my forehead have all disappeared.</li>
            <li> The smell is something I just can&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li> I apply 2 times a day just a small drop to&lt;br /&gt;needed</li>
            <li> (Use small amount, avoid roots)</li>
            <li> I see a small change in the color.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful--very healing for small wounds.</li>
            <li> I use it every night for the past 3 months and since using it my skin has cleared up and the scarring has faded dramatically.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this oil.</li>
            <li> I dabbed oil on a small breakout area and literally after a few hours (re-applying every other hour or so) began to notice dramatic reduction in the size and redness.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t all that bad and tones down shortly.  </li>
            <li> I used this as an addition to a jojoba base oil as well as essential oils to treat my oily skin and created a moisturizer for my friend&#x27;s insanely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had acne that&#x27;s been hard to deal with for years now and</li>
            <li> My scar is hardly noticeable now</li>
            <li> This oil has reduced redness and inflammation and decreased the size of his pimples, sometime as little as overnight.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little confused..</li>
            <li> I do this at least 3 times per week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually grown over a quarter inch after cutting it 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Overall this was a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> but I know it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does not leave a heavy residue behind.  </li>
            <li> Slowly</li>
            <li> This oil is a thick consistency, with an earthy smell.  </li>
            <li> My acne scars are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> Over this year, I suffered the worse breakout that I&#x27;ve had in the past six years.</li>
            <li> My daughter was born with a serious skin condition and I bought this oil to use in her home made soap and sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t too bad before - occasional breakouts on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not do my research before hand and wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in my chin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; (under the skin acne) and my skin is stupid soft.    </li>
            <li> I am still recovering from scars due to those nasty breakouts, but I can definitely see that they have faded a bit</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything and its very thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> I also use it on scarred areas of my legs and it has decreased the appearance of the scar.  </li>
            <li> my friends are going to be asking what my secret is to prevent wrinkles..</li>
            <li> The smell was not as bad as what other people have said.</li>
            <li> It seriously works!</li>
            <li> After two weeks I saw dramatic results with my acne scars.</li>
            <li> If the oil doesn&#x27;t harden when cold, it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> This left nasty marks</li>
            <li> Got my bottle with the seal broken and a piece of the bottle cracked on the side by the label!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this oil just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> Ill always have this stocked in my house or when I go on vacation .</li>
            <li> Well here i am 20 years later and BAM I woke up to that horrible face of acne.</li>
            <li> Having always suffered from acne, it became increasingly difficult to deal with breakouts into my mid-late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had an awful acne flare up, and this calmed it down.</li>
            <li> Takes the dirty and still keeps it moisurize</li>
            <li> So sad!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why: As soon as I made my 3 star review, the company contacted me and told me that they were very sorry the product did not work out for me</li>
            <li> I had a bad breakout and this cleared it up in about 3 or 4 days</li>
            <li> I suffer from it on my hands, and at times when the itch gets so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll edit this review if I can get a non cracked bottle :(</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed with the shipping,  my package was torn and the cap was cracked</li>
            <li> I encourage you to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> He is has awful psoriasis on both knees.</li>
            <li> my wife received a terrible steam burn .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this oil! Great consistency, great smell, and it makes my skin so soft!  The oil absorbs very quickly, non-sticky. I also love that it&#x27;s in a glass bottle, which preserve the quality of the unfiltered oil. Great customer service,Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like this product. My skin started feeling soft after the first use itself.Breakouts started to disappear after 2 weeks. My skin looks now younger and softer. Great One! Will absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my kids after reading that Tamanu Oil helps eczema. The oil arrived extremely quick and after a few days the eczema was noticeably better. I&#x27;m to have found something natural verse using steroid creams that make the skin so thin. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way and the dropper makes it easy to apply to the skin without making a mess. Defiantly will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I started using pumpkin seed oil to cleanse my face and it ended up making me breakout. This left nasty marks and I had read a few things about Tamanu oil being able to reduce scars. It seriously works! I have been using it for about a month and it had drastically reduced redness and the amount I breakout. I love that it comes with a dropper which makes it so easy to get out and not waste any product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I put it on each night before I go to bed and it clears up my scars caused by acne while also helping to reduce acne! It brightens my skin leaving it glowing. I am so glad I found this product it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> I have this oil for about a week. It&#x27;s great when skin is really dry. It doesn&#x27;t have a dispenser, so I&#x27;m using small glass pipette (to avoid germs), it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell. I believe that this is the biggest disadvantage. Now I can only say that it helped me on my healing places after acne. We&#x27;ll see what will happen next.</li>
            <li> Skin type: acne prone, sensitive, irritating and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kid you not when I say that this oil has SAVED MY SKIN. Guys, I&#x27;ve literally only had this for THREE days and my acne is dissolved and my scars are already fading:) I could cry tears of joy because I no longer have to hide behind makeup. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to any teenagers looking for acne products bc I wish I had this a few years ago but in a month your skin will legit look like a VS Model. ITS A MIRACLE💕</li>
            <li> I love this product! With in a couple days I see a lot of improvement wherever I apply it. I use it for acne &amp; for dry skin on my joints! Lotions have never helped or worked for me but this oil did!</li>
            <li> I loved the oil. I like to mix with jojoba oil. I mostly use it at night. I think it would be okay for the day as well but I like to use an spf moisturizer. I felt like my skin looked healthier even after only about 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I accidently stumbled across this oil and am so glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using it for the last couple days and have seen an improvement in the fine lines on my face. Product was delivered on time and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Will definitely be purchasing Tamanu Oil from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin which was getting dry and irritated, causing more breakouts because of the harsh winter we&#x27;ve experienced. While looking for natural moisturizers, I came across Tamanu oil and read about its various benefits. This oil was not only pure, but also cold pressed. Additionally, the price was reasonable. I&#x27;ve been using it as a night-time moisturizer for a few months now. It is viscous, yellow-ish in color and has a strong scent (which I do not find offensive). It was absolutely fantastic! I use it in conjunction with other oils--jojoba if I want to dilute it a bit, etc. I am glad I found this product. Will buy again when.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this because I&#x27;ve read that it has healing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve mixed it with tea tree oil and castor oil to make an oil cleanser which I use every night in the shower.  I do this after an exfoliating yogurt and honey mask that gets washed off (I use organic nonfat yogurt and raw organic honey).&lt;br /&gt;So far this has helped to rid my skin of black heads and pull white heads out, making what was once bumpy skin now smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;So this has shown great results for the last two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nga P. Pham.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin. I often break out around my mouth and chin, but even the most gentle, natural spot treatments irritate my skin and make the area look worse. This stuff has really helped heal my skin. I use a small amount on all of my problem areas morning and night, after applying moisturizer. I still get bumps and clogged pores, but the tamanu oil prevents them from becoming inflamed. Often, they disappear overnight. I apply it under my eyes as well, but can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s doing anything for my fine lines. It did make my skin itch slightly the first few times I used it, but it didn&#x27;t cause redness or obvious irritation so I continued to use it.</li>
            <li> Came across this in my search for lotions and oils that I could use to help treat my daughters eczema. She has a few &#x27;hot spots&#x27; that have flared up and giving us a difficult time. This hasn&#x27;t cured it, but it certainly helps to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic product, I saw dramatic improvement for a variety of skin ailments within our family. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my skin, and the oil has for the most part worked really well. I would recommend this product, but it&#x27;s not a cure all in and of itself. If you&#x27;re having skin problems, this may help, but you also may need to adjust other habits (diet, exercise, etc.).</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!!!! I have tried many Tamanu oils and hands down my skin loves this oil. I use it at night before I go to bed and my skin looks great in the morning. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> My daughter was born with a serious skin condition and I bought this oil to use in her home made soap and sugar scrubs. So far I am very pleased with this oil and the results.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. The only problems I had was after the first time I opened it, the inner part of the cap fell out which made it to where it had no seal. I had to transfer all of it to a different container. Great product, cheap container</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Superior to any other Tamanu oil that I have used. I recommend strongly this particular brand</li>
            <li> I found out about this oil on pinterest so I decided to try it. I received it on time and I started using it that night. I have an oily skin but this product made my skin feel very matte. I really love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff makes my skin smooth soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It smells a bit earthy but dissipates quickly. I have been using a few drops on my face after my retinol moisturizer every night and I have noticed a bid difference in the redness and uneven skin gone on my face. Great brand, excellent packaging and service.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is very good for treating many skin conditions. But be careful not get it into your eyes because it stings. Overall it&#x27;s a good size for first time buyers to try, but you can get same quality at cheaper price if you search around. Definitely recommend getting cold-pressed and unrefined tamanu oil to use versus refined.</li>
            <li> Product works great.  The package arrived ahead of time. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way. Love to mix it with sweet almond oil for my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> still using this product very slowly, it helps with the itch but do not help the real problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> So sad! Got my bottle with the seal broken and a piece of the bottle cracked on the side by the label! I was so excited to try this. I hope I can get a bottle with it not broken. I&#x27;ll edit this review if I can get a non cracked bottle :(</li>
            <li> The smell is funky but, man this stuff works!  I had bought a bottle and misplaced it, I knew I wanted more so, I bought another bottle and added it to my homemade body butters, this stuff is amazing!  It heals quite nicely!</li>
            <li> I make my own hand balm and this was a good addition.  I was a little hesitant based on other reviews and the scent, but the scent is not offensive or strong.  It is neutral or smells like other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have heard so many good things about Tamanu oil.  I have been using it for several weeks now and i like the results.  I use it primarily as a moisturizer on my face.  I add a few drops to my moisturizer and I use it at night and sometimes in the morning. So far so good.  I was worried that I might have a reaction to the oil because i have sensitive skin, but i haven&#x27;t. I have even used it straight and I haven&#x27;t had a problem.  Some people have mentioned that it smells &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;.  It does, but you get used it.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Had great results! Wish it came with a dropper though.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the Castor Oil after hearing about Tamanu Oil from a friend. She had let me borrow it for my skin and it showed great results.&lt;br /&gt;The organic castor oil was amazing as it helped promote hair growth on my eyelashes and eyebrows. As for the Tamanu Oil, it really helped with my psoriasis and I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shipment was processed and shipped out on time and their customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> My headline says it all! After years of adult acne my flare ups have miraculously disappeared. On occasions when I feel a little pimple would come up I would put this oil before bed and like magic the pimple disappears in the morning. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this product. The smell takes getting used to but the result on my skin outweighs the burden of a little nutty smell. 😀</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve only used this once so far...but I have to talk about the customer service. When I got my product, I used it right away. Unfortunately, when I was putting the lid back on, it broke. Like it dissolved in my hand. I e-mailed the company (with picture included) to FYI about their lid. They sent me a new bottle immediatly and refunded my account. WOW! How cool are they?! Thank you SO much and I really appreciate your customer service. By the way, after using the product only once, at the end of the day I noticed an improvement on my face. I&#x27;m excited to see what it will do with longer use. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for the past few weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin. I apply it to patches of skin that is different pigment.  (Not sure how to describe it, I just have some white spots) It took several days for it to work but Yay, they&#x27;re gone. I&#x27;ve been trying it on blemishes after washing my face and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet. Smells like &#x27;plant&#x27; when you first apply but then you can&#x27;t smell it-doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading rave reviews online. It is everything and more. Best thing I have ever used on my face. Used it at the beach on sunburned cheeks and was 100% gone by morning! I use it every night and will continue to!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, the other brand I had been using was sold out so I tried this instead. The quality is superb, far better than what I was using previously. I use this along with castor oil and grapeseed oil in my oil cleansing blend. Would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I selected this product because I was looking for a natural, healing oil for my face at night and had read positive things about Tamanu Oil.  I use the product every other day or so, and am pleased with the results.  I have combination skin, dry in some areas and normal in others and this helps balance everything out.  It has a distinct smell that takes a little bit of time to get used to, but I still appreciate the product for it&#x27;s purpose.  -WhitneyF</li>
            <li> Customer service was great. Oil not so much - hard to pour out, and use, and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything any differently than any other oil we already had around the house.  Was impressed with company, their concern for our gripes, etc - but just seemed like any other oil to us.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil! I have been dealing with hormonal acne and the scaring that comes with it for two years now. I just started using this oil a week ago and it has already made a huge improvement in my skin! Scarring is fading and acne is leaving! Nothing else has worked but this oil. The texture of my skin is also improving! The review the lady posted about wetting your face first was a huge help as well, it helps to smooth the oil on your face evenly. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The order arrived promptly and intact. I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> It smells like really strong Tea Tree Oil, but this Tamanu Oil helped my dry and cracked elbows and my itchy scalp. I would recommend this to friends, who suffer from similar ailments.</li>
            <li> Love the oil and the customer service is outstanding. Angie G.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It has already started clearing up my skin rash along my hair line.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin that tends to break out around the chin and jawline, and I am sensitive to many skin care products. My facialist recommended this product as a way to deal with chronically irritated skin. So far I&#x27;ve had great results! My skin is calmer and less irritated, and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my breakouts. Since it&#x27;s the middle of summer, I substituted this for my usual night cream, which is heavier. I use only 1 drop and spread it around my face with my fingertips, then rub the rest into my palms and press against my face. It&#x27;s important to just apply a small amount because otherwise it will feel greasy and not absorb. It does have a strange smell that will not appeal to everyone. It smells very nutty and earthy, kind of like butterscotch but not as sweet. If you&#x27;re bothered by this you can mix it with another product or add it to a carrier oil. Overall I&#x27;ve loved it and am looking forward to incorporating it into my long term skin care regimen, although I may go back to a traditional night cream once the weather gets cold again.</li>
            <li> I mix a drop with my moisturizer before bedtime. In the morning my skin is improved. Any dirt and grime that have been clogging pores are brought to the surface.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Works wonders on your skin. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this oil just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I developed tons of black heads after using it for about 10 days. I was excited for the good results, but I received the opposite. :(  It&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s not good oil, it just isn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils (almond, coconut, olive), but THIS ONE , I could see the difference in inflammation on my face, &amp; the difference the day after I put it on (night prior). Would definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;-Rosaliny M.</li>
            <li> This product is Great!! Exactly as described. Shipping was quick and easy. I used it for my exzema patches and it works great.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews and I must agree, this oil is pretty wonderful. I have been using it daily instead of moisturizer and it works really well at fading acne scars. It does have a natural earthy scent but it fades pretty quickly especially if you are heading out into fresh air.</li>
            <li> Working with various oil, I found this oil to be very good.  Great for healing dry scaling skin and reducing nail fungus.</li>
            <li> The product arrived packaged well and on time.  I use it as a carrier oil for different essential oils.  I purchased it initially to use it for scarring.  I loved the way it felt and also ended up using it in my hair and on my face.  I used different essential oils depending on what/where I was using it.  It works great!  I have also begun making my own lotions and soap and have incorporated this oil in my new mixtures.  I will buy this oil again.&lt;br /&gt;Ivy J.</li>
            <li> I love the oil and use it mixed in with my homemade lotion. To me it has a nutty smell to it, I like that. Would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Sarah B</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil as a gift for my father for Christmas.He is has awful psoriasis on both knees. He used this oil in the past and on his left knee the psoriasis is completely healed. He ran out so I then purchased this  product. As of today he states the skin is looking better on his knee and the itching is completely gone and this is with him not using it consistently as he should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service with this company has impressed me with a kind follow up email and then even a follow up call. I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;If my dad remembers to send me the pictures I will post before and after photos.</li>
            <li> Since it absorbs so quickly, I mix it with acne medicine in the morning and at night which helps the medication sink in to my skin. Seems to help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils for my face and neck. For many years the back of one of my ears has sort of kept something like eczema. It would heal and a few days later come back. This oil has taken care of the problem. I just ordered a bottle for my sister to try because she has the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very oily but once you learn how to use it works really good. I put a little on my hands at night and wet with water and rub it in and then dry my hands and enough is still on.  I&#x27;m 68 and I can see an improvement in my skin...not a miracle wrinkle remover, but I can tell a difference. I have been using it for about a month and like I said, I mix it with other products.</li>
            <li> I enjoy tamanu oil, I  sue it for my toe infection . my wife received a terrible steam burn . After applying this oil her skin  it does not looked sacred or damaged. So here are two proven cases that it is what it says.. Ill always have this stocked in my house or when I go on vacation . thank you</li>
            <li> I had an extremely painful sunburn on most of my upper body because I forgot to put on sunblock before garden for about 8 hours. I looked up sunburn remedies and that&#x27;s how I discovered tamanu oil, which people praised like a miracle product. Since it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, I wanted to try it and I have to say it really made a difference. I have very sensitive skin; when I get a burn or a cut, the scar stays for years. I currently have two minor oven burns that are 3 years old. But the day after I applied the tamanu oil to my sunburn, it barely hurt when, just the day prior, I was wincing with every movement of my arms, every time my shirt shifted slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of a strong, wood smell, but nothing I really mind and I&#x27;m sure nothing that another person can smell on you. It&#x27;s a dark green color, like olive oil, and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving an oily residue. I&#x27;ve read about a lot of sellers on sites like this selling fake tamanu oil, but this one appears to be authentic and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil to help lighten some dark, &#x27;sun spots&#x27; on my upper chest.  They do seem to be lightening.  That&#x27;s good, but i recently read that this oil is very good for inflammation so i mixed it with some YL Mountain Savory that can irritate my skin by itself. I have been rubbing it into my lower back everyday for about a week now and am pleased with the results.  I would get this oil again.</li>
            <li> Have only used on my toes for a month.  No results yet but I know it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It works very well as a carrier oil for my natural face serums and it has been thoroughly researched and has been found to heal damaged skin, treat scarring, stretch marks, minor cuts and burns, abrasions, rashes, sores, dry skin, eczema, etc.  Tamanu oil is employed by Polynesian women for promoting healthy, clear, blemish-free skin, and is also used on babies to prevent diaper rash and skin eruptions. I would highly recommend this product to mix with your favorite essential oils or use on its own. I look forward to buying this again.</li>
            <li> I heard about Tamanu Oil in a Youtube video and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day in the morning after having washed, dried and moisturized my face. Opposed to what the video says, I am actually massaging it into my skin. I love the walnut fragrance that dissipates quickly after having it applied. The oil absorbs very quickly into your skin and gives it a nice glow, not oily at all. I find that my overall complexion is dewier and my skin is softer. So far (but having it used only for 2 weeks) I cannot say that my brown spots have improved, but I am also not expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;Skin care should be fun and make you feel good, but one should not expect miracles - that is at least my personal philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to the kind and most helpful staff at Cammile Q for shipping the oil so quickly. I will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks now along with a few drops of another essential oil as a moisturizer.  I love it.  The smell is a bit earthy but once it&#x27;s on my skin, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.  It does not feel oily at all and the small acne bumps on my forehead have all disappeared. I will definitely purchase this oil again.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! This stuff is amazing. Just got it today and put a little on my hand and oh my. My hand feels like silk! It has a nice glow. Will reorder as soon as it&#x27;s half done.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny.  This has helped my skin so much.  I also made a serum out of this to help with scars on my son&#x27;s leg from a dog bite attack, and they are fading.  I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Used the product to help with Shingles blisters.  It was quite effective.  I would re-order again if necessary and definately recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Tamanu Oil. I purchased it after hearing how it has worked for hair growth in others. Over the past few years my hairline has receded, and being a female, I was beyond devastated. I spent days searching online for ways to restore my hairline, and Tamanu Oil kept coming up. found Cammile Q and I&#x27;m glad I did. I received my bottle in 2 days and started using it right away. The quality is exceptional. It has a very slight scent which is pleasant, washes out easily the next morning,  and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like others oils I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or so and I&#x27;m definitely seeing new hair growth. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how happy this makes me. For anyone using this oil to restore hair growth, don&#x27;t expect results over night. It will take time and you MUST use it every day to see results. Twice a day for best results from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a few drops along my entire hairline twice per day. I spend a couple of minutes gently rubbing it into my scalp to ensure proper absorption. I also do the inversion method after applying Tamanu Oil. The inversion method is where you apply the oil to the areas where your hair is thinning, bend forward at the waist so your head is upside down, and massage your entire scalp for 5-10 minutes. I do this at least 3 times per week. Not only is my hair growing back in the balding spots, but my hair is growing super fast. It&#x27;s actually grown over a quarter inch after cutting it 2 weeks ago. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Great for your face. Clears up skin in only a few days!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Makes my skin so soft and deeply moisturizes my skin, it seems to be minimizing my fine lines..... I put it on before I go to bed every night.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it each morning and have seen a definite improvement in my complexion. I use on my face and neck under my makeup with great results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Tamanu oil for 3 days and I can tell a slight difference in my skin. With continued use I am hoping to reap the raved about benefits of this oil. I think the smell is pleasant and woodsy. I was slightly disappointed with the shipping,  my package was torn and the cap was cracked but it didn&#x27;t seem to leak. I gave 4 stars until I can give a better review after continued use!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I noticed results in my skin within a day.  I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s with fair, sensitive skin and it makes my skin looks more refreshed, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore.  My husband even looked at me differently and said my face looked good (my husband NEVER notices this kind of thing, so it was a shock).  I recommended it to a friend who&#x27;s in her mid 50&#x27;s with darker normal skin and she was surprised to notice a difference as well.  Then HER husband who had been working out of town said she her face  looked like she&#x27;d been sleeping better without him, and he never notices this kind of thing either.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again when this bottle runs out.  I cannot use it alone because it&#x27;s slightly drying all by itself.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I read that it is a natural sunscreen.  I now use this with some of my essential oils as a &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34; and natural &amp;#34;sunscreen.&amp;#34;  Seems to do the trick wonderfully and my skin really likes it!  The smell isn&#x27;t ideal but it&#x27;s not bad either.  Nothing that can&#x27;t be masked with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by an aesthetician for dry scaly patches around my forehead hair line.  Within two weeks, the itching was gone and the patches completely cleared up.  I am thrilled to have discovered it.  When I placed my order, there were many different manufacturers and retailers to choose from.  I was very impressed at the fast, efficient service I received from Cammile Q, as well as a follow up inquiry to be sure I was satisfied with this product.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Someone recomended it to me on facebook after I posted a status about scars. I do think it has helped some along with some vitamin d3 gummies I have been taking. I use it every night for my acne and scars. It dries your skin kind out which is wierd because it&#x27;s an oil. But it is great for drying up bumps overnight. Sometimes I even use it under my makeup. I never get cystic acne anymore. That&#x27;s a blessing! The product arrived on time and the seller is great! Will be buying again :)</li>
            <li> The smell is something I just can&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li> My face used too get dry all the time. I used to get ingrown hairs on my face all the time.because of my dry skin. I tried different moisturizers but my face would breakout almost immediately. I did some research and discovered tamanu oil might do the trick. Then I found this brand with the best price to review ratio. Ive had it for months and the oil penetrates deep without breaking my skin out. after shaving my hair grows without becoming ingrown. And the moisture lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are minute issues like needing to wet your face first because the oil is a little thick. Also because it moisturizes so well I sometimes forget to put some on my face.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to update this product review. I bought this in February of this year; it&#x27;s now October and I&#x27;m finally running out. I use a couple of drops every day now that it&#x27;s getting colder. In the summer, it was maybe every other day. It is fantastic - I come back to it over and over. I truly believe it has healed my skin from acne and brown (aging) spots. I love it so much!! Now loading up on more for the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;great, thick oil, with a bit of a nutty, curry smell, which is pleasant. good for overnight or super dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for your skin. I bought it for my boyfriend to use for his acne. He&#x27;s had acne that&#x27;s been hard to deal with for years now and his face nearly cleared up right away while using this. Twice a day he takes a dab and rubs it in and leaves it on. His skin is clearer and looks a lot more healthy overall and he plans on continuing the treatment. Even I am using it now as well~</li>
            <li> Love it! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Tamanu oil for a couple months now and it has great improved my acne. I use it mainly as a spot treatment. My husband has also used the oil on his shingles and says that it really helps the itching pain.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a box and bubble wrapped very securely.</li>
            <li> Yes! I love this oil.  It made my skin of my face feel tighter and smoother.  A Little goes a long way.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> It actually helped heal some of my scars after I had done a chemical peel. It smelled earthy and arrived perfectly on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil a few months ago to help treat my ATROPHIC acne scars on my face (not just red marks). I have been applying this oil almost everyday however I have not seen any improvements. I still have hope that it may work and so I will keep applying. I am giving this product three stars for now since I see no change in my skin. I will change it again if I see changes/see no improvement. EDIT: I have changed my original 3 star rating to 5 stars. Here&#x27;s why: As soon as I made my 3 star review, the company contacted me and told me that they were very sorry the product did not work out for me (I wouldn&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work out - it just hasn&#x27;t worked yet.) They had already issued me a refund by the time they sent the email. So why five stars?  I believe this is a quality product. I don&#x27;t know whether it will work for me if I continue to use it. I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you. All I know is the generosity of this company and that they genuinely believe that their product is high enough quality that they back it with a guarantee. If you are set out to buy a good oil and you are comparing this with another brand, just go with this one. Either you&#x27;ll love it, or you&#x27;ll get your money back.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, really nice. great for many uses. Skin care too.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for about a week on my face. It seems to have cleared up my acne. I&#x27;m going to order some for my teenage girls to try. Great stuff. Tina S.</li>
            <li> Excellent. The bottle top broke on my shipment and the seller immediately sent out a new bottle and I received it the next day. Also loved the oil. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin in.a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong smell at first, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell. I used a q-tip to apply it on the spots where I have eczema once in the morning and once at night and I noticed s difference by the second day. My active eczema didn&#x27;t go away, but I noticed the scars definitely got lighter. I wouldn&#x27;t say it heals skin problems, but it definitely improves the appearance of them.</li>
            <li> I received this order super fast, thanks Amazon Prime. It&#x27;s only been two days of twice a day use and I&#x27;m blown away. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and have had an issue with acne since a teen. As an adult it is pretty mild and definitely hormonal. I have sensitive african american oily skin. When I tell you nothing has EVER made my skin look and feel like this, I tell you the truth and I have used it all. I was currently on retin-a but stopped to see how this would do. I had two huge painful cystic pimples on my chin and within 24hrs of use they were gone. I use after a mild cleanser (phisoderm) and rub all over my face, neck and chest with my finger. Definitely an oil but it absorbs so fast and leaves your face soft not greasy.  I&#x27;ll update in a month but I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this tamanu oil every day on my face. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for my acneic skin and has dramatically reduced my dark spots. It has also helped with stretch marks and scarring on the rest of my body. If you&#x27;re at all interested in skin care oils I definitely recommend trying tamanu!&lt;br /&gt;-Michelle M.</li>
            <li> This is an oil that I have used minimally.  I like it because it does not leave a heavy residue behind.  I use this as a carrier oil with my essential oils.  It feels like it allows the EO to carry deeper into the body/skin.</li>
            <li> Used it everyday with camillia oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with jojoba, lavender, and frankincense oils as a facial blend to use in the mornings and before bed. So far I&#x27;ve found the combination to be helpful in clearing my skin, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me look any brighter or younger or however you&#x27;d want to call it. I think it&#x27;s worth trying out, though, as this facial blend is the first thing that&#x27;s helped after countless other more expensive solutions that failed.</li>
            <li> Good, small bottle good travel size. I think it really works.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Absorbs into the skin very quickly, without shine/grease.  I like the smell.  Keep it away from your eye because it may irritate it.  Happened to me overnight, but a light rinse in the morning fixed it right away.  Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil as a possible solution to my hair loss along my hair line. Be warned the smell is quite strong so I wouldn&#x27;t use a whole lot of it.  My mom is going to try it on her skin for age spots so I&#x27;ll update this review after her experience with it.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> This oil worked great in the beginning. My skin looked great,  almost glowing even. It has a natural, woodsy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after about a month of using it daily,  I started getting a rash all over my face so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for my face!</li>
            <li> I really love the packaging of this product; the bottles really cute. and it works great too. I mix it with a few other oils to moisturise my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has soften my laugh lines and has helped with lightening my scars! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;Sara L.</li>
            <li> I researched for a while about the benefits of tamanu oil. I&#x27;m always looking for natural solutions for my adult acne and acne scars. I feel that this product does what it claims to do. The way I use it is mixed in coconut oil with a mixture of tea tree oil, lavender, and frankinscince. Within the first week my hormonal acne along my jaw line had improved a good deal with lightening of acne marks. These oils are also good for wrinkles. The only drawback is the smell isn&#x27;t my fave. 😖Carla C.</li>
            <li> Good for curly &amp; dry hair. I use it with a dropper to make sure I don&#x27;t make my hair look / feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its helped define my curls &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil by Cammile Q is my top favorite!!! I been having some skin issues for the past few months.I refuse to go down that dreaded road of harsh chemicals and pills from a physician. I been there done that when i was 20. Well here i am 20 years later and BAM I woke up to that horrible face of acne. I have been doing the OCM. My blend is Hemp Seed oil with Tamanu. For me this has worked wonders. I use this as my night moisturizer as well. My skin is less angry, very soft and my scars are fading. A little goes a very long way. I do wish they offered this in larger sizes. I use this in all my homemade beauty products from head to toe. I have recommended this to family and several friends. I encourage you to give it a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it after my retina A and it softens and smoothes my skin.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. The smell was not as bad as what other people have said. It&#x27;s just very nutty. I found it to be comforting, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my mom. This is a great oil!</li>
            <li> I previously ordered two my first time because I read so many positive printed reviews. One for me and one for my sister. We both found this product to be very beneficial for us. I had printed previous reviews so my sister could read them also and 99% were positive and both of us agreed. The reviews were the reason I wanted to try this product. There was one that said to use water to help spread the oil. The water helps so much in the application of the oil. The only thing I would add is that once you apply the oil, wipe your hands with a paper towel (wiping your hands gets rid of excess oil) and apply more water. Wait about 3-5 minutes after applying the oil. Skin should feel silky smooth with no oily residue. If your skin continues to feel oily, you put too much oil on your first application. Continue to wipe your hands and apply more water. This will leave your skin silky smooth. I tend to have oily skin. My skin now tends to show only a very small patch of oily skin around 3.00 - 4:30 pm. Product really does work on scars. My sister and I were so pleased with this amazing product that I placed another order of two. Once again I received great service, Received my order within days. I will continue to place orders with Brennas. Caroline H</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it is high quality and works very well The company has great customer service.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It feels great on my skin and hair. You don&#x27;t need much to apply to your face, just a few tiny drops should suffice. So far I haven&#x27;t had any acne outbreaks and I happen to like the smell and the texture of the oil. I haven&#x27;t tried any other Tamanu oil products, but I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> If I were putting this anywhere but my face, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t mind. For a face oil, though, the smell is overpowering. It&#x27;s not exactly a bad smell, but it is a very sharp, earthy smell. I can&#x27;t sleep if I put this on my face before bed. I do have a very strong sense of smell, so this may not bother everyone. It does make my skin soft but after several days it is not a miracle worker (I put a few drops on my face once/day). Maybe with a few drops of a nice smelling essential oil it would be better.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best  !  I highly recommended for skin problems even for lips works great.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle.It has done wonders on my skin my skin has got so brighter and beautiful with product.Don&#x27;t waster your money on other product .Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great packaging and wonderful product. Very happy with it</li>
            <li> I made my first oil blend and wanted to add a booster and tamanu oil was perfect for my skin. To give a try I started my search for a nice brand which I could trust. After reading various reviews on amazon and other websites I found this one and it was exactly what I was looking for, 100% pure and cold pressed. My skin has been loving it. I use it twice a day and its amazing for my oily skin keeping it soft and supple and still oil free. Now its been close to a month since I have been using it and my skin has been so happy about it.</li>
            <li> Great oil! Love using it in my skin care concoctions!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night for a month now, and my skin is SO much smoother. It&#x27;s not a miracle for healing active breakouts, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but it does make scars heal faster and reduces redness. Try alternating with 100% organic aloe for extra magical healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that I can use it in the morning under my makeup (either bobbi brown foundation or cover girl bb cream, for reference). Other products, including some other oils, make it very difficult to apply makeup smoothly, but the tamanu oil seems to act like a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little funky, but you can&#x27;t really complain about the smell of a natural oil...</li>
            <li> I really love this brand of Tamanu Oil. I use it as part of a combination of oils for my face and is is amazingly smooth and my skin has been so much softer, better hydrated, and bright.  I was surprised to learn that Tamanu oil has a natural SPF of 20. This product was shipped quickly, and arrived well packaged. I would definitely purchase again from Cammile Q.</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil has been my answer. Being older and active as a runner, biker, and generally spending my fair share of time in the gym working out.  I was constantly fighting off attacks to my feet and other areas.  All the commercial fungal treatments were too harsh for me and only cycled through relief and wasn’t long when another outbreak would occur.  Tamanu Oil to the rescue!  After showering I use it on my toes my face, my arms, and sensitive areas especially after a long bike ride or run. I have also noticed minor abrasions heal quicker when Tamanu Oil is applied. Absorbed quickly by the skin you can use sparingly and still get good results.  I have tried other brands and other oils with the same characteristics and think this brand Cammile Q is my favorite. I personally like the earthly scent of the oil which seems to dissipate quickly.  Reminds me of a designer scent I have smelled on others before. Although I have no idea what brand it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil in a blend on my face for about three weeks, and although I can&#x27;t totally attribute the results to this product alone, knowing the properties of tamanu oil I&#x27;d expect it&#x27;s carrying its weight. After just three weeks I have seen a great improvement in dark marks left by acne. I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes, but so far it&#x27;s been a miracle for my scarring!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and use it every other day.  I have definitely noticed a positive difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  I absorbs quickly and I like the aroma. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is unique, I like the smell, it is good for dry and damaged skin, it is a good carrier for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little while, and just on my face, but already I&#x27;m seeing pores shrink, redness in the cheeks and forehead diminishing, and my skin isn&#x27;t dry and irritated anymore.  I can&#x27;t tell if any of the fine lines are diminishing, but I wasn&#x27;t really worried about it.  My skin is looking healthier and certainly feels better.  I&#x27;m going to have my sister try this for her super hyper sensitive skin, maybe it will help.  The smell is very mild and somewhat nutty, doesn&#x27;t bother me and disappears pretty quickly, but then I&#x27;m used to herbs and essential oils.  I&#x27;ve not had anyone comment on the smell, so I think I&#x27;m really the only one who can smell it.  My only complaint is now I have some half used bottles of lotions that aren&#x27;t going to get used because this works so much better!  Oh well, I can use them on my elbows I guess.  Larger bottles would be nice too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the ingredients I now (and will probably always) use for making beard oil. I have dry skin under my beard, which results in flaky beard. Eww. Who wants that?  I discovered this product, and it really helps a lot. I love it. It is basically scent-less, and it&#x27;s not to &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; but not to light either. I even threw a few drops into the bathtub to soften up my skin. I love this stuff! Especially since it is Non-staining, and has little or no scent - yet lasts all day! I recommend buying some and trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex M.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin. I read an article about the oil cleansing method (cleaning my face with QUALITY oils), and for my skin type, a tamanu/castor oil mix was recommended. I used it a few months with great results... until I began wearing bronzer and other makeup that was causing breakouts (but I began using bentonite clay on my face: liberally, under and on top of makeup, or as a touchup to get rid of the oily face look, on clean skin before bed, etc. with great results).    Then, I began including it in a hair conditioner I make myself  and my hair is SOOO FAB!!!  (Check out my profile pic on Facebook. My name is Renee Griswold from Cali). I only use natural, high quality products on my face and hair now, and this tamanu oil is a new staple in my DIY natural products. A little goes a long way! It&#x27;s not real greasy, so it&#x27;s great for hair and next, I plan to make skin care products and include this oil! The smell is different, but not bad at all... takes some getting used to (like tea tree or lavender essential oil scents), but has actually become an attractive smell to me (and again you don&#x27;t use much at a time).    I recommend this brand/product to anyone needing a high-end, quality tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil.  Wake up with soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the tamanu oil to mix together with other essential oils to make an oil based facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I use my facial cleanser in the morning and in the night and I have seen the great benefits the tamanu oil has for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely high quality tanamu oil.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped with redness and scarring of acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, hydrates my skin and hair and evens out my skin tone! I have bought this item multiple times and will continue to buy it. It really does improve my complexion! The bottle lasts a lot longer than you would think.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my son with a pretty bad psoriasis breakout that covered much of his upper body. I covered his affected areas with this oil twice per day and notice a marked improvement in just 24 hours. He was all clear within 3 days. Pretty amazing if you ask me! I wish I took pictures, but I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work as quickly as it did. I will keep this on hand to help with any mysterious skin conditions that may pop up and I like that my son did not have to use the steroid cream. Pleased customer!</li>
            <li> I been used it for 2 months ,I saw a change in 2 weeks so it really helps to have health &amp; smooth skin .</li>
            <li> The item - Tamanu Oil arrived on time and is of very good quality. Will order again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Spoorthy M</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. Love Love Love My hair hair seems softer and growing .</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.It really worked for me. My skin was rejuvenated and i noticed the fine lines  are faded and it improved my large pores as well and acne scar..I ordered another two.</li>
            <li> I really liked this. I&#x27;ve never used it before but it helped with some of my dry skin issues here in Colorado. It does smell strongly but it&#x27;s not so offensive as some reviews say. Would definitely buy again. Great seller!</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  Have been using it on a scar.</li>
            <li> I love my tamanu oil! I use it as a hair mask mixed with two tablespoons of coconut oil. I use it once and week and have noticed a huge increase in the healthiness and softness of my hair. It has also helped with less breakage after I have bleached ends! I will be trying it in my face masks after reading the other reviews :)</li>
            <li> I use it for oil cleansing and I love how it makes my face feels . Takes the dirty and still keeps it moisurize</li>
            <li> Good for all skin problems, creates new skin.  Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I.m using Tamanu oil to help remove  a  chemical burn on my face. Slowly but i see improvement. I apply 2 times a day just a small drop to&lt;br /&gt;needed area. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin.  The bottle came on time and in perfect condition.  A little of this oil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was packages well.  I use as part of my facial and I love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love it! Using with Jojoba oil and Rosehip oil as a facial cleanser for my acne. Works great so far. Very Happy with quality of product. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I purchased this before my mommy makeover. I use it twice a day for the last 2 weeks. I have noticed I&#x27;m healing beautifully due to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have been using this as a carrier for my essential oils to use on a scaly dermatitis on my face and it is really helping it heal a lot.  I also use a few drops to moisturize my face and neck and it&#x27;s wonderful for that too!  I also plan on using it for eczema when I have it when the weather changes.  I do sometimes mix it with grape seed oil if I want something lighter, but most of the time I use it full strength.  Like others have said the most important thing is to be sure your skin is wet so it will spread around easily. Michele B.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tamanu oil for a while now. This is my first time purchasing this brand. It is a good quality but it burns my eyes. I cannot put it anywhere around my eye area. I had this same issue with one other brand that I used in the past. I have been using mild chemical peels at home. Recently, I burned my skin accidentally with one of the chemical peel. It is helping my skin to recover really fast and burned mark is almost gone. Having oily skin, Tamanu oil is one of the few oils that I use on my skin, since its is so light weight and skin absorbs it quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But recently, I have notice that there are black particles in the oil. The oil is changing color and turning into dark shade. I first notice the solid black particles around the droplet but now I see it in oil. This oil was either almost expired or doesn&#x27;t have shelf life more than 2 months. If you can use the entire bottle within month or two is fine otherwise it will turn dark (blackish) and the smell will get more stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I wish I could add the picture to give more clarity.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon please add this feature to upload photo with review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/24/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller quickly contacted and informed me that the oil turned black because of dropper. The new oil is good but it has only been 2 weeks since, I have started using the newer bottle. It is too early to give my honest opinion about the shelf life but I will definitely update my review. I do really appreciate the seller and company behind it since they took care of all my issues and contacted me in the matter of no time.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, but have been using this as a day moisturizer and under my night cream. I love it. It moisturizes without oiliness. You only have to use a tiny amount so one bottle will last a long time. It also heals any breakouts. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works great as a moisturizer. Seems to be higher quality than other sources of Tamanu oil I have tried</li>
            <li> I was looking for an oil to help reduce the scarring and inflammation on the left side of my cheek.  I did some research on Tamanu oil, and I found out that Tamanu oil helps reduce inflammation.  I was happy to find this Tamanu oil on Amazon.  I use this oil twice a day (once in the morning and once at night).  I have been using this oil for little over a month.  I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.  My scar is shrinking in size and is lightening.  The inflamed skin around the scar is also less noticeable.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of products to help with the scarring on my cheek.  I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve finally found a product that is helping with my scar.</li>
            <li> Quality oil will purchase again</li>
            <li> been using for about 2 weeks and starting to see positive effects from this product. Follow directions and be patient</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday but the minute I used it I love the way it felt. It has a little smell but not to bad it desapates really quick. I also bought to tamanu soap and its really wonderful none drying.So for now I love it but I will let you know later on if it work for sunspot or pimples and I use a little and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily on the skin.wonderful oil. Well its been more then a month I&#x27;ve been useing this tamanu oil and i can say i love it. I stop useing  my other moisturizers and use the tamanu oil mornings and night.my skin is more even and i can actually see my skin healing old marks i had from sun damage i will defetnily buy again. I dont think i will be with out it.Also i stop breaking out so much and feeling a little more confident with out makeup. To the seller thank you for delievering on time wonderful service thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried Jojoba oil, coconut oil, apricot kernel oil, and hemp seed oil. I think this one is the most effective for healing scars. I have extremely sensitive skin that is both oily and dry, I get agitation bumps if I put on anything that has too many chemicals or ingredients (for this reason I have been looking for more natural alternatives to facial cleansers/healers/moisturizers.) I also have hyper-pigmentation. Currently, I have mixed this with my hemp seed oil (about 1:3 Ratio) and use it as a morning and night moisturizer. The bottle is very small, but a little goes a long way. I have been using for 2 weeks and have seen tremendous improvement to my skin and have had no breakouts. I put the mixture in a little dropper bottle, but before that I would use about 2 drops of Tamanu and 3 drops of hemp seed oil in my hand and would massage it into my face and neck. Leaves skin incredibly soft and not too oily. Highly recommend it for anyone who has troubled skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s smoothed out my skin tone, and helped blemishes heal. The only thing that I felt it did was cause my skin to flake a bit, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s just because of the healing process.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no oily residue and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Has helped fade a scar I have, which is why I bought it, but I discovered that it is an excellent way to weatherproof your hair!! (Use small amount, avoid roots)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this oil on my face since the consistency seemed a bit thick but to my surprise it was a wonderful addition to my oil cleansing method. I use a bit of it w the other essential oils I used to wash my face as I had heard of its acne-fighting properties and saw a great improvement in my breakouts. I also use it on some scars and stretch marks (which are years old) and although they have not completely disappeared there is great improvement. I use it two times a day in the morning and at night as a moisturizer after I wash my face. Very satisfied and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product I usually don&#x27;t believe in the stuff but after one week of use I had to order a second bottle because I knew it worked! I have deep scars from surgery and Acne after one week my scars have almost disappeared. This companies oil is super high-quality! If you&#x27;re going to order it, order it from them!!</li>
            <li> I recently found out about Tamanu oil and I wanted to give it a try; instead of using retail moisturizers.  Well, there are several brands on here, but I decided on this one.  Oh my, I love this oil!!!  The quality of this oil is superb!  This oil is a thick consistency, with an earthy smell.  Yet, once the Tamanu oil is applied to the skin, it is non greasy, light weight, and the smell dissipates quickly.  Only a few drops are needed.  So, on a cotton round pad, I add a 2 drops of Tamanu Oil, 2 drops of Jojoba oil &amp; 2 drops of Peppermint Oil.  (But you can mix with any carrier oil &amp; essential oil you favor.). My skin feels Amazing!  My face is so soft, moisturized, non greasy, and beautiful!  I also use Tamanu oil on my scalp and hair, and it leaves my hair very soft.  Today, I applies 2 drops onto my feet and my feet felt and looked great.  This is the only brand of Tamanu Oil that I have used and will be the only brand that I will ever buy.  Not only is this Tamanu Oil is Amazing, but their customer service is Excellent!  It is great to purchase a great product, from a company that stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> My husband was wanting this product.  We ordered, got here in record time, and he uses it daily.  He keeps it, not in the bathroom, but right next to his recliner, so he&#x27;ll remember to put it on....thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  I decided to try it to ease skin allergies.  I apply it daily to my affected skin areas.  The oil is concentrated, so I only use a few drops.  It spreads easily and absorbs quickly. There is a scent when first applied, but it soon dissipates.  I have been using for one month and have noticed marked improvement.  I have also started using it on my face,neck and hands, to address summer dryness.  Tamanu does the trick and does not leave residual oily feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone for skin irritations and dry/aging skin.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> For months I have been looking for a product to help fade my acne scars but my search stopped when I happened upon this little gem. I heard a lot of good things about this oil so I decided to give it a try and I was not disappointed. It arrived on time in perfect condition and started using it twice a day right away. After two weeks I saw dramatic results with my acne scars. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend. Worked great on Mom&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> love this product it is the best!</li>
            <li> VERY strong smell. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything and its very thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb well. I would try another brand.    UPDATE- A recommendation: do NOT put this anywhere near the eyes or on wounds/burns. It BURNS!    After doing some research I would recommend trying Tamanu oil from Polynesia as it is the highest quality. This oil is from Madagascar which explains the low quality and price. Unfortunately I did not do my research before hand and wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I love EDENS GARDEN! I have a plethora of oils now that I use for my face...moderate acne and acne scars. I am so glad that I found out about the use of oils and I hope they continue to be such a great experience. I&#x27;m an African American female with oily skin (my entire face,not just my t-zone lol)... Give EO&#x27;s a try if you have been battling acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> I just had a full hip replacement and used Tamanu Oil to reduce the scarring on my leg.  It worked!!  I will pass this on to others.  A friend in Hawaii recommended this oil and she was spot on.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and often get cystic acne.  About 2 months ago I read an article that Tamanu oil works wonders on skin.  At this point I was willing to try anything.  I also use this mixed with DoTerra Essential Oils and within 1 day I could see a difference in my skin tone.  After I wash my face I put some of the tamanu oil on a cotton ball with 2 drops of lavender, 2 drops of frankincense, and 2 drops of melaleuca oil and then just go in circular motions all over my face.  I do this morning and night.  My skin has transformed in the last 2 months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  When I&#x27;m about to have a breakout, I feel this remedy kills it.  My skin tone, fine lines, and acne have improved more than I could imagine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in learning more about DoTerra Essential Oils - you can visit my site www.mydoterra.com/seagswags.  You can purchase the 3 oils I&#x27;ve named above.</li>
            <li> To heavy to wear in the daytime,but wonderful overnight.Works great on skin on the neck.Most products won&#x27;t touch this area.I mix it with organic coconut oil for larger area&#x27;s on the body.Very happy with this product.Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t at all sure what to expect. I had read that Tamanu Oil was good for your skin and face so I decided to try it. I have used it for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the results. My skin feels amazing. I use it at night with coconut oil. In the morning my skin is soft and moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li> love the product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great oil! I&#x27;ve been using this oil for 4 days and I already see a HUGE improvement in my skin. The texture of my skin has changed in a good way! My skin is nice and smooth. Even though I have a few small pimples my skin is evening out. My acne scars are slowly disappearing. I&#x27;m also using it on an old scar I&#x27;ve had for about 9 years. I see a small change in the color. It has gotten a bit lighter, which is great in 4 days!!  As far as acne since using this it has cleared my skin a bit. I&#x27;m currently cleansing my body, which is very important.    -Smoothed my skin  -Prevented  pimples  - Lightened old scars and new blemishes  -Soft skin    LOVE IT! I need to order a new bottle ASAP!!    UPDATE!!    I just used it as a spot treatment and it reduced the size of my pimples drastically! Make sure you apply a small amount to your pimples and let it sit!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of Tamanu.  I actually have some contact dermatitis with other brands but Cammile does not seem to bother me.  I&#x27;ve noticed a lessening of dark spots.  My hands are much softer and more moisturized.  I use it daily or every other day on both face and hands.  I also use it on scarred areas of my legs and it has decreased the appearance of the scar.  Well worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> Ive only used it a few days now and because of the smell and i want an extra acne fighting method i add melaluca with this oil and a little bit of water after cleaning my face so it spreads better. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all. If you over do it your face looks and feels greasy.</li>
            <li> I needed a good face moisturizer and decided to go with this oil after having seen it on Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky so I can use it during the day. I use it both in the morning and at night. A little goes a long way. So a dab on my finger is enough. I like the smell of this too. My skin definitely likes it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about 2 months ago after my dermatologist suggested using Tamanu oil to prevent scarring from a second-degree burn I received on my arm. I put a small amount on the affected area twice daily and noticed improvement within days.  The burn healed completely after about a week without scarring.  Some hyperpigmentation remains, but is fading with time.  I also use this oil nightly on my face.  It absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin.  I believe it has improved the texture of my skin and shortened the duration of post-acne marks - they used to last for months, but my most recent &amp;#34;ghost pimple&amp;#34; disappeared in about a week.  I&#x27;ve also had success with using Tamanu oil on chigger and mosquito bites (it didn&#x27;t help the itching, but the red marks went away faster).  If you intend to use this oil for scarring, please note that it is most effective when used to prevent a wound from leaving a scar.  I have not noticed any improvement on old scars and post-acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with the Tamanu oil and very pleased with the quality, price, and level of customer service offered by Cammille Q.  I will continue to purchase Tamanu oil from this seller and have recommended them to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I saw Tamanu Oil as one of my cleansing oil&#x27;s list of ingredients. I wanted to make my own cleansing oil without any additives so I purchased this. I use it when I can remember but I love how non-greasy and gentle it is. I have only used it for a short time but I like the way it makes my skin feel! I plan to use it for a facial scrub later using sea salt.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife.She has been trying a lot products for the acne and nothing  worked until we decide to try this oil......It&#x27;s AMAZING  you can see results in two weeks. I ordered a second bottle!!!!!</li>
            <li> Using it for my toenail fungus  working good.</li>
            <li> I had edited my review to reflect the fact that the black rubber lid had \\&quot;melted\\&quot; into the oil. I was contacted by John Magnus, the co-founder of Cammile Q, after he read my review. He issued me a full refund for the bad bottle and shipped me a brand new one with the assurance that the problem has been remedied. Now that&#x27;s customer service! I&#x27;m glad things worked out this way, because after purchasing another brand of tamanu oil, I found the smell stronger and more curry-like. Cammile Q Tamanu Oil smells noticeably more subtle and feels different, besides. I also prefer the dropper to a squeeze pump.     Yay, so glad I can enjoy this oil again. :)    Original review, still applicable!:    I&#x27;m already addicted to this oil despite the pretty strong smell (it goes sort of earthy butterscotch on me; not a fan of butterscotch). I don&#x27;t smell it at all during the day when I wear it, but when I use more at night, I&#x27;ll catch whiffs of it the next morning. Other reviewers have said the oil is way too heavy for use during the day, which may be true for oily skin types. I have very normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone and I use it every morning for my facial moisturizer: After washing my face, I wet it all over again, put two drops on my finger, and apply it to my face and neck. At night, I wet my face and apply four drops to my face and décolletage. I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in my chin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; (under the skin acne) and my skin is stupid soft.    The key is starting with wet skin. It helps distribute the oil evenly.    Every Sunday I slather this oil all over my hair for an hour or more before my shower. It&#x27;s not hard to wash out like coconut oil and leaves my hair suuuuper shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had been using commercial lotions and moisturizers all my life until recently when I stumbled upon an article about the benefits of using natural oils for hair and skin. It was a moment of &amp;#34;HELLO....WHERE HAVE I BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve suffered and continue to suffer from mild acne and therefore have some acne scars on my face. I wanted to stop using products that have an extensive list of ingredients (most of which are difficult to pronounce) and decided to make my own facial moisturizer utilizing natural oils. I read about how Tamanu Oil is excellent for acneic and scarred skin and decided upon this product. I have been using this Tamanu Oil (mixed with Jojoba, Vitamin E, and Lavender EO) on a clean face for a couple of months, twice a day, and have definitely noticed a difference. My acne scars are lighter and my skin is softer. My boyfriend has also noticed the difference and has commented on it several times :) I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other Cammile Q products such as Argan oil and Castor oil, both of which are supposed to have a lot of benefits. These oils can be quite pricey, but they are a worthy investment!</li>
            <li> Works just as I had hoped! I use it as a carrier oil for a skin care solution. So far I&#x27;ve been applying it for about a month month in the morning &amp; night..Great quality at a great price!  Elizabeth M</li>
            <li> I investigated tamanu oil to help with facial breakouts and to improve my skin&#x27;s overall health. When I first tried it, I was surprised a little by the smell (very nutty)--but it didn&#x27;t bother me. I put a small amount on the more aggravated spots (you really don&#x27;t need more than 1-2 fingertips&#x27; worth for your whole face). While I feel I haven&#x27;t seen ultimate results yet, I do notice a marked improvement in breakout inflammation and overall skin condition: less redness, softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution for those interested in using tamanu oil: this product&#x27;s bottle says it can be applied up to three times daily, but I find using too much oil could dry out your skin and cause more skin problems. Don&#x27;t overdo it; you really don&#x27;t need as much oil as you might think you need.</li>
            <li> So far 3 members of my family have been using this product and have all had great reactions. I have used the tamanu oil to help with acne breakouts. I place just a little bit on existing scars, and initial breakouts to help get rid of them fast. It reducing the swelling and healing process of breakouts, not to mention lessens the frequency of them. Alongside the tamanu oil i use jojoba for moisturizing in the day and spot treat with tamanu oil, because it does have sort of maple syrup odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister had a spot of balding on her head, and she started putting this oil on the spot daily, because her hairstylist suggested it might be psoriasis or a spot of alopecia (spelling?)... low and behold her spot has sprouts of new hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lastly my mother recently had open heart surgery and has one gnarly scar down her chest and across her arm from the incisions. She uses the oil to minimize scaring and it has helped with the redness. She hasnt seen too much of a result, but these are very hefty scars.</li>
            <li> I initial bought this oil for my teenage son&#x27;s problematic acne. I have since found many other uses for this exceptional oil. When my son does follow a routine using this oil it works very well. Try getting a teenage boy to follow anything you want him to, but he saw the great results and asks to use it a lot more than I expected. This oil has reduced redness and inflammation and decreased the size of his pimples, sometime as little as overnight. As for me, I used this oil to help with an incision from a recent surgery. Every time I change the dressing, I put a few drops on along with the bacitracin and it seems to have accelerated the healing process. It impressed my doctor enough to mention how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; my incision was looking and how minimal the scarring was during my last post-operative appointment. I am also using this oil occasionally on my face after my cleansing, toning and moisturizing routine at night. I just finished my 1st bottle last evening, thank goodness I purchase two right from the start. I am certain that this oil will become a standard in our home and I will find even more ways in which it will help my family.</li>
            <li> I just got my oil and I used it on my face as a moisturizer.  Smelled nice and really absorbed into my skin and left it feeling soft, but not greasy.  BR</li>
            <li> Great product...hydrates the skin well...helps to reduce breakouts and it works well for the hair too. Love the suttle nutty scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elliep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am totally amazed at the results I&#x27;m getting with this product. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything thing known to man on my skin LITERALLY! And nothing else compares to this. I am an AA with melanin rich skin that scars easily. Any time I get a pimple I already know a dark spot is soon to follow. I honestly almost gave up hope for clear skin bc it just seemed hopeless. I ran across this oil and finally decided to try it after some pretty bad acne scars. Let me tell you I looked in the mirror today and I literally rubbed my skin bc it look like I had make up on!! I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 20 days Religiously!! My skin is oily so I only use a very small amount with a SPF moisturizer. The oil is thick so start out light. My only advice is that they add a dropper top cause pouring it out waste oil for me.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on my face a couple of weeks ago and noticed that my skin started to feel more soft and look more smooth. I will recomend it.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks now. Reduces redness and dryness without plugging pores, no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll finally get through the winter without skin troubles.</li>
            <li> The order from a second party was sent quickly and arrived safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A family member used it on shingles lesions with other oils and had good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil has a slightly unattractive smell. You may want to select pleasant smelling oils with complementary medicinal qualities if you will be using enough that you might be offended by the odor. You will probably also benefit from blending with other oils that absorb better.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful--very healing for small wounds. Arrived right on time. Good company!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil!!! Great for healing on the skin...I use it on my face too for smoothness!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I decided to try it for stubborn scars and then realized so many other purposes when I got it. it feels great on dry cuticles, acne prone skin, scars etc. I would highly recommend you try this!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I had a bad breakout and this cleared it up in about 3 or 4 days</li>
            <li> Great oil, I use it for my face and it has cleared my acne up and really helped with scarring as well. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, works well to avoid stretch marks, I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for clear skin and reduce marks.</li>
            <li> This oil is very high quality, has date of manufacture and seller has excellent customer service!! What more could you want? I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the product, it is used daily.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin softer, smoother, and clearer. I&#x27;ve been using it full strength but I think it&#x27;d be best added to a carrier oil because it is pretty powerful!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  It&#x27;s making an age spot on my back disappear.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks and it has really gone down.  I like the smell of it also.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!! I have actually run out and plan on purchasing again. I would put this on auto shipment. Andrea M.</li>
            <li> Great little product.  Skin breaks out less and stays hydrated.</li>
            <li> I used this as an addition to a jojoba base oil as well as essential oils to treat my oily skin and created a moisturizer for my friend&#x27;s insanely dry skin.  Both of us are thrilled. I have less shine and an even tone, while my friend has moisturized skin all day, smoother texture and evened tone.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Tamanu Oil to make my own face oils instead of using store bought moisturizer. I have read so many wonderful things about using oils and decided it was time to try it out. This oil came exactly as pictured and the quality was great! I&#x27;ve been using my home brew of oils ever since and I&#x27;m absolutely loving it! I would recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for Tamanu Oil.&lt;br /&gt;-Mercedes S.</li>
            <li> Helped so much with my eczema!</li>
            <li> I like this oil a lot. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it absorbs well. It seems to help my eyebrows grow a little thicker! I keep it away from my eyes since it makes them water a bit. My first bottle lasted much longer than I expected and I love the nutty smell. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will likely keep using.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I am beyond passionate about this product and hate to keep such an amazing secret, secret! If you are debating whether or not to try Tamanu Oil, you MUST give it a chance. My mom told me about Tamanu Oil almost 5 years ago after learning about it on Dr. Oz.    Having always suffered from acne, it became increasingly difficult to deal with breakouts into my mid-late 20&#x27;s. I had tried every prescriptive topical and oral treatment which either left my with dry red skin or in one case hives, yet everything always failed to reduce the breakouts and give me natural looking skin. I would spend hundreds on skin products and NOTHING ever worked.    I was hesitant at first to try Tamanu Oil since the idea of putting oil over oily skin seemed like a breeding ground for clogged pores. However, I was left SPEECHLESS not only by how much the color/tone of my skin changed but how quickly the effects took place. I dabbed oil on a small breakout area and literally after a few hours (re-applying every other hour or so) began to notice dramatic reduction in the size and redness. After 24-48hrs, pimples had nearly vanished. I could go on and on about how much Tamanu Oil has saved my self esteem after years of acne nearly destroyed it, but I have also used the oil for other purposes with just as much success...after a long day in the sun to prevent sun burns, on a jellyfish sting rash, and even to reduce old scars and sun damage/sun spots.     Over the past 5 years I have tried many different brands of Tamanu Oil and this is by far one of the best/top quality, pure, 100% cold pressed, options that you will find out there. If the oil doesn&#x27;t harden when cold, it&#x27;s no good. Although the bottle is small, I use it daily and can get any where from 3-4 mo on just one bottle.     I can continue to rave about this and tell you my skin literally glows and looks flawless immediately after use, but it seems too good to be true which is why I urge everyone, even skeptics,to just give it a try...there&#x27;s a reason this product has over 95% 5 star ratings! I&#x27;m amazed Tamanu Oils popularity hasn&#x27;t grown more over the years, it honestly is the natural and effective cure to so many ailments. I truly believe when I&#x27;m 40 my friends are going to be asking what my secret is to prevent wrinkles..I feel so fortunate to have discovered this oil!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read somewhere that was really good for inflammations, and I needed for my knee, because I put to much pressure on it during a workout. The Tamanu oil helped a lot for it. Then I found out that was good for skin and I have been using it for my skin at night and very happy with the results. I do not  use anything else at this time and my skin is very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil it is amazing! I bought it for the purpose of helping to erase the scars from the body and it is wonderful! And the company shipped my Tamanu Oil on time and with no issues!</li>
            <li> Great oil and wonderful customer service. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Used to get rid of nail fungus. Worked well.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and it is clearing my acne scars!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with Tamanu oil while vacationing in French Polynesia recently. The Noseeum bites and a brush against coral while snorkeling left me with quite a rash. A local recommended a Tamanu oil ointment and I was fully recovered in 48 hours. Love this stuff. I now use it on all bug bites, eczema and any bump, scrape or bruise.</li>
            <li> It seems pure and smells just as other reviewers said - to me it is kind of like a strong nut smell mixed with butterscotch. I do not find it offensive. It seems to do the job of healing a lesion treated with Curaderm, as the makers of Curaderm suggest. The area becomes less red and smoother every day. I have taken to applying it to other sun-damaged areas of my neck, face and arms. Not sure what the long-term effects will be, but it does so well on the post-Curaderm area that it must be good.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it really seems to be helping my skin - especially with this dry, cold winter.  It has a bit of a nutty smell but goes away after a little while.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it on the back of my legs the sides of my stomach and my face! Smells kinda funny! But great benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a month now about once a day and I&#x27;ve noticed softer skin so far. Looking forward to see more results with acne scars. Easy to apply and skin absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Finally got something to help with my dry itchy scalp, I have used everything from Tea tree &amp; Rosemary oil. this has been the only thing that has helped and I see results. the only thing I could say that is weird is that it does smell a little like curry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil after reading great reviews and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  I&#x27;ve used Tamanu oil on my face and neck for a month and my skin literally glows, feels smooth and looks younger.  In the morning I moisturize with Tamanu while my skin is damp, wait about 15 minutes for it to absorb and then apply a light coverage of makeup.  At night I apply Tamanu to my clean face and neck and go to sleep while it does it&#x27;s magic.  I love the earthy fragrance.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Oil is really great on skin. Very light. A little too strong on the scent side. Great product.</li>
            <li> great product not much else to say  good price  quick service , smooth regenerating use this in all my lotions &amp; ointment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different facial oils &amp; this is my fave!!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil after doing some research on using oils for skin care, and I love it! It has a strong smell at first, but it smells almost nutty to me and i think the scent is nice. I use it in a combination (grapeseed, tamanu, lavender) as my facial moisturizer in the evening...my skin is looking good! My skin is sensitive and this has not caused any irritation or breakouts so far with several weeks of daily use. Price is good, too! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! My daughter-in-law mixes this w/rice and rosehip oil for a night cream (which I use religiously every night). It works beautifully!</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturize the skin, and it has evened out dark tones. I use it on my face and feet, and I&#x27;m seeing inprovement. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the product and find the dark marks on my face seem to be slowly fading after a few weeks of usage. Smell is strong but if it works for you, why complain?!  Still using the oil- will post back in the next few weeks and update on results</li>
            <li> This oil really does help fade old blemishes, softens and smoothes skin.  It also helps rid of inflammation within a couple of days.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Over this year, I suffered the worse breakout that I&#x27;ve had in the past six years. My skin wasn&#x27;t too bad before - occasional breakouts on my forehead. However, I started getting breakouts on my chin (a lot!) and my cheeks (never before!). A couple months ago, I heard that using oil moisturizers has helped others with breakouts, so I decided to give this oil a try (not greasy and great for acne prone skin). I really enjoyed this oil because it was light enough to use by itself during the day. If I need more moisture, I would mix it with some argan oil. At night, I combine a few drops of this with a few drops of marula oil. My skin has improved a lot! I am still recovering from scars due to those nasty breakouts, but I can definitely see that they have faded a bit and my complexion is brighter. I still have a couple of breakouts here and there but nothing unmanageable ever since I started using this oil. It has a nutty fragrance to it, which didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this oil a try!</li>
            <li> Has anyone has any sort of reaction to this product? I used it for 3 nights and now my skin texture has completely changed..my skin has micro-bumps everywhere and it is a little red. I have no allergies, non-sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to any face product I have used so I&#x27;m a little confused..Has anyone had an adverse reaction? did your skin eventually return to normal??</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , love this oil for my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the smell but I finally think I&#x27;ve found an oil that will help my nail fungus. I just reordered and will start my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this oil from Camille. I bought another bottle from an often-used company and did not like it nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Lynn D.  - After reading about Tamanu Oil and how it can help so many skin issues, I thought i would try it.  The smell isn&#x27;t all that bad and tones down shortly.  You really only need a teensy bit, it goes a long way.  I am skin that breaks out and from using this,  I actually have less breakouts and I am seeing some results with the wrinkles, a softening where they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.  I am using it for some scars on my face and will update later on how this has worked on them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to add to a face oil I was making. I had never used or seen Tamanu oil before so I was unsure what to expect. It is a thicker, deeper in color oil with a very distinct scent that I&#x27;m not sure how to explain. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but its tolerable. I dilute it with argan oil which makes it go on smoothly &amp; not smell so much &amp; once it soaks in the smell is gone. A little of this goes a long way so this bottle will last a long time, another plus.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter who has severe acne problems and her skin has improved a lot! She just loves it!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well wrapped, good condition.  I delayed reviewing this to get an idea of it&#x27;s usitility and performance.  I smooth a few drops on my face after cleansing and it makes my skin sooo smooth, takes care of peeling and severe dryness issues, all without causing break-outs.  Absorbs fast leaving smooth finish.  My favorite use so far is putting a few drops on my hands and rubbing into scalp and then smoothing down hair shaft, occasionally putting 1-2 additional drops from mid-shaft to ends.  My hair appears to be a bit fuller already and has much less frizz.  I can&#x27;t wait to see down the road any other improvements to come with my hair &amp; skin!  I also rub it on my cuticles. Great product!</li>
            <li> Has helped my tone and breakouts</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would advise against this product. The product caused a rash and itchiness. The area is still discolored although it&#x27;s been weeks since it was last applied.</li>
            <li> I love it! I had an awful acne flare up, and this calmed it down. I think that it&#x27;s helping with my leftover hyperpigmentation too. So exciting! I use it at night, with 3 drops of grapeseed oil. Finally, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was very professional. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly on wet skin and helps with flakiness</li>
            <li> There was no significant difference after using product</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this tamanu oil and love it so far. I use it in the face oil I make and it seems to be very soothing to the skin. I have even used it in an oil mixture for sun burns and it helps mild red turn to tan pretty quickly. I experienced great customer service with this company. Liz was excellent at following up with me as a new customer and making sure I was satisfied. Their oil is quality and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;-Jennifer M.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing ! I highly recommend it. I use it every night for the past 3 months and since using it my skin has cleared up and the scarring has faded dramatically. I ordered this product and it arrived to me promptly ( I love not having to wait around for orders :D ) 5 stars from me !</li>
            <li> I had knee replacement surgery in June 2014 and wanted to help the scar fade so I went to Amazon to see what they had for this and found Tamanu Oil, so I thought I would give it a try. My scar is hardly noticeable now and I&#x27;m sure this product has helped. I have some stretch marks I am going to try it on also and hope I get the same results.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results I achived with my Tamanu Oil. I cut my hand and It was having difficulty healing. Once I started using the Tamanu Oil it started healing from inside out and when the scab fell off there was no scare. I have used Tamanu Oil in the past on a cut and received fabulous results. It is the perfect thing to have in your medicine chest for emergencies.  I would rate this product a 5 it is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Darlene B</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. I have tried two other brands, but this one is truly the best and seems to be the purest. I like spreading it through out my face and neck area just by adding a tiny drop of water, it goes further and spreads easier. It&#x27;s brightening as well, no more old acne scars left on this face! Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil!</li>
            <li> My wife had a good experience for using tamanu oil for years.&lt;br /&gt;But her most favorite brand had discontinued supply so that she picked up an alternative but she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elmo Chun</li>
            <li> This oil good, but it takes a while to see some results. It cannot remove scars completely but it is able to reduce their appearance over time.</li>
            <li> Great product and the company went above and beyond....They even sent me an email to see if I was happy with the product and to offer suggestions for usage and application!!!!! Very nice.</li>
            <li> Really happy, not just with the order but with the company!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product ti me for my skin and hair.  I have sun damage from living in FL all my life, the Tamanu oil makes my skin so soft and smooth.  When I put it on, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  I was able to see a difference in my skin and hair right away!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Used daily, fantastic Results - Drew H</li>
            <li> Great product! Have used it for a month now and already notice how my skin is more hydrated, skin tone is even, and it&#x27;s also helped to improve my cystic acne! Great for healing minor cuts and scrapes as well! Only thing I wish was that the bottle had a dropper, I like to mix essential oils into my night face routine and it would make it a lot easier with a dropper. Overall great product though! Worth every penny and a little goes a long way! - MRice</li>
            <li> Now my mom bought this cause of her friend. She bought it and now he friends love it. My mom honestly enjoyed it. It came on time and it does what it says. I&#x27;m not a oil guy but my mom did enjoy this a lot. If you thinking about trying this just stop thinking and buy it. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Ive never used this oil before,  but i had surgery and knew i would be needing a scar reducing product. I researched a lot online and decided to try this product. Im glad i did. Its a nice medium weight oil, mixes well with a drop of essential oil for fragrance,  and I also combine a dime size amount with a very light face lotion like Kiels for a night moisturizer for my 50 year old skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product and company.</li>
            <li> I love my Tamanu oil! I use a few drops on my face every morning and right before bed. I have been using it for several weeks now, and within the first week I noticed that my skin was clearer. I have fewer breakouts, and my face looks healthier. My skin tone has evened out, the dark circles under my eyes are less noticeable, and the fine wrinkles are my eyes and mouth are less apparent as well. I highly recommend Tamanu oil to anyone that will listen! I&#x27;ve told all my friends and coworkers about Tamanu oil, and specifically about ordering from Cammile Q. They have a high quality product, it&#x27;s delivered quickly, and their customer service is beyond compare. They take the time to check in with you after a couple weeks just to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase. I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Tamanu oil and Cammile Q!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. My face is not only clear, but glowing. And my scars that have taken years to acquire,  are disappearing after only three weeks of use. I will definitely continue using this. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching various oils for my face and finally decided to try tamanu.  There are so many on Amazon choose from but my goal was to find one that is pure,, cold pressed, no added filler ingredients,  at a good price, from a seller with a good reputation.  User reviews posted on Amazon helped me my decision.  I like that this oil absorbs into my skin fairly quickly and then doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  I was hoping this would help my mild scarring and not clog my pores.  I&#x27;m happy that it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, but since I have only used it once a day for about a week now, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will be beneficial to my scars.  However my skin feels very soft and smooth.  The scent is strong but it really isn&#x27;t a bad scent. I think it smells like roasted nuts or pecan pie! I did replace the screw cap with a dropper cap from a finished bottle of serum. The dropper allows me to better control how many drops I use, making it less wasteful and less messy.  My only suggestion would be to redesign the bottle to include a dropper cap in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, even the earthy smell.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered timely and the actual product was just what I was looking for. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I like this oil and it seems to work well for skin and hair.  I mix it with other oils- i wouldn&#x27;t use it over large areas of my body non-diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things I might have wanted to know about this oil in the description for a first time buy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil has a pretty strong smell.  I like it, my partner doesn&#x27;t.  I think it smells like slippery elm bark lozenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil has a tint to it, and used alone it will slightly color light colored skin a yellowish green tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all tamanu oil is the same.</li>
            <li> This is a useful product, however i cannot get past the smell of it. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I prefer my other odorless products.</li>
            <li> Seem to offer healing qualities for the skin as well as perhaps reduce scarring.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great moisturizer &amp; heals any imperfections in your skin. It smells very natural and goes away very quickly so I have no problem with it. I appreciate that it is natural and not masked by perfumes. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out with products and this oil keeps my skin soft, not greasy and clear. It was shipped quickly, very well packaged and fair priced. I highly recommend. Excellent customer service too, I appreciated the follow up phone call to make sure I was satisfied &amp; received my order.</li>
            <li> My husband first purchased this item for a skin problem he was having. A few months later I developed rosacea and was having difficulty finding any product that I could use on my face that didn&#x27;t hurt and sting. My husband did a bit of research for me and encouraged me to try tamanu oil. After reading about the properties of this oil for skin healing, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antibiotic, I was convinced to give it a try. It has brought remarkable healing and comfort to my face. I now use it every night after I cleanse my face to sooth and heal my skin overnight. It helps reduce the redness and keeps my face from getting the sandpaper texture I was dealing with. The company sent the product quickly and it came in great shape. Tamanu oil will be a staple in my skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I started the oil cleansing method a couple weeks ago for acne. I decided to try hemp seed oil and castor oil. I started adding this Tamanu oil to help fade the scars on my face due to acne, when I realized it also helps fight the acne! I love how soft and clean my skin feels after using this every night. I usually have dry spots on my chin, using this method the dry spots are gone! My face feels great! Though I am still fighting the acne, it has gotten significantly better.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is famous for its anti-aging and moisturizing qualities. I had some irritation before after the day cream I used, I believe I was using an Aveda one at that time. My friend recommended me to try essential oils and after it I never go back. I use Tamanu oil every day mixing up with a couple of drops of Frankincense oil instead of everyday cream. The results were obvious after a week. Highly recommend it for those who still looking for a perfect skin care products, the answer is simple, the more natural products you use, the better are the results. I was pleasantly surprised myself, fine wrinkles were gone, the skin color improved and my skin was not dry any more. I started to get a lot of complements about my skin condition. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t forget to drink a lot of water!</li>
            <li> Great product, would buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Smells really good. I&#x27;m using this in a homemade face oil that works great! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product...heals the skin amazingly fast! Great service too! Product arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this oil. It did nothing for my acne and had my face greasy. It seemed to help a bit with toe nail fungus though so I gave 2 stars. Also the rubber from the dropper disintegrated into the oil after it reached about half so I cud not use the rest on my face. I did purchase the oil in another brand which had a spray nozzle that worked much better. Overall this was a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> Great for psoriasis.  Doug B</li>
            <li> I love this Tamanu oil particularly for my eczema. I suffer from it on my hands, and at times when the itch gets so bad I can&#x27;t help myself but scratch it, it gets oozy. This oil dries it right up, takes away the itch and burn and heals the eczema patch. It is a bit of a drying oil, so I do find I need to apply a good moisturiser on top (cocoa butter, shea butter or even just olive oil/coconut oil).</li>
