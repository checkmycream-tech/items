            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I gave these to friends at Christmas, and they loved them.  </li>
            <li>- most are microfiber garbage!</li>
            <li>Love these hair wraps!</li>
            <li>These have to be the fluffiest, most absorbent hair towels I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Better than my turbie twist!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these!  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, the towels, and the button for keeping the towel in place.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li>Great product- 100% terry cloth cotton, very absorbent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>Glad that I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Very nice and soft and well made.</li>
            <li>I tried the towel this morning and when I took it off, my hair was in tangles and came away easily in my hands (quite a number of them)</li>
            <li>Only good to keep hair out of your face to put on make-up etc.  </li>
            <li>Absorbent, soft and easy to use, you just put it on like a hood, cover your hair with the wrap, twist it, and button it on top.</li>
            <li>They came quickly.  </li>
            <li>They are thicker and more absorbent than the other name brand hair towels that I own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to button because you&#x27;re just putting the large button into a stretchy elastic loop.</li>
            <li>Well, the towels are nice enough to look at: pretty colours, and the loop and button work just fine.</li>
            <li>They are just like the original ones from years ago when they first came out.</li>
            <li>Finally found these nice 100% cotton towel turbans like the one I bought years ago.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I  been looking for.</li>
            <li>My kids love them too - helps my daughters hair dry much faster.</li>
            <li>They are cotton and yes they are very absorbent just as it says.</li>
            <li>A fast wrap for your hair.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have been searching endlessly for cotton head towel wraps since my old one from years ago had so many holes in it and was so worn out.</li>
            <li>bigger size, super absorbent, very soft.  </li>
            <li>I recommend everyone get these, cotton is so much better than microfiber at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It holds pretty well until your hair is dry enough to take it off.</li>
            <li>It works on my extra large head, and can even be used by my little 4-year-old twins girls.</li>

            <li> Would like to see these offered in grey, white, and black (for those of us who have dyed hair).  </li>
            <li> Does NOTHING to dry hair!</li>
            <li> I bought these hair towels, not only for after shampooing but also to keep the sweat out of my eyes and off my neck when I&#x27;m working hard around the house.</li>
            <li> Hard to find 100% cotton these days</li>
            <li> Hard to find anymore.</li>
            <li> I hate the new microfiber material they make the head towels now</li>

            <li> I bought these as a gift.  They came quickly.  I can only assume my son&#x27;s girlfriend likes them; she told me she did!</li>

            <li> the best i ever had. look no further, just buy these and you wouldn&#x27;t regret it. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s absorbent, BUT IT&#x27;S NOT.  Only good to keep hair out of your face to put on make-up etc.  Does NOTHING to dry hair!</li>
            <li> These are great cotton towels.  I don&#x27;t like microfiber hair towels so took a chance on these cotton wraps.  They are wonderful...bigger size, super absorbent, very soft.  Best hair wrap towels I&#x27;ve found and I like the button/loop.</li>
            <li> I gave these to friends at Christmas, and they loved them.  I have had mine for several years, and they are great.&lt;br /&gt;Louise Reed</li>
            <li> Just what my wife was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these!  Hard to find 100% cotton these days - most are microfiber garbage!</li>
            <li> Finally found these nice 100% cotton towel turbans like the one I bought years ago.  It works on my extra large head, and can even be used by my little 4-year-old twins girls.</li>
            <li> Love these hair wraps! Very nice and soft and well made.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, the towels, and the button for keeping the towel in place.  They are thicker and more absorbent than the other name brand hair towels that I own.  Would like to see these offered in grey, white, and black (for those of us who have dyed hair).  Thank you BelleSha and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Well, the towels are nice enough to look at: pretty colours, and the loop and button work just fine. The problem is what these do to my hair. I tried the towel this morning and when I took it off, my hair was in tangles and came away easily in my hands (quite a number of them) as I finger-combed it (I have curly-wavy hair). This has never happened with my microfiber turbans. It shouldn&#x27;t happen with this, but I can&#x27;t risk tangles and hair loss every time I shower! So these cloths will be used by me for washing windows etc.</li>
            <li> stay wet into the next day</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I  been looking for. They are cotton and yes they are very absorbent just as it says. They are just like the original ones from years ago when they first came out. I love them. I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> absorbs, the best hair towel !</li>

            <li> These have to be the fluffiest, most absorbent hair towels I&#x27;ve ever used! Wish they came in darker colors though because I wear them while I apply my makeup and they can get stained from the foundation. Best hair towel ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these! Hard to find anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product- 100% terry cloth cotton, very absorbent. Better than my turbie twist!  My kids love them too - helps my daughters hair dry much faster.</li>
            <li> Absorbent, soft and easy to use, you just put it on like a hood, cover your hair with the wrap, twist it, and button it on top. It&#x27;s easy to button because you&#x27;re just putting the large button into a stretchy elastic loop. It holds pretty well until your hair is dry enough to take it off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these. A fast wrap for your hair. Glad that I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Love them! Amazing! Thick cotton and very absorbent. Winderful!</li>
