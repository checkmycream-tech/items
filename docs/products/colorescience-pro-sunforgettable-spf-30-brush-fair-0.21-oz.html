            <li>Would buy again for sure</li>
            <li>I love the powder sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This powder brush is a MUCH better alternative.</li>
            <li>This is the most convenient sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunblock - I put it on in the morning and forget about it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be pretty good sun protection.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to put on ,easy to carry with you and solves the problem of having sun screen protection all day.</li>
            <li>The powder goes on easily and is not visible.  </li>
            <li>but I thought it was fine, although if I bought again would probably try medium.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  like applying a light dusting of powder.  </li>
            <li>One doesn&#x27;t  know if it&#x27;s going on because it&#x27;s so light and inconspicuios.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair-skinned, and I thought this was a shade too light for me.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought Peter Thomas Roth brand and will never buy again.</li>
            <li>This product is super convenient, and does the job.</li>
            <li>so I can have them right at hand</li>
            <li>Do love quickly brushing on and running out the door for my daily walks though.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can throw it in my bag so that I always have a quick and easy form of sun protection for my face when I need it, without having to mess with applying lotions and then reapplying any makeup.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I am more inclined to reapply as this product can be brushed on with ease vs. lotion (not my fav in hit or sticky weather).</li>
            <li>Its my first time purchasing this color.  </li>
            <li>Keeping my fingers crossed it does work in the hot sun of the day.</li>
            <li>but I would probably choose the medium  again next time because I felt the fair was a little too light and did not blend with my skin quite as well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and really works if you apply regularly like any sunscreen product.</li>
            <li>They are so much easier to apply when your on the go.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It works very well as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works very well.  </li>
            <li>Havne&#x27;t had high sun in summer yet to really know if it will work.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist says it contains the two main ingredients she looks for in a broad spectrum sun</li>
            <li>I just use a face primer, no base, and it was still to heavy to wear.  </li>
            <li>and you can barely tell it is on your face.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was only a freckle and the doctor recommended that I should carry travel-size bottles of SPF with me to reapply every few hours</li>
            <li>Great for a toddler (or grown up) on the go - can leave a little chalkiness behind but not enough for me to go back to lotions or sprays.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Have a hard time telling if any is going on when you apply it. Afraid to depend on it in the sun</li>
            <li> Product great and easy to use. I ordered 2 in the same shade and they were not the same color.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all skin types, goes one easily and looks lovely.  This is my second one.  I have liquid sunscreen bc of the greasy feeling it leaves on my skin so this is the perfect solution.  My face didnt get burned all summer so i&#x27;m assuming this works great. Would buy again for sure</li>
            <li> No mes.s, no drips, no grease. What  else can I say and it works you cannot see it until you wash it off and see it on the washcloth</li>
            <li> I love the powder sunscreens. They are so much easier to apply when your on the go. I had originally bought Peter Thomas Roth brand and will never buy again. I spilled almost all of the product when trying to reapply the cap. This is so so much easier to use and you can barely tell it is on your face. Will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough coverage to wear without a base, but to heavy to use as a finishing powder.  I just use a face primer, no base, and it was still to heavy to wear.  Do not blend well and if you accidently get to much on the brush, it&#x27;s impossible to not waste the excess.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This product is super convenient, and does the job. I love that I can throw it in my bag so that I always have a quick and easy form of sun protection for my face when I need it, without having to mess with applying lotions and then reapplying any makeup. Works great!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to put on ,easy to carry with you and solves the problem of having sun screen protection all day. It does not show on your skin. Its perfect</li>
            <li> Great for a toddler (or grown up) on the go - can leave a little chalkiness behind but not enough for me to go back to lotions or sprays.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really works if you apply regularly like any sunscreen product. I am more inclined to reapply as this product can be brushed on with ease vs. lotion (not my fav in hit or sticky weather).</li>
            <li> It seems to be pretty good sun protection. I use it over regular sun screen to be less shiny and it works well.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the car so I can brush it onto the backs of my hands to prevent dark spots. Otherwise, I wash my hands so often, there&#x27;s never any sunscreen on them when I need it.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a dermatologist appointment to have a spot checked on my nose. Luckily it was only a freckle and the doctor recommended that I should carry travel-size bottles of SPF with me to reapply every few hours should I have to be in the sun.  This powder brush is a MUCH better alternative. Not only does it provide immediate SPF protection but because it&#x27;s a powder it soaks up any oil on the face.  It&#x27;s like doing a makeup touch up but with added protection.  I plan on buying a few so I can have them right at hand anytime I need it!</li>
            <li> It works - as a redhead i hate greasy sunscreen.  I had bought Peter Roth and it didn&#x27;t work so I bought color science and it works.  Don&#x27;t try to save money get cs.  I walk my dog daily and hate flattening my hair with a hat.  So happy with cs.  The fair seems fine,  I have color on my skin in the summer and the reviews said it made them pale but I thought it was fine, although if I bought again would probably try medium.</li>
            <li> looked pasty on my face. felt pasty on my face. gross. returned.</li>
            <li> This is the most convenient sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s  like applying a light dusting of powder.  One doesn&#x27;t  know if it&#x27;s going on because it&#x27;s so light and inconspicuios.  I like it because you can&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s there--never greasy or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well as a sunscreen. I have not ever had a burn or tan line while using this product and I often spend hours on the water and in the sun.  My dermatologist says it contains the two main ingredients she looks for in a broad spectrum sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both the medium and fair tones.  I would be considered fair-skinned but I would probably choose the medium  again next time because I felt the fair was a little too light and did not blend with my skin quite as well.  If I were rating the medium tone I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my sunscreen regimen that I keep in my makeup bag for afternoon touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is by far, one of the very best skin protection products available! Use it every day, 365 days a year!</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock - I put it on in the morning and forget about it. Its my first time purchasing this color.  I&#x27;m fair-skinned, and I thought this was a shade too light for me. This might be good for a fair-skinned person in the winter time.  Next time I will purchase a shade darker,</li>
            <li> Havne&#x27;t had high sun in summer yet to really know if it will work.  Time will tell.  Do love quickly brushing on and running out the door for my daily walks though.  Keeping my fingers crossed it does work in the hot sun of the day.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  The powder goes on easily and is not visible.  No oily, slimy, sticky liquid to deal with.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well.  It last a long time, so even though it seems expensive, it goes a long way.  This is especially great for your face and for kids.  No more getting it in the eyes!</li>
