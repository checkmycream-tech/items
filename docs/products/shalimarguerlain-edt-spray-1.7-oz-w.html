            <li>I&#x27;ve used these Guerlain products for many years and still love them.  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering like most perfume on the market now is.  </li>

            <li>It is her favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for more than 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>Shalimar talc is the best especially for layering Shalimar lotion and perfume.  </li>

            <li>I love Shalimar, but this item never arrived.  </li>
            <li>I love the combination.</li>
            <li>After a nice relaxing bath it is wonderful to be able to put on a great smelling dusting powder that seems like a real smell and not come sort of chemically created sharp smell as so many of the star&#x27;s named fragrances seem to be these days.</li>
            <li>the smell is still so mine - and so belongs to everyone who loves a gentle loving smell that reminds your friends that ah ha that is you, Shalimar is mine, and I am thrilled I have the ability to once more surround my self with it.</li>
            <li>that first job was many years ago...</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, old fragrence that has been around for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The powder came quickly as promised and was under the tree on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li>Box of powder is large and very pretty.  </li>
            <li>My first job out of high school was selling cosmetics in a department store.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much....</li>
            <li>BUT... fragrance is far from the lovely Shalimar of the past..</li>
            <li>She mentioned that she was running low on her favorite powder just a few days before Christmas.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance but hard to find locally as it is an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; fragrance; not as overpowering as some of the new ones.</li>
            <li>I love its subtle smell.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available in our local stores and has been hard to find unless you are an Amazon shopper.</li>

            <li> In a suffocating way.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to report.</li>
            <li> but, I was disappointed in the powder&#x27;s scent...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Guerlain products for many years and still love them.  Use the cologne as well as the dusting powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragence for forty years.  I love its subtle smell. It is not overpowering like most perfume on the market now is.  We all know those smells that most women wear that gives you a headache after they leave the area you&#x27;re in.  This is a wonderful, old fragrence that has been around for a very long time. Makes you feel nice.  I will continue to wear this fragrence as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s (and mine) favorite powder. The Shalimar brand is getting hard to find, but not a Amazon. Thank You.</li>
            <li> my wife has used Shalimar for years.  It is her favorite scent.  She mentioned that she was running low on her favorite powder just a few days before Christmas. The powder came quickly as promised and was under the tree on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> Shalimar Dusting powder. Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t surprise me though, I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for more than 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> Shalimar talc is the best especially for layering Shalimar lotion and perfume.  It&#x27;s silky of course but it&#x27;s the the fragrance that is so incredible and it helps the other Shalimar forms of fragrance last longer. There is nothing like Shalimar and I always go back to it.</li>
            <li> I love Shalimar Dusting powder.  It smells wonderful and I just love to use it after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li> I was even in Paris this past summer and couldnt find this dusting powder.  I love it and good price</li>
            <li> I adore this perfume powder....thank you so much....very light and beautiful container etc....it is my favorite perfume of all time</li>
            <li> over 50 years of Shalimar and the smell is still so mine - and so belongs to everyone who loves a gentle loving smell that reminds your friends that ah ha that is you, Shalimar is mine, and I am thrilled I have the ability to once more surround my self with it.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this dusting powder anywhere in town and was thrilled to find it at Amazon!</li>

            <li> My favorite fragrance but hard to find locally as it is an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; fragrance; not as overpowering as some of the new ones.</li>
            <li> Great scent! A wonderful way to spoil yourself after a shower. Super  gift idea too!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, there was powder all over the box when my mom opened it.....</li>
            <li> My wife has enjoyed this fragrance for many years and was pleased to find it online since the department stores in our area were out of stock. It was also less expensive and delivery was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> My first job out of high school was selling cosmetics in a department store.  I had the opportunity to experience a variety of fragrances, of which Shalimar became one of my temporary favorites.  But, I must say...that first job was many years ago...and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me or the body powder...but, I was disappointed in the powder&#x27;s scent...plus, I don&#x27;t care to use products that contain talc.  Oh, well...couldn&#x27;t return it...but the container looks nice in my bathroom. :(</li>
            <li> Last forever! A little goes a long way. Good price. If you are a Shalimar can you will love the powder.</li>
            <li> I love Shalimar, but this item never arrived.  I was charged for it and it took some time to get a refund.  Amazon was extremely helpful in resolving this with the vender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only I had gotten the product.  It would have gotten a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> The smell is not over whelming and stays with you a long time.  People get a drift of smell as you go by them.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item as a gift. The pricing was about 40% less than we have paid in the past locally.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I mix two powders, Shalimar &amp; Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s Youth Dew.  I love the combination.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in good condition. Box of powder is large and very pretty.  BUT... fragrance is far from the lovely Shalimar of the past.. Regret to say I threw the enitre box of that $$$$ dusting powder  in the trash!!.  Fragrance was&lt;br /&gt;overwhelming. In a suffocating way.  Sorry to report.</li>
            <li> After a nice relaxing bath it is wonderful to be able to put on a great smelling dusting powder that seems like a real smell and not come sort of chemically created sharp smell as so many of the star&#x27;s named fragrances seem to be these days.</li>
