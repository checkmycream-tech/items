            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin feeling really nice.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This seems to give her skin the nourishment that it needs for exceptional night cream.  </li>
            <li>Put a dollop on the top of your hand and you can see how great it</li>
            <li>I love this face cream!</li>
            <li>I turned to Lancôme and that was really nice stuff</li>
            <li>To each there own I guess.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and a great deal if you buy it via subscription through amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good night cream and after trying this product for the first time, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>this cream works well for me because it is not greasy and my skin feel very smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>Glad to see Amazon carrying it.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this night cream  for many years.  </li>
            <li>Have used for years and completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I am using it now a week and am pleased at how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Love the 2 jars and the price</li>
            <li>I am trying to use more organic products, and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this because it&#x27;s herbal, rather than perfumy.</li>
            <li>love the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying and to get two jars is quite the deal.</li>
            <li>do people really test these products first and not on teenagers with perfect skin ha</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Also good to note that he is very sensitive towards some of the scents they put in lotions now a days, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother him one bit!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, it just smells fragrance free (which I prefer) but its not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I have used this night treatment cream for years, and it is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love the scent - sort of fruity but not cloying - and as noted by another reviewer it disappears right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that this isn&#x27;t advertised more because it really is an amazing product.....and very affordable.</li>
            <li>No sticky residue and feels cool when you apply it.</li>
            <li>I find this cream is most effective applied immediately after I wash my face at night, while my skin is still a bit wet.</li>
            <li>It is excellent  for sensitive skin, full day moisturizer and would encourage all to use the whole product line from facial foam cleanser, serum with this cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to the fragrance; kind of refreshing with the herbs, but could be a little sweeter.  </li>
            <li>My pores were smaller, oil production was reduced, shading and discoloration began to fade, contours of my neck were more defined and smooth....</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and breathable.</li>
            <li>i like Jason cosmetics very much.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, but the only thing is that it has a strong medicine like smell, which might bother some people.  </li>
            <li>love how my skin looks when i wake up the following morning.  </li>
            <li>Like it better than similar items from Ulta that cost 4x the price.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and slight aroma of this product - not too greasy &amp; not too light.</li>
            <li>While the serum is decent (I&#x27;m only using it now), it&#x27;s not as potent as the Night Recovery Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products are always being discontinued</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite night cream, but now if you look up the title on Amazon you get an awful lotion instead of this wonderful rich cream.</li>
            <li>use this mostly in the night and when the air is really dry, I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It has been a very drying winter</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a lighter consistency (like fat free yogurt whereas some face creams feel like greek yogurt- if that comparison helps) and absorbs deeply and quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not make my skin greasy at all, which is unusual - most creams are too heavy and oily for me.     </li>
            <li>The fact that this product doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I really like this night cream because it isn&#x27;t heavy and disappears into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Loves how soft and hydrated it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li>skin is fairly sensitive to face products too</li>
            <li>Especially in winter, it feels very soothing when I put it on before bed.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it will run about $12-$14 retail for a small jar - but that will last me more than a month with daily use.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and somewhat dry skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My Wife has been using this Orjene night cream for about 3 - 4 years now.  This seems to give her skin the nourishment that it needs for exceptional night cream.  Natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> I have used this night treatment cream for years, and it is gentle and effective. I love the scent - sort of fruity but not cloying - and as noted by another reviewer it disappears right away. I have very sensitive and somewhat dry skin. I find this cream is most effective applied immediately after I wash my face at night, while my skin is still a bit wet. It does not make my skin greasy at all, which is unusual - most creams are too heavy and oily for me.     Well worth the money, and a great deal if you buy it via subscription through amazon.com. Otherwise it will run about $12-$14 retail for a small jar - but that will last me more than a month with daily use.</li>
            <li> And it is getting harder to find!  Glad to see Amazon carrying it.  Have been using this night cream  for many years.  It is excellent  for sensitive skin, full day moisturizer and would encourage all to use the whole product line from facial foam cleanser, serum with this cream.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this before and would buy it again. Smells great and leaves my skin feeling really nice. Nite cream.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and I must say it&#x27;s pretty good.  It absorbs quickly, but the only thing is that it has a strong medicine like smell, which might bother some people.  I started using it a few weeks ago and it has made a difference in my skin. My skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> Have used for years and completely satisfied.  Several people have asked me to share with them what I used.  It seems to be just the right balance, not to heavy or thin.  Would recommend it to anyone....</li>
            <li> got 2 jars and used for 2 months and nothing. do people really test these products first and not on teenagers with perfect skin ha</li>
            <li> I love the feel and slight aroma of this product - not too greasy &amp; not too light. I&#x27;m on my second jar!</li>
            <li> I am using it now a week and am pleased at how my skin feels. Love the 2 jars and the price</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this is one of the few products he can use that doesn&#x27;t break him out. He uses it for aftershave and at night as his moisturizer before bed. Loves how soft and hydrated it makes his skin feel. Also good to note that he is very sensitive towards some of the scents they put in lotions now a days, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother him one bit! It&#x27;s a keeper and we will keep ordering!!</li>
            <li> This cream is nothing short of a miracle worker! After using it for just one week, I noticed improved texture and tone in my skin. My pores were smaller, oil production was reduced, shading and discoloration began to fade, contours of my neck were more defined and smooth....just wonderful. The fact that this product doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals makes it even better. I&#x27;m really surprised that this isn&#x27;t advertised more because it really is an amazing product.....and very affordable. I&#x27;ve been without it for some time now and I can tell the difference in my skin and over all appearance. While the serum is decent (I&#x27;m only using it now), it&#x27;s not as potent as the Night Recovery Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products are always being discontinued so I&#x27;m stocking up on this stuff now.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find somewhere to buy this now.  It&#x27;s my favorite night cream, but now if you look up the title on Amazon you get an awful lotion instead of this wonderful rich cream.</li>
            <li> It works great for my skin! No breakouts, not greasy and absorbs well. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream because it isn&#x27;t heavy and disappears into the skin quickly. I don&#x27;t understand why one reviewer complained about the smell---I really like it. I am trying to use more organic products, and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream! I used it for years paying $18 a jar at Fred Meyers and then they stopped carrying it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I turned to Lancôme and that was really nice stuff but I prefer this product over Lancôme, and that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fairly sensitive to face products too and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with rash or break outs with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a lighter consistency (like fat free yogurt whereas some face creams feel like greek yogurt- if that comparison helps) and absorbs deeply and quickly. My skin feels fresh and breathable. You know how some moisturizer makes you feel pasty? This doesn&#x27;t. Put a dollop on the top of your hand and you can see how great it moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mostly in the night and when the air is really dry, I use it morning and night. I don&#x27;t love the smell, it just smells fragrance free (which I prefer) but its not bad at all. My husband actually says he likes how it smells. To each there own I guess.</li>
            <li> i like Jason cosmetics very much. this cream works well for me because it is not greasy and my skin feel very smooth in the morning. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Negative is the scent.  Reminds me of a lineament.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels smooth.  Still assessing all that is touted about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a year now.  It has been a very drying winter so I am especially glad I had the cream to use.  I do believe my pores are slightly smaller.  It is not a miracle cream but I really like it.  No sticky residue and feels cool when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this because it&#x27;s herbal, rather than perfumy. I&#x27;ve used on my hands and face for over a year now, and I think it&#x27;s decreased some of the dark spots on my hands. Especially in winter, it feels very soothing when I put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> love the ingredients.  love how my skin looks when i wake up the following morning.  i would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good night cream and after trying this product for the first time, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  I&#x27;m getting used to the fragrance; kind of refreshing with the herbs, but could be a little sweeter.  It feels very good on my skin and it&#x27;s not oily and not too thin or watery.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have been hearing about the benefits of CoQ10 for the skin by doctors. I am enjoying and to get two jars is quite the deal. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;susan</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past three years and have had no reason to look for a replacement. Good product.</li>
            <li> My wife has several go to beauty products, but this is the one she swears by. Like it better than similar items from Ulta that cost 4x the price.</li>
