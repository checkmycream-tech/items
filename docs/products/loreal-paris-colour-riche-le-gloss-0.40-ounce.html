            <li>It layers well on top of lipstick and adds shine as well as by itself.  </li>
            <li>Will order me more colors</li>
            <li>It is the best and longest lasting gloss that I have tried to date.</li>

            <li>Love this lip gloss color is good and my lips haven&#x27;t been that much chapped since using !</li>
            <li>It is So easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Super pretty color!!</li>
            <li>I didnt give it a full 5 Stars bc</li>
            <li>I love the way it wears on my lips and very creamy.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Great product...a little sticky as all glass feels to me.</li>
            <li>so i would apply lightly and really blend with my finger.</li>
            <li>And I must add I received this very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty, neutral gloss.  </li>
            <li>The delivery system is magnificent however it does not last that long on your lips when can we find something that will last.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips super soft.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this line of lip gloss for a whole now</li>
            <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t feeling this gloss.  </li>
            <li>more of just a clear gloss, not much color to it</li>
            <li>but it was way too sheer and didn&#x27;t last more than an hour or 2.  </li>
            <li>However, I thought that it was pretty chalky in appearance when I actually put it on.</li>
            <li>I do recommend, although be aware that it last like 5 minutes before you need to re-apply.</li>
            <li>It is a little shiny but not too much and the color is great, very subtle.</li>
            <li>Baby Blossom #151 appears in the tube that it would be a very light sheer pale peachy-pink color, probably barely detectable color when on the lips.</li>
            <li>The color is ok, if you blend it well, tends to go on rather heavy, only last about 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Really pretty color, blends well with other stuff too.</li>

            <li> It may have use as a nude lip sort of look if you are wearing heavy smoky eye shadow but other than that it probably won&#x27;t jive with the natural made down</li>
            <li> This lipgloss is tacky and the color is awful, I thought it would be more of a shiny pink</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the wording is, not pleased with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I usually go for day to day.</li>

            <li> I Love the color. It is So easy to put on. It makes your lips super soft. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This lipgloss is tacky and the color is awful, I thought it would be more of a shiny pink but it actually looks melon(ish) I don&#x27;t know what the wording is, not pleased with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> The color is ok, if you blend it well, tends to go on rather heavy, only last about 15 mins.</li>
            <li> Really pretty color, blends well with other stuff too. NO taste, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Very very light amount of color but it perfectly compliments my lips and is perfect for when I want to dress up a bit. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Great product...a little sticky as all glass feels to me. Maybe I need to get used to it? The color looks beautiful. I would say yes all the way.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss. The color is really nice and it stays in nicely and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Super pretty color!! I was looking for a dupe for NARS Turkish Delite and this was it. I didnt give it a full 5 Stars bc it was a TAD sticky.... so i would apply lightly and really blend with my finger.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this line of lip gloss for a whole now and I must say I am HOOKED. The colors are beautiful and smell good too. I love the way it wears on my lips and very creamy. This color goes with any makeup look I wear. And I must add I received this very fast. Thank you !!! :)</li>
            <li> more of just a clear gloss, not much color to it</li>
            <li> This is a great neutral color!  It layers well on top of lipstick and adds shine as well as by itself.  It smells yummy and has great texture, not too sticky!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this lip gloss color is good and my lips haven&#x27;t been that much chapped since using ! Will order me more colors</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal LeGloss in Baby Blossom #151 appears in the tube that it would be a very light sheer pale peachy-pink color, probably barely detectable color when on the lips. However, I thought that it was pretty chalky in appearance when I actually put it on. It may have use as a nude lip sort of look if you are wearing heavy smoky eye shadow but other than that it probably won&#x27;t jive with the natural made down look I usually go for day to day.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is a lot like the Nars lip gloss. I chose baby blossom, and it looks great!    I do recommend, although be aware that it last like 5 minutes before you need to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I usually like loreal products for a drug store brand but I really wasn&#x27;t feeling this gloss.  I don&#x27;t know if it was just the color or what but it was way too sheer and didn&#x27;t last more than an hour or 2.  I can&#x27;t stand re-applying gloss that often so I will not be buying again.  I will stick with VS lipgloss. It is the best and longest lasting gloss that I have tried to date.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss goes on smooth, looks great....but lasts about 10 minutes. I have tried several forms/ways to apply but no luck. It is still a beautiful gloss and I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the color love the texture love the concept.  The delivery system is magnificent however it does not last that long on your lips when can we find something that will last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty, neutral gloss.  Not a lot of color, just a hint but it definitely gets the job done.</li>
