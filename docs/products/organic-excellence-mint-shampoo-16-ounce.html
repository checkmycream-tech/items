            <li>I just tried organic excellence, and I love it!</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels amazing</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>I try not to do that, but sometimes it&#x27;s helpful if the reviewer is honest</li>
            <li>This shampoo is good on many counts.</li>
            <li>Minty aroma is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>- you feel better and look better!  </li>
            <li>I have been a hairstylist for over 10 years and this is by far THE BEST shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a detangler - very light -</li>
            <li>Great smelling and works well with my fine golden locks.</li>
            <li>Very good cleansing natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>I FINALLY have clean, beautiful, healthy, HAPPY hair.</li>
            <li>, like I said before, I love this shampoo-</li>
            <li>I love this :)  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are listed in readable English and seem wonderful from a chemical-free stand point; it is not rated by EWG.  </li>
            <li>Mostly I love the way my hair feels from using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m finding the organic/natural versions of every product I switch is way better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Organic Excellence Shampoo for about 4 years now and love the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>Curls are more manageable</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found an organic shampoo that works better than the salon stuff i was buying before.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than six months now.</li>
            <li>If you have to have a lot of lather and are able to spend a lot of time and effort rinsing, this is probably okay for you.</li>
            <li>Cocamidopropyl betaine is derived from coconut oil, is non-toxic and is used in Johnson&#x27;s Baby Wash. Since it is plant-derived and not a man-made chemical, they are able to list the shampoo as chemical-free.</li>
            <li>And then I had to brush my hair, and when doing this I lost more hair than in the shower.</li>
            <li>most shampoos contain.</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients are organic and does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li>love the smell too.</li>
            <li>Feels very fresh!</li>
            <li>, so I have to use more than I want to which stings cause of the price factor - but it does a fabulous job without making me breakout -</li>
            <li>love the  light peppermint scent</li>
            <li>I have been using a product sold on TV by that famous hairdresser in Los Angeles that is all the rage because it&#x27;s soap free.  </li>
            <li>and I love what it does for my hair, fantastic product.</li>
            <li>As more and more chemical additives to hair care/beauty products become suspect in creating health problems, it&#x27;s good to have alternative products available for those who are chemically sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well with almost no lather, which means it&#x27;s easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic.</li>
            <li>How can it then claim to be chemical free?</li>
            <li>I was worried about finding chemical free products</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted a chemical free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The companion conditioner was used, as recommended, and it didn&#x27;t really smooth out or detangle quite to the degree I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good natural shampoo ever since I figured out</li>
            <li>otherwise its a good really natural shampoo</li>
            <li>Love the minty scent and it really cleans my scalp!</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair.  </li>
            <li>With this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;- Hair quality has significantly improved</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and untangled.</li>
            <li>It does seem to strip the hair clean of build up...which in turn tends to tangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>Cleanses hair and leaves it clean and shiney.</li>
            <li>works so well!  great for dry scalp conditions.  </li>
            <li>I was just about to purchase this product as I have been looking for some good chemical-free products but this DOES contain a potentially toxic chemical: Cocamidopropyl betaine.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and not oily or dry at all - perfect combination!  </li>
            <li>and my hair no longer gets oily quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly better than most of the commercial shampoos that are loaded with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>The mint scent is mild, so if you are not a fan of mint, do not despair, it is not that noticeable.</li>
            <li>Great product, actually produces more lather than I expected from a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, clean, soft and full of volume!  </li>
            <li>The lather is great and the shampoo does not contain the harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>and I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo-have been using since I found at Natural Grocers where I still buy from-</li>
            <li>and Fresh i like</li>
            <li>It made my eyes water the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My quest is to remove as many chemicals from my beauty products as possible while still hiding the gray (yes, I know, chemicals).  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean, non-greasy, not dry, and the color is staying true.  </li>
            <li>I remember once that my hair dresser recommended a shampoo with purified water as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ve never used an organic product before.  </li>
            <li>just wants to give useful information.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is awesome, but it leaves my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li>I chose this because I watched Megan Elizabeth&#x27;s youtube video &amp;#34;My New Favorite Natural Products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The non-scientist in me wonders if more technical words were used would chemical processes materialize, but their website commentary warns about the dangers of certain chemicals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to having more product in my hair for styling, but so far clean hair and a flat iron are doing the trick.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice to finally find a natural shampoo that works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results will obviously vary from person to person, but overall this is a great product for people who are looking for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo product.</li>
            <li>Love the mint smell, leaves my hair very manageable and not overly dry.</li>
            <li>My hair started to fall out in huge chunks in the shower and when I brushed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li>The mint smell is INTENSE.</li>
            <li>Organic Excellence doesn&#x27;t lather much, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>I simply wanted to point out that fact that it is NOT chemical free as advertised.</li>
            <li>Hair feels crazy awesome!!!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m currently switching all of my beauty products to chemical free)</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any minty aroma or feel to it.  </li>
            <li>It does give some lather but not too much.</li>
            <li>It has the same &#x27;good&#x27; effect minus the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use often, and leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Allafia authentic black soap.</li>
            <li>My hair does not dry out after using this shampoo, and looks much better than using an alternate product.</li>
            <li>as I expected, not  foamy lather but does a good job cleaning and leaves my scalp feeling soothed and my thin hair with more body.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lack of that particular agent.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was no longer getting as oily as quickly, by the 3rd week my scalp had gotten used to it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, it is fairly gentle and thoroughly cleans my hair without stripping it of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I love it that is truly natural shampo, so less lather</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough to not dry your hair out but strong enough to get rid of all dirt.</li>
            <li>I am giving it a rating of 3 simply because I HAVE to give a rating, and I am also trying to at least be partially fair because I have not used it.</li>
            <li>His product leaves my hair totally silky, totally tangle free and is also supposed to remove all harmful residues.  </li>
            <li>the first week I used it (on a daily basis)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally a natural shampoo that works!</li>
            <li>The FIRST time I used it I did not lose any hair in the shower or when I brushed it.</li>
            <li>but it leaves your hair more greasy than usual shampoo , would recommend a clarifying shampoo once a week so hairs does not get too oily but</li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find a shampoo that is both truly natural and does a good job, and this is it!  </li>
            <li>I am proundly sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li>Thus far, I like this shampoo and will continue to use it</li>
            <li>I noticed that my scalp would look oily after about 8-9 hours, I almost went and bought another shampoo except I was too busy to make it to the store</li>
            <li>What I may wind up doing is continuing down the path with the organic shampoo and using the tried and true tv product as my conditioner because I know it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>but without it I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;d be easy to comb out my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The initial mint smell is a little strong when applying, but I don&#x27;t smell it after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, normal hair, but find that most natural shampoos either leave my hair feeling gunky or very dry.  </li>
            <li>I am always on the look out for a decent shampoo that won&#x27;t strip or dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly Asian hair.</li>
            <li>The label on the one I get is a little different from the one shown here- mine is more on the tan side with other differences-also cocamidopropyl betaine is not listed in the ingredients-maybe the label on the one shown here is older-&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>For about 4 months I tried expensive organic, chemical free shampoos and conditioners and many DIY recipes that would not clean my at all!</li>
            <li>have very oily skin and scalp (and lots of thick straight hair)</li>
            <li>try a few other chemical free products</li>
            <li>I also use the conditioner to keep my dry hair soft.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this shampoo is awesome, but it leaves my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> I chose this because I watched Megan Elizabeth&#x27;s youtube video &amp;#34;My New Favorite Natural Products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The non-scientist in me wonders if more technical words were used would chemical processes materialize, but their website commentary warns about the dangers of certain chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having more product in my hair for styling, but so far clean hair and a flat iron are doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice to finally find a natural shampoo that works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results will obviously vary from person to person, but overall this is a great product for people who are looking for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo product.</li>
            <li> Love the mint smell, leaves my hair very manageable and not overly dry.</li>
            <li> My hair started to fall out in huge chunks in the shower and when I brushed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> The mint smell is INTENSE.</li>
            <li> Organic Excellence doesn&#x27;t lather much, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I simply wanted to point out that fact that it is NOT chemical free as advertised.</li>
            <li> Hair feels crazy awesome!!!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m currently switching all of my beauty products to chemical free)</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any minty aroma or feel to it.  </li>
            <li> It does give some lather but not too much.</li>
            <li> It has the same &#x27;good&#x27; effect minus the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use often, and leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Allafia authentic black soap.</li>
            <li> My hair does not dry out after using this shampoo, and looks much better than using an alternate product.</li>
            <li> as I expected, not  foamy lather but does a good job cleaning and leaves my scalp feeling soothed and my thin hair with more body.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lack of that particular agent.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was no longer getting as oily as quickly, by the 3rd week my scalp had gotten used to it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> , it is fairly gentle and thoroughly cleans my hair without stripping it of natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I love it that is truly natural shampo, so less lather</li>
            <li> Its gentle enough to not dry your hair out but strong enough to get rid of all dirt.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a rating of 3 simply because I HAVE to give a rating, and I am also trying to at least be partially fair because I have not used it.</li>
            <li> His product leaves my hair totally silky, totally tangle free and is also supposed to remove all harmful residues.  </li>
            <li> the first week I used it (on a daily basis)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally a natural shampoo that works!</li>
            <li> The FIRST time I used it I did not lose any hair in the shower or when I brushed it.</li>
            <li> but it leaves your hair more greasy than usual shampoo , would recommend a clarifying shampoo once a week so hairs does not get too oily but</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a shampoo that is both truly natural and does a good job, and this is it!  </li>
            <li> I am proundly sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li> Thus far, I like this shampoo and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I noticed that my scalp would look oily after about 8-9 hours, I almost went and bought another shampoo except I was too busy to make it to the store</li>
            <li> What I may wind up doing is continuing down the path with the organic shampoo and using the tried and true tv product as my conditioner because I know it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> but without it I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;d be easy to comb out my hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The initial mint smell is a little strong when applying, but I don&#x27;t smell it after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, normal hair, but find that most natural shampoos either leave my hair feeling gunky or very dry.  </li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for a decent shampoo that won&#x27;t strip or dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly Asian hair.</li>
            <li> The label on the one I get is a little different from the one shown here- mine is more on the tan side with other differences-also cocamidopropyl betaine is not listed in the ingredients-maybe the label on the one shown here is older-&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> For about 4 months I tried expensive organic, chemical free shampoos and conditioners and many DIY recipes that would not clean my at all!</li>
            <li> have very oily skin and scalp (and lots of thick straight hair)</li>
            <li> try a few other chemical free products</li>
            <li> I also use the conditioner to keep my dry hair soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo meets that criteria, doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, and smells lightly of mint (not overwhelming).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat against my head and doesn&#x27;t hold styles.  </li>
            <li> This was a concern for my bf, who normally uses conditioner everyday to wash his hair because shampoo leaves his ends dry.</li>
            <li> Even my son who is not sensitive uses it.  </li>
            <li> Every other natural shampoo I tried left my hair feeling limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> My only frame of reference is to other products out there.  </li>
            <li> The side effects of the SLS in ordinary shampoo were unbearable, but the greasy hair from natural shampoo was unbearable too.    </li>
            <li> However, using this particular anti-dandruff shampoo everyday does not make his hair as dry as other shampoos with harsh ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you need To weT your hair a loT</li>
            <li> A little expensive but so worth it!</li>
            <li> it was the sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate (SLS) in ordinary shampoos that left my scalp dry and itchy, caused split ends, and made my hair fall out.    </li>
            <li> It feels a little strange walking around with damp hair that smells like toothpaste.    </li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly without stripping the hair of oils like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wish there were other fragrance options.</li>
            <li> However, it hasn&#x27;t helped my seborrheic dermatitis and that was my goal with this shampoo/conditioner along with other products to treat it.  </li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day and use a conditioner about once a week.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and this helps calm the uncomfortable feeling!</li>
            <li> The individual hairs are very small in diameter, but I have LOTS of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a lot (and I have long hair- not super thick but longish)</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s difficult to make a comparison with other natural organic products.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave hair limp or stripped.  </li>
            <li> but this has to be used fairly consistently, as in at least every other day to everyday to prevent dandruff</li>
            <li> Just plain ordinary shampoo with no mint scent at all.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 4 months now</li>
            <li> My hair also feels thick with lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I mean, I can use a child size ponytail holder for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Trying to find that is next to impossible without paying salon prices.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleaned my  hair sufficiently and didn&#x27;t seem to leave behind any feeling of residue or heaviness on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I finish with a touch of organic cold pressed coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf who suffers from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to get bad dandruff in the winter months, haven&#x27;t had a flake since.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic. It leaves my hair feeling clean and untangled. My hair also feels thick with lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairstylist for over 10 years and this is by far THE BEST shampoo I have ever used! I dont even have to use conditioner anymore, just some oil after my hair dries because it is wavy. My hair looks and feels amazing and I love that it is all natural. I could immediately tell a difference in my hair. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have allergies to most of the chemicals that are in shampoo&#x27;s today - so was very happy when I found this. Doesn&#x27;t lather very well, so I have to use more than I want to which stings cause of the price factor - but it does a fabulous job without making me breakout - so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo-have been using since I found at Natural Grocers where I still buy from- The label on the one I get is a little different from the one shown here- mine is more on the tan side with other differences-also cocamidopropyl betaine is not listed in the ingredients-maybe the label on the one shown here is older-&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, like I said before, I love this shampoo-I like the way it smells, like the way it cleans-it lathers up perfect/ I don&#x27;t have to use a lot (and I have long hair- not super thick but longish)</li>
            <li> this shampoo does everything it says it does. It cleans thoroughly without stripping the hair of oils like other shampoos. Its gentle enough to not dry your hair out but strong enough to get rid of all dirt. I absolutely LOVE it!  The smell is a great plus. It smells like candy canes--very invigorating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good natural shampoo ever since I figured out it was the sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate (SLS) in ordinary shampoos that left my scalp dry and itchy, caused split ends, and made my hair fall out.    The mint smell is INTENSE. It made my eyes water the first time I used it. I wish there were other fragrance options. It feels a little strange walking around with damp hair that smells like toothpaste.    I have thick, naturally blonde hair. The individual hairs are very small in diameter, but I have LOTS of them. Every other natural shampoo I tried left my hair feeling limp and greasy. The side effects of the SLS in ordinary shampoo were unbearable, but the greasy hair from natural shampoo was unbearable too.    Organic Excellence doesn&#x27;t lather much, but I don&#x27;t care. I FINALLY have clean, beautiful, healthy, HAPPY hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff the girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Love the minty scent and it really cleans my scalp! I have seborrheic dermatitis and this helps calm the uncomfortable feeling! Feels very fresh! Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> didnt work well on my hair.  no reflection on the product though.</li>
            <li> I am proundly sensitive to chemicals but I can use this quite well.  Even my son who is not sensitive uses it.  It cleans our hair in just one shampoo.  I also use the conditioner to keep my dry hair soft. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this :)  My hair is soft and clean.  I feel good using it.  I chose this because I watched Megan Elizabeth&#x27;s youtube video &amp;#34;My New Favorite Natural Products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have above-the-shoulder, color-treated hair.  My quest is to remove as many chemicals from my beauty products as possible while still hiding the gray (yes, I know, chemicals).  This shampoo and conditioner seem to fill the bill.  The ingredients are listed in readable English and seem wonderful from a chemical-free stand point; it is not rated by EWG.  The non-scientist in me wonders if more technical words were used would chemical processes materialize, but their website commentary warns about the dangers of certain chemicals so I assume they aren&#x27;t used in their product.  Mostly I love the way my hair feels from using this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is clean, non-greasy, not dry, and the color is staying true.  I do feel it necessary to use the conditioner.  It&#x27;s more of a detangler - very light - but without it I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;d be easy to comb out my hair.  The initial mint smell is a little strong when applying, but I don&#x27;t smell it after rinsing.  I&#x27;m used to having more product in my hair for styling, but so far clean hair and a flat iron are doing the trick.  I&#x27;m very happy.  In response to comments about the coca betaine - their website says they re-formulated the shampoo and got rid of it.  It is not listed on the current bottle ingredients.</li>
            <li> as I expected, not  foamy lather but does a good job cleaning and leaves my scalp feeling soothed and my thin hair with more body. love the  light peppermint scent</li>
            <li> As more and more chemical additives to hair care/beauty products become suspect in creating health problems, it&#x27;s good to have alternative products available for those who are chemically sensitive.  This product does the job and is safe for you and the environment!</li>
            <li> I was just about to purchase this product as I have been looking for some good chemical-free products but this DOES contain a potentially toxic chemical: Cocamidopropyl betaine. How can it then claim to be chemical free? I am giving it a rating of 3 simply because I HAVE to give a rating, and I am also trying to at least be partially fair because I have not used it. I simply wanted to point out that fact that it is NOT chemical free as advertised.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff!! Hair feels crazy awesome!!!</li>
            <li> The reviews made me think my scalp would tingle and my hair would smell like peppermint.  Nothing like that happen.  Just plain ordinary shampoo with no mint scent at all.  Total blah.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair.  I mean, I can use a child size ponytail holder for my hair.  It&#x27;s flat against my head and doesn&#x27;t hold styles.  I LOVE LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner).  My hair is shiny, clean, soft and full of volume!  I was worried about finding chemical free products (I&#x27;m currently switching all of my beauty products to chemical free) but I&#x27;m finding the organic/natural versions of every product I switch is way better.  Think of it like an organic plant based food diet - you feel better and look better!  These products do the same - nature provides us with everything we need.</li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for a decent shampoo that won&#x27;t strip or dry out my hair. I remember once that my hair dresser recommended a shampoo with purified water as the first ingredient. Trying to find that is next to impossible without paying salon prices. This shampoo meets that criteria, doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, and smells lightly of mint (not overwhelming). It lathers with effort, but that&#x27;s because of it&#x27;s lack of that particular agent. Thus far, I like this shampoo and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I have been using Organic Excellence Shampoo for about 4 years now and love the way it leaves my hair. I finish with a touch of organic cold pressed coconut oil. I use to get bad dandruff in the winter months, haven&#x27;t had a flake since. There Vitamin C cream is great also!</li>
            <li> Great cleaner, I&#x27;d call it a clarifying shampoo. The smell is subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a chemical free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and scalp (and lots of thick straight hair) the first week I used it (on a daily basis) I noticed that my scalp would look oily after about 8-9 hours, I almost went and bought another shampoo except I was too busy to make it to the store so I kept using it.  The 2nd week of use I noticed my hair was no longer getting as oily as quickly, by the 3rd week my scalp had gotten used to it and my hair no longer gets oily quickly, I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 4 months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you smell it in the bottle it does smell minty but my hair does not smell minty after rinsing and drying my hair (I personally don&#x27;t mind this) although I also started dying my hair at around the same time so maybe that&#x27;s why my hair doesn&#x27;t retain a minty smell??</li>
            <li> Great smelling and works well with my fine golden locks.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve never used an organic product before.  So it&#x27;s difficult to make a comparison with other natural organic products.  My only frame of reference is to other products out there.  This shampoo cleaned my  hair sufficiently and didn&#x27;t seem to leave behind any feeling of residue or heaviness on my hair.  It lathers nicely.  I really didn&#x27;t notice any minty aroma or feel to it.  It does seem to strip the hair clean of build up...which in turn tends to tangle my hair.  The companion conditioner was used, as recommended, and it didn&#x27;t really smooth out or detangle quite to the degree I&#x27;d like.  I have been using a product sold on TV by that famous hairdresser in Los Angeles that is all the rage because it&#x27;s soap free.  His product leaves my hair totally silky, totally tangle free and is also supposed to remove all harmful residues.  However, it hasn&#x27;t helped my seborrheic dermatitis and that was my goal with this shampoo/conditioner along with other products to treat it.  What I may wind up doing is continuing down the path with the organic shampoo and using the tried and true tv product as my conditioner because I know it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly Asian hair. With this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;- Hair quality has significantly improved&lt;br /&gt;- Hair fall has reduced&lt;br /&gt;- Curls are more manageable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a natural shampoo that works!</li>
            <li> Packaging is different from the picture on the Amazon site.  Works great.!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and not oily or dry at all - perfect combination!  I can&#x27;t believe I found an organic shampoo that works better than the salon stuff i was buying before.</li>
            <li> My scalp itched terriby after using.  I must be allergic to something in the shampoo &amp; wish I had not ordered it.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. I have been using it for more than six months now. I use the shampoo and the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I try a few other chemical free products but this is just wonderful. It has the same &#x27;good&#x27; effect minus the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I never needed to get back to the chemical products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up quite a bit, which means it has some type of chemical I don&#x27;t want. I much prefer Allafia authentic black soap. It cleans well with almost no lather, which means it&#x27;s easy to rinse. If you have to have a lot of lather and are able to spend a lot of time and effort rinsing, this is probably okay for you. It&#x27;s certainly better than most of the commercial shampoos that are loaded with toxic chemicals. My apologies for mentioning another product in the review. I try not to do that, but sometimes it&#x27;s helpful if the reviewer is honest just wants to give useful information.</li>
            <li> Cocamidopropyl betaine is derived from coconut oil, is non-toxic and is used in Johnson&#x27;s Baby Wash. Since it is plant-derived and not a man-made chemical, they are able to list the shampoo as chemical-free. This shampoo is great for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, actually produces more lather than I expected from a sulfate free shampoo. Love the mint smell, leaves my hair very manageable and not overly dry.</li>
            <li> For about 4 months I tried expensive organic, chemical free shampoos and conditioners and many DIY recipes that would not clean my at all! My hair started to fall out in huge chunks in the shower and when I brushed. The plumber actually had to come out twice to pull all of my hair out of the drain and when I finished my shower I would have to pull my hair out of the shower so the water could drain. My hair was thin!!! And then I had to brush my hair, and when doing this I lost more hair than in the shower. In desperation, I threw my distinguishing hair in a bun and went to the store to get this shampoo and conditioner. The FIRST time I used it I did not lose any hair in the shower or when I brushed it. NOT ONE!! And it got my hair completely clean!!! A little expensive but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Very good cleansing natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf who suffers from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says it works well for preventing dandruff but this has to be used fairly consistently, as in at least every other day to everyday to prevent dandruff otherwise it will come back. This was a concern for my bf, who normally uses conditioner everyday to wash his hair because shampoo leaves his ends dry. However, using this particular anti-dandruff shampoo everyday does not make his hair as dry as other shampoos with harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results will obviously vary from person to person, but overall this is a great product for people who are looking for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Mint smell is great. I don&#x27;t get the greasy feeling others do. Hair feels great and thicker. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cleanses hair and leaves it clean and shiney. I have colored hair and this doesn&#x27;t fade color. Minty aroma is pleasant and not too strong. It does give some lather but not too much. I got this on auto ship so I will always have a bottle on hand. Nice to finally find a natural shampoo that works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good on many counts. The lather is great and the shampoo does not contain the harsh chemicals most shampoos contain.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this shampoo!  I&#x27;d recommend it and buy it again in a heartbeat.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use often, and leaves my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells minTy and Fresh i like iT you need To weT your hair a loT beFore applying iT in order For iT To laTher up.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is awesome, but it leaves my hair a little dry. I have to use wen as a conditioner after.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems using this shampoo. Most of the ingredients are organic and does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate. My hair does not dry out after using this shampoo, and looks much better than using an alternate product.</li>
            <li> works so well!  great for dry scalp conditions.  doesn&#x27;t leave hair limp or stripped.  love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I just tried organic excellence, and I love it! I just started detoxing my home of chemicals and this was the 1st shampoo and conditioner I tried, so happy with it. I bought from EarthTurns.com, great price too!!!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a shampoo that is both truly natural and does a good job, and this is it!  I have very thick, normal hair, but find that most natural shampoos either leave my hair feeling gunky or very dry.  This does neither, it is fairly gentle and thoroughly cleans my hair without stripping it of natural oils.  I shampoo every other day and use a conditioner about once a week.  The mint scent is mild, so if you are not a fan of mint, do not despair, it is not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and I love what it does for my hair, fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I love it that is truly natural shampo, so less lather but it leaves your hair more greasy than usual shampoo , would recommend a clarifying shampoo once a week so hairs does not get too oily but otherwise its a good really natural shampoo</li>
            <li> Never used this brand before, but as I begin to try more organic beauty products, this one stands out as superb!</li>
