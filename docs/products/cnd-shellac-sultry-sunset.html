            <li>It is a beautiful shimmery pink with a lean on the lavender tones.  </li>

            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a little more frost than I prefer, but it is a pretty color.</li>
            <li>A little different color that i thought, but its good</li>
            <li>Hope some new color might have a touch of frost too.</li>
            <li>I love the slight purple tones in the pink and the bit of metallic to it.</li>
