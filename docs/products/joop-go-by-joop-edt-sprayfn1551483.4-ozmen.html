            <li>I have had so many women tell me that I smell great.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and  will never be without it!</li>
            <li>I have always loved the original Joop!  </li>
            <li>was delivered in a timely manner, just not as good as the original</li>
            <li>Very  unusual and &#x60;dazzling&#x60; I would say.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product that gets me quite a lot of positive attention.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Totally underrated, one of the best colognes on the market.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>You guys know me by now - I am confident</li>
            <li>my own skin\\&quot; - not a bad thing</li>
            <li>- Go offers great versatility and flexibility that you can wear any time of year, time of the day, and for any occasion.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has consistently good prices on this cologne and fast ship times.</li>
            <li>It is really that good...</li>
            <li>I found it here in Spain at a duty free shop at the airport and immediately bought two bottles.  </li>
            <li>My first of the Joop fragrances, like many guys, was the original - while I like it, original may be at the lower end of my favorite list.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my co-workers appreciate it, but I enjoy smelling of cologne rather than sweat, and my wife commented that she like the way my shirts smell when I was home on leave from my job as a contractor in Kabul.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Go is pleasant from the beginning - out of the bottle with notes of fruit, floral, and spice that settles into a sweet (but not too sweet) fragrance that is easy on the nose and masculine.  </li>
            <li>cologne has a great and unique scent that last long and will leave great impressions to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was a nice surprise knowing this new scent.</li>
            <li>Much too strong, spicy, and at times, overbearing.  </li>
            <li>The first cologne I tried was  Joop!</li>
            <li>Sweetie really hooked me up..!!  </li>
            <li>Amazing fresh fragrance for daily and party use.</li>
            <li>My roommate asked me about it and would constantly \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; it because he really liked the scent and his girls, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am becoming a huge fan of these lesser known Joop fragrances.  </li>
            <li>A current check yields that Go is listing for a little over $30.00 for a large bottle - great buy..!!  </li>
            <li>I first encountered Joop Go through a friend.</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me get some!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Surely a recommend who like to use fragrance on a regular basis</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fragrance with a unique scent, above average longevity, and a good price/value, I recommend Joop Go..</li>
            <li>I had never smelled this cologne and went purely on Amazon customer responses and pulled the trigger on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li>The gf wants it all the time now.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some men will wear a cologne that projects a mile away, and is very overpowering and this really turns women off.</li>
            <li>This Joop Go kicks it up to a whole new level!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to keep wearing this and glad Amazon carries it since I&#x27;ll be back in the US soon.</li>
            <li>Everyday in class I could smell his cologne and it intrigued me because it was really nice, different.  </li>
            <li>I regret deeply this purchase, specially because it was my birthday present.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for multiple responses from women when you walk by them, don&#x27;t be surprised if some random girl/women grabs your ass and tells you how good you smell, and be prepared to have your clothes ripped off when you&#x27;re having 1 on 1 time!  </li>
            <li>But with this cologne, you only get a slight smell of the fragrance at a range of about 5 feet, and this makes women want to get closer to you to smell it even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cologne fanatic and love wearing different colognes that sets the tone for my day, what I&#x27;m wearing, certain functions I&#x27;m attending, and etc.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, not to heavy, but last a long time.</li>
            <li>The top did not leak or fall off during travel, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past with other colognes.</li>
            <li>/sillage is above average and so is the longevity, lasting the whole work day on the skin and shirt</li>

            <li> My husband and I love it and great price.</li>
            <li> very good stuff........its lasts very very long. and very appealing to everyone....everyone always asks when my boyfriend wears it.....i love it. good price from amazon too...</li>
            <li> I first encountered Joop Go through a friend. Everyday in class I could smell his cologne and it intrigued me because it was really nice, different.  It didn&#x27;t put me off like a lot of colognes and perfumes do. I found it here in Spain at a duty free shop at the airport and immediately bought two bottles.  My roommate asked me about it and would constantly \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; it because he really liked the scent and his girls, too. I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments from guys and girls. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep wearing this and glad Amazon carries it since I&#x27;ll be back in the US soon.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Joop&#x60;s company for years. The first cologne I tried was  Joop! HOMME - and I like it a lot. The scent stays for hours and hours.  Now I have been wearing Joop! GO - and it was a nice surprise knowing this new scent. Very  unusual and &#x60;dazzling&#x60; I would say.</li>
            <li> I buy regular joop a lot. My gf bought me this as a surprise. Very different from the regular one but still dinstinct. The gf wants it all the time now. Thanks for helping me get some!</li>
            <li> Fellas!  Let me tell you this!  I&#x27;m a cologne fanatic and love wearing different colognes that sets the tone for my day, what I&#x27;m wearing, certain functions I&#x27;m attending, and etc. I had never smelled this cologne and went purely on Amazon customer responses and pulled the trigger on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down to the nitty gritty!  Be prepared for multiple responses from women when you walk by them, don&#x27;t be surprised if some random girl/women grabs your ass and tells you how good you smell, and be prepared to have your clothes ripped off when you&#x27;re having 1 on 1 time!  hahahahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne has a great and unique scent that last long and will leave great impressions to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this and thank me later!  ;-)</li>
            <li> Totally underrated, one of the best colognes on the market.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the original Joop!  This Joop Go kicks it up to a whole new level! I love this scent and  will never be without it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.  It is sweet/clean yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it off-and-on since about 2009 when I discovered this scent on a trip to the United Kingdom.  It&#x27;s not easy to find in the U.S. and I always wind up buying it online.  Amazon has consistently good prices on this cologne and fast ship times.</li>
            <li> So Joop Go was the last of my 2012 Christmas colognes... Sweetie really hooked me up..!!  And as the saying goes, \\&quot;saving the best for last\\&quot; is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am becoming a huge fan of these lesser known Joop fragrances.  My first of the Joop fragrances, like many guys, was the original - while I like it, original may be at the lower end of my favorite list.  Much too strong, spicy, and at times, overbearing.  Not so with the lesser known Joop fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go is pleasant from the beginning - out of the bottle with notes of fruit, floral, and spice that settles into a sweet (but not too sweet) fragrance that is easy on the nose and masculine.  Very nice - well done Joop..!! The projection/sillage is above average and so is the longevity, lasting the whole work day on the skin and shirt sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not received compliments outside of Sweetie - she loves that \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell that blends a touch of woods.  I truly believe it has the potential to get you noticed.  You guys know me by now - I am confident \\&quot;in my own skin\\&quot; - not a bad thing - it is what it is - Go offers great versatility and flexibility that you can wear any time of year, time of the day, and for any occasion.  It is really that good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last measure to speak of is value.  A current check yields that Go is listing for a little over $30.00 for a large bottle - great buy..!!  If you are looking for a fragrance with a unique scent, above average longevity, and a good price/value, I recommend Joop Go..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final tally of Go is 4.6 stars out of 5 stars.  You will be hooked... Make it count today...</li>
            <li> Amazing fresh fragrance for daily and party use. Surely a recommend who like to use fragrance on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Good negotiation. The product arrived in the estimated date.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a watered down version, i don&#x27;t know but its not the quality i normally get. from joop.</li>
            <li> I have had so many women tell me that I smell great. I&#x27;ve even been walking through stores, or at work and would have women and co-workers stop me, so they could smell me. This is a very nice product that gets me quite a lot of positive attention. It does not project obnoxiously, so if you only spray 3-5 sprays on your body, people shouldn&#x27;t smell you until they are close to you. I have noticed some men will wear a cologne that projects a mile away, and is very overpowering and this really turns women off. But with this cologne, you only get a slight smell of the fragrance at a range of about 5 feet, and this makes women want to get closer to you to smell it even more.</li>
            <li> I spritz a bit of this on before going to work. I don&#x27;t know if my co-workers appreciate it, but I enjoy smelling of cologne rather than sweat, and my wife commented that she like the way my shirts smell when I was home on leave from my job as a contractor in Kabul. The bottle is glass, so I&#x27;m careful how I pack it when I travel. The top did not leak or fall off during travel, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past with other colognes. This is not an overpowering scent. I would describe it as mellow.</li>
            <li> was delivered in a timely manner, just not as good as the original</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this. It is a scam. I regret deeply this purchase, specially because it was my birthday present. If the smell lasts 15 minutes is a lot. Be careful and stay away from this product. Its a shame that Amazon gives place to people to sell this</li>
            <li> Love the smell, not to heavy, but last a long time.</li>
    </ol>
