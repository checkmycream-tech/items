            <li>This dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have since successfully registered this on the GHD website.</li>
            <li>Really good experience.</li>

            <li>Glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I have frizzy and curly hair and while there is still some frizz, the volume and softness in the hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>Wonderful hair dryer and is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I got a ridiculously good deal on this dryer but having used it I might consider paying full price.</li>
            <li>one had good power and nice airflow for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li>I was able to go to GHD&#x27;s website and register it as well.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding machinery to perform with excellence.  </li>
            <li>and yes I will recommend it to the world! :)</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Just registered my wife&#x27;s air dryer and happy to know its the real deal.</li>
            <li>It does work better than my 30.00 hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is a quiet, wonderful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>They MAY be able to make an exception to policy.</li>
            <li>They MAY be able help you.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair yesterday as soon as I received this excellent hair dryer; and I could not be more happier.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This means that GHD may refused to repair your product even if it is genuine.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and they sent another dryer to me free of charge.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even been using any product because my hair comes out silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Received in March 2015 and registered the product right away, it is indeed authentic.  </li>
            <li>My dryer, purchased/sold by Amazon, is genuine with an original hologram sticker and code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good hair dryer although it does not surfeit any buyer&#x27;s remorse as one debates whether it is worth the high price.</li>
            <li>First of all, I purchased this from Amazon and it is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>This dryer is much more lightweight and easy to use, although it may just feel more lightweight because it dries my hair so much faster-probably 10 minutes total versus 20ish even with a nice dryer.  </li>
            <li>Good grip, can&#x27;t say enough about the need for buttons being out of the way of the grip.  </li>
            <li>I have no proof of this, but as GHD is very desirable brand to counterfeit, it seems plausible.</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much.</li>
            <li>Smooth powerful quick drying.</li>
            <li>you use the air concentrator nozzles they will get very, very, very hot.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer is unbelievably fast and provides a glossy, shiny look very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have short super  fine hair, and have tried everything to get more volume.  </li>
            <li>If you already purchased a GHD product and have issues, CALL GHD FIRST!</li>
            <li>And if you find yourself asking whether it is worth the price, it is.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I was well taken care of by GHD, it’s worth the call.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wanted a good and fast dryer for my long hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has never dried so quickly!  </li>
            <li>Flat-iron plate hot</li>
            <li>If this happened to you, CALL GHD FIRST.</li>
            <li>Love it and if you take the plunge, you will never look back!</li>
            <li>The thing that has amazed me the most and which makes this well worth the money is the way my hair feels after I dry my hair with the GHD.</li>
            <li>The controls are easy to use although the cold button is easy to catch with my thumb, and the cord is of a good length.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, but with all that power comes a little more weight</li>
            <li>this one thinking that if it costs so much it should be pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, smooth and it looks like I just left the beauty salon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it really .can</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve really arrived in the world using this machine.</li>
            <li>Not noisy and very efficient.</li>
            <li>I would probably advise against it if you have thin hair, it gives me great movement through the length of my hair but is a bit of a volume killer at the roots.</li>
            <li>The attachments are nice and narrow, and they stay attached really well.</li>
            <li>The filter itself is easy to clean without removing it from the dryer but to clean behind it the filter must be removed.</li>
            <li>The dryer isn&#x27;t too heavy and is very easy to hold while drying.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair quickly, leaves it shiny and smooth, is not too heavy but still feels substantial and well-built.</li>
            <li>The dryer works so much faster than a normal consumer line product.</li>
            <li>The dryer works so much faster than a normal consumer line product.</li>
            <li>(I was actually fiddling with the cool shot thinking</li>
            <li>Not sure if the real GHD would do a better job.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it was time to try something new.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have to go back over it in the morning to smooth my frizzy hair back out.  </li>
            <li>the GHD Air Professional Performance hair dryer have done was promised!</li>
            <li>The only negative is the weight of the dryer, works exactly as promised, my hair has never looked better or been healthier</li>
            <li>I am not a hair styling professional.</li>
            <li>The GHD Hair dryer is truly a professional quality dryer which everyone needs in their life.</li>
            <li>and I will come back and probably give it 5 stars after I test it out some more and eat some humble pie.</li>
            <li>For so many years I have wasted so much money for a professional blow dry!!</li>
            <li>I bought this as I have long very curly hair which I like to straighten.</li>
            <li>Overall, the dryer feels like a really well built piece of equipment that should last a really long time.nd they stay attached really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and leaves my hair soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fits my hand and is not very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t pressed the high setting in deep enough.</li>
            <li>Overall, the dryer feels like a really well built piece of equipment that should last a really long time.</li>
            <li>This dryer is powerful enough to do this so that I barely need to use my GHD Straighteners, just run them through a few times.</li>
            <li>Ok - I wrote a bad review at first because I messed up how I was working the buttons.</li>
            <li>Dries my thick coarse hair quickly and smooths it out like silk.</li>

            <li> If you buy a “Grey” market camera (purchased outside of Nikon USA import channels) they will not repair it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was weird that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get high heat or the air flow higher...</li>
            <li> I have long, hair with a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> Dries my long and thick hair fast and gives lots of volume.</li>
            <li> Then it started filling up with junk, right behind the filter.</li>
            <li> This dryer is expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Took forever to dry my hair and my hand was killing me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not blasting away and burning your scalp-it will still dry your hair faster</li>

            <li> The only thing to mention is that the cold shot button is a little hard to press and the attachments get pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I had ordered it for my wife and I received this just a few minutes back.</li>
            <li> was empty.</li>
            <li> Mine is not a real GHD.  </li>
            <li> Whilst it is expensive, I believe that it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I got a few years back to replace a busted T3 b/c it was heavy, took a long time to dry my hair, and the style didn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> My hair was dry in 10 minutes (usually took 20 with my last dryer) &amp; my hair was silky &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to dry my hair from towel dried.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to dry my hair from towel dried.</li>
            <li> My wife has other GHD products which have a &amp;#34;Date code&amp;#34; (not data code) and a hologram sticker with hologram code.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that even if I don&#x27;t blow dry all the way it still holds the style quite well with little frizz.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s a bit heavy and does not come with a diffuser attachment which I need in order to dry my hair into curls.</li>
            <li> It takes me half the time it previously took to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> some may view this as unfair, but this is no different from other manufactures such as Nikon.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and use high end styling tools (usually Sedu)</li>
            <li> It has been used less then 7 times per week.</li>
            <li> My guess is that someone in the shipment chain is stealing the labels off the products for resale on the black market.</li>
            <li> My dryer is only a week old so the cold shot button may loosen up over time.</li>

            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d somehow accidentally activated it because it wasn&#x27;t crazy hot).  </li>
            <li> The only small complaint would be that its a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Helps me to cut down on the drying time!</li>
            <li> My T3 dried my hair a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it heavy.</li>
            <li> Not impressed will be shipping back.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure how, but it does.  </li>

            <li> I picked the option where it was &amp;#34;sold and shipped by Amazon.com LLC&amp;#34;. I had ordered it for my wife and I received this just a few minutes back. She tried registering it on the ghd website. The &amp;#34;Date code&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Hologram code&amp;#34; are required for registration (required for manufacturer warranty) and this did not have the Hologram at all - the spot where the hologram goes was empty. Also, the sticker on the dryer says &amp;#34;data code&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Date code&amp;#34;. My wife has other GHD products which have a &amp;#34;Date code&amp;#34; (not data code) and a hologram sticker with hologram code.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Helps me to cut down on the drying time! Recommended by my hairstylist and she was so correct that I should buy the one that she uses in the salon!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. Turned out to be fake. Amazon seemed disinterested about this development. What a mess. Avoid this like the plague.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  I have long, hair with a lot of volume.  This dryer is unbelievably fast and provides a glossy, shiny look very quickly.  And if you find yourself asking whether it is worth the price, it is.</li>
            <li> A good hair dryer although it does not surfeit any buyer&#x27;s remorse as one debates whether it is worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair dryer and is the real deal.  I was able to go to GHD&#x27;s website and register it as well.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly ordered this item due to the poor reviews regarding authenticity. I just went to the ghd website to register the hairdryer and had NO problem with the process! I know the product is a good one as I have used it before! Really good experience. Glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li> For so many years I have wasted so much money for a professional blow dry!! Not anymore! This is an outstanding machinery to perform with excellence.  I blow dry my hair yesterday as soon as I received this excellent hair dryer; and I could not be more happier.  My hair is shiny, smooth and it looks like I just left the beauty salon.  I have curly processes hair (highlights) and the GHD Air Professional Performance hair dryer have done was promised! Awesome product and yes I will recommend it to the world! :)</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Cuts my drying time shorter.  Amazon has great price compared to sephora.</li>
            <li> Just registered my wife&#x27;s air dryer and happy to know its the real deal. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!  Good grip, can&#x27;t say enough about the need for buttons being out of the way of the grip.  This one was well thought out.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Mine is not a real GHD.  You cannot register it as there is no hologram code.  Not impressed will be shipping back.  I did use it a couple of times before I went to register it.  It does work better than my 30.00 hair dryer.  I may just go back with a T3.  Not sure if the real GHD would do a better job.  My T3 dried my hair a lot faster.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Just got it in the mail today and immediately registered with GHD no problems.</li>
            <li> Dries my long and thick hair fast and gives lots of volume. The only small complaint would be that its a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it really .can I return it?</li>
            <li> I am not a hair styling professional. I just wanted a good and fast dryer for my long hair. Decided to go with this one thinking that if it costs so much it should be pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one had good power and nice airflow for the first couple of months. Then it started filling up with junk, right behind the filter. The filter itself is easy to clean without removing it from the dryer but to clean behind it the filter must be removed. I could not do it no matter what I tried. I even tried using some plier-like tools that scratched the filter but it still wouldn&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after a few months of use the air flow is somewhat restricted and it getting worse. For $220 this shouldn&#x27;t be happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December, 2015, it started making whining noises. It has been used less then 7 times per week. I would think for this price it should last longer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase!!!! Very powerful, but with all that power comes a little more weight then I was expecting. I would purchase this item again if ever needed.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the weight of the dryer, works exactly as promised, my hair has never looked better or been healthier</li>
            <li> Now *this* is a hair dryer. I feel like I&#x27;ve really arrived in the world using this machine. No more picking up disappointing dryers at the drug store as an afterthought. It&#x27;s quiet (especially compared to my Conair Infiniti Pro). It drys my hair quickly, leaves it shiny and smooth, is not too heavy but still feels substantial and well-built. The dryer is Italian made. I got a ridiculously good deal on this dryer but having used it I might consider paying full price. My dryer, purchased/sold by Amazon, is genuine with an original hologram sticker and code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the air concentrator nozzles they will get very, very, very hot. Flat-iron plate hot so watch your fingers!</li>
            <li> This is a quiet, wonderful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Ok - I wrote a bad review at first because I messed up how I was working the buttons. I hadn&#x27;t pressed the high setting in deep enough. I thought it was weird that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get high heat or the air flow higher... it&#x27;s actually really, really good and I will come back and probably give it 5 stars after I test it out some more and eat some humble pie. I totally admit to user error on this one and will return with pics, update, etc.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new dryer. It&#x27;s fast and leaves my hair soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fits my hand and is not very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;If you have been on the fence - get it.</li>
            <li> This blow drier dries my hair in half the time and leaves it with volume and shine all day!!  I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this product is a must.  I wish I had had one years ago.  It is worth every penny.  I have short super  fine hair, and have tried everything to get more volume.  It&#x27;s 11.30 pm and my hair looks like I just styled it!</li>
            <li> Very heavy. Took forever to dry my hair and my hand was killing me.</li>
            <li> I have used T3 products for the last several years &amp; wasn&#x27;t getting salon quality blowouts so I thought it was time to try something new. I am so glad I did! This dryer is amazing! It has good air flow &amp; temperature controls. My hair was dry in 10 minutes (usually took 20 with my last dryer) &amp; my hair was silky &amp; shiny. Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have long very curly hair which I like to straighten. This dryer is powerful enough to do this so that I barely need to use my GHD Straighteners, just run them through a few times. The controls are easy to use although the cold button is easy to catch with my thumb, and the cord is of a good length. Whilst it is expensive, I believe that it is worth the cost. I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s a bit heavy and does not come with a diffuser attachment which I need in order to dry my hair into curls.</li>
            <li> Lives up to its reputation. Smooth powerful quick drying. Not noisy and very efficient. I believe healthier drying process for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have no problem registering this product with GHD official web site.</li>
            <li> arrived in time, registered with GHD no problems. Like this dryer a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I ever have😀😀😀</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my experience with everybody to help clarify some misinformation. If you already purchased a GHD product and have issues, CALL GHD FIRST! They MAY be able to make an exception to policy. I was well taken care of by GHD, it’s worth the call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Amazon.com is NOT an authorized retailer of GHD products. What does this mean? This means that GHD may refused to repair your product even if it is genuine. For information on which stores are authorized, call GHD. They have a recording that states which stores are authorized to sell their products. The statement below is from the GHD website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there are some exclusions to the warranty.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; • The warranty will not cover any fault caused through incorrect usage.&lt;br /&gt; • We are also unable to cover any fault caused by accidental damage.&lt;br /&gt; • The warranty is also void if any repair has been attempted by a third party.&lt;br /&gt; • We are also unable to honour any warranty where your  styler has been purchased from an unauthorised distributor; in this instance your consumer rights would lie with the point of sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some may view this as unfair, but this is no different from other manufactures such as Nikon. If you buy a “Grey” market camera (purchased outside of Nikon USA import channels) they will not repair it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my dryer came with the authenticity hologram removed from the cord. I contacted Amazon and they sent another dryer to me free of charge. The second dryer also had the hologram removed. My guess is that someone in the shipment chain is stealing the labels off the products for resale on the black market. I have no proof of this, but as GHD is very desirable brand to counterfeit, it seems plausible. If this happened to you, CALL GHD FIRST. They MAY be able help you. I contacted GHD and verified that my dryer was authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the good stuff. I love this dryer. The attachments are nice and narrow, and they stay attached really well. The dryer works so much faster than a normal consumer line product. The dryer is really quiet. I usually use the dryer on the low heat setting and the low speed setting. I’m male with about 4 inches of hair length. It only takes a few minutes to dry my hair from towel dried. The only thing to mention is that the cold shot button is a little hard to press and the attachments get pretty hot. The attachments have a warning card on them in the box. My dryer is only a week old so the cold shot button may loosen up over time. Overall, the dryer feels like a really well built piece of equipment that should last a really long time.nd they stay attached really well.

            <li> Received in March 2015 and registered the product right away, it is indeed authentic.  It&#x27;s also awesome.  I have very thick hair and use high end styling tools (usually Sedu) and this is by far the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve had.  I decided to replace my SuperSolano I got a few years back to replace a busted T3 b/c it was heavy, took a long time to dry my hair, and the style didn&#x27;t stay so I&#x27;d have to go back over it in the morning to smooth my frizzy hair back out.  This dryer is much more lightweight and easy to use, although it may just feel more lightweight because it dries my hair so much faster-probably 10 minutes total versus 20ish even with a nice dryer.  Don&#x27;t be scared when you turn it on and it&#x27;s not blasting away and burning your scalp-it will still dry your hair faster (I was actually fiddling with the cool shot thinking I&#x27;d somehow accidentally activated it because it wasn&#x27;t crazy hot).  Not really sure how, but it does.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that even if I don&#x27;t blow dry all the way it still holds the style quite well with little frizz.  Haven&#x27;t even been using any product because my hair comes out silky smooth.  I would probably advise against it if you have thin hair, it gives me great movement through the length of my hair but is a bit of a volume killer at the roots.</li>
            <li> The GHD Hair dryer is truly a professional quality dryer which everyone needs in their life. First of all, I purchased this from Amazon and it is 100% authentic. I have since successfully registered this on the GHD website. The dryer isn&#x27;t too heavy and is very easy to hold while drying. It takes me half the time it previously took to dry my hair. The thing that has amazed me the most and which makes this well worth the money is the way my hair feels after I dry my hair with the GHD. I have frizzy and curly hair and while there is still some frizz, the volume and softness in the hair is amazing. The rest of the frizz disappears with my GHD styler which may I just say has made me a GHD fan for life! Love it and if you take the plunge, you will never look back!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t find it heavy. Dries my thick coarse hair quickly and smooths it out like silk. I love this thing so much.</li>
            <li> My hair has never dried so quickly!  This dryer is expensive, but worth it!</li>
