            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love LA Looks Sport Gel.  </li>
            <li>my hair looks ok in the morning</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>I guess rather than a lions mane :)</li>
            <li>I have bottles of this for reassurance I am able to keep my unmanageable hair in place all day.</li>
            <li>I love L.A. Gel.  </li>
            <li>It is my husbands favorite hair gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>but, i love to use this.</li>
            <li>I look extremely handsome again and feel like a thousandaire.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair thicker, and fuller, and seems to hold in place better.</li>
            <li>this is a pretty good gel.</li>
            <li>I am glad this was cheap because it is going in the trash.</li>
            <li>for this product, the minimal amount is best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the best results using this product, than virtually any other.</li>
            <li>Strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its strong and holds for a while.</li>
            <li>but if you use as directed, it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this gel, I&#x27;ve been having some great hair days at a very low price.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>I like it as it is alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>Beware of fakes and cheap knock offs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but it does the trick.  </li>
            <li>, it has a lot nicer smell, and it has a far superior hold.</li>
            <li>Ladies love a man who grooms himself right, so this definetely gets their attention as well.  </li>
            <li>Also, unlike the Ouidad Climate Control Gel (which I will use on top of this gel in very high dew points) it has no silicones in it.  </li>
            <li>This gel is good for those following the Curly Girl Method.  </li>
            <li>I have the best hair in my life, seriously.</li>
            <li>have straight short hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>I been using this product for more than 3 years, and I have to say this is the best gel I have ever used, but however online this product is a little pricey, in my local Beauty supply</li>
            <li>I will admit this gel gives the best hold for my natural botticelli curls, especially in this humid climate I live in.</li>
            <li>It does hold firm though, if it doesn&#x27;t have the flake problem it would be great.</li>
            <li>, and I thought this would be a good gel to try over my leave-in conditioner on my wet hair (post-shower).</li>
            <li>More like light to moderate hold.  </li>
            <li>I have been using different gels, trying to find one that I liked.  </li>
            <li>I use on wet hair out of the shower; let dry overnight for best results.</li>
            <li>For girls hair I believe this gel (L.A Looks) works fairly well, My mom uses it to keep the frizziness of her hair down in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Although there are other gels available this is the most accessible with its very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I probably only use a dime size amount and its just right, any more</li>
            <li>dry my hair after a shower, comb my hair, and it looks great all day -- and for me, most importantly, not looking like I have goop in my hair.</li>
            <li>Use more or less depending on how strong you want the hold to be.</li>
            <li>Even though this same brand makes curly hair gel, i think this is better because it has a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>It was my first experience..</li>
            <li>While it has a powerful hold that gave me great curl definition, it left flakes within a few hours.</li>
            <li>I am using Fructis now, which costs about two dollars more for about half the amount, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>I get really springy, well defined curls with it.  </li>
            <li>Holds very curly and wavy hair</li>
            <li>LA Looks gels are VERY FLAKY and do not hold well.</li>
            <li>my hair is curly, really long,thick, and frizzy, and this works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I have never found any hair product that I like as much as this</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon and it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This gel dries out my hair and is much more flaky than any other gel I have used.</li>
            <li>I need this baby to look sharp and sexy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly a high end hair product girl...</li>
            <li>When it comes to gel, it is worth paying the extra few dollars and getting a better one.  </li>
            <li>When i go outside for gym class on an extremely hot day, my gair stays curly and non frizzy the whole time.</li>
            <li>So I just apply it further down and to the ends to keep my curls from frizzing in this hot &amp; humid weather  :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people like myself who live an exercise lifestyle as well.</li>
            <li>It is soooo humid where I live</li>
            <li>My curls are completely frizz-free with this gel!  </li>
            <li>You can make it as stiff or as soft-appearing as you like, and this size of container will last a good long time, if used judiciously or otherwise.</li>
            <li>I find that when I put it on the hair on my scalp, that it dries exactly like it looks, for me that means my hair looks super wet all day even when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>and it looks so natural not shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel since I was 14 years old.</li>
            <li>As an Asian man I have very unpliable hair</li>
            <li>It can leave some white residue if you put TOO MUCH on your hair</li>
            <li>Then I just have soft, defined curls.</li>
            <li>I have ever used, and I WAS a fan of the natural look.</li>
            <li>American Crew is more expensive but it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>Seriously this was much better than any of the salon products I had been trying.</li>
            <li>If you have short buzz military type of haircut, then the low hold (7 or below) is fine.  </li>
            <li>My previous favorites were Kinky Curly Curling Custard and Ouidad Climate Control, but this is just as good in terms of curl definition, dries with less crunch than Kinky Curly, and is only $2 or $3 at drug stores, supermarkets and big box retailers for 20 oz.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Just like a previous reviewer said, some of my hair was so full of flakes, that one of my co-workers thought I had developed white hair over night.</li>
            <li>I put in on and comb it all back for a classic Asian look.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not last long, it is very, very flaky.  </li>
            <li>My hair was looking better, but not great until I tried this gel.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, so no natural gray hair yet.</li>
            <li>It does dry with a bit of crunch, but I scrunch it out and get soft curls.  </li>
            <li>For those people that have black colored hair(mine is jet black and never been any other color), the white flakes are more obvious and can even give the effect of my hair looking gray!</li>

            <li> It does wonders taming my super thick curly/wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I would apply it right after some towel drying of wet hair and slick it into a ponytail and tie it up.</li>
            <li> : I still don&#x27;t quite believe it, I was using Herbal Essence totally twisted gel and getting OK results, then tried Aussie with bad results, then decided to try this out after it was popular on the curly hair site.  </li>
            <li> Sticking with this one for a while (though might by at local store as it seems more expensive online!  </li>
            <li> On the minus side, it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and have to use hair gel every day to put my hair in a slicked back bun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> If you have long, stringy or out of control wavy hair, you may want to try the 10 (mega hold).</li>
            <li> i have long curly hair</li>
            <li> The gel keeps my hair put all day and a bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s hold for very long.</li>
            <li> I was shopping at the cheaper end of Walmart and Target, but those didn&#x27;t hold very long.  </li>
            <li> i put it on once and in a few hours later it was gone and flaky, its going back to rite aid, dont even try to by this junk..</li>

            <li> After styling my hair, I wash my hand briefly and the gel comes off cleanly and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dirty and sticky like all other gels and mouses.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently discovered this gel in a quest to test out cheaper hair products.  I absolutely love LA Looks Sport Gel.  I get really springy, well defined curls with it.  I&#x27;m a type 3b with some 3c and I&#x27;d consider this a heavier gel.  It does dry with a bit of crunch, but I scrunch it out and get soft curls.  My previous favorites were Kinky Curly Curling Custard and Ouidad Climate Control, but this is just as good in terms of curl definition, dries with less crunch than Kinky Curly, and is only $2 or $3 at drug stores, supermarkets and big box retailers for 20 oz.  Unlike Kinky Curly, it also doesn&#x27;t marketdly increase drying time.  Also, unlike the Ouidad Climate Control Gel (which I will use on top of this gel in very high dew points) it has no silicones in it.  This gel is good for those following the Curly Girl Method.  The price on Amazon is outrageous.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this gel, I&#x27;ve been having some great hair days at a very low price.</li>
            <li> i put it on once and in a few hours later it was gone and flaky, its going back to rite aid, dont even try to by this junk..</li>
            <li> Actually Rob&#x27;s wife here : I still don&#x27;t quite believe it, I was using Herbal Essence totally twisted gel and getting OK results, then tried Aussie with bad results, then decided to try this out after it was popular on the curly hair site.  This stuff holds the curl well and it looks so natural not shiny. I do see a few flakes and the smell is bad (but can&#x27;t smell once on hair), but this has been a miracle for me so far.  Every time I use it my husband comments on how nice my hair looks and I do the same thing always!  Wet, Gel, go.  The other gels my hair looks ok in the morning but by afternoon it has gotten straighter and frizzier.  Sticking with this one for a while (though might by at local store as it seems more expensive online!  My trial size is out, next time buying the big one.</li>
            <li> after maybe 5 or 6 hours, the gel turn into flakes, and there are lots of flake on your hair. It like it snows outside. It does hold firm though, if it doesn&#x27;t have the flake problem it would be great.</li>
            <li> I will admit this gel gives the best hold for my natural botticelli curls, especially in this humid climate I live in. HOWEVER after the gel has dried it turns into white flakes. The flakes are very obvious and big....it comes across as dandruff! For those people that have black colored hair(mine is jet black and never been any other color), the white flakes are more obvious and can even give the effect of my hair looking gray! I am 30 years old, so no natural gray hair yet. I am now using L.A. Looks Nutra-Curl even though the hold is not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> This gel is horrible.  It left me with white specs all over my hair.  It looked like I had a bad case of dandruff (which I don&#x27;t).  What good is the hold if it makes you look like this.  Although it is very cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Xtreme Hold&amp;#34; is an overstatement. On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t wind up crunchy. On the minus side, it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.</li>
            <li> not that good doesn&#x27;t stay up just save your self the money and get moca de gorila hair gel or gorila snot funny name but best affordable hair gel on the market</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and I am having the worst time finding the right gel or mouse. Every time I buy a mouse or gel I end up looking for another or throwing away because they are all way too sticky. My hads get sticky when I touch my hair and my hair feels dirty during the day. I hate the feeling. Then I happened to buy a small LALooks (it could be another brand, but I think this is the one) at a small store inside a hotel in Vegas. I used this gel and I loved it. After styling my hair, I wash my hand briefly and the gel comes off cleanly and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dirty and sticky like all other gels and mouses. I ordered this here in Amazin because I couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Odorless.  Strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight short hair and it works great. Strong hold with no flakes! This bottle will last me 6 months too.</li>
            <li> I follow the Curly Girl method ([...]) &amp; [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]], and I thought this would be a good gel to try over my leave-in conditioner on my wet hair (post-shower). While it has a powerful hold that gave me great curl definition, it left flakes within a few hours. Just like a previous reviewer said, some of my hair was so full of flakes, that one of my co-workers thought I had developed white hair over night. I was too embarrassed to correct her. I am glad this was cheap because it is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work well for guys hair. I would recommend American crew firm hold gel. American Crew is more expensive but it is so worth it! It doesn&#x27;t flake or melt, it has a lot nicer smell, and it has a far superior hold. For girls hair I believe this gel (L.A Looks) works fairly well, My mom uses it to keep the frizziness of her hair down in humid weather. So for guys I would say go and get some American Crew. For girls....I don&#x27;t know if it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Large bottle for such a low price. Works as well as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as strong as &amp;#34;xtreme hold&amp;#34; implies.  More like light to moderate hold.  Good thing it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. Doesn&#x27;t have a harass smell and the hold is terrific.</li>
            <li> Great gel. Holds very curly and wavy hair well. I use on wet hair out of the shower; let dry overnight for best results. Use more or less depending on how strong you want the hold to be. Has a nice smell, too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s hold for very long. Would never buy again. No wonder it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.  I use it after I towel dry my hair after a shower, comb my hair, and it looks great all day -- and for me, most importantly, not looking like I have goop in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold and not crunchy</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE this gel! LA Looks gels are VERY FLAKY and do not hold well. I am in the military and have to use hair gel every day to put my hair in a slicked back bun. This gel dries out my hair and is much more flaky than any other gel I have used. If you are looking for a good styling gel, ECO Styler Krystal is amazing!</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good gel. its strong and holds for a while. the only thing about it is that it is flaky.. its at a low price and i would recomend it for people who dont want to pay alot of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel since I was 14 years old. It does wonders taming my super thick curly/wavy hair! I would apply it right after some towel drying of wet hair and slick it into a ponytail and tie it up. I would go to sleep in it and wake up all I would have to do is take out the ponytail and run my fingers through! I&#x27;m not sure about others but I would use A LOT so I would get flakes every now and then but I&#x27;d rather have small flakes I guess rather than a lions mane :)</li>
            <li> I have been using different gels, trying to find one that I liked.  I was shopping at the cheaper end of Walmart and Target, but those didn&#x27;t hold very long.  However, among the cheap ones, LA Looks is the absolutely worst.  Not only does it not last long, it is very, very flaky.  When it comes to gel, it is worth paying the extra few dollars and getting a better one.  I am using Fructis now, which costs about two dollars more for about half the amount, but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I need this baby to look sharp and sexy.  Ladies love a man who grooms himself right, so this definetely gets their attention as well.  Highly recommended for people like myself who live an exercise lifestyle as well.</li>
            <li> this is the only gel I ever use. As an Asian man I have very unpliable hair but once I put this on it gets locked in place and does not move. I have bottles of this for reassurance I am able to keep my unmanageable hair in place all day. I put in on and comb it all back for a classic Asian look. Although there are other gels available this is the most accessible with its very affordable price. This gel is my go to for my  stiff Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I love L.A. Gel.  I have been using this brand for as long as I can remember.  I am very happy with it.  It can leave some white residue if you put TOO MUCH on your hair but if you use as directed, it works just fine.  I like it as it is alcohol free.  I would venture to say I&#x27;ve been using LA Gel for over 15 years and my hair hasn’t fallen out or been damage by this product.  If you have short buzz military type of haircut, then the low hold (7 or below) is fine.  If you have long, stringy or out of control wavy hair, you may want to try the 10 (mega hold).</li>
            <li> my hair is curly, really long,thick, and frizzy, and this works wonders.  I got this for controlling my curls, not for sport hold.  I probably only use a dime size amount and its just right, any more and it would probably get crunchy.  for this product, the minimal amount is best.</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem finding this in stores.  It is my husbands favorite hair gel.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I began trying tips learned on the curly girl website. I tried a bunch of expensive hair products , different brands including curly girl favorites like Devacurl. My hair was looking better, but not great until I tried this gel. Seriously this was much better than any of the salon products I had been trying. Actually I bought several salon brand items. I&#x27;m mostly a high end hair product girl...or I was. With this gel, I get great curl definition. It dries a little crunchy, but I scrunch it out. Then I just have soft, defined curls. I have the best hair in my life, seriously. I love this gel. I have never found any hair product that I like as much as this, I don&#x27;t  get any flakes at all. I do apply it while my hair is soaking wet, then scrunch with a t-shirt. Maybe the wet application is keeping me from getting flakes. I&#x27;m not sure, but I know I&#x27;m going to stop buying all the different products that I won&#x27;t use. My hair and pocketbook will thank me.</li>
            <li> It smells weird but does its job</li>
            <li> I been using this product for more than 3 years, and I have to say this is the best gel I have ever used, but however online this product is a little pricey, in my local Beauty supply it cost around 3 bucks!!!</li>
            <li> i have long curly hair and i use a lot of gel. I can&#x27;t stand getting a small tube of curly hair gel for 3 bucks because it doesn&#x27;t last me long. Even though this same brand makes curly hair gel, i think this is better because it has a stronger hold. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair flaky.It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greacey. It&#x27;s very cheap. Any gel works on my hair but, i love to use this. When i go outside for gym class on an extremely hot day, my gair stays curly and non frizzy the whole time.</li>
            <li> I love this gel!  It is soooo humid where I live, not many products can keep my curls tame but LA Looks Sport definitely does!  My curls are completely frizz-free with this gel!  I have had zero issue with flaking.  For this price, you might as well try it and see if you like it!  I apply it about 2 inches from the scalp and down to ends.  I find that when I put it on the hair on my scalp, that it dries exactly like it looks, for me that means my hair looks super wet all day even when it&#x27;s dry.  So I just apply it further down and to the ends to keep my curls from frizzing in this hot &amp; humid weather  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deployed and can not get this at the PX great product I use all the time.</li>
            <li> Beware of fakes and cheap knock offs. Hey, I was trying to save some money and CVS has a hair gel that is a copy of this one. Very similar packaging and wording, etc. They had it 2 for 1 and so I got some and it was horrible! My hair poofed out. It didn&#x27;t have hardly any hold. It did not keep my hair slicked and stiff like the LA Looks one. Sometimes I have trouble finding this gel locally. Problem solved! I ordered from Amazon and it is the real deal. The one I received was missing the front labeling, so it might be factory 2nds. But the back label is the same and it smells and works the same. All good. I look extremely handsome again and feel like a thousandaire. The gel keeps my hair put all day and a bottle lasts me a long time. I am a man with short hair.</li>
            <li> Thisis some of the best hair holding gel I have ever used, and I WAS a fan of the natural look. You can make it as stiff or as soft-appearing as you like, and this size of container will last a good long time, if used judiciously or otherwise. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The best for the spiked look!</li>
            <li> i received this product on time... very good. Excellent..It was my first experience..but really awesome. I would advice my friends to buy too..</li>
            <li> Great product, was delivered when promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the best results using this product, than virtually any other. I put it on wet, and let it dry an hour before combing out. Leaves my hair thicker, and fuller, and seems to hold in place better. Since I comb it out, I don&#x27;t notice the flaking that others complain of. Plus I&#x27;m blonde, either it doesn&#x27;t show up or I&#x27;m clueless.</li>
            <li> does the job perfectly</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It&#x27;s cheap, but it does the trick.  My husband&#x27;s hair looks just as good as when I was buying him the $30 salon products.</li>
