            <li>Meaningful beauty products really work - thank you Cindy Crawford</li>
            <li>they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Worth every penny and others</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer but does it help my dark circles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li>I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li>so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes crow feet melt away!  </li>
            <li>bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
            <li>i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
            <li>They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find on that really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Want to try a product which &#x27;really&#x27; works?</li>
            <li>But, no matter what I say, unless YOU TRY IT, you cannot see that it really works.  </li>
            <li>I would rather have a beautiful skin, than buy expensive clothes and have a wrinkle face; that is like putting the cart in front of the horse, makes sense to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really ok.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for three months,and dissent really help with dark circles,are fine lines, by the eyes</li>
            <li>I will know more in a few weeks...</li>
            <li>It is worth the money and believe me I have spend some money on different skin product and nothing as work ...</li>
            <li>From the eye cream, came the day/night moisturizers, which truly permeated into my skin and not just sat on top, which some creams had in the past.  </li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>For the price, I will stay with my old cream.</li>
            <li>I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive facial skin, especially my eyes.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product because it is has a subtle affect on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>

            <li> I tried her products long before seeing this list</li>
            <li> this is one I can not live without.</li>
            <li> Back to my usual serum.</li>
            <li> Tube was split on the end and leaked out on other products bought</li>
            <li> All other eye creams made my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> I have noticed diminished crows feet and my circles arent as dark under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t change it for any other skin product !!!</li>
            <li> It is really not a serum but a thin cream.  </li>
            <li> Helps soften skin and slowly removes lines.</li>
            <li> It was a real waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical when I saw the television ads, but I thought I would start with the eye cream since this is the thinnest skin on your face</li>
            <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is on the worst skin care list.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product should be called meaningless</li>
            <li> The refund was tedious...</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  </li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember that it was working.</li>
            <li> Meaningful beauty products really work - thank you Cindy Crawford</li>
            <li> I noticed no changes at all with this product. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really ok.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for three months,and dissent really help with dark circles,are fine lines, by the eyes</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many beauty products throught out mylife and I have yet to find on that really does what it says.  I say keep your money and just stick to the age-old routine of washing your face at night and when you wake up in the morning, apply moisturizer, drink lots of water, no coffee or sugars, exercise, laugh-laugh-laugh more and think positive.</li>
            <li> This worked just like the ad said I love this product!! It arrived in just a few days. I could be happier and I am telling all my friends Thanks so much</li>
            <li> It is really not a serum but a thin cream.  Saw no difference and used it for 2 weeks.  Back to my usual serum.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product because it is has a subtle affect on the eyes.  It enhances but it does not look greasy.  I will know more in a few weeks...</li>
            <li> Helps soften skin and slowly removes lines.</li>
            <li> Want to try a product which &#x27;really&#x27; works? Then try the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty Skincare line.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical when I saw the television ads, but I thought I would start with the eye cream since this is the thinnest skin on your face therefore one gets those fine lines, then the wrinkles appear sooner than we would think they should.  But, as soon as I felt the consistency of this product, I knew it was going to sell me on the entire line and it did. From the eye cream, came the day/night moisturizers, which truly permeated into my skin and not just sat on top, which some creams had in the past.  They were greasy, did not help my skin, nor my pillows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, your face is like a canvas, if you take care of it, believe me, you WILL see the difference in using  this skincare line.  Worth every penny and others can see the difference because I get many compliments; this tells me the truth.  People are like our mirrors.  But, no matter what I say, unless YOU TRY IT, you cannot see that it really works.  I would rather have a beautiful skin, than buy expensive clothes and have a wrinkle face; that is like putting the cart in front of the horse, makes sense to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself, then when you see your face take on a different texture, you too will fall in love with this Meaningful Beauty Skincare Line.  I absolutely love it and know you will too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet if this product helps or not.  I will keep using it to see if I get any results.  It is a good moisturizer but does it help my dark circles and crows feet.  It remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> this stuff broke my skin out under my eyes i do not like this stuff at all.and so not serum more like a cream.</li>
            <li> Love it! Seems to work as well as roc-</li>
            <li> Tube was split on the end and leaked out on other products bought</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum!  It really makes crow feet melt away!  I have been using for about 5 days and wow!  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Cindy Crawford line for about a year already , my dermatologist is happy to see my skin has gone thinker around the eye  and reduced the fine lines .&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and recommend everyone to try it and trust it . It is worth the money and believe me I have spend some money on different skin product and nothing as work ...&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t change it for any other skin product !!!&lt;br /&gt;I own the entires line and it will last you for a wile ...&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy ladies !!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely and I am using it  am and pm.  I do not see any changes.  For the price, I will stay with my old cream.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive facial skin, especially my eyes. All other eye creams made my eyes burn. This product doesn&#x27;t. I have noticed diminished crows feet and my circles arent as dark under my eyes. Love this whole line. My face has never felt so great.</li>
            <li> It was a real waste of money.  I thought the order was for a serum, but it&#x27;s just like water. Cindy needs to put a lot more research into the products she puts her name on!</li>
            <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is on the worst skin care list. Draw your own conclusions. I tried her products long before seeing this list and I sent them back.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the Meaningful Beauty products, I love all of her stuff,&lt;br /&gt;but this is one I can not live without.</li>
