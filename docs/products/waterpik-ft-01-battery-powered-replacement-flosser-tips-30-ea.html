            <li>Will not be purchasing more refills.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find the Flosser tips at any store.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the tool that costs more that comes or is sold as the whitener one at more money.</li>
            <li>These tips go with the flossing tool, but I don&#x27;t understand how they could be considered better than flossing with hand held floss tape.  </li>
            <li>3 more words?</li>
            <li>really works great,  </li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>WaterPik Flosser is a great product and a very necessary tool for good hygiene - I use it twice a day - EVERY DAY - easy to handle</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years ordered many more sets my teeth always feel clean and all foods removed better than a toothpick and safer</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product</li>
            <li>Work just fine as replacement tips for my flosser.  </li>
            <li>Glad I checked out Amazon since I was able to get a large replacement supply and also found the picks for my Hummingbird Flosser.</li>
            <li>The grandkids really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>I enjoy the flosser and the tips are soft and do not hurt your gums but do a good job.</li>
            <li>fit like the original tips .The</li>
            <li>This is a small product that arrived in the promised time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Clean and efficient way to eep your teeth and gums out of any bacteria.</li>
            <li>make my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special bout the tips.</li>
            <li>These bend too easily and are not even good for a single flossing.  </li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and was just as stated.  </li>
            <li>Flosser tips are kept secure and in one place until you are ready to use.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t smile, teeth had goo all over.</li>
            <li>Made this purchase, teeth now have a sparkle, I can smile again.</li>
            <li>These tips aren&#x27;t available at the drugstores here, they go a long way to help keep gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this as a fairly inexpensive tool if you can&#x27;t floss normally.</li>
            <li>I will run right back to good old flossing once my hardware is removed from my teeth</li>
            <li>As are the super flat picks I also like because I can use them to help make sure my teeth are not getting deposits of calcification.</li>
            <li>there is a very light indentation sort of like a tiny square mark and that goes in one position and then the tips do not come off</li>
            <li>After I use regular floss it still removes more.</li>
            <li>Price is right, they work really well.  </li>
            <li>The flosser tips are too flimsy, and the vibration of the actual WaterPik flosser is too strong, often causing one&#x27;s gums to bleed.</li>
            <li>but the cost was up to  3 times as much</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>very quick!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  they don&#x27;t fall apart like the ones  sent with the bow.</li>
            <li>I really like those</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like these things.  </li>
            <li>But I find most of the time it works right between two teeth and does an excellent job of cleaning between the teeth and not too harsh being a slightly flexible but still somewhat hard plastic pick like object.</li>
            <li>It was important to me because I have been using a waterpik flosser for a long time but the retail stores do not sell the refills.  </li>
            <li>The overall flosser is good, I wish I could get these reg tips in the stores, but they only sell the white ones which I do not like.  </li>
            <li>It works great if you&#x27;ve eaten something like popcorn, for instance, and you want to dislodge some kernels, but other than that, I don&#x27;t really recommend it - especially not for daily use.</li>
            <li>Waterpik really needs to get rid of this type of container and use only the one pictured that holds 30 tips as it is much easier to hold and works very well.</li>
            <li>Need to be more firm and sturdy to give the desired flossing effect.</li>
            <li>New container Gand this gets five stars.</li>
            <li>These tips insert easily at the gumline, even with tight contacts between teeth.  </li>
            <li>a new way to floss  much easier to use than regular floss</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really fit into tight places between teeth like it says it will.</li>
            <li>I asked the large stores such as walmart and cvs why they sell the flosser package with the tips but do not sell refills</li>
            <li>These little things seem so expensive and this was the best price I could find anywhere</li>
            <li>The container that holds them can be a little better and that is only reason why this got four stars and no five.</li>
            <li>Add that to the lower price that Amazon offers and you get a home run.</li>
            <li>She says it is so much eaiser to floss with these than regular floss.</li>
            <li>Bring back the old tips in the 30 pack.</li>
            <li>Work well with braces, so much easier and less time consuming than regular flossing</li>

            <li> Work well with braces, so much easier and less time consuming than regular flossing</li>
            <li> I will continue to order from amazon as this small product is genuine waterpik tips for less than waterpik sells it for.</li>
            <li> Using them is SO MUCH EASIER than ordinary dental floss.</li>
            <li> The containers I received with my last order did not look like the one in the photo and was a single strip design holding 15 tips.</li>
            <li> Due to one of the containers being defective, I had to throw the entire container away along with the tips.</li>
            <li> They can be hard on sensitive gums and so if your braces or teeth have some issues there this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> The flosser tips work very well with the power handle but the container holding the tips is about as poor as it can get.</li>
            <li> These flosser tips do their job which is to floss, but they are a bit rough on the gums.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I was looking for which was my error.  </li>
            <li> The rings will not allow dental flossing no how no way it shreds the strings into bits and hard to get any bits it holds onto back out.</li>
            <li> Not a useful product.</li>
            <li> but if you get them on upside down they will.</li>
            <li> I use everyday other tooth type picks too including the rubberized tipped ones that you just poke between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had such a difficult time finding these tips locally.  </li>
            <li> Wish there was less packaging, though.</li>
            <li> but they were much more expensive than amazon which usually is the case as difficult to compete with amazon or its sellers.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These little piks reach those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> No comments as I have not liked the flosser itself.</li>
            <li> The picks are too thick.  </li>
            <li> Was forced to search for alternatives to dental flossing when I got 9 rings put around crowns on my teeth to attach braces to.</li>
            <li> The less expensive tool holds both style of tips so buy the less expensive battery tool and pick up the tips separate if you want.</li>
            <li> This is a very confusing website, these flosser tip as hard to find.</li>
            <li> Finding refills is difficult in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Water Pic flosser for quite sometime and, was unable to locate in stores.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to get it between the teeth without it bending</li>
            <li> but they are very expensive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was recommended that I get one and I looked around but the cost was up to  3 times as much so these refills will last awhile. They arrived very quickly in great condition.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and was just as stated.  These little things seem so expensive and this was the best price I could find anywhere</li>
            <li> Ours were also in the strips of 15 and they are not the same quality as the earlier product pictured.  These bend too easily and are not even good for a single flossing.  Bring back the old tips in the 30 pack.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser. Clean and efficient way to eep your teeth and gums out of any bacteria.</li>
            <li> These are just what I was looking for and work great with my battery powered flosser!  It beats flossing with dental floss and works much better!</li>
            <li> If your kids have braces, this is a must have item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a waterpik flosser for years. Finding refills is difficult in stores. These little piks reach those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t smile, teeth had goo all over. Made this purchase, teeth now have a sparkle, I can smile again. Shipped fast and was as advertised.</li>

            <li> Excellent product. Great for my teeth.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I was looking for which was my error.  I did pass them on to someone who can use them.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery and very easy to use. The items are as advertised. They work flawlessly with our WaterPik Flosser.</li>
            <li> This was one my wife ordered but she tells me that they fit her machine well and work great. Add that to the lower price that Amazon offers and you get a home run.</li>
            <li> The overall flosser is good, I wish I could get these reg tips in the stores, but they only sell the white ones which I do not like.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>

            <li> I enjoy the flosser and the tips are soft and do not hurt your gums but do a good job. thank you</li>
            <li> These flosser tips do their job which is to floss, but they are a bit rough on the gums.  They do get a lot of the food particles between teeth which is the intended purpose of this item.  I just wish the material was rubber instead of plastic.  That would do the trick.</li>
            <li> I already had a water pik and this was a great value for replacements.  Wonderful shipperand very quick!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase!</li>
            <li> great to have extras on hand for he flosser&lt;br /&gt;flosser works well also&lt;br /&gt;had the best dental report ever&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li> These tips aren&#x27;t available at the drugstores here, they go a long way to help keep gums healthy.  After I use regular floss it still removes more.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed that I could not find any place. This will keep me in good supply for awhile</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  they don&#x27;t fall apart like the ones  sent with the bow. I would order again. You should get this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this.  The picks are too thick.  Will not be purchasing more refills.</li>
            <li> Too expesive for what you get</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years ordered many more sets my teeth always feel clean and all foods removed better than a toothpick and safer you will love the health benefits great solid product great price</li>
            <li> Work well with braces, so much easier and less time consuming than regular flossing</li>
            <li> Nice to know there are replacement parts out there.</li>
            <li> Great product delivered as promised</li>
            <li> I had such a difficult time finding these tips locally.  I&#x27;m real happy that i was able to order them online.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find the Flosser tips at any store.  Was happy I found them online.  I like the fact that you only need one hand to use the flosser as opposed to needing two hands to use standard floss.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product</li>
            <li> No comments as I have not liked the flosser itself. Not a useful product.</li>
            <li> WaterPik Flosser is a great product and a very necessary tool for good hygiene - I use it twice a day - EVERY DAY - easy to handle</li>
            <li> These tips insert easily at the gumline, even with tight contacts between teeth.  Using them is SO MUCH EASIER than ordinary dental floss.</li>
            <li> Was forced to search for alternatives to dental flossing when I got 9 rings put around crowns on my teeth to attach braces to. The rings will not allow dental flossing no how no way it shreds the strings into bits and hard to get any bits it holds onto back out. Anyway found this flosser system and bought one along with replacement tips here. I also picked up a package of the whitener tips. I can&#x27;t for the life of me see how it adds any whitening material to your mouth or gums or teeth. So my guess they don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t buy the tool that costs more that comes or is sold as the whitener one at more money. The less expensive tool holds both style of tips so buy the less expensive battery tool and pick up the tips separate if you want. Otherwise after using both for about 4 months or longer now I&#x27;d recommend just these and the standard tool. They can be hard on sensitive gums and so if your braces or teeth have some issues there this might not be for you. But I find most of the time it works right between two teeth and does an excellent job of cleaning between the teeth and not too harsh being a slightly flexible but still somewhat hard plastic pick like object. I use everyday other tooth type picks too including the rubberized tipped ones that you just poke between your teeth. I really like those but they are very expensive. As are the super flat picks I also like because I can use them to help make sure my teeth are not getting deposits of calcification. Overall I would recommend this as a fairly inexpensive tool if you can&#x27;t floss normally. Some people say the tips don&#x27;t stay on the unit but there is a key to that...there is a very light indentation sort of like a tiny square mark and that goes in one position and then the tips do not come off but if you get them on upside down they will. I will run right back to good old flossing once my hardware is removed from my teeth but so grateful I found these.</li>
            <li> I bought  this battery powered flosser years ago and have been searching for the pick replacements in stores with dental supplies. Glad I checked out Amazon since I was able to get a large replacement supply and also found the picks for my Hummingbird Flosser. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These tips go with the flossing tool, but I don&#x27;t understand how they could be considered better than flossing with hand held floss tape.  I think it&#x27;s a waterPik gimmick.</li>
            <li> Too flimsy. Need to be more firm and sturdy to give the desired flossing effect. It is difficult to get it between the teeth without it bending</li>
            <li> Bought this item to go with a water pik for my granddaughter who just got braces.  She says it is so much eaiser to floss with these than regular floss.</li>
            <li> Too flimsy.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like these things.  Before brushing and after flossing, I dip the tip into toothpaste and scrub between teeth with it.  It does a good job and stimulates my gums.</li>
            <li> just what I needed. This is a very confusing website, these flosser tip as hard to find. 3 more words?</li>
            <li> Excellent way to maintain good oral hygiene.  Flosser tips are kept secure and in one place until you are ready to use.</li>
            <li> really works great,  make my teeth feel so clean.  a new way to floss  much easier to use than regular floss</li>
            <li> Work just fine as replacement tips for my flosser.  Wish there was less packaging, though.</li>
            <li> This is a small product that arrived in the promised time and in excellent condition. It was important to me because I have been using a waterpik flosser for a long time but the retail stores do not sell the refills.  I asked the large stores such as walmart and cvs why they sell the flosser package with the tips but do not sell refills and they said the store policy was just to sell the flosser. I called waterpik and they acknowledged the same. I ordered flossers from waterpik but they were much more expensive than amazon which usually is the case as difficult to compete with amazon or its sellers. I will continue to order from amazon as this small product is genuine waterpik tips for less than waterpik sells it for.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really fit into tight places between teeth like it says it will. The flosser tips are too flimsy, and the vibration of the actual WaterPik flosser is too strong, often causing one&#x27;s gums to bleed. It works great if you&#x27;ve eaten something like popcorn, for instance, and you want to dislodge some kernels, but other than that, I don&#x27;t really recommend it - especially not for daily use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the flosser let alone flosser  tips. You get what you pay for. Nothing special bout the tips.</li>
            <li> Great for massaging gums</li>
            <li> These tips are good to have since you go through them fairly quickly. The container that holds them can be a little better and that is only reason why this got four stars and no five. New container Gand this gets five stars.</li>
            <li> my dentist is very happy with the results of this product on my teeth. Easier to use then flossing is.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  Price is right, they work really well.  There&#x27;s just not anyway to put all the words you want for this product.</li>
            <li> Yes very happy with this product. The grandkids really enjoy using it and I am in hopes that it will help with there teeth</li>
