    <ol>
            <li>and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>In Texas any help is good!...</li>
            <li>It works great even in humid areas.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>The concept us good</li>
            <li>A damp towel around the neck does a better job that this does!</li>
            <li>I will be buying another when the one I own gives out.  </li>
            <li>I also bouth Handy Cooler, and works great[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This fan looks very impressive but does not produce much air.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying a \\&quot;Handy</li>
            <li>I bought this item thinking it would help me stay cool while walking around in an art fair.</li>
            <li>I think it is more about the evaporation / cooling effect it has on the aluminum metal resting on the sides of your neck.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find another one.</li>
            <li>So how many times did I get this out to use this summer?  </li>
            <li>So how many times did I get this out to use this summer?  </li>
            <li>I just find the ease and simplicity of wetting a cloth in water and putting it around my neck a better option.</li>
            <li>i am in OK, tested on a 101degree day.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work,  need more power</li>
            <li>This is a great product for those who need to stay cool during hot and humid days.</li>
            <li>The unit is more effective when it is worn with the fan in front your neck, using it according to the picture is really very ineffective.    </li>
            <li>Directions say to use distilled water for best results and for the first use and occasionally thereafter to add a drop of liquid detergent to the water chamber to enhance operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Specifically, they state to fill the device up with water until it leaks out the front (notifying that it is filled) then after doing so to \\&quot;vigorously\\</li>
            <li>I hoped this would help keep me cool off on the course</li>
            <li>It does not keep you cool.  </li>
            <li>: The Original Handy Cooler in Blue.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it is a lot better than the Personal Fan 2.0 and 3.0 that Sharper Image put out several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because the beginning of football season in Texas is still very hot.</li>
            <li>I live in FL and love to play golf.</li>
            <li>It WILL dribble water out the front vents, down your chest, if you put too much water in it, but then that feels good too!  </li>
            <li>I can only see it helping in more mildly warm weather, I could barely feel it during summer and did nothing when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 weeks straight, every day in the desert, to the point of dirt and dust being all over it, and probably in it as it has sucked fine dust inside the front ports, yet it keeps on working just fine so far!  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m cooled down, if I could just find a good paying spot to dig in......</li>
            <li>but on the course a wet hand towel does a much better job!</li>
            <li>It works much better in areas with low humidity.</li>
            <li>In hi humid areas it actually will cause you to sweat more.</li>
            <li>After you fill the chambers on each side with water, you shake the unit vigorously and shake most of the water out through same vents.  </li>
            <li>and we have had another hot summer.  </li>
            <li>I just find the ease and simplicity of wetting a cloth in water and putting it around my neck a better option.he unit could fall off if the fan section is not kept at the back of the</li>
            <li>and we have had another hot summer.  </li>
            <li>so I am interested in anything to relieve it.</li>
            <li>Travel a lot to hot climates.  </li>
            <li>how the device \\&quot;leaks\\&quot;, that being said the instructions that come with the device explain how to exactly how to remedy this.</li>
            <li>and it is warm due to</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT IT AND WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.</li>
            <li>This thing just does not do much at all.</li>
            <li>and although I recieved it fast, as soon as I got it the heat wave subsided.  </li>
            <li>and maybe I&#x27;ll decide if I really like it or not.</li>
            <li>This is even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It really does nothing.</li>
            <li>its like a gag gift,there no cooling after the unit attains body temp.your better off with a wet rag.</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t sweat most of the time so usually have to spray water on my skin to cool me.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to buy this product when i first saw it, but upon receiving it and using it for awhile, I found that it did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>The arms do get cool when indoors and low humidity</li>
            <li>The inner silver side that rests on your neck is designed to remain cool once the water chamber has</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make you feel like your in AC, but it did make the heat tolerable enough to allow him to attend all our games last fall. :-)</li>
            <li>First things first, don&#x27;t expect miracles, this isn&#x27;t an actual miniature air-conditioning system but rather a device that provides a cooling effect through water evaporation which is encouraged by the use of the battery powered fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not so much the fan, as it really does not put out that much air up the back of your neck.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me as far as cooling.</li>
            <li>all being said the device does work, the metal plates on the inside of the device do a good job to keep your neck cool and thus giving an overall cooling sensation, again don&#x27;t expect a personal A/C system but it will at least allow you to feel cooler than you did without it.</li>
            <li>The product does not blow enough air or get cool enough to be of much use.</li>
            <li>The idea is a good one, but is not very effective, especially for such a large  device.    </li>
            <li>We live in Phoenix Arizona.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still be using it next summer when it gets hot again</li>
            <li>The back of my neck is what tells the rest of my body that I am hot.</li>
            <li>I deffinitely dont recommend this product, it doesnt do what is expected to do: Cool my neck.</li>
            <li>and I assume that, the fan blowing and the metal is what is expected to cool you.&lt;br /&gt;6.  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the Mojave desert, and also central California in 80 to high 90 degree weather and found it to really help.  </li>
            <li>It will be great if someone invents one that can blow cold air.</li>
            <li>I also have an old Sharper Image neck collar, that plug into a battery pak and outlet.</li>
            <li>I have M.S and am heat sensitive.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I ever really felt it on the back of my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fan in the back is much like the fan in the fragance devices that you plug in the wall like airwick.</li>
            <li>but we didnt notice that it cooled our necks much over the regular temperature.  </li>
            <li>It leaks and doesn&#x27;t keep me cool, not worth the the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even cool you down inside your house in the air conditioning.</li>
            <li>By following the instructions I have had no issues with with any water leaking or running down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final suggestion, if you wish to speed up and improve the cooling process make sure when filling up the device with water, do so using water that&#x27;s been refrigerated.</li>
            <li>This collar help you to feel better, but will not cool you down in a 100*F &amp; high humidity.</li>
            <li>it cools the chamber metal down, and then lightly blows up and out the back of your neck.  </li>
            <li>These things draw in air in from the very front vents, that then passes through the inner chamber where there is a blue cloth or something that absorbs the bit of water that you pour through the two rubber caps on each side.  </li>
            <li>water and air comes out of the front small black section to cool your face, but believe me, on a very humid day the entire device actually causes you to sweat more since it is not very powerful.    </li>
            <li>and you are somewhere that has absolutely no other air circulating around you</li>
            <li>Here are some other things that you might be interested in knowing.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>Not sure this works as well as described-think the metal is what makes it seem that it is cool.</li>
            <li>It is simple to refill it, and it lasts multiple hours depending on how hot, and dry it is outside.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so this adiabatic cooling product should have worked well.  </li>
            <li>did not make much difference just a little.</li>
            <li>You can barely hear the fan run when you turn it on to low, and it is just a little louder on high, so the one in the video truly was defective, or I got a very quiet unit...  </li>
            <li>This one has 2 chambers that you can put the water in, one on either side, and it doesn&#x27;t leak but very little when you wear it at first.  </li>

            <li> The battery last a long time and it is a quiet machine.</li>
            <li> While prospecting for gold I am usually either digging dirt at a feverish pace, or hiking around with a metal detector, in hot dry area&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> In my case as an average size female,  I found that although I started out with the fan section at the back of my neck that it would sometimes slip to the front.&lt;br /&gt;9.</li>
            <li> 1 battery lasts a long time, well over a week.  </li>
            <li> They claimed it gives you the same cooling effect as a wet rag or towel would on your neck.  </li>
            <li> There is a blue material inside each water chamber that gets wet when you put the water in</li>
            <li> It looks similar to the other neck cooler</li>
            <li> &quot; shake the excess water out until dry.</li>
            <li> seem to cool your whole head, and body down a bit, which might actually be from your blood flowing past a cold piece of metal, resting on each side of your neck.  </li>
            <li> (Just don&#x27;t get your dry gold bearing dirt wet with this as it will gum up your gold DRY washer).     </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m just not sure how good or bad</li>
            <li> As this air passes over the wet media / cloth inside each chamber on each side of your neck</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the fan can be slightly noisy if in a quiet location when set to the \\&quot;high\\&quot;</li>
            <li> this is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> The water doesn&#x27;t leak into the battery, compared to the other 2 versions from Sharper Image that didn&#x27;t have this feature on it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take extreme heat.</li>

            <li> While prospecting for gold I am usually either digging dirt at a feverish pace, or hiking around with a metal detector, in hot dry area&#x27;s.  I have used this in the Mojave desert, and also central California in 80 to high 90 degree weather and found it to really help.  (If it&#x27;s over 100, I find shade and rest). This actually makes you FEEL cooler!  It is not so much the fan, as it really does not put out that much air up the back of your neck.  I think it is more about the evaporation / cooling effect it has on the aluminum metal resting on the sides of your neck.  These things draw in air in from the very front vents, that then passes through the inner chamber where there is a blue cloth or something that absorbs the bit of water that you pour through the two rubber caps on each side.  As this air passes over the wet media / cloth inside each chamber on each side of your neck it cools the chamber metal down, and then lightly blows up and out the back of your neck.  These now cooled down metal chambers on each side of your neck seem to cool your whole head, and body down a bit, which might actually be from your blood flowing past a cold piece of metal, resting on each side of your neck.  You know it works well when you notice yourself getting hotter, and you reach up and feel the metal chamber against your neck and it is warm due to all the water has evaporated out of it.  It is simple to refill it, and it lasts multiple hours depending on how hot, and dry it is outside.  I always wear a BIG brimmed ventalated straw hat with this, to keep the sun off my head.  It WILL dribble water out the front vents, down your chest, if you put too much water in it, but then that feels good too!  (Just don&#x27;t get your dry gold bearing dirt wet with this as it will gum up your gold DRY washer).     There is a you tube video on this type of unit out there but the one in the video is obviously defective.  You can barely hear the fan run when you turn it on to low, and it is just a little louder on high, so the one in the video truly was defective, or I got a very quiet unit...  1 battery lasts a long time, well over a week.  My only concern is its durability, and only time will tell in that department.  I have used it for 3 weeks straight, every day in the desert, to the point of dirt and dust being all over it, and probably in it as it has sucked fine dust inside the front ports, yet it keeps on working just fine so far!  I will be buying another when the one I own gives out.  Now that I&#x27;m cooled down, if I could just find a good paying spot to dig in......</li>
            <li> This collar help you to feel better, but will not cool you down in a 100*F &amp; high humidity. In Texas any help is good!...</li>
            <li> I purchased this device some years ago from The Sharper Image. They claimed it gives you the same cooling effect as a wet rag or towel would on your neck.  Wrong! It did absolutely nothing for me as far as cooling. I also should have taken the battery out when I stored it for winter, because come next summer the battery compartment was all corroded. It ended up going in the garbage, and I ended up going back to buying mini traveling fans again.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for several years. It works much better in areas with low humidity. Colorad, NM, parts of Texas. In hi humid areas it actually will cause you to sweat more. Even the neck coolers that you soak in water have this event. I also have an old Sharper Image neck collar, that plug into a battery pak and outlet. It works great even in humid areas. It looks similar to the other neck cooler and I can not find any part numberr or description. some one once told me it works like a mini heat pump. I have not been able to find another one.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT IT AND WAS VERY DISAPOINTED. IT DOESNT WORK AS DESCRIBED. A WASTE OF MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY THIS YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY !!!</li>
            <li> I deffinitely dont recommend this product, it doesnt do what is expected to do: Cool my neck. Instead accumulates hummidity and sweat over the neck area. I also bouth Handy Cooler, and works great[[ASIN:B002F8IFV6 Small Fan &amp; Mini-Air Conditioner: The Original Handy Cooler in Blue. Portable and convenient. Runs on batteries or USB. Cools air up to 30F.]]</li>
            <li> Unless you have really cold water to put in it and you are somewhere that has absolutely no other air circulating around you this is pretty useless. We live in Phoenix Arizona. No humidity which is what was recommended.....The only \\&quot;relief\\&quot; produced was the soaked cloth that protects the front part. The only reason it was relief was because I had just put freezing cold water in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it is a lot better than the Personal Fan 2.0 and 3.0 that Sharper Image put out several years ago.  This one has 2 chambers that you can put the water in, one on either side, and it doesn&#x27;t leak but very little when you wear it at first.  The water doesn&#x27;t leak into the battery, compared to the other 2 versions from Sharper Image that didn&#x27;t have this feature on it.  And it was hard to put the water in and use it.    This one you can purchase it on Sharper Image&#x27;s website for $50.00, but on Amazon you can get it for $30.00 or so, a lot cheaper.      I have used this several times already and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This thing just does not do much at all. I can&#x27;t take extreme heat. I live in FL and love to play golf. I hoped this would help keep me cool off on the course but it actually seemed to make things worse because the sweat under it could not evaporate. The arms do get cool when indoors and low humidity but on the course a wet hand towel does a much better job!</li>
            <li> My husband had been wanting one of these for a while.  I finally ordered him one.  It just wasn&#x27;t what he thought it would be.  He did give it a few chances but did not like the results.</li>
            <li> This fan looks very impressive but does not produce much air. The inner silver side that rests on your neck is designed to remain cool once the water chamber has water and air comes out of the front small black section to cool your face, but believe me, on a very humid day the entire device actually causes you to sweat more since it is not very powerful.    The idea is a good one, but is not very effective, especially for such a large  device.    The unit is more effective when it is worn with the fan in front your neck, using it according to the picture is really very ineffective.    It will be great if someone invents one that can blow cold air.</li>
            <li> It leaks and doesn&#x27;t keep me cool, not worth the the price. A damp towel around the neck does a better job that this does!</li>
            <li> I ordered this when we were having a heat wave and although I recieved it fast, as soon as I got it the heat wave subsided.  The temperatures were in the 70s and 80s but no more 90s.  I&#x27;m in Central Ohio so it was over the 70% humidity recommended to stay under on the back of the box.  I used it while mowing on a riding lawn mower.  I have M.S and am heat sensitive.  Plus, I don&#x27;t sweat most of the time so usually have to spray water on my skin to cool me.  I did not notice being noticeablly cooler wearing this but I did not have to spray my skin with water either. So I&#x27;m just not sure how good or bad I think this device is but I do understand why the reviews are all over the place.  I think this is one device that you have to actually try to see if you like it for your situation. I&#x27;ll still be using it next summer when it gets hot again and maybe I&#x27;ll decide if I really like it or not. Here are some other things that you might be interested in knowing.&lt;br /&gt;1.  One AA alkaline battery is included.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The plastic bottle included for carrying extra water is only 2 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;3.  After you fill the chambers on each side with water, you shake the unit vigorously and shake most of the water out through same vents.  I fill mine under the tap)&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you don&#x27;t shake the water out, it will leak out and get you wet.&lt;br /&gt;5.  There is a blue material inside each water chamber that gets wet when you put the water in and I assume that, the fan blowing and the metal is what is expected to cool you.&lt;br /&gt;6.  If you add water, shake it out, and put on the collar in an air conditioned house before you go outside it is very cold.  That wears off the longer you stay out.&lt;br /&gt;7.  The fan area where the air blows out is very small and I don&#x27;t think I ever really felt it on the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;8.  In my case as an average size female,  I found that although I started out with the fan section at the back of my neck that it would sometimes slip to the front.&lt;br /&gt;9. The unit could fall off if the fan section is not kept at the back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;10. The fan noise is like a small hum but not noticeable unless you&#x27;re using it in a quiet environment.&lt;br /&gt;11.  Directions say to use distilled water for best results and for the first use and occasionally thereafter to add a drop of liquid detergent to the water chamber to enhance operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the end of August 2012 and we have had another hot summer.  So how many times did I get this out to use this summer?  Very few.  I did get it out when the power was out and we didn&#x27;t have air conditioning but even then I eventually just went to the went cloth around my neck cooler.  I&#x27;m a gadget person but when I want to be cooler I just find the ease and simplicity of wetting a cloth in water and putting it around my neck a better option.he unit could fall off if the fan section is not kept at the back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;10.

            <li> I purchased this because the beginning of football season in Texas is still very hot. My husband has a medical condition that makes the heat hard for him to deal with. It won&#x27;t make you feel like your in AC, but it did make the heat tolerable enough to allow him to attend all our games last fall. :-)</li>
            <li> I have used this neck cooler about 5 times and I do not like it. It does not keep you cool.  There is not enough fan power or air flow.  It leaks water.  I have already had to change the battery and the battery compartment is very difficult to open. I recommend buying a \\&quot;Handy Cooler\\&quot; - a personal handheld air cooler instead.</li>
            <li> This is even better than I expected.  I am caring for my elderly Mom who needs it to be 89 degrees in here... this saves my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who has any cooling need... especially those of us dealing with menopause!</li>
            <li> I tend to hate the heat so I am interested in anything to relieve it. I bought this item thinking it would help me stay cool while walking around in an art fair. EPIC FAIL  Whatever cooling effect it had was unnoticeable and the thing got heavier as the day progressed.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> it works... kinda. but for the most part its crap. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> i am in OK, tested on a 101degree day. did not make much difference just a little. the fan in the back is much like the fan in the fragance devices that you plug in the wall like airwick. i dont recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The back of my neck is what tells the rest of my body that I am hot. This product works just as described. The battery last a long time and it is a quiet machine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who need to stay cool during hot and humid days. I purchased for a health reason to control my body temp and it met those needs.</li>
            <li> I would not give this product any stars. What a waste of money. It really does nothing. The tiny bit of air that it emits is nearly impossible to feel. The water drips down your neck. It is really terrible. I returned this item.</li>
            <li> This thing is a rip off! I should have known better. I used it one day. It doesn&#x27;t even cool you down inside your house in the air conditioning. The fan is terrible and barley blows. You put cold water in the unit before putting it around your neck and then it dissapoints you and leaks water down your back. Sharper image makes one of these also, not sure how that one works. Overall...waste of money</li>
            <li> I was excited to buy this product when i first saw it, but upon receiving it and using it for awhile, I found that it did not live up to the hype. The product does not blow enough air or get cool enough to be of much use.</li>
            <li> doesnt work. its like a gag gift,there no cooling after the unit attains body temp.your better off with a wet rag.</li>
            <li> Travel a lot to hot climates.  Not sure this works as well as described-think the metal is what makes it seem that it is cool.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  You have to add water and it is NOT comfortable at all. It is not an Air Conditioner at all.  Maybe a evap cooler with a weak fan.</li>
            <li> First things first, don&#x27;t expect miracles, this isn&#x27;t an actual miniature air-conditioning system but rather a device that provides a cooling effect through water evaporation which is encouraged by the use of the battery powered fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said the device does work, the metal plates on the inside of the device do a good job to keep your neck cool and thus giving an overall cooling sensation, again don&#x27;t expect a personal A/C system but it will at least allow you to feel cooler than you did without it. The only complaint I have is that the fan can be slightly noisy if in a quiet location when set to the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I have seen other users describe is how the device \\&quot;leaks\\&quot;, that being said the instructions that come with the device explain how to exactly how to remedy this. Specifically, they state to fill the device up with water until it leaks out the front (notifying that it is filled) then after doing so to \\&quot;vigorously\\&quot; shake the excess water out until dry. By following the instructions I have had no issues with with any water leaking or running down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final suggestion, if you wish to speed up and improve the cooling process make sure when filling up the device with water, do so using water that&#x27;s been refrigerated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work,  need more power</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so this adiabatic cooling product should have worked well.  The conduction plates were too thick slowing conduction of heat from the neck to the wet cloth, and the air flow was almost nil resulting in little heat transfer due to convection.</li>
            <li> If you live in a humid place where temps soar, its basically useless. I can only see it helping in more mildly warm weather, I could barely feel it during summer and did nothing when I was pregnant. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> We are hikers. The concept us good but we didnt notice that it cooled our necks much over the regular temperature.  Didn&#x27;t work. We would have returned them and ask for money back but when you run around, repack item, mail at post office and pay postage to return--it is not worth the hastle. It is trash.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple years ago and it was complete crap, all it did was make my neck sweaty, didnt cool me down a bit,  wast of money.</li>
