            <li>The ointment smells very strongly of sulfur.</li>
            <li>This stuff is soooo strong!</li>
            <li>It was the most sulfur I could find without making it myself or getting a prescription.  </li>
            <li>seemed ok but don&#x27;t sleep in it as it can get</li>
            <li>But be sure to read the instructions.</li>
            <li>It is magic.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I do feel like the more</li>
            <li>The free soap was of no help either.</li>
            <li>This does really work and fast !!!!</li>
            <li>When you bathe with it, the smell washes away pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I put it on right away.</li>
            <li>Really greasy my son didn&#x27;t want to apply it to his full face for acne but dotted on here and there with a qtip</li>
            <li>I heard great reviews and I purchased this product only to get moderate to severe reactions.</li>
            <li>I was spending $170 on Rodan and Fields Unblemished and it worked good enough</li>
            <li>I left it for a couple mins then rinsed it off with warm water waited about 10 mins before I applied the sulfur ointment to let my skin balance itself left the ointment on for 10 mins then rinse with warm water hoping this stuff work so far</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s my first time using it</li>
            <li>had to stop using this product the third day because it broke me out even more.</li>
            <li>The soap smells okay, but I made a critical discovery.</li>
            <li>I still have mild acne as an adult, around my forehead and hairline, sometimes the cystic type.</li>
            <li>so good only thing I feel is a slight burning sensation which is expected I&#x27;ve tried sulfur in the past with great results got it as a rx from a Derm and paid way more than this product</li>
            <li>The bar soap, not so much but the 10% sulfur cream gives a  noticeable difference almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I tried every thing, and pay too much</li>
            <li>These products work really well.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to spend that much on a product it should work and work really well.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to moisturizer as much.</li>
            <li>I figured out the key ingredient in Unblemished that helped the most was sulfur.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t simply wash quickly with the soap and you can&#x27;t leave the ointment on all day.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why more products are not available with sulfur and why doctors do not recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my skin clear up along with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old.</li>
            <li>Wow, the only product that stopped my acne!</li>

            <li> Excellent product i love the results and others too!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product two days after I placed the order. I&#x27;ve already use the soap to wash my face the package states to leave the soap on your face for 10 mins but since it&#x27;s my first time using it I left it for a couple mins then rinsed it off with warm water waited about 10 mins before I applied the sulfur ointment to let my skin balance itself left the ointment on for 10 mins then rinse with warm water hoping this stuff work so far so good only thing I feel is a slight burning sensation which is expected I&#x27;ve tried sulfur in the past with great results got it as a rx from a Derm and paid way more than this product</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf to try. It&#x27;s no miracle cure, but he is persistent on using it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son who is battling horrible acne.  The bar soap, not so much but the 10% sulfur cream gives a  noticeable difference almost immediately.  It was the most sulfur I could find without making it myself or getting a prescription.  I would recommend it to anyone with super oily skin and tough acne.</li>
            <li> I have severe acne but this product did not help me I wanted this product to help me but it didn&#x27;t this product contain sulfur that not only smell horrible but also causes a burning sensation in your skin which is very annoying.i had to stop using this product the third day because it broke me out even more.The free soap was of no help either.</li>
            <li> The ointment smells very strongly of sulfur. Even after you wash it off, you can still smell it. The soap smells okay, but I made a critical discovery. When you bathe with it, the smell washes away pretty easily. But whatever you do, don&#x27;t get any on your underarms! The sulfur smell just won&#x27;t go away. Other than that, I have no complaints about the soap.</li>
            <li> Really greasy my son didn&#x27;t want to apply it to his full face for acne but dotted on here and there with a qtip seemed ok but don&#x27;t sleep in it as it can get&lt;br /&gt;In your eyes etc. from your pillow at night</li>
            <li> This does really work and fast !!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and help with my acne.</li>
            <li> I had acne as a teen that was treated with Accutane. I still have mild acne as an adult, around my forehead and hairline, sometimes the cystic type. I have been using benzoyl peroxide to no effect. Four applications of this soap dried out all the excess oil from my skin, decreased any inflammation and eliminated almost all my acne. But be sure to read the instructions. Both the soap and the ointment are meant to sit on the skin for ten minutes, then be washed off with water. You can&#x27;t simply wash quickly with the soap and you can&#x27;t leave the ointment on all day. Both products do smell like sulfur and I can smell it throughout the day on my skin, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for clear skin. I can&#x27;t understand why more products are not available with sulfur and why doctors do not recommend this stuff. It is magic.</li>
            <li> Got this a couple days after I ordered it. I put it on right away. This stuff is soooo strong! But it works!! Try it, you wont be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Wow, the only product that stopped my acne! I tried every thing, and pay too much but this is IT!!!!! Love it</li>
            <li> These products work really well.</li>
            <li> Had to return this product. I heard great reviews and I purchased this product only to get moderate to severe reactions.</li>
            <li> did not take care of my problem</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for year. I was spending $170 on Rodan and Fields Unblemished and it worked good enough but my skin was still breaking out. If I&#x27;m going to spend that much on a product it should work and work really well. I figured out the key ingredient in Unblemished that helped the most was sulfur. It was in the mask I loved from Proactiv. I went on a search and found this and the result is AMAZING skin for an AMAZING price! I do use Hope in a Jar moisturizer because this will dry your skin. I do feel like the more I use this the less dry my skin becomes and I don&#x27;t have to moisturizer as much. I&#x27;ve had maybe 3 breakouts since I&#x27;ve started using this and those 3 have been minuscule, like maybe 1 or 2 small pimples, compared to my daily breakouts and blackheads. I suffer from cystic acne too and have gone through one treatment of Accutane about 10 years ago. That helped my cystic acne a lot but I&#x27;ve since had 2 kids and my hormones had brought it back. It&#x27;s not as bad as before but I have had the occastional cyst that will hibernate painfully under my skin. Haven&#x27;t had a cyst since I&#x27;ve started this. I&#x27;m 34 years old.</li>
