            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t leave a residue build-up and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I never go out of my way to write a review but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t find it impressive</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>I have used this three times, once per week, and it is effective.</li>
            <li>After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I was loving how it felt on my hair</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>give the product 4 stars, but the customer service was so nice that I had to rate 5</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice as well.</li>
            <li>However, I can honestly say that I am now a fan.</li>
            <li>It did smell nice.</li>
            <li>Well I had my hair deep-conditioned at the salon one day by him using it and honestly didn&#x27;t feel any difference.</li>
            <li>and it already has done some nice things with my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice but nothing revolutionary.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly who knows if this is making a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So for every time I use about a spoonful of this conditioner, apply it, then leave it on for about 5 minutes, and wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>Smells really nice though</li>
            <li>The way I see it, no one will be truly honest because that would be the end of the freebies.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s kind of chunky).  </li>
            <li>I also use Moroccan oil which it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST conditioner I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li>It not only works great..... but smells WONDERFUL  !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It hydrates, it detangles and leaves your hair feeling healthy and good after just one use.  </li>
            <li>As nice as my hair feels after using it, the nauseating fragrance cancels out the benefits.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>
            <li>Fix my hair up really nice.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It smells nicely, too.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice customer service follow-up with a coupon.</li>
            <li>(I have kind of wavy hair that curls up at the bottom when it&#x27;s layered-</li>
            <li>then I thought which is a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, awesome!</li>
            <li>I have not used it in my own here yet but will soon.</li>
            <li>but oh my gosh - it makes it fall so nicely</li>
            <li>my reviews are my honest opinion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve basically tried every kind of conditioner that comes in a jar.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li>It works really nice and aceptable price</li>
            <li>I use with a warm head wrap.  </li>
            <li>Not as thrilled with the results as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>which is nice if you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>The views in this statement are strictly my own and I am not affiliated with any of these companies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My husband has commented on how nice my hair smells after I use this.</li>
            <li>The bottles also feel really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and seems to work well for my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice ( but quite perfume).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner to help soften it and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>I put the mask on, then a plastic cap on and wrap a warm towel over that.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice texture that is thicker than conditioner</li>
            <li>Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner is wonderful for my damaged&lt;br /&gt;hair and smells great.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>

            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell,</li>
            <li>I love this hair mask because it reduces frizziness and makes my hair more manageable. :)</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely scent :)</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look healthy and sleek for days afterward.</li>
            <li>It also looks shiner and healthy.  </li>
            <li>plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many products..</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Oh the seller even reached out to me, giving me more detailed instructions on how to use it!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I decided to take the plunge and purchase this hair mask, and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Most Sunday mornings, I wake up and go for a run, then immediately jump in the shower and wash my hair before applying this product.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone, and I would pay a lot more for it than what they ask for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been falling in love with this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect as a leave in (I use it as a leave in only)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>FANTASIC HAIR MASK :)))</li>
            <li>Ojon works better.</li>
            <li>Pricier, but works better than this product.</li>
            <li>I tried to look for a cheaper alternative, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to ojon until something better and more affordable comes up.</li>
            <li>I have never had such silky hair that feels so wonderful!</li>
            <li>but mostly I just care about the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>So this product with argon oil was recommended to me and I love it.</li>
            <li>The Hydrating Argan Oil Mask is good and smells fresh as well, and is conditioning and gives my hair a fuller feel.</li>
            <li>While it is conditioning and hydrating, I think the repairing conditioner did a better job.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better than it used to before I bleached it.</li>
            <li>but I love this</li>
            <li>i love the length of my hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product Works just like it says!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use the straightener every day now, which I really love.</li>
            <li>like it was 20 yeas ago, but it is remarkably better.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy a lot and keep it in case they stop making it.</li>
            <li>I should probably be taking better care of .</li>
            <li>Im already thinking about buying 5 more, before they get pricey or out of stock.  </li>
            <li>but once you wash it off, its okay tho.</li>
            <li>a must try :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>

            <li>Makes my hair much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this hair mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still trying to figure out the perfect time for my hair to leave it on, but this product actually works.</li>
            <li>After the first use I felt and saw a remarkable improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>

            <li>Works ok</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used better products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already looked into getting more.</li>
            <li>but it was better in moderation.</li>
            <li>Now it is so silky that I am in love with my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair mask worked like magic.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after a couple more uses.</li>
            <li>I satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy state.</li>
            <li>If you love overly perfumed stuff</li>
            <li>Which might have more to do with the olive oil than the DC but still.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely.</li>
            <li>smells amazing, enjoy every time using the mask.</li>

            <li>SMOOTH &amp; MOIST.</li>
            <li>This was fantastic.</li>
            <li>One use and my hair feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>While some products and treatments helped--the state of my hair wasn&#x27;t improving as much as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li>That was until I tried the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Care</li>
            <li>smooth and</li>
            <li>Leaves her bleached and damaged hair feeling silky smooth and is helping along the repair process.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for my type of hair.  </li>
            <li>frizz free</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I can feel the difference after using for the 3rd time.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013</li>
            <li>A great deep conditioner for the price!</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth</li>
            <li>Makes me hair shiny smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>For the price and how many treatments you get, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I switch up between this and my Kerastase Masque (I think switching up is important).</li>
            <li>They really have helped thicken and strengthen my hair and all produce a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic</li>
            <li>After using this mask, my hair is tangle free and smooth.</li>
            <li>But after using this product, my hair is so smoothly and weighted.</li>
            <li>but yet is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free for evaluation/testing purposes and my feedback is 100% mine and may vary from yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your hair feel so soft and smell good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve being using this treatment for more than two years, this one really make it look better my bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product; but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be formulated for coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have a very frizzy hair, I am going to buy it again, for sure :)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling nice &amp; soft &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>It left my hair so shiny and healthy that a friend commented he hasn&#x27;t seen my hair look so good.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft and everyone tells me how good it smells.</li>
            <li>hair does feel soft after using it, but there are plenty of hair conditioners and masks out there that can do that AND smell good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good deep conditioner :)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and the smell is sooooo good.</li>
            <li>Loving this so far need another:)</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY HAIR SMELL SOOOOOOOOO GOOD AND SOOOOOOOOOO SOFT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to postpone hair cuts at tje salon because my ends are in such good shape now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a far superior product.</li>
            <li>Since most people want shiny lustrous hair, I was impressed that it revives dull and dry hair giving it a beautiful shine while strengthening your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t opposed to very strong smelling deep conditioners and want your hair to look and feel healthy, I would go for it!</li>
            <li>(I LOVE my color right now but getting here was a huge process)</li>
            <li>I have fine but very curly hair that is greatly affected by humidity (which in NC in June is high).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff and plan on buying more as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li>Rich smells good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This product works really well on my highlighted hair!!!</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is very effective.</li>
            <li>Very effective deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>It was ok but not the miracle cream that everyone claimed, just being a bit more realistic.</li>
            <li>Its super hydrating and my hair will feel weightless and look super shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Has pretty good slip, and made my hair feel like pure silk and look divine.</li>
            <li>You know using a great amount of it is better than using a small portion of another better one.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t try this product please do, love the way it makes my hair feel it&#x27;s soft and manageable, first day I use it coworkers ask what did I used cause my hair looks so good.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was Okay (not bad at all, but nothing spectacular) in my natural 4C hair</li>
            <li>Okay so i have dry wavy hair and for some reason the hair stays nice and smooth for 6-8 hours  at most , say for the evening when i take a shower after gym or so and use both the products together .</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s the best hair mask I have ever bought, I&#x27;m startin to get back my strong and health before 3 pregnancies.</li>
            <li>Great for my fine dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my super delicate hair and this product is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super easy to comb through my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants soft beautiful shining hair.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I gobbed a whole bunch on to get a good dose of hydration.</li>
            <li>Not the best product I have ever used, but it certainly works for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite product!</li>

            <li>Right before I started using this mask, I did a full trim of my hair, and was sure to go through and remove any split ends.</li>
            <li>This mask is amazing, it makes my hair soft, shine, and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many kinds of products, none of them has really good effect after I dry my hair.</li>

            <li>Wow!  Love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair is significantly softer after using and it has helped reverse coloring damage.</li>

            <li>My wife bought this product and reported that she loved the wide mouth container so that she can scoop it out easily, the instructions were easy to follow, was easy to apply and rinse out, and made her Hawaiian-sun damaged hair silky smooth and new again.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using the mask, it feels healthy, soft and manageable!!!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice pleasant light scent that didn&#x27;t bother me, and was a simple off white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy, shiny, smooth and she has a ton of new hair</li>
            <li>Really made my hair smooth and easy to style.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I feel my hair getting soft, hydrated, easy to comb after rinsing, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>Got home, rinsed it out easily with warm water only, and VOILA!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my hair is so soft and strong  thank you</li>
            <li>I have used It&#x27;s a 10, Macadamia, Moroccan Oil and a few other good ones, but this is the best</li>
            <li>I had over processed hair and it restored my hair to better than normal!  </li>
            <li>silky smooth right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The results after letting it air dry are amazing!</li>
            <li>For the first time EVER my hair is manageable and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week (or a bit more often if I want my hair to look particularly good for something) and it leaves my hair feeling extra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it naturally gives me more volume.</li>
            <li>I do really like the smell its a very clean but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Great product, received quickly, as expected!</li>
            <li>For the price it is now - significantly discounted - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>hair is soft, light and smells nice ;)</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair, the conditioner was great for smoothing out frizzy and keeping my hair looking shiney</li>

            <li>My hair detangles automatically, shiny, but not greasy, and is growing quickly.</li>
            <li>Ok seriously I never writethese type of reviews.</li>
            <li>made my curls feel super soft, helped DE-tangling much easier and it smells sooooooo good.</li>
            <li>it was super unmanageable because of all the sun exposure and coloring .but</li>
            <li>Super conditioning and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I felt as if I had just applied a gloss as well because my hair was so super shiny.</li>
            <li>While I love all their products I must say this is a much better deep conditioner that I will buy in place of their version from now on.</li>
            <li>The sellers sent it to me quickly and it was wrapped well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sure be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I now use it in advance of coloring my hair and 1-2 times per week to keep my hair feeling healthy, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But the delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>didnt notice a difference, except that my hair was super oily.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a quick mask...</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product, I would definitely repurchase this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I tried the best and most expensive.</li>
            <li>I have for years tried many others and none have given me the soft, smooth &amp; hydrating feeling.</li>
            <li>This one, though, has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have bleached super processed hair colored with purple.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m pregnant, so it helps...</li>
            <li>It smells really good and because the product is very dense, it leaves my hair super soft afterwards</li>
            <li>Would prefer either scent free or a more natural scent like coconut oil - even lemon oil ,etc</li>
            <li>, I finally got this product... and couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy after.</li>
            <li>I just used it quick in the shower</li>
            <li>The mask is thick and my hair felt more moisturized- all at a great price</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Hair is soooo soft, shiny and very easy to comb thru.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>and I love all the compliments and HIGHLY recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair was so beautiful and curly,but now it was very damage and dry.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time and it left my hair manageable with a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the conditioner leaving hair so smooth and easy to straighten my curly normally frizzy hair .....</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet scent to it, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I dyed it back to my original brunette color, trimmed it, limited heat exposure, put in oils, used the best shampoos and tried just about every treatment I could think of.</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge difference with just the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it the first time you will notice a huge difference in your hair.</li>
            <li>You feel the difference on the very first use</li>
            <li>This is such a great product I recently bleached my hair and bought this to make it look better and it works.</li>
            <li>There are far better masks on the market that are much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I used this mask the very first day and it was just a wonder how silky and shiny the results were.</li>
            <li>Very first application was mindblowing.</li>
            <li>I had got this item before for free when it first came out.</li>
            <li>I used the product last night, and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I used it as a normal conditioner</li>
            <li>We are both very satisfied with this product, have already reordered it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>Once I finally get around to getting it cut, I&#x27;m sure this will keep my hair soft and looking good.</li>
            <li>the next morning, it is full, soft and behaves beautifully.  </li>
            <li>On top of this, I use the Arvazallia argan oil everyday which keeps my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair and apply a good amount each time.</li>
            <li>This mask was amazing right from the first wash its very moisturizing, completely transforms the hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weigh down my hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot</li>
            <li>Love this product makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>But I love trying new products</li>
            <li>The fact that it works great, and I use less fits both my wallet and my beauty needs.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to all my social media followers that&#x27;s how amazing it was</li>
            <li>you can get equally great product for less the price</li>
            <li>I previously was using a macadamia oil mask that I thought was doing a great job.</li>
            <li>One use and my hair was much softer and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and healthy looking and it is full of body without using styling products or blow drying.  </li>
            <li>After the first usage my hair has improved so much :)</li>
            <li>short  because the odds of successfully  untangling my hair  were very slim.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite dry, so I had to use a good amount.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use this product，It&#x27;s really wonderful！I love it</li>
            <li>Only after one use, I can feel my hair is so soft and easy to handle!!!</li>

            <li>Excellent for coarse, dry, color treated hair!</li>

            <li>I hardly write reviews on products because none of them have impressed me much.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached platinum blonde and this conditioning treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is amazing.</li>

            <li>I literally do not have one negative thing to say about this incredible product.</li>
            <li>This mask works very well and leaves your hair with a light feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but already I can tell its amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this hair mask, my hair was bleached FOUR times to get a bright red out of my hair..... and believe it or not I toned it as well FOUR TIMES, and if that didn&#x27;t do enough damage I also ran some manic panic through my hair in order to get the color I wanted!!</li>
            <li>customer service is very proactive and attentive.</li>
            <li>They really followed up and were genuinely concerned about whether or not their product was working.  </li>
            <li>But this product leaves my hair so smooth and really takes away all the frizz.</li>
            <li>Not only did it exceed my expectations, but it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few products to try and I&#x27;ve been really happy with this one.</li>

            <li>Well, I can not say enough amazing things about this product.</li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>have experimented and tinkered with every last drop in the jar in different ways, and feel that I have given this product a more than fair chance to prove</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, unless it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>makes it really soft and healthy</li>
            <li>product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of iffy about buying this product, for the reason that I&#x27;ve tried several others and non of them</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>old and our hair has become much more brittle.</li>

            <li>I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>They are more shiny and soft so..</li>
            <li>My hair was silk soft and my curls were better than ever.</li>
            <li>but this was worth a try based on price and reviews.</li>
            <li>rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>this product is worth it .i</li>
            <li>OLD PRODUCT IS TOP SHELF</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel so soft and healthy</li>

            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and healthy after using it, rather than greasy and gunky.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really healthy and soft now.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely loving it, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>This was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keeps my hair soft and moisturized with my really love.</li>
            <li>one is so worth</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a ton of product to make it work well either, so it&#x27;s definetly worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I might have bought the product again, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Thick cream, spreads easily, hydrates, and leaves my hair shiny, clean, and smelling gorgeous.</li>

            <li>(considering how often this happens with beauty products, it’s worth mentioning).</li>
            <li>Check the customer images for more, along with details about how I take my before and after pictures (always on product-free, residue-free, naturally air-dried hair).</li>
            <li>Prefer a more natural ingredient product if using this product weekly on my hair.</li>
            <li>So soft, shiny, manageable, i even cancelled my hair trim app since it was so healthy.</li>
            <li>I have tried the product and I am satisfied so far with it.</li>

            <li>and my hair is soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this 2-3 times weekly and my hair is soft and more manageable.</li>

            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent months trying products and reading reviews to find the best product.. something that actually works.</li>
            <li>I keep touching it because its so soft I can&#x27;t keep my hands off it.</li>
            <li>My hair looked healthy and was soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price for what it does.</li>
            <li>I am nearly out and about to by more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Made my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>so far but already felt my hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now, I always make sure to rinse it out completely</li>
            <li>After one treatment of this stuff, my hair felt soft and healthy, including my ends.</li>
            <li>Hair felt soft and so healthy looking after one time use.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair moisturized and deeply conditioned that I feel it&#x27;s more shiny and smooth even if I have curly</li>
            <li>but it still leaves my hair smelling fresh at all times when I use it.</li>
            <li>I just purchased my second jar because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>First off, I love hair masks and this new product now and one of them.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my long, dry, curly hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>I went from have dried, brittle bleached blond hair, to having very healthy, easily brushable hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing results!My hair is so soft &amp; has an amazing shine!I used to hold my hair up without a scrunchie, due to its thickness.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, it made a huge positive difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommended if you have dry frizzy hair like mines!</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews and deciding to purchase it, I have to totally agree with other people that this hair mask is the best!</li>
            <li>This impressed me enough that I will be investigating other products by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li>And now the struggle to get my hair back to it&#x27;s original healthy state begins.</li>
            <li>I love this product the first time I used it my hair felt so soft and looked so healthy.......love it !</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, so I go through it pretty quickly</li>
            <li>This product not only rinses out cleanly, it works a lot better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Everything positive you are reading about this product is true.</li>
            <li>Smells very good, subtle.</li>
            <li>I felt pretty good about the product, hair is silky, though I only used it once after purchasing, Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My long frizzy hair has never looked and behaved better ...ever!  </li>
            <li>Not only the customer services is awesome and fast with the replies and concern, but the product works as long as you use it as instructed.</li>
            <li>Tried this hair mask for the first time, left it on after shampoo for couple minutes, my hair feels soft and looks great too.</li>
            <li>I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner compared to other ones I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and makes your hair super soft!  </li>
            <li>I got the product from the mail and tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>Why shell out money going to the salon when you can get treatment in the comforts of your home right?</li>
            <li>i saw the results right away no lie</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s just not the right product for my texture.</li>
            <li>well this product right here did impress me allright.</li>
            <li>My hair (new growth) is so manageable and easy to comb through</li>
            <li>I have smooth, pretty curls rather than frizzy, chunky ones, and my hair takes to styling much easier.</li>
            <li>My hair is more softer,shinier and my black hair looked more natural and surprisingly i think its making my hair more dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bleaching my own hair pretty regularly for years.</li>
            <li>I have long, super fine hair which gets split ends easily.</li>
            <li>After a good clarifying shampoo my hair is back to normal, but it never felt sticky or waxy before using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used a popular mask for several years and I find that this is just as good for half the $$$$.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent that is not unpleasant, it smells like a mixture of olive/argan oil to me, definitely not an over-powering scent.  </li>
            <li>It certainly showed results instantly, and the smell is the cherry on top of a sundae!</li>
            <li>Hydrating ArganOil Hair Mask is very nice and you use very little so for the price it will be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use it twice a week , I think that more times a week leaves your hair greasy , and less won&#x27;t let you see the results</li>
            <li>this is the only hair mask that makes my hair smooth and easy to comb</li>
            <li>Makes my color treated hair super soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>However, this just isn&#x27;t doing it for me; it smells great and feels soft while on, but always leaves my hair feeling dry and looking frizzy.</li>
            <li>I find that I get best results when I let my hair partially air dry, but that&#x27;s not always feasible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I loved the way my hair felt, but after a couple more uses my hair started losing it&#x27;s volume and feeling sort of strange--I don&#x27;t want to say it was greasy but it quit feeling dry but it was only because it was coated with this stuff and not because it was hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Great on my overly processed hair, even apply small amounts on the tips of my hair before curling as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, but so far I am pleased and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and it lasts long after I&#x27;ve rinsed.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical upon ordering this, but I totally loved it now and am just glad I gave this product a try!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use packaging that wasn’t leaking (plus!)</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>She had very thin blonde hair and this product made it incredible gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This Hydrating Argan Oil is a FANTASTIC product - I love the way it makes my hair moisturized and straight even without using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This really works for my hair, left my hair soft and easy to comb, smell nice.</li>
            <li>It gives not only a good natural  looking, but also keeps my hairs in style.</li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a really good find.</li>
            <li>soft, shining and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>Kind of dry when I opened it</li>
            <li>This product is amazing...makes my hair soft, easy to comb and calms the frizzes.  </li>
            <li>Problem is, I liked it so much, I started using it as my daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I get the best results when I put it all over my head and then, using a wide tooth comb, comb through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>It is equally as good and about half the price.  </li>
            <li>My ONLY slightly-not-great review is that the scent is a bit masculine, like AXE body wash, but the product is so good that I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft and easy to manage and the smell is nice.works for my daughters hair</li>
            <li>I uses it once a week and its great for adding moisture back into the hair if you get blonde highlights or dye your hair.</li>
            <li>I loved how soft it left my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair becameuch more soft, supple and much easier to manage....</li>
            <li>I was kind of in a rush and only had a 2-3 mins, but really wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it more frequently than it recommends to target my ends specifically and have really noticed an improvement in the texture and health of my hair, including my ends.</li>
            <li>I am a single mother of two girls in their 20s and we all think this mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair was able to be brushed right afterwards which is quite the feat.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Like it very much.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very reasonably priced -</li>
            <li>This mask definitely adds shine and made my hair very smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Found the results to be great when used either as a light conditioner or deep conditioning with the added benefit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it revives dull, dry hair, giving it more elasticity thus managability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished with a drop of Argon oil for added shine the results are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unadvertised benefit, works great as a hand cream... softness without the least bit of greasiness..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introductory special price or otherwise, I would highly recommend the Arvazallia Oil and Mask for those seeking a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>They break down easily when applied to allow the lovely ingredients to benefit the skin/hair.</li>
            <li>It felt so great that I have been looking at the complete range of products to determine if there is any other one in the line that I may want to try.</li>
            <li>Product has a good fragrance and is thick and rich consistency.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say it left my hair very soft and manageable,to all my natural sisters please try it.</li>
            <li>First I use a good clarifying shampoo, then I put this stuff on and leave it in for a little while I finish the rest of my shower.</li>
            <li>Excellent  conditioner,  a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and gives great slip!.</li>
            <li>I have high lights in my hair and with this my hair is soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that easily gets knots when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to see the results in first hair wash...</li>
            <li>Very happy..highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I could see an improvement even after the first use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I have used higher end products ranging from 50-85 $</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair light and soft and I just can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Will keep using to improve my hair, it was pretty damaged from color treatments.</li>
            <li>Wifey says this one is a keeper! ;-)</li>
            <li>mak really reduce the frizz!</li>
            <li>I love it and definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I enjoy soft, defined curls without holding them with mousse or gel.</li>
            <li>Maybe because my hair was pretty destroyed?</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this product in the future</li>
            <li>After the first use i could tell the difference.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second container and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended :)</li>
            <li>Being the avid shopper I am on Amazon, I searched and found this Argan oil hair mask.  </li>
            <li>most likely to re-order</li>
            <li>Very hydrating!</li>
            <li>I can see the difference in the first use.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bit more moisturized but</li>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>I used this in place of my conditioner for the first time and I can already feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I would not have even bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>Just after one use i could see how much silky my hair was!</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used it for the first time ever</li>
            <li>After only a couple of uses, my hair does feel softer and looks so much more healthier.</li>
            <li>I used my regular shampoo with it and voila it is magic.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS SURREAL</li>
            <li>I love this deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioning mask!  </li>
            <li>my hair feels silky and healthy the next day.</li>
            <li>My hair can get so dry and damaged but this always helps me smooth it out and improve the quality of my hair so quickly!</li>
            <li>It has a soft scent which I enjoy.</li>
            <li>so so many different products</li>
            <li>but this product renews it and leaves it soft and smooth</li>
            <li>love the smell of this deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought hair mask before this but from my experience, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>After trying so many products, I think I finally found the &#x27;ONE&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this conditioner I was blown away.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this hair mask.  </li>
            <li>My hair is color treated, but I&#x27;ve had many compliments on the health of my hair from multiple stylists.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I knew that there would be a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and noticed an immediate difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s soft and just doesn&#x27;t make my hair silky smooth is all.</li>
            <li>especially if you have 4c hair:)</li>
            <li>My first  review ever...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>The first two days that ive tried it</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>The argan oil mask and argan oil conditioner really helped!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, as well as the entire line of Arvazallia products.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I had read all the five star reviews prior to buying this hair mask, which made me want to purchase this product that much more.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t give me that silky, smooth, naturally shiny, healthy-looking result I desired.</li>
            <li>I have tried many deep conditioners, and even at home</li>
            <li>This is the first time I write a review, but because I could see the result from the first time I use it, I decided to write this review.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for hair products that will make my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time 2 days ago.</li>
            <li>it conditions very well!</li>
            <li>First time using this product and I am liking it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li>Love how my hair feels when I use this product, I only use it twice a week</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this when i run out.</li>
            <li>I used according to package instructions and my hair was noticeably softer after my first use.</li>
            <li>It is also curly therefore it gets pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li>I tried the Moroccan Oil first</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try the product.</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t write many product reviews, but Arvazallia&#x27;s Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask is a product definitely worthy of a five-star review!  </li>
            <li>She first started using it every day, then backed off to 2-3 times per week as the condition of her hair improved.</li>
            <li>My hair was incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had low expectations for this product, but after 4 uses I can say that I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different professional-brand conditioners and balms.</li>
            <li>Thought my hair was &amp;#34;Arganed&amp;#34; out after using so many of the same products and didn&#x27;t think me hair would respond.  </li>
            <li>FIRST, A NOTE ABOUT HAIR PRODUCTS CONTAINING ALCOHOL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shopping as fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I received a couple compliments the day after I first used this.</li>
            <li>From the first use I felt and saw the difference.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the ends of my hair soft, smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>If you screwed up your hair you should probably go to a salon first.</li>
            <li>Seems to hydrate pretty well.</li>
            <li>I tried much more expansive brands, with the same effect.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the Argan oil, which I LOVE, and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li>Then rinse :) i swore on Its a 10 products for deep conditioning but this blows them out of the water.</li>
            <li>If not and you don&#x27;t get  my first answer, send this again.</li>
            <li>I also have to leave it on ends only, as conditioners leave my hair greater than I like.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash it out thoroughly because it left my hair oily</li>
            <li>first though when I saw it was &amp;#34;China product&amp;#34; baah.  </li>
            <li>for the first time..</li>
            <li>I am writing this review after just purchasing my second Hair Mask, which tells you by itself: I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m interested in trying it as a leave-in and letting my natural curls roam free.</li>
            <li>I am very close to 70!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Feel way better than my Paul Mitchel&#x27;s Hair Repair which I have been using in the last twenty years.</li>
            <li>my hair us really smooth and soft ...</li>
            <li>Used it on the first night for 10 mins and no results.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>.After hair oils, hair masks are my next favorite thing.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I never run out of hair mask because without it, is just not the same for my over-processed hair.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what everyone said it would do.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and is in need of a touch-up at 8 weeks when I first used this product.</li>
            <li>I tried a different product a couple of years ago that cost more and found no difference in the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>You can see the difference in your hair from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>This hair mask smells great and works wonderfully on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference after first use.</li>
            <li>I will buy more from the same brand.</li>
            <li>I have just purchased the hot oil treatment to go along with it.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I have a mixture of 4a/b hair and my crown is 4c.</li>
            <li>It does relax curls a bit, so if you&#x27;re going for a curly effect, it would be better to use a different conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deep conditioner to use.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this Deep Conditioner Mask in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extremely soft, 100% tangle free, shinier and just easier to manage.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it out, my curls are more defined than with regular conditioners.</li>
            <li>I have really thick curly hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Saw results after first use.</li>
            <li>, I can feel much better the day after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase but this conditioner is fantastic, it leaves my hair manageable but not heavy.</li>
            <li>and it just feels like a regular conditioner, unlike the Moroccan brand where it is thicker and feels more like a treatment.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many types of shampoos and conditioners, attempting to soften my coarse hair.</li>
            <li>has first class customers service.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my coarse, curly hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I use it from the middle of my head and downwards, trying not to get my front, or top hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still pretty damaged.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;Really  this product work fantastic, the hair looks silky , soft and shinny,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft and smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>and it can feel pretty fried sometimes.</li>
            <li>I love this deep condtioner!  </li>
            <li>BUT after using this mask I was absolutely blown away by the immediate results!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li>texture of my hair definitely got lot more stronger.</li>
            <li>And my hair definitely got a lot more shinier.</li>
            <li>Just used this product for the first time and I must admit, it works really well!  </li>
            <li>And rinsing smoothly and soft .</li>
            <li>It is a litte oily for me after the first day of use</li>
            <li>They will definitely be my default company I&#x27;ll buy more products from.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>my hair was shiny and soo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First Time</li>
            <li>love this conditioner, it made such a difference after the 1st application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it; my hair actually MOVES now.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil and so many different conditioners - none of them came close!</li>
            <li>Put the exact amount and don&#x27;t leave it  longer than listed in the instructions.</li>
            <li>This really works well..!</li>
            <li>will definitely buy more of this</li>
            <li>After the first use my hair felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it was pretty fried.</li>
            <li>I would imagine with continued use, the results would only get better over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different conditioners I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice, so maybe I&#x27;ll try it more regularly and see how that goes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using since I first got it</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for many years and this is the one stand out product I have used in the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>I left it on over night hoping that it would condition better.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this hair mask</li>
            <li>I use hot tools and dye my hair</li>
            <li>You see results after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I needed a mask that would provide good moisture without leaving my hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>Curls were good dried but not frizzy.</li>
            <li>She has a lot of trouble finding a good product</li>
            <li>This is a nice, thick cream that stays in for the treatment period and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is oober soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Also, the formula is very rich, so the product should last a while.</li>
            <li>works great on my soooo dried hair!!</li>
            <li>And after so many try-and-fail&#x27;s with other conditioners, I honestly feel like I finally found one that works (yay)!</li>
            <li>She has very thick dark hair, and this stuff adds a nice shine, and more importantly, makes it more manageable to put in ponytails without a lot of brushing etc.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and alive :)</li>
            <li>Right now I use HSI which I really like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it did or not, but it certainly feels different and it seems to work better than having my hair conditioned at the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now ready to follow the recommended use because it has really improved my hair a great deal in the past week.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tends to get dry in colder months.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and left my hair soft and detangled on the first use.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair become silkier and moisture held longer than usual while using this product, and shine was in my hair which appeared natural, rather than when you have a shinier look from applying a hair product that gives the appearance of a greasy look, which this product did not do, rather a natural shine to the hair which was impressive.  </li>
            <li>Especially after a long summer being in the pool with the kids, this is the best product to get my hair back in shape.</li>
            <li>In an effort to curtail the breakage, I invested in Kerastase conditioner plus a couple of other popular brands.  </li>
            <li>You can safely apply it from the roots to the ends, without the hair looking flat...</li>
            <li>After 2 applications, I can see a significant improvement in my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair tamed and shiny,  clean and not a bit greasy - better than other products!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for dry bleached hair!!!</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that this mask is 100% sulfate and paraben free, but unfortunately contains silicones, which I wanted to mention in case if this is something you are trying to avoid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it seriously wasn&#x27;t that great to me...</li>
            <li>Amazing product, made my bleached hair soft and silky after just one use, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I used it only once so far and the outcome was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos/conditioners/hair masks nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still in the early stages of using this, but so far I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my ends looked at least 80% better.</li>
            <li>Getting a comb through my hair after conditioning would be a struggle, but I don&#x27;t own a comb, and my broken handled hairbrush was fighting it even more.</li>
            <li>my hair is chemically treated ( blonde ) and very porous... trying to find a conditioner that actually helps to make it feel soft and this is by far the best ive found !  </li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week instead of my regular conditioner and It leaves my hair very silky and smooth!.</li>
            <li>and you get so much of it, but also because I am using the mask twice a week which is probably not necessary for most people.</li>
            <li>and you get so much of it, but also because I am using the mask twice a week which is probably not necessary for most people.</li>
            <li>I thought what&#x27;s so different about this line compared to others and how can it really help my hair become healthy once again</li>
            <li>It definitely left my perm hair really soft &amp; nice.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is easily weighed down by, well everything.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week and it leaves my curls looking very healthy, but when I straighten my hair my roots look a little greasy</li>
            <li>My hair is significantly smoother and seems to be growing in a little better.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Makes hair super soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several products like this one and I can tell you that my hair feels really smooth right after usage.</li>
            <li>While I do like this product for leaving my hair soft and healthy looking, the smell is a little more &amp;#34;elderly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have dry hair that has been colored for years ... tried several products including Wen and this is amazing!  </li>
            <li>it after first use, made my dry, over-processed hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>No more static electricity, easy to comb after washing.</li>
            <li>Took a chance and ordered this after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews and prices was the reason I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought hair products online before, but the positive reviews convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li>For me, this is a positive thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using the Argan Oil Hair Oil this company puts out, read positive reviews about the hair mask and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I would definitely use more products in the Arvazallia line and would recommend to others who may be looking for a hair product that covers all the basic and important areas of your hair regime.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing the first time but after that, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>It works better than  most of the other products I&#x27;ve tried and usually paid much more for.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used the whole jar in 1 use.</li>
            <li>Making my long hair really smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other hair masks, but this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says, my hair is much softer and manageable.</li>
            <li>its really nice but the quantity is not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expected it could have that good result, but this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li>I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only did it improve the condition of my hair, but my color was immediately deeper and much more vibrant.</li>
            <li>sure does make my hair nice and soft, so much so that it loses it&#x27;s body and bounce.</li>
            <li>:)  HIGHLY recommended to purchase their entire system.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to run my fingers through my hair in a long time!</li>
            <li>Im only giving it 4 stars because I widh the bottle were bigger, other that that its great!</li>
            <li>They even followed up the order with a e-mail to see if I had any concerns and a big list of how to use the product to get the best results and various other ideas.  </li>
            <li>Do not use more than what it says in the instructions and do not leave too long!</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and wavy (mostly frizzy)</li>
            <li>But for less than $20, this is an amazing mask.</li>
            <li>I ended up just squeezing most of the water out of my hair then applying the mask (no towel dry needed).</li>
            <li>I just bleached my hair and it makes it feel super soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my bleached curly dry hair feel softer for sure.  </li>
            <li>leaves hair super soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After one use, my hair feels super soft and it shines.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with dry brittle hair would love this.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel super silky soft in and out of the shower</li>
            <li>She used this one time and her hair felt super soft after one use like her hair used to feel years ago.  </li>
            <li>Makes my course hair super soft.</li>
            <li>After using it my hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; It has revitalized my hair that was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>After I blew it dry, I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth it was!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to having to put a ton of product in my hair, letting it air dry, dealing with resulting frizz, more product, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair has been processed for years and the top layer has been so dry it felt like straw.</li>
            <li>Left hair very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Really feels nice on my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Its been dyed many colors over the years, and I straightened it every single day for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>An alcohol in this sense is not a fermented mixture; it is a chemical compound of a certain molecular structure based on carbon and oxygen.</li>
            <li>This hair mask leaves hair pretty soft, but it&#x27;s really only because it contains a silicone that coats the hair and makes it appear healthy.</li>
            <li>I donate my hair every few years and the hair dresses can never believe how healthy the donations are!</li>
            <li>The product was new in the package and the seller has checked back with me to verify that I was satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly dig smells in general, but this one is fine.</li>
            <li>For my hair, which is curly, dry, and definitely tangly, this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You have to be careful and not use too much, though, or your hair will be INCREDIBLY greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>This right here is my new hair Holy grail.</li>
            <li>I have fine color treated blonde hair.</li>
            <li>My individual hair shafts are fine, but I have a lot of hair and it is somewhat wavy.</li>
            <li>I did not see a miraculous hair transformation, but using this along with a good hair trim has gone a long way to making my dry, over processed, over colored hair look much healthier!  </li>
            <li>I used this product right after dying my hair and it was very soft.</li>
            <li>Reviews are right about this product- hair is very soft and shiny after I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>You could imagine the state of my hair, which is waist length &amp; very thick, so I have a ton of it, which sounds great</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic for such a large jar of it, too.</li>
            <li>A little bit of fragrance is nice, but way too much in this product.</li>

            <li>It does not work very well for my purposes.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair softer and price is very affordable.</li>

            <li>The mask, when used with the oil, has made a real difference in the look and feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The damage I did really scared me.  </li>
            <li>I use too much of the product.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to buy this mask (thanks to the reviews) and</li>
            <li>It Left my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>oh so very shiny.</li>

            <li>It was really overpowering.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>and it has helped my hair so much.....</li>

            <li>but i was very disapointed becuse its been expired since march...</li>
            <li>my friend who works in a very $$ salon gave me this inside info.  </li>
            <li>What I expected was a bit more moisture and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have realized this would be very per fumy.</li>
            <li>But the smell is what really put this one over the edge for me</li>
            <li>Twice a week with leaving on over night is promising with favorable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very conditioning.</li>
            <li>I wanted to write this review for those who have virgin hair, like myself, as I couldn&#x27;t find much below.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well both ways.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>and it really works well with me.</li>
            <li>So, I expected more than I</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend !</li>
            <li>and I have found argon oil really helps to hydrate my hair</li>
            <li>This product, after three uses, left my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping and a very helpful follow up e-mail.</li>
            <li>and this hair mask really helps with that without making my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Very well package and on time delivery</li>
            <li>and the product is real.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to cut my curly damaged hair.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>It is filled with silicones and argan oil is one of the last ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>The effect has been very restorative without greasiness or weight being added.</li>
            <li>Hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I chose this solely based on Amazon rating/reviews, and it really did work well and soften my brittle hair.  </li>
            <li>This has really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need a lot</li>
            <li>and I think the two really gives my hair the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li>so I really think it would work on all hair types.</li>
            <li>It works really well this way.</li>
            <li>This works very well and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely be reordering at this price....</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free, for testing and reviewing purposes ONLY!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think anything would make that much of a difference but after reading all the reviews I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like hair masks</li>
            <li>so much so that I made a point of using it once per week.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my hair look and feel longer and silkier.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li>My hair also looks very shiny.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>i have very frizzy hair nd damaged</li>
            <li>This one is much cheaper and helps my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks now, and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a big difference in how soft and healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I think my results are only going to improve and am thrilled with the results after only two treatments!</li>
            <li>Not too heavy or &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; .. smells nice</li>
            <li>The oil I used daily on the ends of my hair only, which gave a nice immediate improvement in appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is exceptional and far exceeds my previous expectations.</li>
            <li>and this product moisturizes it nicely without a heavy feel.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>This product has my hair feeling back to its soft healthy self.</li>
            <li>First use made my hair silky, but then my hair became even more dry!!!!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>SO soft!!!</li>
            <li>the long high volume fine hair is back!.I wish I had been aware of these products years ago.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this because of the positive reviews, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>When I want to flat iron my hair for a smooth look, this product makes the process so much easier.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly when my hair is good and every other day when it feels extra dry-like in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now and am very pleased with how soft and less frizzy my hair becomes -- I just stay to live running my fingers through my hair!</li>
            <li>My hair has been damaged and very dry and brittle, the first treatment was a huge turn around.</li>
            <li>Before using this product I had to use a flat iron or curling iron to smooth out the frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li>the final product is what makes this worth it for me!</li>
            <li>there are other products out there that so a lot better.</li>
            <li>My hairs have got damaged after many times of dye, perms and other things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it mostly in the shower by adding it to my squeezed out hair, leaving it in, doing my other shower stuff and then rinsing.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use it once or twice a week because of how rich it is.</li>
            <li>i have tried other products nothing works on my hair like this product does love it.</li>
            <li>She had tried many of the better-known products to help the extreme brittle, breaking and thinning condition of her hair that she was experiencing.</li>
            <li>I have tried other hair products that have an overwhelming smell or scent that just won&#x27;t go away, but the Arvazallia hair mask is not like that.  </li>
            <li>You will notice a significant difference in your hair after your second use.</li>
            <li>This extremely hydrating hair mask is my favorite in the bunch.</li>
            <li>hair is softer after using it, but it is nothing more that any other Hydrating product can do .</li>
            <li>I have natural, 4C, kinky hair &amp; it makes my hair SUPER soft, Manageable, Moisturized, and Dehydrated!</li>
            <li>Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair - I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I wrap it in a Turbie Twist and clean the apartment, do some homework, and throw my laundry in before getting back into the shower to wash it out.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this mask my hair was noticeably smoother, softer and didn&#x27;t feel dried out, it also made my split ends look better.  </li>
            <li>Wow, from the first use my hair felt so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Took a couple treatments to notice a difference but since then it has kept my long hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>All the Redken, Chi, and Biosilk products I use to clean, nourish, and style my hair just aren&#x27;t enough to manage it and/or replenish moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy, baby fine (fly-away) hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li>I color my hair so it cut down on the dryness and made it very smooth just after one use.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li>What I got what a good deep conditioner that helps keep frizz down.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on in the last few minutes of their shower and their hair feels wonderful and combs right out!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but generic, and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone with damaged hair that wants a smoother and healthier looking hair.</li>
            <li>-- I will start out by saying I have very straight brown hair of normal thickness that I am currently trying to grow out (not that it really matters, but it&#x27;s hangs to about the bottom of my shoulder blades right now).  </li>
            <li>Almost tangle free from the rinsing out of it and made it a breeze to blow dry straight.</li>
            <li>amazing for the coarse, dry hair I have.  </li>
            <li>The ends are not nearly as dry as they used to be and it looks smooth and feels soft after just blow drying.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair as well for the same keeps my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li>It left my hair incredibly soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine indian hair which gets very dry and frizzy during the winter months and wanted to get something really moisturizing and organic.</li>
            <li>I felt how smooth it was RIGHT after I washed it out when it was still wet!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my hair at all, but it leaves it feeling soft and healthy and gives it a pretty shine that I normally don&#x27;t see without finishing spray!</li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair that I get colored and highlighted every eight weeks.  </li>
            <li>Mine is coloring and heat damaged vey dry fine hair.</li>
            <li>plan to keep using this as my primary conditioner as long as it continues to work as well as it has been.</li>
            <li>I will use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I have fine over proccecced na dreally damaged hair that it gets so dry soemtimes</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, blond, and bone dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Going to give a full rinse out a shot next time to see if that makes any difference at all.  </li>
            <li>Want my money back or a full bottle of the thing</li>
            <li>The not as directed way worked better but so far In my two uses ,this stuff is not great or even better than a drug store conditioner.</li>
            <li>This made my hair so soft and silky with just the first use</li>
            <li>Directions indicated to use it for several minutes on damp towel-dried hair, I left it on for several hours with good results.</li>
            <li>After first use my hair was silky soft.</li>
            <li>First time I used this product and it made my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Pretty good..didn&#x27;t stop breakage..but soft manageable hair</li>
            <li>Normally she has very Frizzy hair</li>
            <li>One use completely brought my hair back to its natural healthy feel and made it shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I did not like how my hair turned out the day after the first use, but now my hair is really soft.</li>
            <li>my hair feels incredibly soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>she isn&#x27;t willing to share with her mom ~ unless it&#x27;s her asking for me to touch her hair because it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so healthy and shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because this is heavier than a conditioner, make sure you rinse out ALL of the product before getting out of the shower so that your hair is not weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li>it felt heavier, fuller, but not in a weighed down way; it felt healthy.</li>
            <li>I used about a Tablespoon amount on my hair (just from neck down - I don&#x27;t condition the top of my head).</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and this did not create a greasy feel that so many products can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as instructed, and ever since I&#x27;ve begun using it my hair has gotten really tangled and gross feeling, becoming super matted and seems to be due to the build up this product is causing.</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair super soft like others claim), but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried about how good this product actually would end up being.</li>
            <li>I also recommended my friend and she has fallen in live with the product too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying something new in attempt to tame my hair, but nothing (not even high end salon products) have ever been as effective as this.</li>
            <li>My hair felt super soft, moist &amp; light; not coated or weighed down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to write reviews for hair conditioning products, but for mine (Asian) it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try again -not as directed- using less on top of another conditioner to try to seal in the moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>Still need a bit more uses (it&#x27;s been about a week) to see if my split ends decrease or are less visible.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lasted me a lot I still have more than half</li>
            <li>For an added boost, after I rinsed out the mask in the shower, I put more on my hair and wrapped it in a towel and let it sit for about a half hour and rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li>It works better that the previous ones I tried.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product, my hair is so shiny and a lot less frizzy when I use this mask.</li>
            <li>I love my previous argan oil hair mask from EVA NYC, but I was looking for a cheaper alternative and decided to purchase this one.</li>
            <li>On top of that, lately my hair has been very brittle and breaking easy, so I thought to try a deep conditioner to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li>I still use the Mizani smooth guard serum to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I saw a difference immediately after using the products and everytime I use them, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle.</li>
            <li>Just seemed like a somewhat greasier version of decent conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using this as a daily treatment and never have I felt my hair to be this smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Probably not the main demographic for this product</li>
            <li>But this is more of a mask for occasional hair repair than daily-use.more of a mask for occasional hair repair than daily-use.</li>
            <li>I USED TOP OF THE LINE CONDITIONER BEFORE THIS MORE EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li>Its makes my hair really soft and tangle free, will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Its more like a regular conditioner actually.</li>
            <li>time I left it on for just 5 min in the shower and still left my hair much better</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future .</li>
            <li>it makes  my hair feel so soft, i will keep using it thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Great for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>and it left my hair feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>In creams and lotions, it supports the main emulsion system and gives texture to the product.</li>
            <li>to the main issue</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair really soft and smooth, especially when paired with the curl cream after.</li>
            <li>Once I rinsed, my hair was not detangled and did not seem particularly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>and omg, It&#x27;s like a different set of hair on my head, doesn&#x27;t look oily but super silky and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this is the only one that has worked.  </li>
            <li>but I leave it on for at least ten, twice a week, and get great results.</li>
            <li>It performed better than even much more expensive conditioners that I have used before.</li>
            <li>Been using it as my main conditioner for every wash.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and will never go back to regular conditioner again.</li>
            <li>I have fully highlighted hair, and was shopping around for deep conditioners as my $150/tub of Oribe was quickly running out.</li>
            <li>So I quickly put it in my hair, washed it out brushed through my hair and went on with my day..</li>
            <li>Decent moisturizer for the price.</li>
            <li>I use products generously but a little goes a long way, also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves my hair, which is very thick and long, feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Thus far,  it has made a positive difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioners ranging from cheap to expensive for my bleached, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Left my hair super soft !!</li>
            <li>I probably didn&#x27;t even keep it on as long as suggested and it still made my hair smooth and really soft but still very curly.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I needed to find something because my hair was a frizzy mess with split ends and flyaways from putting so many highlights in.</li>
            <li>Really makes your hair soft!</li>
            <li>This works very well for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>I later buy it for gifts for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>My wife is Latina and has thick brown hair that is quite healthy!</li>
            <li>I really fried my hair right after using it and had to switch to Olaplex but will go back to this eventually.</li>
            <li>I am aware there may be other more expensive products out there that may work better for two or three times the price, but I am pleased with the quality offered by this one and not eager to fork over extra for a marginal difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product, even if the cost is a bit high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I need to use it a few more times before I really see the results as it seems my hair likes new products in general.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair silky and smooth and it&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the other highly rated hair masks.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets, my hair is soft, hydrated and manageable since the very first used.</li>
            <li>- I used it, wasn&#x27;t for me, clearly tons of other people love it,</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t follow the directions out of the box, I felt my hair really needed deep conditioning more often because it has dry and frizzy ends from years of chemical treatments.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the other popular Argan oil deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>This would not be as effective for me if I only used it every other wash.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I have Curly thick hair, This product moisturizes my hair and leaves it feeling soft and less frizzy and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally coily, frizzy, and dry, and each application of this product leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, and intensely hydrated, and comb out is a breeze!</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky soft!!</li>
            <li>Just a little bit after shampooing, I don&#x27;t wait more than a minute to rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>but this mask moisturizes my hair a little better than the Kerastase.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for several hours, it rinses clean and my hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I ruined my hair by putting too much protein in my hair and now it is super dry.</li>
            <li>I have natural curled with highlights so my hair tends to get dry and easily tangled.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I digress...), the scent that remains is very gentle and barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised, it actually helped to repair my super damaged hair</li>
            <li>Very hydrating but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft and silky and it helped so much with these high humidity days we are having.</li>
            <li>This hair mask really hydrated my hair and makes it feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>When my hair dried, it was perfect - back to the way it used to be before it got dried out.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped to restore body and shine to my 62 year old hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was over processed and it made it so soft and so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Its really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t notice too much irritation.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky, and really helps with manageability in these humid summer months.</li>
            <li>Really has helped to add moisture to my hair and leaves it with a soft finish.</li>
            <li>I used Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration</li>
            <li>This really does leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times so far and really like the shine and softness.</li>
            <li>It also makes my natural hair really curl up and shine.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft, really takes frizz.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky soft and very manageable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my hair soft, silky, shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>but I just tried the hair mask for one time and my hair is straight and it feels so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels real soft after application.</li>
            <li>, it really made my hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY SHINY AND SOFT .</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen my hair look this healthy in such a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped that after several days off and weekends in a row that maybe my results would be cumulative, and that parading around in my undergarments with dairy queen dollar menu dessert for hair might be worth it someday, but I was eventually running out of mask and not seeing results.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy a second bottle of &amp;#34;any&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Flaked and dried my hair out more</li>
            <li>These improvements seem short lived so far, but I am hoping with regular use that I will see more long-lasting changes.</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition like normal and then put this in and comb it through and then leave it about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>about 20 times - you really don&#x27;t need more than a small scoop.</li>
            <li>It last forever worth the money.</li>
            <li>I followed the mask by applying a couple of pumps of the same brand oil to hair along my regular styling products, I have been very pleasantly surprised at the improvement after each use, after blow drying my hair, my hair looked healthy and felt very supple and was soft all over.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see my hair getting greasey any faster than it normally does</li>
            <li>I used Color-Proofs shampoo Detox to get rid of buildup, then shampooed like normal using my Redken.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a product worth trying.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair immensely soft and smooth, and makes them appear fresher for long.</li>
            <li>I shampoo my hair like normal, but instead of using conditioner, I use the Arvazalia Oil Mask.</li>
            <li>This condition is amazing and helps me and my daughter&#x27;s long thick frizzy hair to be smooth and soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>then my normal</li>
            <li>&amp;  rarely purchase the same thing twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally cut off most of the long damaged hair I had and have been growing the rest out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my blonde sister will definitely appreciate a jar for what&#x27;s left of her hair. ;)</li>
            <li>Cetearyl alcohol is used across our entire range of fresh products as an emulsifier.</li>
            <li>I actually use this as regular conditioner 3-4 times a week which is much more frequent than what the instructions suggest, but haven&#x27;t noticed any problems yet.</li>
            <li>I have normal kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li>In one use my hair felt so healthy, i box dye my hair straighten everyday</li>
            <li>My hair has never been more soft and silky, and the results truly last through to my next shampoo (about once a week)!  </li>
            <li>As good, if not better than the deep conditioning treatments I get at the salon.  </li>
            <li>no complaint about that</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this hair mask once a week between your normal shampoo and conditioning routine.</li>
            <li>This hair mask was nice an thick.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time the other day and it made my fine blonde hair very managable.</li>
            <li>I started using this product twice a week about a month ago and it has really helped smooth down my hair and delay the occurrence of split ends without making making my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair sliky soft and healthy looking without weighting it down.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, it makes it lay down better</li>
            <li>I felt that the mask really nourished by hair and even though it was thick it was easy to rinse out!</li>
            <li>My long, fine, curly hair had suddenly become fried-feeling in certain spots.</li>
            <li>I use it differently than most, probably, in that I apply it to dry hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did leave it super soft but it also left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Just apply it in your hair after use the shampoo, then slightly massage your hair from root and wait from 5 mins to 7 mins, finally, wash your hair with warm water.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and smooth and dry faster</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling super soft, with no tangles at all.</li>
            <li>and I do have colored, thin but strong hair, and it detangled my hair so well and make it so smooth.</li>
            <li>This hair mask is super thick and light</li>
            <li>After bleaching my hair several times it was really damaged and I couldn&#x27;t keep it healthy even though I tried coconut oil, egg and other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone, leaves your hair EXTREAMLY soft, no tangles and gives it shine!</li>
            <li>have pretty fine hair- wavy when dried naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, long, colored hair that was starting to feel very brittle.</li>
            <li>and this seems to tame it even when I straighten it :)</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say if you have baby fine hair, just use a dime to nickel&#x27;s worth of it or it can weigh you hair down.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which is rare because I have such baby fine</li>
            <li>works very well on dry hair and the price was right</li>
            <li>Great for my thick dry hair!</li>
            <li>My Hair: Baby fine, blonde, color treated, straight, dry, brittle, split ends, frizzy, dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner once, but I must say it&#x27;s the most hydration conditioner I&#x27;ve used for a long while.  </li>
            <li>The jar is a good size and you don&#x27;t need much, even for long and thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shinning  and new</li>
            <li>We live in FLA - and chlorine, saltwater and sun do a job on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Use it 3 times a week leave it for 10 minutes comb hair and it leaves it like new.</li>
            <li>my hair is like new after one use...</li>
            <li>so I try something new every chance I get</li>
            <li>I live in Florida so it is always humid</li>
            <li>They even sent a follow-up emails regarding the product and how to use it/whether I received my new shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida (</li>
            <li>I live in the Atlanta area, so the heat and humidity are fierce.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels new.</li>
            <li>New customer, for life.</li>
            <li>I have Moroccan and Bumble products as well, but this is my new fave.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t look like a live wire anymore.  </li>
            <li>Brings new youth to my silver locks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair while in search of a new hair salon and thought I&#x27;d try this to attempt to reverse some damage since it&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve had a trim.</li>
            <li>I have found my new brand-</li>
            <li>I live in a humid area.</li>
            <li>The product was half full no signs of leakage ripped off!  </li>
            <li>amazing for bleached and dry dry hair!!!</li>
            <li>I used a lot of other brand name, high end products such as Moroccan Oil and Pureology, and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>My hair just feels alive and vibrant and fuller</li>
            <li>Its very good..making your hair soft and moisturized ,but ingredients are far from organic.</li>
            <li>I always get a deep conditioning treatment every 6 weeks from a salon, which last about a week and keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair soft, but it dried my hair out more than it was, it contains alcohol</li>
            <li>More efficient forms of hydrogenation enable fatty alcohols to be formed directly from triglycerides (vegetable oils).</li>
            <li>My bleach ravaged hair is starting to look like normal hair and not straw thanks to your product!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so soft for quite a few days :)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so silky, and when I comb through it wet after the shower, my hair is nearly tangle free.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair and towel dried it, then put a nice amount of this on my hair and left it on for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Most of which, I have later learned were either actually causing more damage or just a total waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and the older</li>
            <li>The smell I think is unnecessarily strong and gives me a slight headache, also the tub I received says Made in China.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, dry and tends to loose it</li>
            <li>Really helps bring back the soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>For almost a year now I have been using Redkens Body Full, my hair just seemed to be getting very dry.</li>
            <li>The Arvazallia deep conditioning mask produced incredible results for my bleached blonde/ over processed and coarse, thick hair type!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this did not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>followed all of the instructions on the container very clearly, leaving it in for about 6 minutes after brushing it through my hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>

            <li>Since good reviews matter to me prior to a purchase-had I known so little of the 1500 reviews were actually verified purchases-</li>
            <li>Not high in comparison to similar products, even, but high for me as I don&#x27;t generally invest more than $10 in a container of this size.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>At first I thought another product “hyping” up their product and the results you would receive, plus all the discounts that were attached to various products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair SO silky soft!</li>
            <li>Made me hair ridiculously soft!</li>

            <li>WOW!</li>

            <li>but my hair is soft and my scalp didn&#x27;t break out!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>All I have to say is WOW!</li>
            <li>and when I washed it out it was so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>Made my hair baby soft!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, soft, and there are never any tangles in my hair after I use this either!  </li>
            <li>I decided to leave the mask in because of the state of my hair, and when I went to straighten my hair, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was!</li>
            <li>I am aware now and will continue to purchase and utilize them in the future..</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>

            <li>The first time I used this I left it in for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>After conditioning my hair once its already so soft and has stayed touchable since!</li>
            <li>When I sent a review to the seller, they instantly sent me email explaining that the gap occurs due to shipping, and to ensure my satisfaction, they sent me another container free of charge!</li>
            <li>The product made such a difference after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a guy, 60, and I keep my hair shorter than years past.</li>
            <li>(People, you gotta quit supporting corporate greed like that.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Arvazallia Oil for the past couple of weeks and absolutely love</li>
            <li>Natural look with confidence!</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky soft after using this!</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell it is making a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I found this deep conditioner, and I will definitely keep using it.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be including this in my curly to straight hair regimen!</li>
            <li>I’ve used a couple hair masks in the past and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>After the first time use, my skin broke out and my ears around the hairline became so red and itchy.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I love using this product prior to straightening my hair because it helps seal the moisture into my hair since I only deep condition/straighten once a week!</li>
            <li>This helps my hair a lot....feels so soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different conditioners and this is the first that leaves my hair</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, but in the top</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky and soft!</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny, soft and conditioned!  </li>
            <li>My hair is soooo soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I have had bleached blond hair for the past 10 years and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I&#x27;ve ever used that has totally moisturized my hair.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>My hair feels instantly soft!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as other products; but what I really disliked were the telemarketing calls that came with the product.</li>
            <li>My only very minor issue is that the smell is a bit strong and off-putting going on, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in the hair.</li>
            <li>Even if I end up trying something new, I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;ll come back to Arvazallia&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been letting it grow and since not cut regularly, was becoming very dry.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything amazing and the consistency is a little strange</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that my results are NOT due to suddenly conditioning my hair every day when I wasn’t before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that my results are NOT due to suddenly conditioning my hair every day when I wasn’t before.</li>
            <li>My favorite deep condition compare to other products .Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have also put just a small amount in my hair after the shower and left it, no heavy feeling, just more smoothness!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have started a new regime with my hair, enhancing all areas of my hair; restoring, strengthening, moisturizing, conditioning, and giving a natural shine to my hair I have found that this product can be added to my hair regime products with all of the benefits it gives my hair in just ONE PRODUCT.  </li>

            <li>Used it on my newly bleached hair and now my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would help smooth it out and make it less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I use a comb in the shower with it (per the instructions) and am able to detangle effortlessly (I have fine, thin, long hair that for some reason is prone to dreading itself overnight).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price because of how well it works on my dry, kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product my hair became baby soft again (I left it on overnight).  </li>
            <li>I have only applied this product once, so I am going to have to update this review after a few more tries.&lt;br /&gt;So far, your hair gets incredibly soft and it really changed how it looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times now and love it, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down, like some conditioners</li>
            <li>I think it is also worth mentioning that I have been experiencing hair breakage (from using too much keratin) , and that my breakage slowed down after using this product</li>
            <li>All of the items are ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need.</li>
            <li>I only bought this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have type 3c hair, fine and soft tight curls.  </li>
            <li>Wow oh wow!</li>
            <li>I have paid far less for more with other products, but I reserved judgment until after my first use.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I definitely think this is the product to thank for more manageable curls and less frizziness and dryness</li>
            <li>The reason I only gave it four stars is because previously I had been using Moroccan Oil Hair Mask and had slightly better results.  </li>
            <li>Hair still kind of dry and dead looking.</li>
            <li>I only wish that in came in bigger jars, as I run out fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does what it wants, it gets extremely frizzy in both humid and dry conditions and it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>(1) the fragrance is more like the stench of someone who&#x27;s trying to mask a foul odor, and (2) the actual conditioner is nothing I haven&#x27;t used before and that I really don&#x27;t like - it&#x27;s that slippery, slick type of conditioner that feels like you can never wash off completely.  </li>
            <li>My ends feel dry right now</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped it would be, left my long thick hair super soft and strong.</li>
            <li>It took 50 years to find something to turn my naturally curly/frizzy, high-maintenance mess into low-maintenance, fabulous curls with body and shine.  </li>
            <li>but I havent used it long enough to observe any significant improvements to hair.  </li>
            <li>I expected magic from all the previous orders.. and started to think maybe I&#x27;m asking for too much..</li>
            <li>By this last attempt, I became entirely certain that this product was not in fact doing me any favors at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For several weeks I would pass my fingers through my hair and large strands of hair would come with my fingers.</li>
            <li>This does make your hair a little smooth but nothing miraculous.</li>
            <li>When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-)</li>
            <li>Very high price for a low quality product.</li>
            <li>Check the customer images for more, along with details about how I take my before and after pictures (always on product-free, residue-free, naturally air-dried hair).he oil, only because so little oil is needed for the hair</li>
            <li>No static, fly away hair and no greasy, heavy residue!</li>
            <li>It softens my coarse, unruly curls twice a week gives them several days of definition and calm.</li>
            <li>Even 24 hours later, my hair is still so soft and shiny and my sister wants to order some now.</li>
            <li>This mask made it soft, shiny and the middle to the ends look really</li>
            <li>I also get far fewer tangles than I used to and the ones I do get are much easier to comb out, which is a big plus for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, that I always only wear straight</li>
            <li>I put this on with a shower cap over night and my hair turned so soft with just one application.  </li>
            <li>Silky soft hair.</li>
            <li>It also conditions, hydrates and moisturizes your hair for a soft and silky texture, allowing manageability and improving elasticity.</li>
            <li>This stuff helped a lot and made it soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>After allowing the mask to sit for 20mins under heat,  my curls felt soft and juicy.</li>
            <li>It worked well on my naturally curly hair that sometimes will get frizzy also.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it would only really work if used every time after shampooing.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>

            <li>My hair is so incredibly soft after using this.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and my hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter also used it.</li>
            <li>This has not done nothing to my hair but make it feel soft</li>
            <li>I only use this product about twice a week, if you use it more, it might be too much because it is such a heavy conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I feel like most deep conditioners are so heavy</li>
            <li>In the last six months, I have been experimenting with argan oil products to improve the condition of my hair, which I color regularly (lighten) but rarely blow-dry.  </li>
            <li>The price for this product was low enough that I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>i  was scared to use it because i get tired sometimes of the many products i use for my damaged hair trying to find ones that really work.</li>
            <li>Its been helping with my course thick hair making it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves my thick and frizzy hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Although it says to let it stay on for 5-7 minutes,  because I have chemically treated hair, I applied it and covered my hair with a shower cap, and sat under the dryer for approximately 20 minutes on warm temperature setting.</li>
            <li>This Argan Hair mask keeps my thick hair looking smooth and shiny without being to oily!</li>
            <li>It washes out really easily, and when my hair would normally be tangled even with a little regular conditioner, this one lets me work my fingers through without any</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t do much for my blonde processed (with new grey wiry hairs).</li>
            <li>The first time i used hydrating argan oil mask and deep conditioner my hair absorb it so quick with few amount</li>
            <li>I was searching the Amazon website one morning for hair products to give my hair a new regime schedule with products different than what I normally use, and came across this product.  </li>
            <li>It could be that my results are so dramatic because I went from using no deep conditioner to using this (see aformentioned bit about having a hard time finding good products for my hair texture....), but I will say I&#x27;ve had much better results with this product than I have had with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have long, frizzy, color treated hair and after I blow dry and straighten, my hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>After the first my hair went from dry &amp; brittle to soft, silky &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>this stuff is super thick and oily, which at first freaked me out</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that gets very dry and damaged looking at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I could feel the difference right away when my hair was still wet.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Really helped to make my hair smooth and less dry now that the weather is colder and air is drier.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and prefer more subtle, natural scents to this.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached and dry but has improved so much after using it!</li>
            <li>now with this product it seems that my hair is more soft and less dry.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It does the same as all of the other drugstore and even cheap conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the First time I am buying something to treat dry hair.</li>
            <li>My already dry tresses were getting pretty worked over by the curling iron and the coloring.</li>
            <li>I have really dry hair and have noticed an improvement after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after my first use, and my hair is DRY.</li>
            <li>I then just let my hair air dry as it was hot out</li>
            <li>The tub was not as full as it could have been (about half)</li>
            <li>And if you are going for a pastel hair color you can mix your hair dye with this hair mask and leave it in your hair for as long as possible and the result come out greater than with a regular white conditioner because this product is just so nourishing and moisturizing for your hair!</li>
            <li>Due to the viscosity I had to use a little more than expected to work it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing the product out, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at first.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is also naturally dry (due to the natural curl and coarse texture, on top of the dry climate of which I live), so it&#x27;s safe to say it gets a little stressed out.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t overuse, will make your hair flat rather than straight.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair and this product really makes my hair feel and look soft!</li>
            <li>I tend to concentrate this towards the middle of my hair down through the ends since that is where I need the most deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>May as well simply use a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>For me it was not more hydrating than most deep conditioners in this price range.  </li>
            <li>and I have been nursing my hair back to health for the last two years and have seen such tremendous changes.</li>
            <li>She could tell an immediate improvement with the first use, which continued to improve over the next several weeks.</li>
            <li>I rotate it with a daily conditioner and a second weekly condition and it helps my hair so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless products to help me repair the damage to my hair and this is the only product that&#x27;s has been consistent</li>
            <li>teenage daughter used this for the first time last night and was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin, wavy, dyed hair that gets frizzy very easily.</li>
            <li>I have long baby fine hair that turned straws like due to all of the abuse.  </li>
            <li>The bottom of my hair has been blonde and pretty dry colored but now its just soft and straight,  totally recommended!</li>
            <li>my thick super long coarse frizzy hair is smooth and soft after just 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I DID mix this with a high protein conditioner for extra hydration.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you invest in this product as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Bummed because I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product especially those chemically treated hair because it works.</li>
            <li>I live in a super dry climate and have very fine, thin, dry hair</li>
            <li>have super fine very curly hair and so usual curly dry hair products weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair was literally dead, specially on the tips</li>
            <li>It gets very dry and brittle particularly on the ends from coloring and using the hair drier, flat iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The same girl who made those comments about my hair hasn&#x27;t mentioned any positive changes, but she also hasn&#x27;t mentioned being coarse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The overwhelming scent was not good.</li>
            <li>It takes too long to really penetrate.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have much time in the shower, no problem because you don’t have to leave this in for a long time to reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I needed something to really condition my hair as I&#x27;m trying to grow it long again.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and looking much healthier.</li>
            <li>I recently colored my hair a red ombre and it absolutely killed my healthy ends.</li>
            <li>Now, my hair is back to normal again.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty bummed expected it not to work well</li>
            <li>It always takes a couple regular washes after to get my hair feeling normal again.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, very curly and VERY damaged from straight ironing it 2x a day for over a year.</li>
            <li>I live in Miami, and the weather here is pretty humid, and the Arvazallia Hydrating Hair Mask makes my hair way less frizz.</li>
            <li>so I have to use dry shampoo right after washing my hair, although it is possible</li>
            <li>use just a little once or twice a week as a quick conditioner</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that the first time I used the mask, my hair seemed to soak it all in so much that I needed to use quite a bit, but after that, the moisture in my hair was so improved that I needed much less conditioner on subsequent applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that the first time I used the mask, my hair seemed to soak it all in so much that I needed to use quite a bit, but after that, the moisture in my hair was so improved that I needed much less conditioner on subsequent applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was starting to get into  the $25 conditioners, so I&#x27;m glad I found something that works really well for a little less.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to deep</li>
            <li>I simply cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I was in total disbelief, every time I would pass my fingers, I would get a new bunch of hair in my hands.  </li>
            <li>I USUALLY LIVE IT ON FOR 1 DAY ,ONLY IN THE ENDS</li>
            <li>It works really well with my damaged dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and over-processed hair and this mask really moisturized and hydrated my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, though it says you can use it up to 2x per, and it has been a real help to my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Mehhh... did not do anything much for my color treated dry hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because my hair became very brittle and dry after having it lightened.</li>
            <li>really helped in moisturizing my dry ends.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like this is a must-have product, but it is helpful for dry ends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped with my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has dry or damaged hair and wants to nourish their hair.</li>
            <li>It is a decent moisurizer but not super intense and the smell of the conditioner smells like something I could get a Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>so my hair got really fried,got split ends,was shedding and every time I brushed it my hair broke off but after doing extensive research I decided to buy this product since it has 5 stars</li>
            <li>used this the first time and left it on for a long time and the results were</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this hair mask for those who have damaged hair and want to really repair and nourish their hair back to</li>
            <li>This is the first product in a long time that I could actually feel make a difference.</li>
            <li>I color my hair blonde, from a box, and I keep it pretty long.</li>
            <li>use this only once a week, although there&#x27;s no reason why someone couldn&#x27;t use this every day, especially if you have straight or treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Really terrific mask and YES, it really does take ONE time only to see results!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I leave it in for 10 minutes when I really want a deep condition, or I use it just as a conditioner when not deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from using a flatiron daily and even regular haircuts don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>This really left my natural hair feeling really soft even after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair for the first time and it left my hair very dry and with out a natural bounce.</li>
            <li>This definitely conditions hair leaving it very soft.</li>
            <li>Just left it feeling very very soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it repairs, restores and strengthens weak, damaged and over processed hair.</li>
            <li>so I do major damage to it</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner as a deep conditioner, my hair is back to normal!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I used this mask &amp; the oil from the same brand, &amp; wow !</li>
            <li>If you are having trouble keeping the ends of your long hair soft and smooth, then I would recommend you try this.  </li>
            <li>Two bleaching sessions (one left in far too long, leading to scalp burn), four dyes, and very irregular conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two treatments and...</li>
            <li>And one jar of these is about the same price as one professional treatment!  </li>
            <li>I usually leave on overnight but have left it on for 10 min only and was still satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Keeps my coarse hair soft!</li>
            <li>I just wanted a super hydrating deep conditioner to try and keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li>This really did the trick for my dry damaged hair!</li>
            <li>Really helped my dry hair!</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product if your hair is dry and damaged.!</li>
            <li>Perming it straight, coloring (blonde), flat iron, and curling iron.  </li>
            <li>hair is medium length, thick, and has a mind of its own, thus I&#x27;ve  been at its mercy, rejoicing when it decided to behave, and bemoaning its stubbornness  the other 364 days of the year.</li>
            <li>Because I Have Really Thick Hair Which Causes Me To Run The Flat Iron Through A Couple Of More Times.</li>
            <li>The whole purpose of getting this was to hydrate my very dry scalps and help me stop all the dandruffs, and it worked so</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and is very damaged.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry do to coloring it so much which I&#x27;m stopping.</li>
            <li>I have the typical semi - curly Caucasian hair and I live in Colorado which was really drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li>i bought this to use with a new flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It was very thick and almost felt like more of a balm styling product than conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have butt length, thin, fine, pin straight hair that&#x27;s dyed red.</li>
            <li>This worked right away on my dry, dry hair.</li>
            <li>it works great as a hair conditional but it smells quite bad.</li>
            <li>I use it at least once a week, and my hair always feels refreshed and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It just looked damaged in general.  </li>
            <li>I Generally follow up with another conditioner (tresemme curly) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has been two weeks that I have been using this hair mask, and I have received compliments on a daily basis at how soft my hair looks now...</li>
            <li>This product left my hair soft .</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying again, especially because it&#x27;s such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I could barely get my brush through it.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>This product has finally given me my soft hair again.</li>
            <li>Have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li>how soft it makes my hair, and the overall effect it has on my hair!</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>I barely write reviews.</li>
            <li>I have mixed natural hair</li>
            <li>I like the smell, soft and feminine but then it fades and isn&#x27;t a problem at my &amp;#34;no perfume office&amp;#34; later on.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt rough afterwards so it didn&#x27;t really feel like a hair oil mask.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>I will be trying the oil hair treatment too in the near future.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair soft, but the softness will despair the following morning.(I wash my hair at night)</li>
            <li>So Im a 2nd time around natural</li>
            <li>I have coarse (4c) natural hair, that hits at my shoulders when in its shrunken state.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male with thinning hair, and this product seems to make my hair bit thicker and gives it volume instead of my old, armpit-looking hair.</li>
            <li>Not only is it soft but it shines too.</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I have only tried this product once so far.  </li>
            <li>I used it last night and my hair has never been this soft.</li>
            <li>I dont see a big change in my hair after using this product but it does feel really soft when i rinse it and it easier to comb after using this</li>
            <li>/&gt;i spent the better part of last week crying because i thought u had ruined my hair..</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair soft now</li>
            <li>How is it possible to have MY hair this soft?</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and actually stays with me for several days even without washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li>If you shamppo and condition regularly, your hair is fairly soft to begin with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll switch back to Loreal Professional Nature Therapy conditioner in a tub.</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old woman with short curly hair.  </li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;Still a bit early to say if this product is working.&lt;br /&gt;It seems the coarse part of the hair has gotten softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only downside is it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product about four times but my hair does feel silky and soft after applying this mask.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s so soft &amp; silky, it actually comes apart, &amp; I have to use a scrunchie.</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair actually feels soft again.  </li>
            <li>only use a small portion to cover my entire hair area so you can save more for later use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the second use my hair was back to normal.</li>
            <li>I used this product twice last week &amp;d each time my hair did not feel like straw after a day, which is what I normally experience with standard conditioners, even &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; conditioners.</li>
            <li>This definitely makes hair smoother, but for me, the results don&#x27;t last any longer than normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been the kind to care for my hair because I&#x27;ve always been skeptical</li>
            <li>so I was kind of skeptical with this product</li>
            <li>It is really comparable to more really expensive deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>It is thick, moisturizing and I like the light scent it has also.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair but many layers.</li>
            <li>It seems like cheap really thick conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair and love the results.</li>
            <li>I also find with other deep conditioners that the results don&#x27;t last after the first shampoo afterwards, my hair hair would go right back to being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks I used it every 4 days and now am down to once a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard finding a good deep conditioner for fine hair because so many are targeted for thick hair, and as a result most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried would completely weigh my hair down and make it look disgusting.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I noticed an extreme difference!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I actually had shine to my hair after I blew it dry, and it felt much softer.</li>
            <li>I took a break from my straight hair and decided to deep condition and moisturize my hair before I went back to flat ironing my hair again.</li>
            <li>it left my hair very soft by  second hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry, frizzy hair and live in a humid climate, which does not help!  </li>
            <li>It does have a noticeable scent that is a touch strong when I apply it to my hair in the shower (if you can&#x27;t do scents, this is definitely not the product for you), but once I have blow-dried my hair (blow dried or blown dry?</li>
            <li>I used to put my hair up with a large hair clip and it was hard to close because so much hair I had.</li>
            <li>My hair has been damaged due to dyeing and I don&#x27;t want to spend too much for treatment.</li>
            <li>It moisturizers the hair and never leave the hair too soft or flat.</li>
            <li>It takes a little extra time to do this mask but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>highly recomended  this treatment for everybody with very dry hair.</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking that I was definitely not going to wash my hair, get out of the shower and dry my hair, only to get back in and put the mask in to wash it out.</li>
            <li>When an Argan hair mask that I had previously been using was no longer available, I went in search of a substitute that, like the other, was in cream form for easier application.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely did it&#x27;s magic on my dry dull hay hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been very careful or gentle with my hair</li>
            <li>I live in CO and my hair gets so dry.</li>
            <li>I also color my hair and live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>This has given my dry colored hair a new life.  </li>
            <li>Although the cream is a little loose and can slip through my fingers, it&#x27;s much easier to use than straight oil.  </li>
            <li>It, at least, made my hair smell clean and the smell did linger on for days.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with damaged, dry hair, and will definitely be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li>and it left her hair soft for several days.</li>
            <li>I just found out that reviews can be filtered by verified purchases out of the 1500 or so reviews on this product 140 are actually verified purchases-also among the verified purchases all the critical reviews including mine have been marked not helpful.</li>
            <li>I used this once, following instructions (left in for 10 minutes in the shower) and it made my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Im currently transitioning back to natural and</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to contain my natural waves with gel products that left my hair feeling gross and took away my volume.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big junkie when it comes to hair masks because of my frizzy ends and trying to find as natural products for it as possible.</li>
            <li>My skin has not been that sensitive to any products in the past and this is the first hair product that i had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks smoother after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients list several silicone-ish products, but considering the sporadic (1x week) recommended use, not going to worry about it.</li>
            <li>African American with 4C natural hair, works well and has helped define some of my curls/coils.</li>
            <li>I try to leave it in as long as I can (normally a few hours) and it leaves my hair feeling like cool silk.</li>
            <li>Decent as a run of the mill product, but not as expected for an overmight mask</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have dry curly/wavey/frizzy hair, and this product makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Will purchase this and only this product from now on, because no other one that I have used can compare with this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, expensive and cheap, with very little difference.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first because I don&#x27;t buy hair products online</li>
            <li>will update if there is a major change in later time.</li>
            <li>This mask feels rich and thick and really conditions the hair well without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My hair was breaking from being so dry and after just one time using this product, my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li>I have very oily, thin, fine hair that I&#x27;ve spent years abusing with colors and heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using its a 10 but sick of paying the high $$ I found this on amazon and thought I&#x27;ve been paying double this whole time and this is much better.</li>
            <li>And by accept, I mean flat iron and occasionally cry about becoming bald at forty.    </li>
            <li>Normally my hair is impossibly dry and tangles itself in knots within minutes of being brushed.</li>
            <li>cause it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair at all and not worth $15.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement where my hair isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; but is generally softer.  </li>
            <li>For the folks that need extra moisture due to processing I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Finally, with the last bit left, I wrapped it up and wore it overnight and rinsed the sludge out of my hair in the morning, even going so far as to take my chances with not quite rinsing it all the way.</li>
            <li>As long as it stays this price, I will be a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve just gone pretty heavy handed with their marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product first few days</li>
            <li>well as this product first few days) and</li>
            <li>My ends were pretty ruff, after frying everyday and bleaching it from ombre.</li>
            <li>For years my hair is damaged from all the heat from straightening everyday and the first time i used this just rinsing out my hair in the shower</li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week, and it really has done wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li>I still need to do a protein treatment &amp; trim a few inches off, but my hair, after everything I put it through, is SUPER shiny &amp; with the exception of the the few inches I&#x27;ll get cut off, it&#x27;s actually very soft !</li>
            <li>We live above the arctic circle and it is extremely dry here.</li>
            <li>I have 50-ish year old thick, but very fine hair past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The texture becomes softer and I find that it really doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This product added body and structure to my hair without weighing it down and maintained the curls for a whole week.</li>
            <li>My hair was very dry from ocean swimming, over processing, and sun damage and this product hydrated and made it very soft.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed out the mask and let my hair air dry, my hair was so soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>It took my dry, over processed and brittle hair and turned it to a shiny, soft, manageable miracle.</li>
            <li>I now use the product as a leave-in because my curly hair became very frizzy and less manageable after the lightening.</li>
            <li>But I am ready to face the world with less split ends and hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft before I blow dry and stays that way after.  </li>
            <li>I am black and my hair is really curly and kinky.</li>
            <li>It leaves  my dry color processed and straightened hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dry wiry gray hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and hydrated, when I blow dry it while be so shiny.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out with hair spray use.</li>
            <li>I recently had my hair highlighted, which is a much needed change for my dark brunette locks.</li>
            <li>I have used the hair mask for the past few weeks and it has made my hair healthier, more shiny and prevented breakage.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more geared to every other etnicity except black hair!!!</li>
            <li>I never ever leave reviews on Amazon but this product has made my hair shiny and soft every single time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Okay, seriously... I never write product reviews on Amazon or other websites....</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, the first time i used it i was shocked after drying my hair to not even have to straighten it because it was silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed I paid 16$ for an item that wasn&#x27;t even filled remotely to the top.</li>
            <li>I have spent alot of money on deep penetrating conditioners that don&#x27;t live up to their claim.</li>
            <li>This hair mask makes my dry, brittle, damaged hair feel soft and like I just left the salon.</li>
            <li>This made my hair feels soft, but dry at the same time.</li>
            <li>I just bleached the tips of my hair to nearly platinum blonde , it was getting dry</li>
            <li>Regardless, my hair was really dry and damaged and this brought it back to life, making it feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair with highlights and my hair is naturally wavy so also a bit dry and prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally dry and unruly mane and this product left my hair soft and manageable...</li>
            <li>It made my coarse, dry hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>Not only does the texture improve but that dry, unmanageable hair becomes silky, soft and</li>
            <li>I have thin, dry hair and the Arvazallia conditioner makes it soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Blonde highlighted hair is so hard to maintain and this stuff really helps!!</li>
            <li>My hair had been very dry and brittle at the ends, but after just one use of this stuff, it was soft again.</li>
            <li>She is natural and has very dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have a tight curl pattern, and enjoy flat ironing and dying my naturally black hair medium ash blonde.</li>
            <li>The only product in the world that completely transformed my dry, frizzy, tangled, brillo pad hair!  </li>
            <li>You know how usually (if you bleach your hair or dye it) when you dont wash it for a day or two, the roots are super greasy and the ends of your hair are DRY AS HAY?</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair mask wanting to try a deep conditioner for my naturally curly and very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural brunette turned blonde and my hair was very dry with a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>Absolutely hands down my fave hair conditioner of the moment!</li>
            <li>I read all of the good and bad reviews about this product before purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>Not too bad it smells really good ...</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much it repairs damage, but generally seems to work well.</li>

            <li> I never go out of my way to write a review but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t find it impressive</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times, once per week, and it is effective.</li>
            <li> After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I was loving how it felt on my hair</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> give the product 4 stars, but the customer service was so nice that I had to rate 5</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice as well.</li>
            <li> However, I can honestly say that I am now a fan.</li>
            <li> It did smell nice.</li>
            <li> Well I had my hair deep-conditioned at the salon one day by him using it and honestly didn&#x27;t feel any difference.</li>
            <li> and it already has done some nice things with my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice but nothing revolutionary.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly who knows if this is making a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So for every time I use about a spoonful of this conditioner, apply it, then leave it on for about 5 minutes, and wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Smells nice</li>
            <li> Smells really nice though</li>
            <li> The way I see it, no one will be truly honest because that would be the end of the freebies.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s kind of chunky).  </li>
            <li> I also use Moroccan oil which it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST conditioner I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li> It not only works great..... but smells WONDERFUL  !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It hydrates, it detangles and leaves your hair feeling healthy and good after just one use.  </li>
            <li> As nice as my hair feels after using it, the nauseating fragrance cancels out the benefits.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice</li>
            <li> Fix my hair up really nice.</li>
            <li> It also smells really good without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It smells nicely, too.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice customer service follow-up with a coupon.</li>
            <li> (I have kind of wavy hair that curls up at the bottom when it&#x27;s layered-</li>
            <li> then I thought which is a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, awesome!</li>
            <li> I have not used it in my own here yet but will soon.</li>
            <li> but oh my gosh - it makes it fall so nicely</li>
            <li> my reviews are my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve basically tried every kind of conditioner that comes in a jar.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li> It works really nice and aceptable price</li>
            <li> I use with a warm head wrap.  </li>
            <li> Not as thrilled with the results as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> which is nice if you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> The views in this statement are strictly my own and I am not affiliated with any of these companies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband has commented on how nice my hair smells after I use this.</li>
            <li> The bottles also feel really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and seems to work well for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice ( but quite perfume).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner to help soften it and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> I put the mask on, then a plastic cap on and wrap a warm towel over that.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice texture that is thicker than conditioner</li>
            <li> Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner is wonderful for my damaged&lt;br /&gt;hair and smells great.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair mask!!</li>

            <li> Also the seller sent me a coupon after my purchase which I thought was very nice and attentive of them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wonderful product.</li>

            <li> I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell,</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask because it reduces frizziness and makes my hair more manageable. :)</li>
            <li> It also has a lovely scent :)</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look healthy and sleek for days afterward.</li>
            <li> It also looks shiner and healthy.  </li>
            <li> plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many products..</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Oh the seller even reached out to me, giving me more detailed instructions on how to use it!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to take the plunge and purchase this hair mask, and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Most Sunday mornings, I wake up and go for a run, then immediately jump in the shower and wash my hair before applying this product.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone, and I would pay a lot more for it than what they ask for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been falling in love with this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had better leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect as a leave in (I use it as a leave in only)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> FANTASIC HAIR MASK :)))</li>
            <li> Ojon works better.</li>
            <li> Pricier, but works better than this product.</li>
            <li> I tried to look for a cheaper alternative, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to ojon until something better and more affordable comes up.</li>
            <li> I have never had such silky hair that feels so wonderful!</li>
            <li> but mostly I just care about the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> So this product with argon oil was recommended to me and I love it.</li>
            <li> The Hydrating Argan Oil Mask is good and smells fresh as well, and is conditioning and gives my hair a fuller feel.</li>
            <li> While it is conditioning and hydrating, I think the repairing conditioner did a better job.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels better than it used to before I bleached it.</li>
            <li> but I love this</li>
            <li> i love the length of my hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product Works just like it says!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use the straightener every day now, which I really love.</li>
            <li> like it was 20 yeas ago, but it is remarkably better.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy a lot and keep it in case they stop making it.</li>
            <li> I should probably be taking better care of .</li>
            <li> Im already thinking about buying 5 more, before they get pricey or out of stock.  </li>
            <li> but once you wash it off, its okay tho.</li>
            <li> a must try :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> WILL ORDER MORE</li>

            <li> I absolutely love how it made my hair smell as well.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the smell and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> What I also like about this product is that it is sulfate free!</li>
            <li> Would love to buy it again once I finished :)</li>
            <li> I just think this is the best deep conditioner I ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair look shiny and wavy when my hair is pulled backing a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still trying to figure out the perfect time for my hair to leave it on, but this product actually works.</li>
            <li> After the first use I felt and saw a remarkable improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>

            <li> it leaves my hair smooth and looks amazing....</li>
            <li> I hope it works better for someone else.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is all that and more.</li>
            <li> Works ok</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used better products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already looked into getting more.</li>

            <li> Makes me hair shiny smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> For the price and how many treatments you get, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I switch up between this and my Kerastase Masque (I think switching up is important).</li>
            <li> They really have helped thicken and strengthen my hair and all produce a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic</li>
            <li> After using this mask, my hair is tangle free and smooth.</li>
            <li> But after using this product, my hair is so smoothly and weighted.</li>
            <li> but yet is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free for evaluation/testing purposes and my feedback is 100% mine and may vary from yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your hair feel so soft and smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using this treatment for more than two years, this one really make it look better my bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product; but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be formulated for coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very frizzy hair, I am going to buy it again, for sure :)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling nice &amp; soft &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> It left my hair so shiny and healthy that a friend commented he hasn&#x27;t seen my hair look so good.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft and everyone tells me how good it smells.</li>
            <li> hair does feel soft after using it, but there are plenty of hair conditioners and masks out there that can do that AND smell good.</li>

            <li> Good deep conditioner :)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a far superior product.</li>
            <li> Since most people want shiny lustrous hair, I was impressed that it revives dull and dry hair giving it a beautiful shine while strengthening your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t opposed to very strong smelling deep conditioners and want your hair to look and feel healthy, I would go for it!</li>
            <li> (I LOVE my color right now but getting here was a huge process)</li>
            <li> I have fine but very curly hair that is greatly affected by humidity (which in NC in June is high).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff and plan on buying more as soon as I run out!</li>

            <li> Its super hydrating and my hair will feel weightless and look super shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Has pretty good slip, and made my hair feel like pure silk and look divine.</li>
            <li> You know using a great amount of it is better than using a small portion of another better one.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t try this product please do, love the way it makes my hair feel it&#x27;s soft and manageable, first day I use it coworkers ask what did I used cause my hair looks so good.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was Okay (not bad at all, but nothing spectacular) in my natural 4C hair</li>
            <li> Okay so i have dry wavy hair and for some reason the hair stays nice and smooth for 6-8 hours  at most , say for the evening when i take a shower after gym or so and use both the products together .</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the best hair mask I have ever bought, I&#x27;m startin to get back my strong and health before 3 pregnancies.</li>
            <li> Great for my fine dry frizzy hair.</li>

            <li> Overall a good product and easy to use.</li>

            <li> and I look for good conditioners/masks that not only provide moisture but a lot of slip as well.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hair restoration product.</li>
            <li> It really brings more nutrition and shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh fragrance too.</li>
            <li> And while the formulation is good now, who knows what it could be like in the future.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> Finally, I appreciated the two follow up emails that the company sends to make sure that you have no issues with the product and to offer a coupon as a thank-you gift.</li>
            <li> It is not as full as the picture shows, not even close.</li>
            <li> This really works to smooth my hair and keep the curls/waves without the frizz!</li>
            <li> my full review on my blog-</li>
            <li> This smells really nice and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this my hair again looks healthy.</li>
            <li> This also smells so nice and my hair is so silky soft after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ingredients seems relatively standard, the reviews and price were good, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> My hair is now really nice, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair so much body &amp; makes my hair feel &amp; look healthy.</li>
            <li> &amp; I loved to use this item every time I deep condition.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy and subtly, deliciously fragrant --- and SO hydrating!</li>
            <li> Nice- leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I am going back to Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with it, but I am very prone to greasy hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....not really any better than stuff in department stores</li>
            <li> After first use  my hair feel soft and shine and smell really good.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Smell not bad.</li>
            <li> Amazing - left it in overnight and very curly, frizzy hair washed out smooth and easily detangled!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and reported that she loved the wide mouth container so that she can scoop it out easily, the instructions were easy to follow, was easy to apply and rinse out, and made her Hawaiian-sun damaged hair silky smooth and new again.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using the mask, it feels healthy, soft and manageable!!!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice pleasant light scent that didn&#x27;t bother me, and was a simple off white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy, shiny, smooth and she has a ton of new hair</li>
            <li> Really made my hair smooth and easy to style.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I feel my hair getting soft, hydrated, easy to comb after rinsing, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> Got home, rinsed it out easily with warm water only, and VOILA!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair is so soft and strong  thank you</li>
            <li> I have used It&#x27;s a 10, Macadamia, Moroccan Oil and a few other good ones, but this is the best</li>
            <li> I had over processed hair and it restored my hair to better than normal!  </li>
            <li> silky smooth right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The results after letting it air dry are amazing!</li>
            <li> For the first time EVER my hair is manageable and easy to style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week (or a bit more often if I want my hair to look particularly good for something) and it leaves my hair feeling extra soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it naturally gives me more volume.</li>
            <li> I do really like the smell its a very clean but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Great product, received quickly, as expected!</li>
            <li> For the price it is now - significantly discounted - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> hair is soft, light and smells nice ;)</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair, the conditioner was great for smoothing out frizzy and keeping my hair looking shiney</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells wonderful, a subtle fruity scent that had The Mister burying his face in my hear repeatedly.</li>
            <li> My hair detangles automatically, shiny, but not greasy, and is growing quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok seriously I never writethese type of reviews.</li>
            <li> made my curls feel super soft, helped DE-tangling much easier and it smells sooooooo good.</li>
            <li> it was super unmanageable because of all the sun exposure and coloring .but</li>
            <li> Super conditioning and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I felt as if I had just applied a gloss as well because my hair was so super shiny.</li>
            <li> While I love all their products I must say this is a much better deep conditioner that I will buy in place of their version from now on.</li>
            <li> The sellers sent it to me quickly and it was wrapped well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sure be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I now use it in advance of coloring my hair and 1-2 times per week to keep my hair feeling healthy, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> But the delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> didnt notice a difference, except that my hair was super oily.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a quick mask...</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product, I would definitely repurchase this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I tried the best and most expensive.</li>
            <li> I have for years tried many others and none have given me the soft, smooth &amp; hydrating feeling.</li>
            <li> This one, though, has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have bleached super processed hair colored with purple.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;m pregnant, so it helps...</li>
            <li> It smells really good and because the product is very dense, it leaves my hair super soft afterwards</li>
            <li> Would prefer either scent free or a more natural scent like coconut oil - even lemon oil ,etc</li>
            <li> , I finally got this product... and couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy after.</li>
            <li> I just used it quick in the shower</li>
            <li> The mask is thick and my hair felt more moisturized- all at a great price</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Hair is soooo soft, shiny and very easy to comb thru.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> and I love all the compliments and HIGHLY recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair was so beautiful and curly,but now it was very damage and dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and it left my hair manageable with a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the conditioner leaving hair so smooth and easy to straighten my curly normally frizzy hair .....</li>
            <li> It has a very sweet scent to it, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I dyed it back to my original brunette color, trimmed it, limited heat exposure, put in oils, used the best shampoos and tried just about every treatment I could think of.</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference with just the first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it the first time you will notice a huge difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> You feel the difference on the very first use</li>
            <li> This is such a great product I recently bleached my hair and bought this to make it look better and it works.</li>
            <li> There are far better masks on the market that are much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I used this mask the very first day and it was just a wonder how silky and shiny the results were.</li>
            <li> Very first application was mindblowing.</li>
            <li> I had got this item before for free when it first came out.</li>
            <li> I used the product last night, and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I used it as a normal conditioner</li>
            <li> We are both very satisfied with this product, have already reordered it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Once I finally get around to getting it cut, I&#x27;m sure this will keep my hair soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> the next morning, it is full, soft and behaves beautifully.  </li>
            <li> On top of this, I use the Arvazallia argan oil everyday which keeps my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and apply a good amount each time.</li>
            <li> This mask was amazing right from the first wash its very moisturizing, completely transforms the hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weigh down my hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> But I love trying new products</li>
            <li> The fact that it works great, and I use less fits both my wallet and my beauty needs.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to all my social media followers that&#x27;s how amazing it was</li>
            <li> you can get equally great product for less the price</li>
            <li> I previously was using a macadamia oil mask that I thought was doing a great job.</li>
            <li> One use and my hair was much softer and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and healthy looking and it is full of body without using styling products or blow drying.  </li>
            <li> After the first usage my hair has improved so much :)</li>
            <li> short  because the odds of successfully  untangling my hair  were very slim.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite dry, so I had to use a good amount.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use this product，It&#x27;s really wonderful！I love it</li>
            <li> Only after one use, I can feel my hair is so soft and easy to handle!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my damaged hair shine and feel very soft :)</li>

            <li> This mask works very well and leaves your hair with a light feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but already I can tell its amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask, my hair was bleached FOUR times to get a bright red out of my hair..... and believe it or not I toned it as well FOUR TIMES, and if that didn&#x27;t do enough damage I also ran some manic panic through my hair in order to get the color I wanted!!</li>
            <li> customer service is very proactive and attentive.</li>
            <li> They really followed up and were genuinely concerned about whether or not their product was working.  </li>
            <li> But this product leaves my hair so smooth and really takes away all the frizz.</li>
            <li> Not only did it exceed my expectations, but it smells amazing.</li>

            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> have experimented and tinkered with every last drop in the jar in different ways, and feel that I have given this product a more than fair chance to prove</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, unless it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> makes it really soft and healthy</li>
            <li> product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of iffy about buying this product, for the reason that I&#x27;ve tried several others and non of them</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and smooth!</li>

            <li> My hair was silk soft and my curls were better than ever.</li>
            <li> but this was worth a try based on price and reviews.</li>
            <li> rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> this product is worth it .i</li>
            <li> OLD PRODUCT IS TOP SHELF</li>

            <li> one is so worth</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a ton of product to make it work well either, so it&#x27;s definetly worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I might have bought the product again, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>

            <li> Check the customer images for more, along with details about how I take my before and after pictures (always on product-free, residue-free, naturally air-dried hair).</li>
            <li> Prefer a more natural ingredient product if using this product weekly on my hair.</li>
            <li> So soft, shiny, manageable, i even cancelled my hair trim app since it was so healthy.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product and I am satisfied so far with it.</li>

            <li> I keep touching it because its so soft I can&#x27;t keep my hands off it.</li>
            <li> My hair looked healthy and was soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li> but it still leaves my hair smelling fresh at all times when I use it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second jar because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> First off, I love hair masks and this new product now and one of them.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my long, dry, curly hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I went from have dried, brittle bleached blond hair, to having very healthy, easily brushable hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing results!My hair is so soft &amp; has an amazing shine!I used to hold my hair up without a scrunchie, due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, it made a huge positive difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended if you have dry frizzy hair like mines!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews and deciding to purchase it, I have to totally agree with other people that this hair mask is the best!</li>
            <li> This impressed me enough that I will be investigating other products by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li> And now the struggle to get my hair back to it&#x27;s original healthy state begins.</li>
            <li> I love this product the first time I used it my hair felt so soft and looked so healthy.......love it !</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, so I go through it pretty quickly</li>
            <li> This product not only rinses out cleanly, it works a lot better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Everything positive you are reading about this product is true.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, subtle.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty good about the product, hair is silky, though I only used it once after purchasing, Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My long frizzy hair has never looked and behaved better ...ever!  </li>
            <li> Not only the customer services is awesome and fast with the replies and concern, but the product works as long as you use it as instructed.</li>
            <li> Tried this hair mask for the first time, left it on after shampoo for couple minutes, my hair feels soft and looks great too.</li>
            <li> I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner compared to other ones I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and makes your hair super soft!  </li>
            <li> I got the product from the mail and tried it right away.  </li>
            <li> Why shell out money going to the salon when you can get treatment in the comforts of your home right?</li>
            <li> i saw the results right away no lie</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s just not the right product for my texture.</li>
            <li> well this product right here did impress me allright.</li>
            <li> My hair (new growth) is so manageable and easy to comb through</li>
            <li> I have smooth, pretty curls rather than frizzy, chunky ones, and my hair takes to styling much easier.</li>
            <li> My hair is more softer,shinier and my black hair looked more natural and surprisingly i think its making my hair more dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my own hair pretty regularly for years.</li>
            <li> I have long, super fine hair which gets split ends easily.</li>
            <li> After a good clarifying shampoo my hair is back to normal, but it never felt sticky or waxy before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used a popular mask for several years and I find that this is just as good for half the $$$$.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair very soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent that is not unpleasant, it smells like a mixture of olive/argan oil to me, definitely not an over-powering scent.  </li>
            <li> It certainly showed results instantly, and the smell is the cherry on top of a sundae!</li>
            <li> Hydrating ArganOil Hair Mask is very nice and you use very little so for the price it will be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use it twice a week , I think that more times a week leaves your hair greasy , and less won&#x27;t let you see the results</li>
            <li> this is the only hair mask that makes my hair smooth and easy to comb</li>
            <li> Makes my color treated hair super soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> However, this just isn&#x27;t doing it for me; it smells great and feels soft while on, but always leaves my hair feeling dry and looking frizzy.</li>
            <li> I find that I get best results when I let my hair partially air dry, but that&#x27;s not always feasible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I loved the way my hair felt, but after a couple more uses my hair started losing it&#x27;s volume and feeling sort of strange--I don&#x27;t want to say it was greasy but it quit feeling dry but it was only because it was coated with this stuff and not because it was hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Great on my overly processed hair, even apply small amounts on the tips of my hair before curling as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, but so far I am pleased and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and it lasts long after I&#x27;ve rinsed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical upon ordering this, but I totally loved it now and am just glad I gave this product a try!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use packaging that wasn’t leaking (plus!)</li>
            <li> I will most definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> She had very thin blonde hair and this product made it incredible gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This Hydrating Argan Oil is a FANTASTIC product - I love the way it makes my hair moisturized and straight even without using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This really works for my hair, left my hair soft and easy to comb, smell nice.</li>
            <li> It gives not only a good natural  looking, but also keeps my hairs in style.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a really good find.</li>
            <li> soft, shining and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li> Kind of dry when I opened it</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...makes my hair soft, easy to comb and calms the frizzes.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, I liked it so much, I started using it as my daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I get the best results when I put it all over my head and then, using a wide tooth comb, comb through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> It is equally as good and about half the price.  </li>
            <li> My ONLY slightly-not-great review is that the scent is a bit masculine, like AXE body wash, but the product is so good that I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and easy to manage and the smell is nice.works for my daughters hair</li>
            <li> I uses it once a week and its great for adding moisture back into the hair if you get blonde highlights or dye your hair.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft it left my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair becameuch more soft, supple and much easier to manage....</li>
            <li> I was kind of in a rush and only had a 2-3 mins, but really wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it more frequently than it recommends to target my ends specifically and have really noticed an improvement in the texture and health of my hair, including my ends.</li>
            <li> I am a single mother of two girls in their 20s and we all think this mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair was able to be brushed right afterwards which is quite the feat.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Like it very much.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very reasonably priced -</li>
            <li> This mask definitely adds shine and made my hair very smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Found the results to be great when used either as a light conditioner or deep conditioning with the added benefit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it revives dull, dry hair, giving it more elasticity thus managability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished with a drop of Argon oil for added shine the results are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unadvertised benefit, works great as a hand cream... softness without the least bit of greasiness..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introductory special price or otherwise, I would highly recommend the Arvazallia Oil and Mask for those seeking a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> They break down easily when applied to allow the lovely ingredients to benefit the skin/hair.</li>
            <li> It felt so great that I have been looking at the complete range of products to determine if there is any other one in the line that I may want to try.</li>
            <li> Product has a good fragrance and is thick and rich consistency.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say it left my hair very soft and manageable,to all my natural sisters please try it.</li>
            <li> First I use a good clarifying shampoo, then I put this stuff on and leave it in for a little while I finish the rest of my shower.</li>
            <li> Excellent  conditioner,  a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and gives great slip!.</li>
            <li> I have high lights in my hair and with this my hair is soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that easily gets knots when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see the results in first hair wash...</li>
            <li> Very happy..highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I could see an improvement even after the first use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have used higher end products ranging from 50-85 $</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair light and soft and I just can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Will keep using to improve my hair, it was pretty damaged from color treatments.</li>
            <li> Wifey says this one is a keeper! ;-)</li>
            <li> mak really reduce the frizz!</li>
            <li> I love it and definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I enjoy soft, defined curls without holding them with mousse or gel.</li>
            <li> Maybe because my hair was pretty destroyed?</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of this product in the future</li>
            <li> After the first use i could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second container and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended :)</li>
            <li> Being the avid shopper I am on Amazon, I searched and found this Argan oil hair mask.  </li>
            <li> most likely to re-order</li>
            <li> Very hydrating!</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in the first use.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit more moisturized but</li>
            <li> First</li>
            <li> I used this in place of my conditioner for the first time and I can already feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I would not have even bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> Just after one use i could see how much silky my hair was!</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used it for the first time ever</li>
            <li> After only a couple of uses, my hair does feel softer and looks so much more healthier.</li>
            <li> I used my regular shampoo with it and voila it is magic.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SURREAL</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioning mask!  </li>
            <li> my hair feels silky and healthy the next day.</li>
            <li> My hair can get so dry and damaged but this always helps me smooth it out and improve the quality of my hair so quickly!</li>
            <li> It has a soft scent which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> so so many different products</li>
            <li> but this product renews it and leaves it soft and smooth</li>
            <li> love the smell of this deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought hair mask before this but from my experience, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> After trying so many products, I think I finally found the &#x27;ONE&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this conditioner I was blown away.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this hair mask.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color treated, but I&#x27;ve had many compliments on the health of my hair from multiple stylists.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I knew that there would be a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and noticed an immediate difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s soft and just doesn&#x27;t make my hair silky smooth is all.</li>
            <li> especially if you have 4c hair:)</li>
            <li> My first  review ever...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> The first two days that ive tried it</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> The argan oil mask and argan oil conditioner really helped!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, as well as the entire line of Arvazallia products.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had read all the five star reviews prior to buying this hair mask, which made me want to purchase this product that much more.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t give me that silky, smooth, naturally shiny, healthy-looking result I desired.</li>
            <li> I have tried many deep conditioners, and even at home</li>
            <li> This is the first time I write a review, but because I could see the result from the first time I use it, I decided to write this review.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for hair products that will make my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time 2 days ago.</li>
            <li> it conditions very well!</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I am liking it.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels when I use this product, I only use it twice a week</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this when i run out.</li>
            <li> I used according to package instructions and my hair was noticeably softer after my first use.</li>
            <li> It is also curly therefore it gets pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> I tried the Moroccan Oil first</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try the product.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t write many product reviews, but Arvazallia&#x27;s Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask is a product definitely worthy of a five-star review!  </li>
            <li> She first started using it every day, then backed off to 2-3 times per week as the condition of her hair improved.</li>
            <li> My hair was incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations for this product, but after 4 uses I can say that I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different professional-brand conditioners and balms.</li>
            <li> Thought my hair was &amp;#34;Arganed&amp;#34; out after using so many of the same products and didn&#x27;t think me hair would respond.  </li>
            <li> FIRST, A NOTE ABOUT HAIR PRODUCTS CONTAINING ALCOHOL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shopping as fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received a couple compliments the day after I first used this.</li>
            <li> From the first use I felt and saw the difference.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the ends of my hair soft, smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> If you screwed up your hair you should probably go to a salon first.</li>
            <li> Seems to hydrate pretty well.</li>
            <li> I tried much more expansive brands, with the same effect.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Argan oil, which I LOVE, and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> Then rinse :) i swore on Its a 10 products for deep conditioning but this blows them out of the water.</li>
            <li> If not and you don&#x27;t get  my first answer, send this again.</li>
            <li> I also have to leave it on ends only, as conditioners leave my hair greater than I like.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash it out thoroughly because it left my hair oily</li>
            <li> first though when I saw it was &amp;#34;China product&amp;#34; baah.  </li>
            <li> for the first time..</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after just purchasing my second Hair Mask, which tells you by itself: I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m interested in trying it as a leave-in and letting my natural curls roam free.</li>
            <li> I am very close to 70!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Feel way better than my Paul Mitchel&#x27;s Hair Repair which I have been using in the last twenty years.</li>
            <li> my hair us really smooth and soft ...</li>
            <li> Used it on the first night for 10 mins and no results.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> .After hair oils, hair masks are my next favorite thing.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I never run out of hair mask because without it, is just not the same for my over-processed hair.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what everyone said it would do.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and is in need of a touch-up at 8 weeks when I first used this product.</li>
            <li> I tried a different product a couple of years ago that cost more and found no difference in the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> You can see the difference in your hair from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> This hair mask smells great and works wonderfully on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference after first use.</li>
            <li> I will buy more from the same brand.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased the hot oil treatment to go along with it.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I have a mixture of 4a/b hair and my crown is 4c.</li>
            <li> It does relax curls a bit, so if you&#x27;re going for a curly effect, it would be better to use a different conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deep conditioner to use.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this Deep Conditioner Mask in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely soft, 100% tangle free, shinier and just easier to manage.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it out, my curls are more defined than with regular conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Saw results after first use.</li>
            <li> , I can feel much better the day after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase but this conditioner is fantastic, it leaves my hair manageable but not heavy.</li>
            <li> and it just feels like a regular conditioner, unlike the Moroccan brand where it is thicker and feels more like a treatment.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many types of shampoos and conditioners, attempting to soften my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> has first class customers service.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my coarse, curly hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I use it from the middle of my head and downwards, trying not to get my front, or top hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still pretty damaged.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;Really  this product work fantastic, the hair looks silky , soft and shinny,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really soft and smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> and it can feel pretty fried sometimes.</li>
            <li> I love this deep condtioner!  </li>
            <li> BUT after using this mask I was absolutely blown away by the immediate results!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> texture of my hair definitely got lot more stronger.</li>
            <li> And my hair definitely got a lot more shinier.</li>
            <li> Just used this product for the first time and I must admit, it works really well!  </li>
            <li> And rinsing smoothly and soft .</li>
            <li> It is a litte oily for me after the first day of use</li>
            <li> They will definitely be my default company I&#x27;ll buy more products from.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> my hair was shiny and soo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First Time</li>
            <li> love this conditioner, it made such a difference after the 1st application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it; my hair actually MOVES now.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil and so many different conditioners - none of them came close!</li>
            <li> Put the exact amount and don&#x27;t leave it  longer than listed in the instructions.</li>
            <li> This really works well..!</li>
            <li> will definitely buy more of this</li>
            <li> After the first use my hair felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> so it was pretty fried.</li>
            <li> I would imagine with continued use, the results would only get better over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different conditioners I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice, so maybe I&#x27;ll try it more regularly and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using since I first got it</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for many years and this is the one stand out product I have used in the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> I left it on over night hoping that it would condition better.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this hair mask</li>
            <li> I use hot tools and dye my hair</li>
            <li> You see results after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I needed a mask that would provide good moisture without leaving my hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Curls were good dried but not frizzy.</li>
            <li> She has a lot of trouble finding a good product</li>
            <li> This is a nice, thick cream that stays in for the treatment period and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is oober soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, the formula is very rich, so the product should last a while.</li>
            <li> works great on my soooo dried hair!!</li>
            <li> And after so many try-and-fail&#x27;s with other conditioners, I honestly feel like I finally found one that works (yay)!</li>
            <li> She has very thick dark hair, and this stuff adds a nice shine, and more importantly, makes it more manageable to put in ponytails without a lot of brushing etc.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and alive :)</li>
            <li> Right now I use HSI which I really like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it did or not, but it certainly feels different and it seems to work better than having my hair conditioned at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ready to follow the recommended use because it has really improved my hair a great deal in the past week.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tends to get dry in colder months.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and left my hair soft and detangled on the first use.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair become silkier and moisture held longer than usual while using this product, and shine was in my hair which appeared natural, rather than when you have a shinier look from applying a hair product that gives the appearance of a greasy look, which this product did not do, rather a natural shine to the hair which was impressive.  </li>
            <li> Especially after a long summer being in the pool with the kids, this is the best product to get my hair back in shape.</li>
            <li> In an effort to curtail the breakage, I invested in Kerastase conditioner plus a couple of other popular brands.  </li>
            <li> You can safely apply it from the roots to the ends, without the hair looking flat...</li>
            <li> After 2 applications, I can see a significant improvement in my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tamed and shiny,  clean and not a bit greasy - better than other products!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for dry bleached hair!!!</li>
            <li> Another great thing is that this mask is 100% sulfate and paraben free, but unfortunately contains silicones, which I wanted to mention in case if this is something you are trying to avoid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seriously wasn&#x27;t that great to me...</li>
            <li> Amazing product, made my bleached hair soft and silky after just one use, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I used it only once so far and the outcome was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Most shampoos/conditioners/hair masks nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still in the early stages of using this, but so far I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my ends looked at least 80% better.</li>
            <li> Getting a comb through my hair after conditioning would be a struggle, but I don&#x27;t own a comb, and my broken handled hairbrush was fighting it even more.</li>
            <li> my hair is chemically treated ( blonde ) and very porous... trying to find a conditioner that actually helps to make it feel soft and this is by far the best ive found !  </li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week instead of my regular conditioner and It leaves my hair very silky and smooth!.</li>
            <li> and you get so much of it, but also because I am using the mask twice a week which is probably not necessary for most people.</li>
            <li> and you get so much of it, but also because I am using the mask twice a week which is probably not necessary for most people.</li>
            <li> I thought what&#x27;s so different about this line compared to others and how can it really help my hair become healthy once again</li>
            <li> It definitely left my perm hair really soft &amp; nice.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is easily weighed down by, well everything.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week and it leaves my curls looking very healthy, but when I straighten my hair my roots look a little greasy</li>
            <li> My hair is significantly smoother and seems to be growing in a little better.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Makes hair super soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products like this one and I can tell you that my hair feels really smooth right after usage.</li>
            <li> While I do like this product for leaving my hair soft and healthy looking, the smell is a little more &amp;#34;elderly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that has been colored for years ... tried several products including Wen and this is amazing!  </li>
            <li> it after first use, made my dry, over-processed hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> No more static electricity, easy to comb after washing.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and ordered this after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews and prices was the reason I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought hair products online before, but the positive reviews convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li> For me, this is a positive thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the Argan Oil Hair Oil this company puts out, read positive reviews about the hair mask and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I would definitely use more products in the Arvazallia line and would recommend to others who may be looking for a hair product that covers all the basic and important areas of your hair regime.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing the first time but after that, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> It works better than  most of the other products I&#x27;ve tried and usually paid much more for.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used the whole jar in 1 use.</li>
            <li> Making my long hair really smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other hair masks, but this one is the best!  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says, my hair is much softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> its really nice but the quantity is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expected it could have that good result, but this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only did it improve the condition of my hair, but my color was immediately deeper and much more vibrant.</li>
            <li> sure does make my hair nice and soft, so much so that it loses it&#x27;s body and bounce.</li>
            <li> :)  HIGHLY recommended to purchase their entire system.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to run my fingers through my hair in a long time!</li>
            <li> Im only giving it 4 stars because I widh the bottle were bigger, other that that its great!</li>
            <li> They even followed up the order with a e-mail to see if I had any concerns and a big list of how to use the product to get the best results and various other ideas.  </li>
            <li> Do not use more than what it says in the instructions and do not leave too long!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and wavy (mostly frizzy)</li>
            <li> But for less than $20, this is an amazing mask.</li>
            <li> I ended up just squeezing most of the water out of my hair then applying the mask (no towel dry needed).</li>
            <li> I just bleached my hair and it makes it feel super soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my bleached curly dry hair feel softer for sure.  </li>
            <li> leaves hair super soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> After one use, my hair feels super soft and it shines.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with dry brittle hair would love this.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel super silky soft in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> She used this one time and her hair felt super soft after one use like her hair used to feel years ago.  </li>
            <li> Makes my course hair super soft.</li>
            <li> After using it my hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this product; It has revitalized my hair that was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> After I blew it dry, I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth it was!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having to put a ton of product in my hair, letting it air dry, dealing with resulting frizz, more product, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair has been processed for years and the top layer has been so dry it felt like straw.</li>
            <li> Left hair very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Really feels nice on my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Its been dyed many colors over the years, and I straightened it every single day for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> An alcohol in this sense is not a fermented mixture; it is a chemical compound of a certain molecular structure based on carbon and oxygen.</li>
            <li> This hair mask leaves hair pretty soft, but it&#x27;s really only because it contains a silicone that coats the hair and makes it appear healthy.</li>
            <li> I donate my hair every few years and the hair dresses can never believe how healthy the donations are!</li>
            <li> The product was new in the package and the seller has checked back with me to verify that I was satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly dig smells in general, but this one is fine.</li>
            <li> For my hair, which is curly, dry, and definitely tangly, this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and not use too much, though, or your hair will be INCREDIBLY greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> This right here is my new hair Holy grail.</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated blonde hair.</li>
            <li> My individual hair shafts are fine, but I have a lot of hair and it is somewhat wavy.</li>
            <li> I did not see a miraculous hair transformation, but using this along with a good hair trim has gone a long way to making my dry, over processed, over colored hair look much healthier!  </li>
            <li> I used this product right after dying my hair and it was very soft.</li>
            <li> Reviews are right about this product- hair is very soft and shiny after I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> You could imagine the state of my hair, which is waist length &amp; very thick, so I have a ton of it, which sounds great</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic for such a large jar of it, too.</li>
            <li> A little bit of fragrance is nice, but way too much in this product.</li>
            <li> Arvazallia Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner for Dry and Damaged hair is the perfect finisher for my other 2 Arvazallia hydrating Argan Oil products (shampoo and conditioner).</li>

            <li> So only one use made a huge difference</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much because the price was very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks much healthier and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking fried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much about how my hair feel because I&#x27;m a guy I guess,</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> not only did it exceed my expectations by leaving my hair silky smooth and noticibly minimizing my split ends</li>
            <li> After I tried it my hair was noticeably softer and felt very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I had very damaged hair from relaxer and others</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling really silky.</li>

            <li> It really smooths my frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> I like this product real well.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner really softens my hair and helps with breakage.</li>
            <li> It does not work very well for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair softer and price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> These products really work, and they are reasonably priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not oily at all, more like silky feel and</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works.</li>
            <li> but I use it instead of conditioner every time and it really works.</li>
            <li> I much prefer squeeze tubes and bottles than a jar.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says.</li>
            <li> , the smell is fantastic I definitely recommend this products</li>

            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend, she loves it so much.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair is so much healthier.</li>
            <li> My hair which is very damaged by years of dye is now silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> But the real kicker is after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I can really see and fee the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare very well.</li>
            <li> I would like to compare the Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating mask and see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I thought; it looks like a smooth cream, but it&#x27;s an almost solid paste.</li>
            <li> Her hair is curly mine is closer to just being straight</li>
            <li> and I straighten it very often.</li>
            <li> Take heed on using too much at your roots.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer and shinier after just one use.</li>
            <li> I was ready to cut it all</li>
            <li> It is really helpful.</li>
            <li> The mask, when used with the oil, has made a real difference in the look and feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The damage I did really scared me.  </li>
            <li> I use too much of the product.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to buy this mask (thanks to the reviews) and</li>

            <li> Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask by Arvazallia seemed to condition my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell also which lingers a bit after styling</li>
            <li> Over all for the price and how much product you get I would say buy this if you need to repair your hair .</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> I really wish they would have shampoo along with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> i was concerned by the price that it was going to be cheap and low quality</li>
            <li> This product was very moisturizing to my hair.</li>
            <li> It did moisturize my hair but didn&#x27;t really stop the breakage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks  </li>

            <li> I use this 1-2 times a week because I use a heat tools on my hair and it needs as much moisture, nutrients and pampering that it can get.</li>

            <li> Well I&#x27;ll tell you why this product really works and how much it&#x27;s improved the state of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will NOT regret the decision to purchase- it really works.</li>
            <li> always her hair is very</li>
            <li> This really helped my sun bleached summer hair.  </li>
            <li> really works</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> She says it works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair very often and for about 20 years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I thought; it looks like a smooth cream, but it&#x27;s an almost solid paste.  </li>
            <li> so even when trying to comb my hair gently</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> but I will buy again as it really works.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My curly hair is tamed and much softer with reduced frizz after using it as directed.</li>
            <li> but i was very disapointed becuse its been expired since march...</li>
            <li> my friend who works in a very $$ salon gave me this inside info.  </li>
            <li> What I expected was a bit more moisture and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have realized this would be very per fumy.</li>
            <li> But the smell is what really put this one over the edge for me</li>
            <li> Twice a week with leaving on over night is promising with favorable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very conditioning.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this review for those who have virgin hair, like myself, as I couldn&#x27;t find much below.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well both ways.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> and it really works well with me.</li>
            <li> So, I expected more than I</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend !</li>
            <li> and I have found argon oil really helps to hydrate my hair</li>
            <li> This product, after three uses, left my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping and a very helpful follow up e-mail.</li>
            <li> and this hair mask really helps with that without making my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Very well package and on time delivery</li>
            <li> and the product is real.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to cut my curly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> It is filled with silicones and argan oil is one of the last ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> The effect has been very restorative without greasiness or weight being added.</li>
            <li> Hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I chose this solely based on Amazon rating/reviews, and it really did work well and soften my brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> This has really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need a lot</li>
            <li> and I think the two really gives my hair the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> so I really think it would work on all hair types.</li>
            <li> It works really well this way.</li>
            <li> This works very well and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely be reordering at this price....</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free, for testing and reviewing purposes ONLY!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything would make that much of a difference but after reading all the reviews I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like hair masks</li>
            <li> so much so that I made a point of using it once per week.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair look and feel longer and silkier.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> My hair also looks very shiny.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> i have very frizzy hair nd damaged</li>
            <li> This one is much cheaper and helps my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks now, and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made a big difference in how soft and healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I think my results are only going to improve and am thrilled with the results after only two treatments!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; .. smells nice</li>
            <li> The oil I used daily on the ends of my hair only, which gave a nice immediate improvement in appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional and far exceeds my previous expectations.</li>
            <li> and this product moisturizes it nicely without a heavy feel.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> This product has my hair feeling back to its soft healthy self.</li>
            <li> First use made my hair silky, but then my hair became even more dry!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> SO soft!!!</li>
            <li> the long high volume fine hair is back!.I wish I had been aware of these products years ago.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because of the positive reviews, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> When I want to flat iron my hair for a smooth look, this product makes the process so much easier.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly when my hair is good and every other day when it feels extra dry-like in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now and am very pleased with how soft and less frizzy my hair becomes -- I just stay to live running my fingers through my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged and very dry and brittle, the first treatment was a huge turn around.</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had to use a flat iron or curling iron to smooth out the frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li> the final product is what makes this worth it for me!</li>
            <li> there are other products out there that so a lot better.</li>
            <li> My hairs have got damaged after many times of dye, perms and other things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it mostly in the shower by adding it to my squeezed out hair, leaving it in, doing my other shower stuff and then rinsing.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use it once or twice a week because of how rich it is.</li>
            <li> i have tried other products nothing works on my hair like this product does love it.</li>
            <li> She had tried many of the better-known products to help the extreme brittle, breaking and thinning condition of her hair that she was experiencing.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair products that have an overwhelming smell or scent that just won&#x27;t go away, but the Arvazallia hair mask is not like that.  </li>
            <li> You will notice a significant difference in your hair after your second use.</li>
            <li> This extremely hydrating hair mask is my favorite in the bunch.</li>
            <li> hair is softer after using it, but it is nothing more that any other Hydrating product can do .</li>
            <li> I have natural, 4C, kinky hair &amp; it makes my hair SUPER soft, Manageable, Moisturized, and Dehydrated!</li>
            <li> Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair - I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I wrap it in a Turbie Twist and clean the apartment, do some homework, and throw my laundry in before getting back into the shower to wash it out.</li>
            <li> After the first use of this mask my hair was noticeably smoother, softer and didn&#x27;t feel dried out, it also made my split ends look better.  </li>
            <li> Wow, from the first use my hair felt so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Took a couple treatments to notice a difference but since then it has kept my long hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> All the Redken, Chi, and Biosilk products I use to clean, nourish, and style my hair just aren&#x27;t enough to manage it and/or replenish moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, baby fine (fly-away) hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li> I color my hair so it cut down on the dryness and made it very smooth just after one use.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li> What I got what a good deep conditioner that helps keep frizz down.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on in the last few minutes of their shower and their hair feels wonderful and combs right out!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but generic, and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to everyone with damaged hair that wants a smoother and healthier looking hair.</li>
            <li> -- I will start out by saying I have very straight brown hair of normal thickness that I am currently trying to grow out (not that it really matters, but it&#x27;s hangs to about the bottom of my shoulder blades right now).  </li>
            <li> Almost tangle free from the rinsing out of it and made it a breeze to blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> amazing for the coarse, dry hair I have.  </li>
            <li> The ends are not nearly as dry as they used to be and it looks smooth and feels soft after just blow drying.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair as well for the same keeps my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> It left my hair incredibly soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine indian hair which gets very dry and frizzy during the winter months and wanted to get something really moisturizing and organic.</li>
            <li> I felt how smooth it was RIGHT after I washed it out when it was still wet!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my hair at all, but it leaves it feeling soft and healthy and gives it a pretty shine that I normally don&#x27;t see without finishing spray!</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair that I get colored and highlighted every eight weeks.  </li>
            <li> Mine is coloring and heat damaged vey dry fine hair.</li>
            <li> plan to keep using this as my primary conditioner as long as it continues to work as well as it has been.</li>
            <li> I will use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I have fine over proccecced na dreally damaged hair that it gets so dry soemtimes</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, blond, and bone dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Going to give a full rinse out a shot next time to see if that makes any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Want my money back or a full bottle of the thing</li>
            <li> The not as directed way worked better but so far In my two uses ,this stuff is not great or even better than a drug store conditioner.</li>
            <li> This made my hair so soft and silky with just the first use</li>
            <li> Directions indicated to use it for several minutes on damp towel-dried hair, I left it on for several hours with good results.</li>
            <li> After first use my hair was silky soft.</li>
            <li> First time I used this product and it made my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Pretty good..didn&#x27;t stop breakage..but soft manageable hair</li>
            <li> Normally she has very Frizzy hair</li>
            <li> One use completely brought my hair back to its natural healthy feel and made it shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I did not like how my hair turned out the day after the first use, but now my hair is really soft.</li>
            <li> my hair feels incredibly soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> she isn&#x27;t willing to share with her mom ~ unless it&#x27;s her asking for me to touch her hair because it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so healthy and shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because this is heavier than a conditioner, make sure you rinse out ALL of the product before getting out of the shower so that your hair is not weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> it felt heavier, fuller, but not in a weighed down way; it felt healthy.</li>
            <li> I used about a Tablespoon amount on my hair (just from neck down - I don&#x27;t condition the top of my head).</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this did not create a greasy feel that so many products can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as instructed, and ever since I&#x27;ve begun using it my hair has gotten really tangled and gross feeling, becoming super matted and seems to be due to the build up this product is causing.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair super soft like others claim), but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how good this product actually would end up being.</li>
            <li> I also recommended my friend and she has fallen in live with the product too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying something new in attempt to tame my hair, but nothing (not even high end salon products) have ever been as effective as this.</li>
            <li> My hair felt super soft, moist &amp; light; not coated or weighed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write reviews for hair conditioning products, but for mine (Asian) it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try again -not as directed- using less on top of another conditioner to try to seal in the moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> Still need a bit more uses (it&#x27;s been about a week) to see if my split ends decrease or are less visible.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lasted me a lot I still have more than half</li>
            <li> For an added boost, after I rinsed out the mask in the shower, I put more on my hair and wrapped it in a towel and let it sit for about a half hour and rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li> It works better that the previous ones I tried.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, my hair is so shiny and a lot less frizzy when I use this mask.</li>
            <li> I love my previous argan oil hair mask from EVA NYC, but I was looking for a cheaper alternative and decided to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> On top of that, lately my hair has been very brittle and breaking easy, so I thought to try a deep conditioner to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> I still use the Mizani smooth guard serum to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I saw a difference immediately after using the products and everytime I use them, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle.</li>
            <li> Just seemed like a somewhat greasier version of decent conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using this as a daily treatment and never have I felt my hair to be this smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Probably not the main demographic for this product</li>
            <li> But this is more of a mask for occasional hair repair than daily-use.more of a mask for occasional hair repair than daily-use.</li>
            <li> I USED TOP OF THE LINE CONDITIONER BEFORE THIS MORE EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Its makes my hair really soft and tangle free, will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Its more like a regular conditioner actually.</li>
            <li> time I left it on for just 5 min in the shower and still left my hair much better</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future .</li>
            <li> it makes  my hair feel so soft, i will keep using it thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> In creams and lotions, it supports the main emulsion system and gives texture to the product.</li>
            <li> to the main issue</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair really soft and smooth, especially when paired with the curl cream after.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed, my hair was not detangled and did not seem particularly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> and omg, It&#x27;s like a different set of hair on my head, doesn&#x27;t look oily but super silky and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this is the only one that has worked.  </li>
            <li> but I leave it on for at least ten, twice a week, and get great results.</li>
            <li> It performed better than even much more expensive conditioners that I have used before.</li>
            <li> Been using it as my main conditioner for every wash.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and will never go back to regular conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I have fully highlighted hair, and was shopping around for deep conditioners as my $150/tub of Oribe was quickly running out.</li>
            <li> So I quickly put it in my hair, washed it out brushed through my hair and went on with my day..</li>
            <li> Decent moisturizer for the price.</li>
            <li> I use products generously but a little goes a long way, also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves my hair, which is very thick and long, feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Thus far,  it has made a positive difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioners ranging from cheap to expensive for my bleached, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft !!</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t even keep it on as long as suggested and it still made my hair smooth and really soft but still very curly.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I needed to find something because my hair was a frizzy mess with split ends and flyaways from putting so many highlights in.</li>
            <li> Really makes your hair soft!</li>
            <li> This works very well for my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> I later buy it for gifts for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> My wife is Latina and has thick brown hair that is quite healthy!</li>
            <li> I really fried my hair right after using it and had to switch to Olaplex but will go back to this eventually.</li>
            <li> I am aware there may be other more expensive products out there that may work better for two or three times the price, but I am pleased with the quality offered by this one and not eager to fork over extra for a marginal difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product, even if the cost is a bit high.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I need to use it a few more times before I really see the results as it seems my hair likes new products in general.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair silky and smooth and it&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the other highly rated hair masks.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets, my hair is soft, hydrated and manageable since the very first used.</li>
            <li> - I used it, wasn&#x27;t for me, clearly tons of other people love it,</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t follow the directions out of the box, I felt my hair really needed deep conditioning more often because it has dry and frizzy ends from years of chemical treatments.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the other popular Argan oil deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This would not be as effective for me if I only used it every other wash.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have Curly thick hair, This product moisturizes my hair and leaves it feeling soft and less frizzy and smelling wonderful.</li>

            <li> My hair feels silky soft!!</li>
            <li> Just a little bit after shampooing, I don&#x27;t wait more than a minute to rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> but this mask moisturizes my hair a little better than the Kerastase.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for several hours, it rinses clean and my hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I ruined my hair by putting too much protein in my hair and now it is super dry.</li>
            <li> I have natural curled with highlights so my hair tends to get dry and easily tangled.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I digress...), the scent that remains is very gentle and barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised, it actually helped to repair my super damaged hair</li>
            <li> Very hydrating but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>

            <li> This hair mask really hydrated my hair and makes it feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, it was perfect - back to the way it used to be before it got dried out.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped to restore body and shine to my 62 year old hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was over processed and it made it so soft and so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very manageable and soft.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t notice too much irritation.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and silky, and really helps with manageability in these humid summer months.</li>
            <li> Really has helped to add moisture to my hair and leaves it with a soft finish.</li>
            <li> I used Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration</li>
            <li> This really does leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times so far and really like the shine and softness.</li>
            <li> It also makes my natural hair really curl up and shine.  </li>

            <li> This product really makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky soft and very manageable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my hair soft, silky, shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> but I just tried the hair mask for one time and my hair is straight and it feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels real soft after application.</li>
            <li> , it really made my hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY SHINY AND SOFT .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my hair look this healthy in such a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped that after several days off and weekends in a row that maybe my results would be cumulative, and that parading around in my undergarments with dairy queen dollar menu dessert for hair might be worth it someday, but I was eventually running out of mask and not seeing results.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy a second bottle of &amp;#34;any&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Flaked and dried my hair out more</li>
            <li> These improvements seem short lived so far, but I am hoping with regular use that I will see more long-lasting changes.</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition like normal and then put this in and comb it through and then leave it about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> about 20 times - you really don&#x27;t need more than a small scoop.</li>
            <li> It last forever worth the money.</li>
            <li> I followed the mask by applying a couple of pumps of the same brand oil to hair along my regular styling products, I have been very pleasantly surprised at the improvement after each use, after blow drying my hair, my hair looked healthy and felt very supple and was soft all over.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see my hair getting greasey any faster than it normally does</li>
            <li> I used Color-Proofs shampoo Detox to get rid of buildup, then shampooed like normal using my Redken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair immensely soft and smooth, and makes them appear fresher for long.</li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair like normal, but instead of using conditioner, I use the Arvazalia Oil Mask.</li>
            <li> This condition is amazing and helps me and my daughter&#x27;s long thick frizzy hair to be smooth and soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> then my normal</li>
            <li> &amp;  rarely purchase the same thing twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally cut off most of the long damaged hair I had and have been growing the rest out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my blonde sister will definitely appreciate a jar for what&#x27;s left of her hair. ;)</li>
            <li> Cetearyl alcohol is used across our entire range of fresh products as an emulsifier.</li>
            <li> I actually use this as regular conditioner 3-4 times a week which is much more frequent than what the instructions suggest, but haven&#x27;t noticed any problems yet.</li>
            <li> I have normal kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> In one use my hair felt so healthy, i box dye my hair straighten everyday</li>
            <li> My hair has never been more soft and silky, and the results truly last through to my next shampoo (about once a week)!  </li>
            <li> As good, if not better than the deep conditioning treatments I get at the salon.  </li>
            <li> no complaint about that</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this hair mask once a week between your normal shampoo and conditioning routine.</li>
            <li> This hair mask was nice an thick.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time the other day and it made my fine blonde hair very managable.</li>
            <li> I started using this product twice a week about a month ago and it has really helped smooth down my hair and delay the occurrence of split ends without making making my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair sliky soft and healthy looking without weighting it down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, it makes it lay down better</li>
            <li> I felt that the mask really nourished by hair and even though it was thick it was easy to rinse out!</li>
            <li> My long, fine, curly hair had suddenly become fried-feeling in certain spots.</li>
            <li> I use it differently than most, probably, in that I apply it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did leave it super soft but it also left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Just apply it in your hair after use the shampoo, then slightly massage your hair from root and wait from 5 mins to 7 mins, finally, wash your hair with warm water.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and smooth and dry faster</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling super soft, with no tangles at all.</li>
            <li> and I do have colored, thin but strong hair, and it detangled my hair so well and make it so smooth.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is super thick and light</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair several times it was really damaged and I couldn&#x27;t keep it healthy even though I tried coconut oil, egg and other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone, leaves your hair EXTREAMLY soft, no tangles and gives it shine!</li>
            <li> have pretty fine hair- wavy when dried naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, long, colored hair that was starting to feel very brittle.</li>
            <li> and this seems to tame it even when I straighten it :)</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say if you have baby fine hair, just use a dime to nickel&#x27;s worth of it or it can weigh you hair down.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which is rare because I have such baby fine</li>
            <li> works very well on dry hair and the price was right</li>
            <li> Great for my thick dry hair!</li>
            <li> My Hair: Baby fine, blonde, color treated, straight, dry, brittle, split ends, frizzy, dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner once, but I must say it&#x27;s the most hydration conditioner I&#x27;ve used for a long while.  </li>
            <li> The jar is a good size and you don&#x27;t need much, even for long and thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shinning  and new</li>
            <li> We live in FLA - and chlorine, saltwater and sun do a job on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Use it 3 times a week leave it for 10 minutes comb hair and it leaves it like new.</li>
            <li> my hair is like new after one use...</li>
            <li> so I try something new every chance I get</li>
            <li> I live in Florida so it is always humid</li>
            <li> They even sent a follow-up emails regarding the product and how to use it/whether I received my new shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida (</li>
            <li> I live in the Atlanta area, so the heat and humidity are fierce.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels new.</li>
            <li> New customer, for life.</li>
            <li> I have Moroccan and Bumble products as well, but this is my new fave.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t look like a live wire anymore.  </li>
            <li> Brings new youth to my silver locks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair while in search of a new hair salon and thought I&#x27;d try this to attempt to reverse some damage since it&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve had a trim.</li>
            <li> I have found my new brand-</li>
            <li> I live in a humid area.</li>
            <li> The product was half full no signs of leakage ripped off!  </li>
            <li> amazing for bleached and dry dry hair!!!</li>
            <li> I used a lot of other brand name, high end products such as Moroccan Oil and Pureology, and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> My hair just feels alive and vibrant and fuller</li>
            <li> Its very good..making your hair soft and moisturized ,but ingredients are far from organic.</li>
            <li> I always get a deep conditioning treatment every 6 weeks from a salon, which last about a week and keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft, but it dried my hair out more than it was, it contains alcohol</li>
            <li> More efficient forms of hydrogenation enable fatty alcohols to be formed directly from triglycerides (vegetable oils).</li>
            <li> My bleach ravaged hair is starting to look like normal hair and not straw thanks to your product!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so soft for quite a few days :)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so silky, and when I comb through it wet after the shower, my hair is nearly tangle free.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and towel dried it, then put a nice amount of this on my hair and left it on for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Most of which, I have later learned were either actually causing more damage or just a total waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and the older</li>
            <li> The smell I think is unnecessarily strong and gives me a slight headache, also the tub I received says Made in China.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, dry and tends to loose it</li>
            <li> Really helps bring back the soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> For almost a year now I have been using Redkens Body Full, my hair just seemed to be getting very dry.</li>
            <li> The Arvazallia deep conditioning mask produced incredible results for my bleached blonde/ over processed and coarse, thick hair type!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this did not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> followed all of the instructions on the container very clearly, leaving it in for about 6 minutes after brushing it through my hair</li>

            <li> Since good reviews matter to me prior to a purchase-had I known so little of the 1500 reviews were actually verified purchases-</li>
            <li> Not high in comparison to similar products, even, but high for me as I don&#x27;t generally invest more than $10 in a container of this size.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> At first I thought another product “hyping” up their product and the results you would receive, plus all the discounts that were attached to various products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> You can definitely tell it is making a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I found this deep conditioner, and I will definitely keep using it.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be including this in my curly to straight hair regimen!</li>
            <li> I’ve used a couple hair masks in the past and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> After the first time use, my skin broke out and my ears around the hairline became so red and itchy.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I love using this product prior to straightening my hair because it helps seal the moisture into my hair since I only deep condition/straighten once a week!</li>
            <li> This helps my hair a lot....feels so soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different conditioners and this is the first that leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, but in the top</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny, soft and conditioned!  </li>
            <li> My hair is soooo soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I have had bleached blond hair for the past 10 years and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I&#x27;ve ever used that has totally moisturized my hair.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> My hair feels instantly soft!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as other products; but what I really disliked were the telemarketing calls that came with the product.</li>
            <li> My only very minor issue is that the smell is a bit strong and off-putting going on, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in the hair.</li>
            <li> Even if I end up trying something new, I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;ll come back to Arvazallia&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been letting it grow and since not cut regularly, was becoming very dry.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything amazing and the consistency is a little strange</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that my results are NOT due to suddenly conditioning my hair every day when I wasn’t before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that my results are NOT due to suddenly conditioning my hair every day when I wasn’t before.</li>
            <li> My favorite deep condition compare to other products .Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have also put just a small amount in my hair after the shower and left it, no heavy feeling, just more smoothness!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have started a new regime with my hair, enhancing all areas of my hair; restoring, strengthening, moisturizing, conditioning, and giving a natural shine to my hair I have found that this product can be added to my hair regime products with all of the benefits it gives my hair in just ONE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have started a new regime with my hair, enhancing all areas of my hair; restoring, strengthening, moisturizing, conditioning, and giving a natural shine to my hair I have found that this product can be added to my hair regime products with all of the benefits it gives my hair in just ONE PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my newly bleached hair and now my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would help smooth it out and make it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I use a comb in the shower with it (per the instructions) and am able to detangle effortlessly (I have fine, thin, long hair that for some reason is prone to dreading itself overnight).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price because of how well it works on my dry, kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product my hair became baby soft again (I left it on overnight).  </li>
            <li> I have only applied this product once, so I am going to have to update this review after a few more tries.&lt;br /&gt;So far, your hair gets incredibly soft and it really changed how it looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and love it, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down, like some conditioners</li>
            <li> I think it is also worth mentioning that I have been experiencing hair breakage (from using too much keratin) , and that my breakage slowed down after using this product</li>
            <li> All of the items are ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have type 3c hair, fine and soft tight curls.  </li>
            <li> Wow oh wow!</li>
            <li> I have paid far less for more with other products, but I reserved judgment until after my first use.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I definitely think this is the product to thank for more manageable curls and less frizziness and dryness</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it four stars is because previously I had been using Moroccan Oil Hair Mask and had slightly better results.  </li>
            <li> Hair still kind of dry and dead looking.</li>
            <li> I only wish that in came in bigger jars, as I run out fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does what it wants, it gets extremely frizzy in both humid and dry conditions and it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> (1) the fragrance is more like the stench of someone who&#x27;s trying to mask a foul odor, and (2) the actual conditioner is nothing I haven&#x27;t used before and that I really don&#x27;t like - it&#x27;s that slippery, slick type of conditioner that feels like you can never wash off completely.  </li>
            <li> My ends feel dry right now</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped it would be, left my long thick hair super soft and strong.</li>
            <li> It took 50 years to find something to turn my naturally curly/frizzy, high-maintenance mess into low-maintenance, fabulous curls with body and shine.  </li>
            <li> but I havent used it long enough to observe any significant improvements to hair.  </li>
            <li> I expected magic from all the previous orders.. and started to think maybe I&#x27;m asking for too much..</li>
            <li> By this last attempt, I became entirely certain that this product was not in fact doing me any favors at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For several weeks I would pass my fingers through my hair and large strands of hair would come with my fingers.</li>
            <li> This does make your hair a little smooth but nothing miraculous.</li>
            <li> When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-)</li>
            <li> Very high price for a low quality product.</li>
            <li> Check the customer images for more, along with details about how I take my before and after pictures (always on product-free, residue-free, naturally air-dried hair).he oil, only because so little oil is needed for the hair</li>
            <li> No static, fly away hair and no greasy, heavy residue!</li>
            <li> It softens my coarse, unruly curls twice a week gives them several days of definition and calm.</li>
            <li> Even 24 hours later, my hair is still so soft and shiny and my sister wants to order some now.</li>
            <li> This mask made it soft, shiny and the middle to the ends look really</li>
            <li> I also get far fewer tangles than I used to and the ones I do get are much easier to comb out, which is a big plus for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, that I always only wear straight</li>
            <li> I put this on with a shower cap over night and my hair turned so soft with just one application.  </li>
            <li> Silky soft hair.</li>
            <li> It also conditions, hydrates and moisturizes your hair for a soft and silky texture, allowing manageability and improving elasticity.</li>
            <li> This stuff helped a lot and made it soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> After allowing the mask to sit for 20mins under heat,  my curls felt soft and juicy.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my naturally curly hair that sometimes will get frizzy also.  </li>

            <li> Works really well to deeply moisturize hair.</li>
            <li> Has completely restored my ends.</li>
            <li> I have never felt my hair this soft IN MY LIFE.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> the split ends don&#x27;t look nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Used on my daughter; her hair was soft and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> It has completely changed the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> Completely transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair silky and soft after use.</li>

            <li> spoiled brat and her soft hair..</li>
            <li> Makes maY hair so soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> makes your hair sooo soft</li>
            <li> While the shampoo and conditioner both contain Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil, you really need this third product to see maximum results!</li>
            <li> I have 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and silky and not fuzzy at all.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the hair soft and avoid thinning of hair.</li>
            <li> I covered with a plastic cap and let sit for about 10 minutes and could not believe how soft my hair was after rinsing out.  </li>
            <li> So, I have to say that I have been very pleasantly surprised by how well this product works.</li>
            <li> My hair is so incredibly soft after using this.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and my hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter also used it.</li>
            <li> This has not done nothing to my hair but make it feel soft</li>
            <li> I only use this product about twice a week, if you use it more, it might be too much because it is such a heavy conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I feel like most deep conditioners are so heavy</li>
            <li> In the last six months, I have been experimenting with argan oil products to improve the condition of my hair, which I color regularly (lighten) but rarely blow-dry.  </li>
            <li> The price for this product was low enough that I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> i  was scared to use it because i get tired sometimes of the many products i use for my damaged hair trying to find ones that really work.</li>
            <li> Its been helping with my course thick hair making it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves my thick and frizzy hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Although it says to let it stay on for 5-7 minutes,  because I have chemically treated hair, I applied it and covered my hair with a shower cap, and sat under the dryer for approximately 20 minutes on warm temperature setting.</li>
            <li> This Argan Hair mask keeps my thick hair looking smooth and shiny without being to oily!</li>
            <li> It washes out really easily, and when my hair would normally be tangled even with a little regular conditioner, this one lets me work my fingers through without any</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do much for my blonde processed (with new grey wiry hairs).</li>
            <li> The first time i used hydrating argan oil mask and deep conditioner my hair absorb it so quick with few amount</li>
            <li> I was searching the Amazon website one morning for hair products to give my hair a new regime schedule with products different than what I normally use, and came across this product.  </li>
            <li> It could be that my results are so dramatic because I went from using no deep conditioner to using this (see aformentioned bit about having a hard time finding good products for my hair texture....), but I will say I&#x27;ve had much better results with this product than I have had with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have long, frizzy, color treated hair and after I blow dry and straighten, my hair is shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> After the first my hair went from dry &amp; brittle to soft, silky &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> this stuff is super thick and oily, which at first freaked me out</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that gets very dry and damaged looking at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the difference right away when my hair was still wet.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Really helped to make my hair smooth and less dry now that the weather is colder and air is drier.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and prefer more subtle, natural scents to this.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached and dry but has improved so much after using it!</li>
            <li> now with this product it seems that my hair is more soft and less dry.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It does the same as all of the other drugstore and even cheap conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is the First time I am buying something to treat dry hair.</li>
            <li> My already dry tresses were getting pretty worked over by the curling iron and the coloring.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and have noticed an improvement after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after my first use, and my hair is DRY.</li>
            <li> I then just let my hair air dry as it was hot out</li>
            <li> The tub was not as full as it could have been (about half)</li>
            <li> And if you are going for a pastel hair color you can mix your hair dye with this hair mask and leave it in your hair for as long as possible and the result come out greater than with a regular white conditioner because this product is just so nourishing and moisturizing for your hair!</li>
            <li> Due to the viscosity I had to use a little more than expected to work it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing the product out, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at first.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is also naturally dry (due to the natural curl and coarse texture, on top of the dry climate of which I live), so it&#x27;s safe to say it gets a little stressed out.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overuse, will make your hair flat rather than straight.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and this product really makes my hair feel and look soft!</li>
            <li> I tend to concentrate this towards the middle of my hair down through the ends since that is where I need the most deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> May as well simply use a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> For me it was not more hydrating than most deep conditioners in this price range.  </li>
            <li> and I have been nursing my hair back to health for the last two years and have seen such tremendous changes.</li>
            <li> She could tell an immediate improvement with the first use, which continued to improve over the next several weeks.</li>
            <li> I rotate it with a daily conditioner and a second weekly condition and it helps my hair so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products to help me repair the damage to my hair and this is the only product that&#x27;s has been consistent</li>
            <li> teenage daughter used this for the first time last night and was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy, dyed hair that gets frizzy very easily.</li>
            <li> I have long baby fine hair that turned straws like due to all of the abuse.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of my hair has been blonde and pretty dry colored but now its just soft and straight,  totally recommended!</li>
            <li> my thick super long coarse frizzy hair is smooth and soft after just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I DID mix this with a high protein conditioner for extra hydration.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you invest in this product as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bummed because I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product especially those chemically treated hair because it works.</li>
            <li> I live in a super dry climate and have very fine, thin, dry hair</li>
            <li> have super fine very curly hair and so usual curly dry hair products weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair was literally dead, specially on the tips</li>
            <li> It gets very dry and brittle particularly on the ends from coloring and using the hair drier, flat iron and hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The same girl who made those comments about my hair hasn&#x27;t mentioned any positive changes, but she also hasn&#x27;t mentioned being coarse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The overwhelming scent was not good.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to really penetrate.</li>
            <li> If you don’t have much time in the shower, no problem because you don’t have to leave this in for a long time to reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I needed something to really condition my hair as I&#x27;m trying to grow it long again.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and looking much healthier.</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair a red ombre and it absolutely killed my healthy ends.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair is back to normal again.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty bummed expected it not to work well</li>
            <li> It always takes a couple regular washes after to get my hair feeling normal again.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, very curly and VERY damaged from straight ironing it 2x a day for over a year.</li>
            <li> I live in Miami, and the weather here is pretty humid, and the Arvazallia Hydrating Hair Mask makes my hair way less frizz.</li>
            <li> so I have to use dry shampoo right after washing my hair, although it is possible</li>
            <li> use just a little once or twice a week as a quick conditioner</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that the first time I used the mask, my hair seemed to soak it all in so much that I needed to use quite a bit, but after that, the moisture in my hair was so improved that I needed much less conditioner on subsequent applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that the first time I used the mask, my hair seemed to soak it all in so much that I needed to use quite a bit, but after that, the moisture in my hair was so improved that I needed much less conditioner on subsequent applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was starting to get into  the $25 conditioners, so I&#x27;m glad I found something that works really well for a little less.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to deep</li>
            <li> I simply cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I was in total disbelief, every time I would pass my fingers, I would get a new bunch of hair in my hands.  </li>
            <li> I USUALLY LIVE IT ON FOR 1 DAY ,ONLY IN THE ENDS</li>
            <li> It works really well with my damaged dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and over-processed hair and this mask really moisturized and hydrated my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, though it says you can use it up to 2x per, and it has been a real help to my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Mehhh... did not do anything much for my color treated dry hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hair became very brittle and dry after having it lightened.</li>
            <li> really helped in moisturizing my dry ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like this is a must-have product, but it is helpful for dry ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped with my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has dry or damaged hair and wants to nourish their hair.</li>
            <li> It is a decent moisurizer but not super intense and the smell of the conditioner smells like something I could get a Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> so my hair got really fried,got split ends,was shedding and every time I brushed it my hair broke off but after doing extensive research I decided to buy this product since it has 5 stars</li>
            <li> used this the first time and left it on for a long time and the results were</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this hair mask for those who have damaged hair and want to really repair and nourish their hair back to</li>
            <li> This is the first product in a long time that I could actually feel make a difference.</li>
            <li> I color my hair blonde, from a box, and I keep it pretty long.</li>
            <li> use this only once a week, although there&#x27;s no reason why someone couldn&#x27;t use this every day, especially if you have straight or treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Really terrific mask and YES, it really does take ONE time only to see results!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I leave it in for 10 minutes when I really want a deep condition, or I use it just as a conditioner when not deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from using a flatiron daily and even regular haircuts don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> This really left my natural hair feeling really soft even after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair for the first time and it left my hair very dry and with out a natural bounce.</li>
            <li> This definitely conditions hair leaving it very soft.</li>
            <li> Just left it feeling very very soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it repairs, restores and strengthens weak, damaged and over processed hair.</li>
            <li> so I do major damage to it</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner as a deep conditioner, my hair is back to normal!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I used this mask &amp; the oil from the same brand, &amp; wow !</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble keeping the ends of your long hair soft and smooth, then I would recommend you try this.  </li>
            <li> Two bleaching sessions (one left in far too long, leading to scalp burn), four dyes, and very irregular conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two treatments and...</li>
            <li> And one jar of these is about the same price as one professional treatment!  </li>
            <li> I usually leave on overnight but have left it on for 10 min only and was still satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Keeps my coarse hair soft!</li>
            <li> I just wanted a super hydrating deep conditioner to try and keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> This really did the trick for my dry damaged hair!</li>
            <li> Really helped my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product if your hair is dry and damaged.!</li>
            <li> Perming it straight, coloring (blonde), flat iron, and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> hair is medium length, thick, and has a mind of its own, thus I&#x27;ve  been at its mercy, rejoicing when it decided to behave, and bemoaning its stubbornness  the other 364 days of the year.</li>
            <li> Because I Have Really Thick Hair Which Causes Me To Run The Flat Iron Through A Couple Of More Times.</li>
            <li> The whole purpose of getting this was to hydrate my very dry scalps and help me stop all the dandruffs, and it worked so</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and is very damaged.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry do to coloring it so much which I&#x27;m stopping.</li>
            <li> I have the typical semi - curly Caucasian hair and I live in Colorado which was really drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li> i bought this to use with a new flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It was very thick and almost felt like more of a balm styling product than conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have butt length, thin, fine, pin straight hair that&#x27;s dyed red.</li>
            <li> This worked right away on my dry, dry hair.</li>
            <li> it works great as a hair conditional but it smells quite bad.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week, and my hair always feels refreshed and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> It just looked damaged in general.  </li>
            <li> I Generally follow up with another conditioner (tresemme curly) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has been two weeks that I have been using this hair mask, and I have received compliments on a daily basis at how soft my hair looks now...</li>
            <li> This product left my hair soft .</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying again, especially because it&#x27;s such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I could barely get my brush through it.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li> This product has finally given me my soft hair again.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> how soft it makes my hair, and the overall effect it has on my hair!</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I barely write reviews.</li>
            <li> I have mixed natural hair</li>
            <li> I like the smell, soft and feminine but then it fades and isn&#x27;t a problem at my &amp;#34;no perfume office&amp;#34; later on.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt rough afterwards so it didn&#x27;t really feel like a hair oil mask.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the oil hair treatment too in the near future.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair soft, but the softness will despair the following morning.(I wash my hair at night)</li>
            <li> So Im a 2nd time around natural</li>
            <li> I have coarse (4c) natural hair, that hits at my shoulders when in its shrunken state.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with thinning hair, and this product seems to make my hair bit thicker and gives it volume instead of my old, armpit-looking hair.</li>
            <li> Not only is it soft but it shines too.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I have only tried this product once so far.  </li>
            <li> I used it last night and my hair has never been this soft.</li>
            <li> I dont see a big change in my hair after using this product but it does feel really soft when i rinse it and it easier to comb after using this</li>
            <li> /&gt;i spent the better part of last week crying because i thought u had ruined my hair..</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair soft now</li>
            <li> How is it possible to have MY hair this soft?</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and actually stays with me for several days even without washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> If you shamppo and condition regularly, your hair is fairly soft to begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll switch back to Loreal Professional Nature Therapy conditioner in a tub.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old woman with short curly hair.  </li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;Still a bit early to say if this product is working.&lt;br /&gt;It seems the coarse part of the hair has gotten softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only downside is it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product about four times but my hair does feel silky and soft after applying this mask.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s so soft &amp; silky, it actually comes apart, &amp; I have to use a scrunchie.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels soft again.  </li>
            <li> only use a small portion to cover my entire hair area so you can save more for later use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the second use my hair was back to normal.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice last week &amp;d each time my hair did not feel like straw after a day, which is what I normally experience with standard conditioners, even &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; conditioners.</li>
            <li> This definitely makes hair smoother, but for me, the results don&#x27;t last any longer than normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been the kind to care for my hair because I&#x27;ve always been skeptical</li>
            <li> so I was kind of skeptical with this product</li>
            <li> It is really comparable to more really expensive deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> It is thick, moisturizing and I like the light scent it has also.</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but many layers.</li>
            <li> It seems like cheap really thick conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and love the results.</li>
            <li> I also find with other deep conditioners that the results don&#x27;t last after the first shampoo afterwards, my hair hair would go right back to being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks I used it every 4 days and now am down to once a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding a good deep conditioner for fine hair because so many are targeted for thick hair, and as a result most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried would completely weigh my hair down and make it look disgusting.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I noticed an extreme difference!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I actually had shine to my hair after I blew it dry, and it felt much softer.</li>
            <li> I took a break from my straight hair and decided to deep condition and moisturize my hair before I went back to flat ironing my hair again.</li>
            <li> it left my hair very soft by  second hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair and live in a humid climate, which does not help!  </li>
            <li> It does have a noticeable scent that is a touch strong when I apply it to my hair in the shower (if you can&#x27;t do scents, this is definitely not the product for you), but once I have blow-dried my hair (blow dried or blown dry?</li>
            <li> I used to put my hair up with a large hair clip and it was hard to close because so much hair I had.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged due to dyeing and I don&#x27;t want to spend too much for treatment.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers the hair and never leave the hair too soft or flat.</li>
            <li> It takes a little extra time to do this mask but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> highly recomended  this treatment for everybody with very dry hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking that I was definitely not going to wash my hair, get out of the shower and dry my hair, only to get back in and put the mask in to wash it out.</li>
            <li> When an Argan hair mask that I had previously been using was no longer available, I went in search of a substitute that, like the other, was in cream form for easier application.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely did it&#x27;s magic on my dry dull hay hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been very careful or gentle with my hair</li>
            <li> I live in CO and my hair gets so dry.</li>
            <li> I also color my hair and live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> This has given my dry colored hair a new life.  </li>
            <li> Although the cream is a little loose and can slip through my fingers, it&#x27;s much easier to use than straight oil.  </li>
            <li> It, at least, made my hair smell clean and the smell did linger on for days.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with damaged, dry hair, and will definitely be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> and it left her hair soft for several days.</li>
            <li> I just found out that reviews can be filtered by verified purchases out of the 1500 or so reviews on this product 140 are actually verified purchases-also among the verified purchases all the critical reviews including mine have been marked not helpful.</li>
            <li> I used this once, following instructions (left in for 10 minutes in the shower) and it made my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Im currently transitioning back to natural and</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to contain my natural waves with gel products that left my hair feeling gross and took away my volume.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big junkie when it comes to hair masks because of my frizzy ends and trying to find as natural products for it as possible.</li>
            <li> My skin has not been that sensitive to any products in the past and this is the first hair product that i had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and looks smoother after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients list several silicone-ish products, but considering the sporadic (1x week) recommended use, not going to worry about it.</li>
            <li> African American with 4C natural hair, works well and has helped define some of my curls/coils.</li>
            <li> I try to leave it in as long as I can (normally a few hours) and it leaves my hair feeling like cool silk.</li>
            <li> Decent as a run of the mill product, but not as expected for an overmight mask</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have dry curly/wavey/frizzy hair, and this product makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Will purchase this and only this product from now on, because no other one that I have used can compare with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, expensive and cheap, with very little difference.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because I don&#x27;t buy hair products online</li>
            <li> will update if there is a major change in later time.</li>
            <li> This mask feels rich and thick and really conditions the hair well without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking from being so dry and after just one time using this product, my hair was so soft!</li>
            <li> I have very oily, thin, fine hair that I&#x27;ve spent years abusing with colors and heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using its a 10 but sick of paying the high $$ I found this on amazon and thought I&#x27;ve been paying double this whole time and this is much better.</li>
            <li> And by accept, I mean flat iron and occasionally cry about becoming bald at forty.    </li>
            <li> Normally my hair is impossibly dry and tangles itself in knots within minutes of being brushed.</li>
            <li> cause it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair at all and not worth $15.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement where my hair isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; but is generally softer.  </li>
            <li> For the folks that need extra moisture due to processing I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Finally, with the last bit left, I wrapped it up and wore it overnight and rinsed the sludge out of my hair in the morning, even going so far as to take my chances with not quite rinsing it all the way.</li>
            <li> As long as it stays this price, I will be a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve just gone pretty heavy handed with their marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product first few days</li>
            <li> well as this product first few days) and</li>

            <li> I use it a few times a week, and it really has done wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> I still need to do a protein treatment &amp; trim a few inches off, but my hair, after everything I put it through, is SUPER shiny &amp; with the exception of the the few inches I&#x27;ll get cut off, it&#x27;s actually very soft !</li>
            <li> We live above the arctic circle and it is extremely dry here.</li>
            <li> I have 50-ish year old thick, but very fine hair past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> The texture becomes softer and I find that it really doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This product added body and structure to my hair without weighing it down and maintained the curls for a whole week.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry from ocean swimming, over processing, and sun damage and this product hydrated and made it very soft.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed out the mask and let my hair air dry, my hair was so soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> It took my dry, over processed and brittle hair and turned it to a shiny, soft, manageable miracle.</li>
            <li> I now use the product as a leave-in because my curly hair became very frizzy and less manageable after the lightening.</li>
            <li> But I am ready to face the world with less split ends and hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft before I blow dry and stays that way after.  </li>

            <li> I recently had my hair highlighted, which is a much needed change for my dark brunette locks.</li>
            <li> I have used the hair mask for the past few weeks and it has made my hair healthier, more shiny and prevented breakage.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more geared to every other etnicity except black hair!!!</li>
            <li> I never ever leave reviews on Amazon but this product has made my hair shiny and soft every single time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Okay, seriously... I never write product reviews on Amazon or other websites....</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, the first time i used it i was shocked after drying my hair to not even have to straighten it because it was silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed I paid 16$ for an item that wasn&#x27;t even filled remotely to the top.</li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on deep penetrating conditioners that don&#x27;t live up to their claim.</li>
            <li> This hair mask makes my dry, brittle, damaged hair feel soft and like I just left the salon.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feels soft, but dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> I just bleached the tips of my hair to nearly platinum blonde , it was getting dry</li>
            <li> Regardless, my hair was really dry and damaged and this brought it back to life, making it feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair with highlights and my hair is naturally wavy so also a bit dry and prone to frizz.</li>

            <li> It made my coarse, dry hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> Not only does the texture improve but that dry, unmanageable hair becomes silky, soft and</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and the Arvazallia conditioner makes it soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Blonde highlighted hair is so hard to maintain and this stuff really helps!!</li>
            <li> My hair had been very dry and brittle at the ends, but after just one use of this stuff, it was soft again.</li>
            <li> She is natural and has very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have a tight curl pattern, and enjoy flat ironing and dying my naturally black hair medium ash blonde.</li>
            <li> The only product in the world that completely transformed my dry, frizzy, tangled, brillo pad hair!  </li>
            <li> You know how usually (if you bleach your hair or dye it) when you dont wash it for a day or two, the roots are super greasy and the ends of your hair are DRY AS HAY?</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair mask wanting to try a deep conditioner for my naturally curly and very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette turned blonde and my hair was very dry with a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down my fave hair conditioner of the moment!</li>
            <li> I read all of the good and bad reviews about this product before purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad it smells really good ...</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much it repairs damage, but generally seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, dry and damaged hair that is always hard to brush, not luxurious blah blah blah</li>
            <li> I bought this hair mask for my daughter who has long, straight hair down to her waist.</li>
            <li> But even after a major trim it still looked dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the right conditioner, and this works well.</li>
            <li> Even after just 2 uses my hair feels so much softer and definitely  less frizzy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s easy to see why &amp;#34;alcohols&amp;#34; are confusing to the average cosmetic label reader.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and have long virgin hair that seems to be perpetually dry no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Normally I can only go 3 days without washing my hair because at this point my hair starts to get slightly oily.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my dry, curly hair, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and my hair definitely looks healthier on the days I use it.</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight hair and this hydrates it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and rich with a velvety texture.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve noticed with using this product it keeps my hair conditioned for much longer without letting my hair get greasy, flat or heavy looking.</li>
            <li> Fatty alcohols were originally prepared from fats and oils by hydrolysis, which produces fatty acids.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hai very soft until the next wash and then all of the benefits go down the drain.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight but with so much frizz, I just tried this mask once and  the change was dramatic</li>
            <li> I can truly feel &amp; see a positive difference in my hair after just a few uses of this stuff!</li>
            <li> A little bit certainly goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that gets extremely knotted.</li>
            <li> So far this product has been extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> hairstylist recently took me from long, red to short brunette/ombre.</li>
            <li> After years and year of putting my hair through the ringer, all that dying, flat ironing, curling, and blow drying has final caught up with me.</li>
            <li> and maybe I didn&#x27;t wash it out well enough because my hair was really flat after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy, fluffy hair that I get highlighted and usually control with a flat iron -</li>
            <li> The jar is small and to top it off; you open up the jar… it is not filled all the way!!</li>
            <li> I leave in my hair and rinse the next day-just average as far as conditioning.                                                 </li>
            <li> but once I used it as an all-night hair mask; the results were the same no matter how long I left it on.</li>
            <li> first few tries</li>
            <li> It did not weigh down my straight hair as other treatments have, and left no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on how healthy, shiny, and thick my hair looks, and literally in January my hair dresser told me I had extensive damage due to straightening my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This mask brings me back to my pre teens when I just washed my hair, brushed it, and let it dry.</li>
            <li> , It left my hair oily and yet dry at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I would  definitely recommend this, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> My dry, flyaway hair that resisted taming with several other treatments is now soft and shiny without any greasiness.</li>
            <li> I work it through the ends of my hair and up and leave it in while I&#x27;m shaving and scrubbing, and usually by the time I&#x27;m ready to rinse</li>
            <li> I felt the price was reasonable for the small amount I have used each time.  </li>
            <li> I am not having nearly as much breakage as I have in the past.  </li>
            <li> Even a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Definitely a life long customer.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 5-10 minutes in the shower, clipped up out of the way since my hair is really long.</li>
            <li> Have not tried long enough to give a review but they keep asking for one.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s been abused by flat irons, dryers etc.</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long, medium thickness, curly, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I relax, color and flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> and once I&#x27;ve rinsed it out I apply the Hair Oil and proceed with blow drying and flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing the conditioner out, blow drying, and flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li> I have my hair colored on a regular basis and I have quite a bit of grey.  </li>
            <li> My Hair And Flat Ironed It.</li>
            <li> and I also use a flat iron..</li>
            <li> - my hair dresser has been on my case to stop using my flat iron</li>
            <li> I use this mask about once a week for my long white hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding conditioners that really make my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick, dry hair which after 10 years of highlighting and processing and now with some gray has gotten very course and dry.  </li>
            <li> I like it because while rich and thick, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look oily.</li>
            <li> I have reduced my 2 stars down to 1 star because clearly some sleezy marketing tactics are involved.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and silky without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> This mask completely eliminates all of my frizz but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and shiny, and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> After hearing so many positive reviews on this product, and to how all the dirty hippie blogs worship argan oil like the holy grail of luxurious locks, I have to say that I went into this purchase with extremely high hopes and was let down, to say the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and super hydrating but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This big jar goes a long time !</li>
            <li> It is too soon to actually review the product, as I have used it once only, but the low rating is due to a marketing machine which stepped over the intrusive line today.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Even Have To Run The Flat Iron Through Twice !</li>
            <li> i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because a little goes a long way (I have very long and thick hair and found that this small jar lasted several uses) and because it leaves your hair smelling AMAZING.</li>
            <li> We live in Houston where the sun is baking almost year round on the hair.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m a man with short red-brown hair, it was visibly dry and frizzy and literally squeaked in the shower when shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry anyway (red hair) but either way the conditioner worked quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my hair on a daily basis and I also blow dry and use hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and less frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry recently it is breaking .</li>
            <li> If you have dry, brittle, or damaged hair, then this is definitely the hair mask for you!</li>
            <li> but it goes back to dry and brittle after one day.</li>
            <li> Recently visited Aruba and my hair was severely wind-blown and dry -</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver for me, especially when my hair gets extremely dry over the winter.</li>
            <li> As we all know blonde and pool water don&#x27;t mix my hair came out looking like a dry poodle, after using this conditioner</li>
            <li> I look forward to the next time I blow dry my hair out and see what it looks like.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my dry fragile hair</li>
            <li> I have really dry frizzy hair and this definitely helps.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I had been suffering from extremely dry hair for the last 2 years before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every time I condition because I have such dry hair.</li>
            <li> my ends felt moisturized and definitely weren&#x27;t as frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> my ends felt moisturized and definitely weren&#x27;t as frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely dry prior to using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> do not use a hair dryer or blow dryer; I simply braid or twist up my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Brought my absolutely dry and brittle hair back to life!  </li>
            <li> Helped soften up my suddenly dry hair after the second use.</li>
            <li> My color treated hair gets silky then the next day feels dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it next week and blow dry my hair this time.</li>
            <li> This and regular environmental causes leave my hair dry, brittle and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I opened it and used it as soon as it arrived (which was actually 1 day earlier than the expected delivery date).</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and my hair is soft, shiny, and not as coarse if I didn&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried combing it through my entire damp head of hair, wrapping the gooey mess of hair up in a clip atop my head, totally rocking the Jimmy Neutron soft-serve icecream curl for several hours while I did chores before finally rinsing it.</li>
            <li> You will feel and see the different in one single application.  </li>
            <li> , however I actually use this every single day as my conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous to using this conditioner, as I initially said my hair was pretty dried out and dead.</li>
            <li> It has become fairly dry and damaged - too much heat styling over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels extremely dry after I use it, even when I leave it in for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, dry, damaged, and curly, so I use &amp;#34;hair mask&amp;#34; type products as a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was always using other conditioners before, but this really seems to make my hair less dry</li>
            <li> Usually such deep conditioners make my hair limp and lifeless, but this actually had the opposite effect.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have curly, long hair and use a straightening iron which is so bad for the hair!</li>
            <li> Mixing a small amount of this with the first and/or 2nd stage of the conditioning wash makes a noticeable difference with less dryness.</li>
            <li> I had highlighted and colored my hair 4 days ago-2 chemical processes that left my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair since I was 18, and as such is tends to be very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry after being colored, but using this mask in place of my regular conditioner has made a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> but I do also use it as a regular conditioner (my hair is very dry)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, scalp protecting oils but still makes it crazy clean.</li>
            <li> I blow it dry, I flat iron it</li>
            <li> I tried to use different conditioners to improve it and the results ware very limited.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly if you have thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and normally have a hard time with tangles.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular,  nothing bad.</li>
            <li> After having my first child, my hair (which is long, and used to be a lot thicker) has been falling out like crazy AND it has felt very dry/hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t lift enough to tone, so I ended up dying it back to dark brown.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is near the bottom, which means there is only a small amount included in the product.  </li>
            <li> I have colored, long and wavy hair..</li>
            <li> Tried leaving some in, and while it did hydrate my hair a bit, not more so than when i use normal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I am a guy with long hair.</li>
            <li> -- I plan to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any long term effects after using it 3x week for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> After just one use my hair looked healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> I plan to repurchase this as long as I keep getting the results I want.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I have long hair and so do my kids.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and voluminous for a few days after use.</li>
            <li> I blow dried and was amazed at how soft and manageable my hair was.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to leave it on my hair for so long.</li>
            <li> But, as mentioned above, fancier fatty alcohols, such as cetyl alcohol are not drying; instead, they are actually conditioning to hair and</li>
            <li> The stuff goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> &gt; When I bought this product earlier, there was a gab in the cream, showing the bottom being empty.</li>
            <li> no need to leave it on longer than a few minutes and no cap needed...perfect for a busy mom like me.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a product that didn&#x27;t take quite as long to &amp;#34;cure,&amp;#34; so to speak.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I had expected the need to use the oil after each shampoo but not so.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and want to keep growing it</li>
            <li> I air dried and put no additional product in just to see how my hair would naturally look with just this change alone.</li>
            <li> After the long winter, my hair got so damaged like never before.</li>
            <li> I would continue to use the product to see any long term effects.</li>
            <li> It also lasts long.</li>
            <li> When it dried it was shiny, soft, manageable, bouncy, etc.</li>
            <li> Combing my hair was a 30 minute long ordeal.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for as long as you can.</li>
            <li> I have really long,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to leave it in that long</li>
            <li> I use it once a week when I take a long bath.</li>
            <li> every day, sometimes I can leave it on for as long as they recommend (10 mins)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if it was just a one-off strange case or if it was the product, but none-the-less, I regret paying the price I did for it.</li>
            <li> Her hair is medium, long and normal-oily.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and the jar lasts me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TINTED LONG HAIR .</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because I’d tried so many different products and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li> She has really thick straight hair that has been damaged by ironing and blow drying..</li>
            <li> The mask itself is thick and you don&#x27;t need much to fully saturate your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair a lot in the last year (brown to blonde to blonder to red) and now it&#x27;s a little dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> and then when my hair starts really frizzing and look dull and damaged - in the summer from the chlorine and in the winter from the dry air</li>
            <li> I am an African American 29 year old woman with dry, thick, at times brittle hair.</li>
            <li> As usual, I pat-dried my hair with a soft towel, brushed it, and let it dry before checking how</li>
            <li> my hair was dry , brittle and looked  really bad, after using this amazing mask</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair ( I went from black to blonde) and basically destroyed it in the process.</li>
            <li> Once I washed it out and towel dried it, I almost didn&#x27;t want to blow dry it because there were no tangles and my hair felt soft.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a different brand of conditioner containing it and had a similar experience.</li>
            <li> My hair is INSANELY dry and the dead ends have gone to epic extremes, so my hair needed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is INSANELY dry and the dead ends have gone to epic extremes, so my hair needed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, if I was my hair today and use it, and don&#x27;t use it next week, it&#x27;s not like my hair will still be shiny and sleek because it was actually repaired from the previous week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m going to have to cut my hair because I am just killing my ends… this hair, along with cutting back on my flat iron, has genuinely saved my hair.</li>
            <li> This made my hair incredibly soft, and a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> love the protection from harsh winter on my thick hair!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it really deep conditions at all, and the minimal results go away after a single wash.</li>
            <li> The price was unbeatable compared to similar products and a little goes a long way, so I can see this lasting me a long time.</li>
            <li> I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this is seriously a miracle worker for my hair!  </li>
            <li> I have long waist line length hair which is wavy, dry, frizzy and damage hair</li>
            <li> I have been battling with dry hair for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I had recently lighten my hair from virgin black to blonde, so with that comes dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and while it may be hard to find time for a long shower with a new baby, this gives me the feeling of a little &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; visit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left it on for as little as three minutes and as long as ten.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, chemically treated hair and have a hard time finding anything I really like.</li>
            <li> After being (an idiot) adventurous, I went from blonde to brown and back to blonde.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair bleached for the ombre look and although my hair stylist was careful not to fry my hair, it was very dry after.</li>
            <li> I usually keep it on for 45 minutes and my hair has never been this soft!</li>
            <li> Will go back to my other brand</li>
            <li> For those who bleach or due their hair often, I definitely recommend you buy this!</li>
            <li> It works like any other argan oil deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was skeptical because for the past 6 months I have been trying many different conditioners</li>
            <li> The only other one I have used is the Organix line hair mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other masks and had hopes for help that have later been unfulfilled.</li>
            <li> Cetearyl alcohol in combination with other ingredients in the formula (such as triethanolamine and stearic acid) forms an emulsion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After purchasing, I received several follow up emails from Arvazallia, who appear to be extremely invested in the satisfaction of their customers.</li>
            <li> The treatment only takes 5 minutes, however, due to how damaged my hair is, I did my treatments: 30 minutes, overnight, 30 minutes, overnight.</li>
            <li> actually I used it as conditioner every other day.</li>
            <li> Be sure to try ALL of their products, you will NOT be sorry!</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner, once a week, and add a little extra Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it 2 of 3 times a week and leave it on as long as I can!</li>
            <li> This has replaced my other deep conditioners as they don&#x27;t even come close to accomplishing what this one did for me.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other hair mask in the future.</li>
            <li> My very thick, coarse hair responded really well</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my hair is so soft, shiny, split ends are far less noticeable, and hardly any tangles.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and tons of it.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a very long time (hopefully!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this product makes brushing an ease...</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t leave it on very long because I had company coming</li>
            <li> I also got the argan oil because my hair is so dry and that combined with this is just...</li>
            <li> I moved to idaho and my hair has been so dry.</li>
            <li> the product helped with my dry, brittle hair after a bleaching/coloring.  </li>
            <li> We have a pool so before I started using this product, my hair was extrememy dry and damaged from the chlorine and sun.</li>
            <li> The argan oil also works well if you want to add shine and softness to dry hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or frizzy hair</li>
            <li> my hair was dry ad breaking</li>
            <li> I will blow dry and straighten my hair maybe once each every 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> I have had issues with my hair being severely dry for a couple of years now....</li>

            <li> It is oily at the roots and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> Feels dry, but isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I use about every 4 days (shampoo, dry hair, apply hair mask and leave on for 30 min).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has dry hair on needs a moisture treatment.</li>
            <li> if I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if I have any results in my dry, color treated, brittle hair.</li>

            <li> However, if you have dry splits, this might not be the answer -</li>
            <li> It says to leave it in your hair for 5-7 mins but since my hair can get really dry since it is kinda damaged, i like to leave it in for longer like 15</li>
            <li> When I rinse and dry after that</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have time to dry it.  </li>
            <li> I TAKE IT OFF AN BLOW DRY .</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and issues with breakage.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair from coloring it all the time</li>
            <li> I use it as regular conditioner and leave it in a few extra minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different conditioning products that really did nothing for me or just made my hair worse.</li>
            <li> I use this Argan Oil Hair Mask a few times a week, while using the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand daily.</li>
            <li> It dried and was soft and absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse frizzy hair and this makes it soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> had virgin straight, thick, black asian hair once...</li>
            <li> have thick, naturally wavy hair that has been a nightmare my entire life.</li>
            <li> This DC is extremely thick &amp; provides decent slip while rinsing.</li>
            <li> Its kind of annoying to wash my hair, apply the conditioner, and then leave it in and wash it out 5 minutes later.</li>
            <li> I hate them though, so, as much as my hair might enjoy that, I always feel like a poodle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for a long time yet, so it remains to be seen how it holds up several months down the road.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have very thick, wavy, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been very dry lately, and I desperately needed a good mask.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting really dry for the first time in my life, and I think I made it worse by obsessing over it.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dries, it’s not dry and fragile as usual, but keep in mind, I do use a leave-in moisturizer as well (by another brand).</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, curly hair, and I am thrilled to have finally found a product that works to tame crazy curls and eliminate frizzy bad-hair days!  </li>
            <li> Normally I would use my denman brush, but my hair was damaged recently via bad stylist who appeared to have highlighted for the first time EVER.</li>
            <li> For me thats not realistic because I like to leave this in for an hour and blow dry before rinse.</li>
            <li> I have seen no difference between this mask and the average off-the-shelf daily</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and usually takes an hour to brush it out after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I just have minimal hair and it becomes coarse due to sun damage and ponytails.</li>
            <li> Thickening and soft , with small amounts .</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try this product; however, it as a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed by the reviews.</li>
            <li> This product, on first use, softened the broken ends and seemed to retexturize my hair.</li>
            <li> have very long blonde hair and found a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have since achieved the same result without the buildup by using raw coconut oil--which I can get for the same price.</li>
            <li> In the last few months my hair had become very dry and brittle from coloring and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely trying their other products!</li>
            <li> I received this hair mask a month ago in mid july and was so frustrated because I had high hopes for this product since the reviews were so positive.</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely coarse and dry due to extreme process.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry for the past 6 months and the only thing that seemed to help was deep treatments at the salon.</li>
            <li> and it not only makes my hair incredibly soft, but there is minimal frizz left behind.</li>
            <li> but once you use another product the effect doesnt remain what I mean is using your normal conditioner, but</li>
            <li> My long blonde hair absorbs the oil, but does NOT weigh it down at all!</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy or drastic, but the ends of my hair are becoming wispy and dry and on bad days, straw-like, and over all my hair is a bit more frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Made my dry hair come to life again!</li>
            <li> It was dry, brittle, and nothing kept it from being frizzy until now!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Moroccanoil line deep conditioning treatment, but it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a 56-year-old black female who used to have curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It was featured as a related product to a brand I previously used, and I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a couple months and still have over half the tub left, and my hair is about to my waist.</li>
            <li> I went from black hair to red and back to black</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a different hair mask,</li>
            <li> then I started to notice my ends of my hair were getting dry and rough.</li>
            <li> My hair is 3 feet long and silver/white (natural) - lately, it&#x27;s been snapping off at the slightest provocation.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long, silky hair naturally...</li>
            <li> My hair is basically all white under my jet black hair color</li>
            <li> To try and fix the dryness I did a few long treatments of this mask following the directions over the course of one day.</li>
            <li> I was super sad as my hair resembled a stack of hay if I may say..</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t do that on a day that you need to style your hair though because mine was too soft and slightly weighed down because of the heavy conditioning to stay curled or in specific style).  </li>
            <li> By the end of the week I can feel that it&#x27;s time to go through another treatment as my hair starts to go a little coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> the ends of my hair are very dry-</li>
            <li> My hair is processed and between chemical overload and the FL sun very dry.</li>
            <li> were very dry or</li>
            <li> very, very dry w/summer/heat, etc...</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and brittle after a chemical treatment.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and breaking off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry.</li>
            <li> Have very dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to get very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally very very dry brittle hair</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that started looking very dry after this winter.</li>
            <li> It is color-treated and it has a tendency to get very dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t see any different in my hair, i think it made my hair even more dry, i can&#x27;t even return this product, very unhappy with this.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle as it once did, I can&#x27;t tell if it has helped my split ends yet but at least it feels completely soft!</li>
            <li> Left my hair in a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> used this product a few times and have seen NO improvement&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am 62 and know that your hair changes over time, it is color treated, and very coarse and dry......</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with the middle and ends of my hair getting dry and breaking.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, thick, and dry hair that tends to break off at the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the army, and every day I have to put my hair in a tight slicked back sock bun.</li>
            <li> this once has seemed to revert all of the damaged hair caused by tight buns and field exercises and dollar tree shampoo back into silky civilian majestic unicorn hair</li>
            <li> I also use a little oil on the really dry areas before I flat iron.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little intense for me, but after rinsing out, hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I only use a little on the ends.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were a little cheaper, but for what it does I&#x27;ll pay $16.</li>
            <li> so hopefully the one I order today will last a little</li>
            <li> I do leave it on a lot longer than recommended in the instructions though, as a little extra treat for my hair once a week.</li>
            <li> If I use it every day my hair starts to feel a little oily, but I am extra prone to an oily scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I can even smell it a little after I&#x27;ve washed my hair the next time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about it, once my hair started drying, it was frizzy (my hair is normally NOT frizzy)!</li>
            <li> The product is very thick, so it seems to really coat your hair evenly.</li>
            <li> I did a search for extreme dry hair conditioner and this product came up.</li>
            <li> My hair was really dry due to self-coloring that I did with the store bought coloring products.</li>
            <li> I use it every other wash to hydrate my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have extreme dry hair.  </li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s dry, I straighten so it&#x27;s damaged, and its brittle due to both.</li>
            <li> The way I used it I just applied it on my bottom half of hair (never apply hair masks and conditioners on scalp because it has no effect other than making it oily) and left it in for about 15 minutes before washing it off.</li>
            <li> The way I used it I just applied it on my bottom half of hair (never apply hair masks and conditioners on scalp because it has no effect other than making it oily) and left it in for about 15 minutes before washing it off.</li>
            <li> only problem is, I think my hair is too damaged that when I don&#x27;t use the product, it comes back to its damaged and dull look.</li>
            <li> (Which can be bad if you need it to have more stiffness)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the perfumy smell, but it goes away after I style my hair with my regular hair product.</li>
            <li> have followed the on-line instructions which state that this should be combed through the hair (rather than just applied) and stay on for at least 6 minutes; I leave it on for nearly 20.  </li>
            <li> This product has helped so much in restoring moisture to my poor hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only a few times</li>
            <li> I did this mask and left it on a few hours.</li>
            <li> HAIR IS SO WET</li>
            <li> I really do not leave the house without applying this .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why such a fuss around the mask, it does not do any miracles if you fluffy and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that in the month that I&#x27;ve been using it (twice a week, roughly), my hair has gotten noticeably softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair that is heavily processed</li>
            <li> the product was what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so we&#x27;ll see if it stands the test of time.</li>
            <li> It still feels like straw when I wet my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly, crazy hair that needs something to nourish and love it so that it will behave and this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> I regret spending my money I spent on this jar.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful to rinse it thoroughly or it&#x27;ll leave some build-up.  </li>
            <li> Organic Ingredients than expected</li>
            <li> i was on amazon not really looking for something to fix it ...</li>
            <li> I was rushing to a friend&#x27;s with wet hair.</li>
            <li> used it only once few days ago .</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with lots of deep conditioning without the heavy oiliness.</li>
            <li> In the summer it&#x27;s even worse because I&#x27;m in the pool every day and the chlorine really takes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews here saying the product left their hair greasy or it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner once, there were minimal fly-away pieces and straightening with an iron was a cinch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is thick and my hair felt soft while it was on my hair.</li>
            <li> It made my color treated (not to mention thick &amp; course) hair soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s makes my hair thick curly hair soft as silk.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt softer when it was wet as I was brushing it, but after my hair dried it kinda felt the same.</li>
            <li> After searching long and hard for a product to repair my dry, brittle, over-processed hair, I finally found it!</li>
            <li> I bleached my poor LONG hair to death and bought this to use in preparation- using coconut oil pre-bleach, and this after, my hair is crazy soft and surprisingly strong.</li>
            <li> No longer dry and stringy!!</li>
            <li> I know that may sound weird but usually after it is washed, my hair is still dry feeling and within a day or two it begins to feel oily.</li>
            <li> this hair mask mad a BIG difference in how soft, shiny, manageable and how my hair actually set with my short hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to find a product that works to help with a recent bout of dry hair that was not responding to my usual moisturizing conditioners.</li>
            <li> I know that flat irons and curling irons are hard on your hair when used often, but they seemed to be the only option to help manage my hair.</li>
            <li> I mean WOW.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft it&#x27;s unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I was always confused about what to do with my hair, mainly because It used to be very dry at the end, but somehow greasy in the roots.</li>
            <li> I color my hair dark with highlights, and after switching back and forth from brown and blonde for a few years it was very damaged on the ends and had a weird straw like texture.</li>
            <li> My hair are black, straight, thin and started to become dry.</li>
            <li> I also use the Argan Oil, which has made a big difference in softening my wavy frizzy hair which is always a challenge to tame.  </li>
            <li> I use a flat iron almost everyday so this conditioner has been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> For the price I would have expected it to be extremely moisturizing</li>
            <li> I apply it on my entire head and wrap my hair in a towel and in the morning wash as usual and reapply on the ends and it has brought my &amp;#34;damaged hair&amp;#34; back from the dead.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair, put the mask in my whole head, massage a little bit and put a plastic bag or a heat retainer hat and leave it there for al least half an hour while I&#x27;m doing stuff around the house.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable that this conditioner dries my hair, or at least provides very little moisture.</li>
            <li> Total luxury minus usual $$.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s slightly damaged and I have dry ends.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and find it hard to tame my hair as I get older due to aging hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> bought again and lasts a while a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but honestly, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That being said, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> A little of each thing goes a long way I believe.</li>
            <li> Even though it is not specific for hard water, it helps to untangle my snarls from the water and my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair, so I tend to deep condition it</li>
            <li> Additionally, I loose less hair when combing and brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to turn my dry, thick hair into a silky mane, and I finally found it.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry, naturally, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely tight dry curls.</li>
            <li> I recently had the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; and cut off 6 inches of my frizzy and dry hair so that I could begin the long process of healing and bringing life back into my sad frazzled strands.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try their other products, like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Now I can wash my hair every other day because it locks the water inside my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The price is unreal because you need to use such a small amount that it lasts for months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s course due to dying and bleaching.</li>
            <li> Other Argan oil products have not worked well for my hair type either</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products in this line.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because my hair is so damaged</li>
            <li> usually I have massive tangles.</li>
            <li> My curls usually soak up product, and one pot of this will last me 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried  other hair masks</li>
            <li> I only had to use a small amount because of the thickness of the product.</li>
            <li> I will soon be looking into other products that Arvazallia has.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It does not make it shiny or silky like when I use other masks.</li>
            <li> Last summer I made the mistake of getting lazy and letting my salon tone my hair after I had already bleached it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to explain that, other than it felt like a copy-cat of another product.</li>
            <li> (I recommend using it like every other wash).</li>
            <li> other hairstylists going to town with the razor and etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> go do your other things...shaving, etc ...</li>
            <li> I got this product based on reviews of other customers.</li>
            <li> my ends were extremely dry/split as well as my scalp.</li>
            <li> It advises using the mask 1-2 times a week, however I doubled it due to the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $$$ of dollars trying to find a product that delivers!  </li>
            <li> The mask may go a little quicker than the oil, only because so little oil is needed for the hair</li>
            <li> I use this along with other products.</li>
            <li> hair has always been thick, frizzy, and generally poofy</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 30 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li> My first application I was hoping for just a mediocre amount of moisture</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely oil....</li>
            <li> I will order other hair products from this line as I run out.</li>
            <li> Macadamia oil on the other hand helps to prevent against hair breakage by penetrating the scalp and hair follicles to improve hair strength and</li>
            <li> usually use this once or twice a month in place of the regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will definately purchase again and look forward to trying other products by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li> Although I think I&#x27;ve tried all the other ones out there already.</li>
            <li> other thing is it attracts dirt</li>
            <li> I have hair damage from extreme coloring (blond).</li>
            <li> product makes my other conditioners obsolete.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have relaxed hair which is extremely damaged</li>
            <li> she had been having some problems with her here due to illness and the product worked</li>
            <li> Now, I only use a small hair clip, the length of my index finger, to put it up.  </li>
            <li> It is just like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference from other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put any other styling products on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this and trying there other products too.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that breaks easily and shows every bad thing that has ever happened to it, which has made it difficult in the past to find hydrating products that don&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown almost black and have been bleaching it blond for the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li> WOULD WORK EVEN A LITTLE FOR MY DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I always add a little argan oil afterwards before I blow dry it</li>
            <li> I can manage to blow dry, yet not be weighed down by the obscenities I did to it previously.</li>
            <li> It even has a shine before it looked dead and dry.</li>
            <li> After my hair dries it just feels bland, but not very moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and the curl pattern was less defined as a result of less moisture.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it a few times a month to keep my dry ends up to shape.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I noticed that my ends were almost permanently dry when this was not the case before.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and damage and this product helped a little.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, dry, curly hair...</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that I normally tame with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but I have no problem rating things down when they don&#x27;t perform which you can tell in some of my other reviews.</li>
            <li> So it becomes dry and stiff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for a few years now, lately been going the blond way and as a result my hair has been very dry and normal on the stand hair products just made the situation worst, so started to look for other solution, came across a few reviews that praised the quality and effective result, ordered and arrived just on time.</li>
            <li> At first upon reading the directions for this mask I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Living in humid Texas, it&#x27;s hard to keep my hair from going frizz central.</li>
            <li> But the abuse I gave it in my younger years (relaxers, dyes, and blow drying) had caused my hair to look and feel like straw, dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> But, for whatever reason, when short my salt and pepper hair is wiry and dull.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to everyone who have dull and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with conditioners is either my hair still feels dry and frizzy, or they tame down the frizz and dryness</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive conditioners, but after using it, it made my hair really frizzy.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been trying different oils and conditioners on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It actually works on delicate curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> Since I ordered the product, I have received at least 3 emails soliciting feedback, which I don&#x27;t mind, but somehow I was data-mined such that they found my home phone number (not in my amazon profile) and called me at home.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the risk.  </li>
            <li> It honestly is not worth the money</li>
            <li> My only complaint with the coconut oil was that I have to leave it in my hair 45 minutes before showering.  </li>
            <li> all dark</li>
            <li> I did not expect much and extremely skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Probably not worth the price</li>
            <li> Much like all of you, I was skeptical about trying these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a product junkie and switch brands often, but I&#x27;m sticking with Arvazallia Hydrating Argan Oil Mask (and the hair treatment) for a long while.  </li>
            <li> I put it in while showering and wrap my hair into a turbie twisty, shave my legs and that fun stuff, then rinse it out with cold water.</li>
            <li> Average results.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife and daughters they love the crap out of it.</li>
            <li> Last long because it is thick and you just need to use a small amount to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I also tired &amp;#34;HSI PROFESSIONAL Hydrating smoothing Anti-Frizz Hair Mask with Argan Oil,&amp;#34; but it did not help my frizz hair.</li>
            <li> When I wear wet and curly I put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair - so I feel like my hair can never get enough moisture.</li>
            <li> I have thin, but naturally curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I find the smell a little bit strong for my taste tho, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, so its not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> you definitely want to use it when your hair feels dry and tired.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write negative reviews, but this product was just a big no for me</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it looking greasy at all.</li>
            <li> And this mask you can apply it on your scalp and comb all the way down to your roots.</li>
            <li> It did not weigh down my hair with an oily feel.</li>
            <li> Gives my frizzy hair smoothness without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> but it does not weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> This product gave it some moisture and tamed it down.</li>
            <li> if you purchase this you wont be let down.</li>
            <li> It smooths and keeps frizz down</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair weighed down.  </li>
            <li> In the morning when I let down my hair</li>
            <li> my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Softened my hair and also made it shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It also defines my curls without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I think it must weigh it down or something.</li>
            <li> And I Plan On Buying Other Products From The Brand !</li>
            <li> I have no need for any other conditioner!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even use a small portion before I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually oily but it&#x27;s been dry from coloring.  </li>
            <li> She has very very dry, course thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding conditioners and hair products that tame frizz but don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair was softer, smoother, and much less brittle.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark, thick, course, slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> After one use, my hair was softer, shinier, and less frizzy...</li>
            <li> I also bought the oil, and I apply that after slightly towel drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Less frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is about half way, and looks used.  </li>
            <li> I had  used previously &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Less frizz</li>
            <li> This hair mask provides instant results, seriously.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t bother trying to comb thru it for fear of losing half my hair, but rather applied some Hydrating Argan Oil Mask in the shower and</li>
            <li> My hair  is visibly less frizzy, and feels lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> Item came with less product than I thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the jar lasted me 3-4 treatments, so about a month to a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Baby soft (ESPECIALLY the ends, which is crazy).</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in the softness of my hair after use and less frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had black hair</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It, which I  do about half the time</li>
            <li> It contains Methylisothiazolineone and EDTA both of which have been the subject of studies raising health concerns.  </li>
            <li> Once a week I put this on with a plastic bag, slightly heat it, leave on 5 minutes and my hair feels like I had a salon treatment.  </li>
            <li> and i previous had thinning hair in the front</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Kerastase Mask</li>
            <li> I do find it to be less creamy</li>
            <li> Less Hair fall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fairly critical of hair products, but the only criticism of this is that it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I typically have to put some sort of detangler on my hair to comb it out before styling, and I don&#x27;t have to do that with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even if I go out in a humid day, if I have used this in the morning or the night before my hair will be much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have started using this after each shampoo on the lower half of my hair, keeping in in my hair for 3-5 minutes before rinsing it out.  </li>
            <li> Much less frizz now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price.  </li>
            <li> I have tried countless other products to try and tame my hair, from crazy expensive high end to products offered in hair salons and thus far, this mask blows all the others away.</li>
            <li> I got course long hair, you can guess how it&#x27;s hard to manage, well, since I started using this mask</li>
            <li> I even use just a little bit every day and don&#x27;t rinse it out and my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
            <li> It helps restore moisture to my hair as it has been particularly dry and frizzy during the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> here they showing  two creams, like two products, but actually is only one and the name of the mask is Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask AND Deep Conditioner , l think is too bad to put 2 products in the foto if u are selling 1 only.</li>
            <li> Double processing is not good for the hair but this conditioner seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> so it is a mess without this stuff-</li>
            <li> did not full feel the expectations. ..</li>
            <li> The product is made in China and not a true Argon product  with the kernel oil being four up from the bottom of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> When I got home my hair was a mess - it was almost in dreads because the store-bought conditioners were waxy and wouldn&#x27;t penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li> Almost empty and there&#x27;s no notable difference to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long and thick hair (longer than kardashians</li>
            <li> Besides, I hate not being able to trust reviews because of all the corporate ass-kissing that goes on behind that practice.</li>
            <li> I tried clarifying and applying, as a rinse out conditioner, as a deep conditioner, as instructed and a couple other ways, but in the end my hair was not happy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and often notice wirey strands sticking out after blowdrying.</li>
            <li> Just wish it cost a little less.</li>
            <li> It might take a little getting used to it because it doesn’t bubble up like typical shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I no longer use a bunch of hair masks, hair serums, styling creams, or end up having my hair up in a tight pony tail / bun.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry and dull for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> and it became dry, frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li> This mask cream is thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t live up to hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when I try a new product, this has proven all that it claimed to do, I wish I had known about this sooner.  </li>
            <li> my case, I got bored of my long curly hair and started experimenting doing different things.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less frizzy when air dried.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thick hair that is always dry</li>
            <li> It is not super heavy.  </li>
            <li> Works well for my thick, wavy, rather dry hair.  </li>
            <li> But everyday I do, my hair feels smoother, silky, and less brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, color-treated, and I flat iron and blow-dry my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have thick virgin hair and purchased this because it was a little dry.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try because of those crazy positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I still use a little oil for protection from the blow dryer and straightener if I decide to use it.</li>
            <li> I just use a little bit of product twice a week.</li>
            <li> One concern would be the cost of this product, it&#x27;s a little pricey if you want to keep it in your beauty arsenal all the time.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened it, I saw how little product there was.</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job by leaving us with little to no tangle and our hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> It smells like chemicals, gives my scalp a burning sensation, and is no better than any other (cheaper) conditioner I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> me tell you a little thing or two about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> how well it worked with one little use.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried other argan products in the past (will review them eventually as well)</li>
            <li> I put a little bit on my ends before putting on my hair gel.</li>
            <li> For the uninformed, if you want to know how corporations work against us, google &#x27;Monsanto&#x27; for a little enlightenment.)  </li>
            <li> but I also use a little bit as a conditioner when I shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will give you results after the first use, you can&#x27;t go wrong trying this!</li>
            <li> This is a little hair miracle.</li>
            <li> This stuff has little argan oil in it and just coats your hair.  </li>
            <li> So this product HYDRATED the crap out of both my natural new growth and my relaxed ends.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that typically looks dull.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick Asian hair and this product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth without nasty residue!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be confused though this is only one container of product and is not full to the brim.</li>
            <li> My hair is in the worst shape it&#x27;s been in after being blonde, going black, adding red, and now trying to get back to blonde.  </li>
            <li> too heavy for fine hair and hate the smell</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair that has been damaged over time from dyes and highlights.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that I just recently highlighted.  </li>
            <li> My hair was badly damaged from a year&#x27;s worth of mistreatment.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in amazing shape regardless of how horrible I treat it ---like sunburning it, blow drying etc etc.....</li>
            <li> My only disappointment, is that the mask doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> I have really fine/dry hair that gets tangled like crazy no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> She often has trouble with tangles and dryness on</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even look heavy and greasy</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair limp either.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical but after the first time I used it,  I knew this was my hair rescuer.  </li>
            <li> Any heavy conditioners/masks I used</li>
            <li> At first, I was VERY skeptical of buying this because I had never heard of the brand before.</li>
            <li> &gt; The seller sent me an email with additional tips on how to use the product, i.e. leave in longer for deeper condition or add a few drops of their Argan oil to the mask for a boost.</li>
            <li> but it is not available.</li>
            <li> harsh treatment</li>
            <li> too heavy for my medium-thick, wavy, mid-back-length hair</li>
            <li> I section my hair, slather it on, and let it sit for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve used it my hair has been softer but no noticeable difference yet in improvement</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> After a few times of use, the effects wore off and I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Heavily perfumed lotion.</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> it actually felt worse.</li>
            <li> So I bleached it a few time, one after another.</li>
            <li> It is a mixture of fatty alcohols.</li>
            <li> These were then hydrogenated to form fatty alcohols.</li>
            <li> I also use Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia on towel dried hair after shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li> A few months&#x27; ago, I started using coconut oil as a hair mask once per week.  </li>
            <li> I wash it everyday, I use heat on it everyday.</li>
            <li> If anything felt like it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> leave my hair feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged ( poor coloring job - outside in Az sun &amp; swimming)  </li>
            <li> The pump on my oil didn&#x27;t work after a few uses</li>
            <li> This conditioner gives it gloss without making it heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I stopped processing my hair a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes my hair all day, and it still keeps the hydrating a few days after I used it.</li>
            <li> Is heavy conditioner so don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> You can use it as a mask or even as an everyday conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair, towel dried it, applied the conditioner, and let it sit for one hour under a plastic cap.</li>
            <li> The company recommends leaving it on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I JUST WASTED $17 ON A PRODUCT I WAS HOPING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair went from feeling like dried up straw to feeling like a newborn kitten.</li>
            <li> I dont use it everyday though...</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so heavy that it will knock you over.  </li>
            <li> It gets so brittle and damaged (especially because it is on the thin side).</li>
            <li> It is heavily perfumed, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as my everyday.</li>
            <li> withholding a few stars as the hydrating mask  does have a cloying perfume scent.  </li>
            <li> so processing it only made it worse.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that dried up colored look anymore.  </li>
            <li> I also have been experiencing some trouble with hair loss.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try a shower hair mask a few times a week, so I did some research and found</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m bummed that I feel like I wasted $15 (I&#x27;m not going to return it</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dried</li>
            <li> I towel dried and applied for an hour then</li>
            <li> My hair was dried out from the flat-iron.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a improvements with dead ends .</li>
            <li> but once you have it all worked though, you might notice a heavy feeling since your hair is going to be collecting the hydration.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve used quite a few</li>
            <li> I use this mask few times a week</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it until 2 weeks in, but this stuff has really dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a few minutes and rinsed.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times now.</li>
            <li> Nothing heavy left behind.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with really dry, brittle and not very good looking hair until I tried this Hair Mask from Arvazallia!</li>
            <li> While it is recommended to be used less often I have used it as a conditioner by leaving it in my hair for just 2 - 3 minutes after washing my hair everyday in the past week.  </li>
            <li> also noticed that the past few times I&#x27;ve used the Arvazallia mask I have less shedding/breakage than I did before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dry thin blond hair and this mask conditions and infuses my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair is feeling less like straw!  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less damaged!</li>
            <li> The only other thing that would work as well would be an expensive salon brazillian blowout.</li>
            <li> They are very smart ( in a bad way)  </li>
            <li> After using this product I rubbed the oil into my wet, thick, course and dried out hair and then styled as usual</li>
            <li> I have colored hair that is rather thin and flat.</li>
            <li> If you didn’t know then sulfates is what makes the shampoo turn into a thick lather in the shower and is also used in other household cleaning products.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t cause my hair to be stiff or course after the dye was rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> So....needless to say there&#x27;s been a lot of bleaching, coloring, cutting, hair damage from previously having to pull back my hair in a bun for 4 years in the military, enduring Texas heat,</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair</li>
            <li> Recently bleached my virgin hair after 18 years of refraining and was appalled by how it stole the lively feel from it.</li>
            <li> So last weekend, I really abused my hair like BAD !</li>
            <li> My hair has been through a lot over the past few years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve applied a small amount to my towel dried hair and didn&#x27;t rinse out</li>
            <li> that that&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair at all; thick dark relaxed hair (transitioning to natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had very long hair that was very thick but</li>
            <li> Despite it being thick, it also has a bit of a whipped consistancy, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little sad about probably getting &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to the smell like we humans typically do, because I have to sniff a little harder now.</li>
            <li> have very thick, colored, DRY hair</li>
            <li> Being as though my hair has been damaged from previous things used and hard wear and tear</li>
            <li> It seems like a small bottle yet it lasts a long time because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> Im just plain lazy.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that tends to dry out in the heat</li>
            <li> I merely used as I would any other conditioner, I.e., lather on wet hair, leave on 3 to 5 minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> My ends are smoothed and there&#x27;s very little frizz.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair when I washed but very little after using the Argan Oil Hair Mask twice.</li>
            <li> It is thick and shiny and I have little to no hair loss anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have heavily highlighted hair and it&#x27;s hard to keep it hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I was a little doubtful at first, but</li>
            <li> I usually keep it on for about 10 minutes then rinse.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair after using this for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> hair product, because I am not usually satisfied with them...</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I received a compliment as soon as I dried my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often skeptical when shampoos and such claim to work on all hair textures, but I believe it now.</li>
            <li> Been using this 1-2 times per week for the past 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its the product working</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been well past the recommended 7 minutes, closer to 10.</li>
            <li> I rinse it, then shampoo and condition as usual.</li>
            <li> But my product use is a fraction of what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the overpowering flowery smell</li>
            <li> Not sure why the instructions say use 1-2 times a week....</li>
            <li> but after it&#x27;s washed out, only a faint scent remains.</li>
            <li> my hair no longer look like someone killed it!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll be buying again though.</li>
            <li> Just started using, I usually buy</li>
            <li> so not really sure</li>
            <li> and I was not pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve probably earned some nasty comments regarding my opinions</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m not really sure, because I&#x27;ve been coloring it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I usually keep the mask on for about 15 minutes, with or without heat</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this hair mask.</li>
            <li> I have been bleaching and dying my hair often for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> as usual you amazon reviewers came though for me again...</li>
            <li> Smooths and defines with a small amount of product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the rave is about on this product.</li>
            <li> Some actually make my hair worse!  </li>
            <li> tub is SMALL.</li>
            <li> This time of year static is insane.</li>
            <li> It clings to your hair faintly the next day which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Usually hair mask smell like chemicals or treatments and that smell is just not pleasing for something you have to keep in your hair for a sustain amount of time.</li>
            <li> In the past, it was highlighted and I dyed over the highlights with permanent dye twice.</li>
            <li> Even with my thin hair, it did not leave it feeling heavy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I also sent it to my daughter who has very thick and extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I got a little aromatherapy while applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;The subtle fragrance is glorious.</li>
            <li> Esp with my frizzy dry hair from hard water!!</li>
            <li> I was sure that I&#x27;d end up with a crew cut after watching it go from bad to worse throughout the tough Michigan winter!</li>
            <li> I have long hair (almost to my butt) and was afraid I would have to use half the container</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, usually oily and brittle at the ends.</li>
            <li> If I have a complaint, it is the font of the directions is so small</li>
            <li> So I have found it difficult to maintain a straight/blow dry look without it getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have curly red hair and AWFUL water conditions where I live, so throwing in some of that Florida humidity</li>
            <li> i suppose, but it&#x27;s hardly some miracle product.</li>
            <li> I must say for the price though that this one will be hard to beat.</li>
            <li> and so has been hard to grow out because the ends keep splitting</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to style.  </li>
            <li> It is also hard to control my curl.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this at least four times a week.</li>
            <li> However, you must do as the director says, it need to stay in your hair at least 10 minute I think.</li>
            <li> Since used my hair has grown at least 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> It an essiential for my hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> After this momentary lapse in judgement to further make my follicles cry, I was in desperate need of repair.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is naturally a dirty, strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li> The smell is so awful it reminds me of the cheap aftershave that men used in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner at least twice a week and my hair did feel softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li> At least, it was.</li>
            <li> and I was running late.  </li>
            <li> my daughter and I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair length is about mid-back and fairly thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy frizzy hair and this helps add moisture.</li>
            <li> conditioner is thick.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly thick, even for a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, wavy hair, and this re-hydrated my hair and took away the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick curly hair with a lot of dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li> I do have thick hair, but not curly.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and has always been silky, but after dying it a couple of times it began to feel like straw.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick curly frizzy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I have course, thick hair and could tell a difference in smoothness and texture after one use.</li>
            <li> It is a thick consistency and mixes well with my &amp;#34;hi-pro-pac&amp;#34; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American woman with thick, curly hair that requires a lot of moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, thick and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick hair mask hair</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with thick unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that has been color treated and is feeling like straw and fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> This is really, really thick and luxurious...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not amazing.</li>
            <li> normal masks leave my hair so oily and nasty to where i have to use vinegar to actually tame it down this</li>
            <li> no more hard time for me !</li>
            <li> I am so mean to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair had been severely damaged due to (4) failed attempts to do an ombre color on my hair.</li>
            <li> After a few years of dying it blonde, the ends looked terrible and my hair felt very dry and fried.</li>
            <li> I also use a very small amount of Argan Oil before blow drying my hair which also helps the process.</li>
            <li> BUT it is a very small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to go from very dark brown to blonde, which is stupid to attempt at home, but I&#x27;m a bit too impulsive at times.</li>
            <li> Seriously buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously think hair</li>
            <li> However, I am seriously considering repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> I now use less of the post-shower oil, except on the vulnerable ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well for conditioning my dry and brittle hair but it stinks.</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial, and I have crazy, curly, colored, and dry at times hair.  </li>
            <li> I am deployed and the water was doing some serious work on my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Then I wash it out with cold water in the morning, blow dry it and then straighten it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, how have I not heard of this product before???  </li>
            <li> Seriously - where has this been all my life??</li>
            <li> The price is a little to expensive though</li>
            <li> I had my hair fried during a bad coloring process--which had to be corrected the same day.</li>
            <li> Kinda wished it smelled differently, not that it smells bad or anything.  </li>
            <li> The bad: It didn&#x27;t give me different hair</li>
            <li> Not a good conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d feel ugly if I left the house  without it.</li>
            <li> and I know thats not good for hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a few masks, but was not impressed until this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In between the heat and humidity of summer, it can be extremely difficult to tame.</li>
            <li> I have badly damaged hair, from years of bleaching, coloring,blow drying and ( ouch ) flat irons.</li>
            <li> I received the package, I was disappointed to see that the container was only about half-full.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with it, especially after reading all the hype about it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of conditioners, and some quite expensive over the past year</li>
            <li> This does not look like the hair of someone who&#x27;s been lying in bed like a dirty mop for half a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> After a few bad hair cuts, color and a relaxer(!!!), I have totally damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product along with the argan oil.</li>
            <li> I still have breakage but my poor hair is so brittle now.</li>
            <li> Had tangled unmanageable broken hair .. feels and looks healthier</li>
            <li> The hair oil and this hydrating mask work wonders for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been color treated for years, thin and always prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product now.</li>
            <li> but tired it anyway.</li>
            <li> It really helps with that nasty feeling you get from chlorine.</li>
            <li> made things worse.</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced that problem, even after leaving it in for hours.</li>
            <li> : It moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make my thin hair feel greasy or lose volume.</li>
            <li> Seriously !</li>
            <li> and I seriously saw results that had me hooked on this product!</li>
            <li> this stuff is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> This was seriously a miracle for my hair!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, if you have thick, long hair do not buy</li>
            <li> The bad: This smells like an old man&#x27;s aftershave and my co-workers kept saying I smelled like a man. :(</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is the packaging (kinda boring) and the scent (not really good).</li>
            <li> Not from color dying or anything (I&#x27;m a man FYI) but from using the wrong product accidentally.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time but sadly it was cracked from the bottom</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any weird chemical smell so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when reading the reviews</li>
            <li> I e-mailed customer service about this, asking if something was wrong with my order.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry if you try this for yourself.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> hey, we gotta be be wrong sometimes.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s downright creepy.  </li>
            <li> This is horrible, not only does it smell like men&#x27;s after shave</li>
            <li> I thinking is to expensive for the price.</li>
            <li> SO HELP what may I be doing wrong?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be unrealistic though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my waves lose all sense of shape without some holding product and my hair still got frizzy/poofy, but I wasn&#x27;t put off by this because that&#x27;s hoping for A LOT with my hair.</li>
            <li> I hate how pungent and long-lasting the smell is even after my hair dried.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try the Moroccanoil brand restorative hair mask, but it is SO expensive.</li>
            <li> Helped get my hair back after using that terrible Dr. Bronners peppermint soap on my hair!!</li>
            <li> And unfortunately for me</li>
            <li> unfortunately I was wrong.</li>
            <li> However, the quality of the product is not impressive.</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> gd, not perfect but</li>
            <li> Was I wrong...</li>
            <li> It felt like I had just conditioned my hair with my expensive salon conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I hate getting it trimmed when I start to get damage from brushing and everyday things like ponytails.</li>
            <li> Expensive conditioner with no benefit.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I think it&#x27;s got to go...</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I have to date returned several products that did not work or smelled awful.</li>
            <li> A bit on expensive side.</li>
            <li> It does not hydrate as well as it claims and the paste can be difficult to put on your hair.</li>
            <li> Which, at the end of the day when I take it down, leaves me with this awful broken half-fro with my ends snapping in half.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and terribly damaged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product was just another disappointment in dealing with my over processed hair.</li>
            <li> We were so close to cutting it off until I came across this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m desperate.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all seen stories about how China sneaks in cheaper or dangerous ingredients when no one knows.</li>
            <li> It was crazy.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s saving me money by extending the time between my expensive Brazilian keratin treatments!  </li>
            <li> a swimmer and chlorine water always gets into my Swim cap so it makes for a very sad situation for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive and I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li> Should have stuck with &amp;#34;Perfect 10.&amp;#34; This is not a good product, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and screw it impossible without hair spray.</li>
            <li> I can even wash and run, if I want to- which was impossible before using this product.  </li>
            <li> I damaged my hair really bad from bleaching it.</li>
            <li> and it was badly damaged from a bad chemical straightener.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim since the price wasn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times</li>
            <li> I had to cut out some bad habits I had with my hair and</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your hair reeking of an overpowering (bad) men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked effect of my hair after using the mask.</li>
            <li> i was completely shocked when i woke up this morning</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell terrible but not beautiful either.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that can handle all of your hair needs, then you should give this product a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my grandaughter was desperate to soften and relax her hair and this product saved the day!</li>
            <li> I was truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was initially disappointed with the size of the container for the price.  </li>

            <li> Stupid, I</li>
            <li> My locks looked awful and I was desperate.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t hate my hair, nor myself, so I&#x27;ve grown to accept these locks of tragedy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, I just haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all in my hair.</li>
            <li> But I hate it.  </li>
            <li> annoying smell</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> I relax my hair every six weeks and the damage can be really brutal.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband hated it.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed!  </li>
            <li> After having my hair chemically straightened, it was in horrible shape!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great, leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling amazing!  Loved the follow-up email from the company that wanted to make sure I was happy with their product!</li>
            <li> This mask works great! I use it on a weekly basis and it keeps my ends looking great. I usually keep it on for about 10 minutes then rinse. I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it looking greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I loved this mask. It makes my hair more shiny! And it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Its been helping with my course thick hair making it more manageable.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, it made a huge positive difference on my hair. I used to buy expensive conditioners, but after using it, it made my hair really frizzy. But this product is an absolute gem, it made my hair softer and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mask!!!  It made my hair very soft and easy to style. I think I&#x27;ll try their other products, like the shampoo and conditioner. I will be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner does great things for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly girl, somehere between a 3C-4A pattern, this stuff really softened my hair and defined my curls as well, i will be buying this again</li>
            <li> I was looking for hair masks on Amazon and came across this product #ByAccident I read all the raving reviews and decided to order it. I was amazed to see the results in first hair wash...then i received an email from the brand about &amp;#34;how to use this mask&amp;#34; #impressive and results were better after i followed their email instructions. Very happy..highly recommend! I have colored, long and wavy hair..</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It soften my hair and strength it at the same time. And this mask you can apply it on your scalp and comb all the way down to your roots. Now I can wash my hair every other day because it locks the water inside my hair. My hair has never been this healthy and shining! This big jar goes a long time !</li>
            <li> This hair mask leaves hair pretty soft, but it&#x27;s really only because it contains a silicone that coats the hair and makes it appear healthy. Silicones can actually lock out moisture and cause buildup. I really didn&#x27;t find it impressive and I won&#x27;t buy it again. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it really deep conditions at all, and the minimal results go away after a single wash.</li>
            <li> Just seemed like a somewhat greasier version of decent conditioner.  Tried leaving some in, and while it did hydrate my hair a bit, not more so than when i use normal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to give a full rinse out a shot next time to see if that makes any difference at all.  Worth a try i suppose, but it&#x27;s hardly some miracle product. They&#x27;ve just gone pretty heavy handed with their marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also support, originally 3/5 for product, but upped to 5/5 for awesome customer support.</li>
            <li> I like how this mask smells and works on my hair. After using this mask my hair is smoothy</li>
            <li> The product arrive on time &amp; I love it .&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair feel so soft and smell good. I would totally recommend anyone to get this product.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for restoring hair to a healthy soft texture! One use and my hair was much softer and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Arvazallia hair mask works wonders on my hair.  the ends of my hair are very dry- when i use the mask it calms the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;love the product!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair after using this for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this hair conditioner and it&#x27;s smell. I could see an improvement even after the first use.</li>
            <li> My favorite deep condition compare to other products .Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Review dated 11-11-2014. Zero stars. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Does not work. Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask is way better and available at most grocery stores.</li>
            <li> So far one of the best in leaving your hair soft , smooth. Product has a good fragrance and is thick and rich consistency. Yes I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> very good, it does better than any other I have used</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My hair smooth &amp; shine..</li>
            <li> Just dyed my hair and used this after and it helped so much. I haven&#x27;t seen my hair look this healthy in such a long time. Even getting out of the shower, I could tell that it looked healthier. I also got the argan oil because my hair is so dry and that combined with this is just...its a miracle haha. Like you have to buy this. It&#x27;s the real deal. I am sooo happy with this thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good product- smells wonderful and is very nourishing.</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair ( I went from black to blonde) and basically destroyed it in the process. I was looking for something that would help smooth it out and make it less frizzy. This absolutely did the job. It is AMAZING, and my hair looks really healthy again. It also smells wonderful. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky soft!!</li>
            <li> I have used higher end products ranging from 50-85 $ but this one gave me the best desirable results so far. The first time i used hydrating argan oil mask and deep conditioner my hair absorb it so quick with few amount it goes a long way. My hair is more softer,shinier and my black hair looked more natural and surprisingly i think its making my hair more dark. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> My favorite mask. Tempted to use it every day. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> 1st time noticed a difference</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I am addicted to this product along with the argan oil. Hair is soooo soft, shiny and very easy to comb thru. I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! This works better than It&#x27;s a 10 Hair Mask. Great price. Great texture afterwards. Leaves my hair light and soft and I just can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and coarse hair. Lately, I have been trying different oils and conditioners on my hair.  I did a search for extreme dry hair conditioner and this product came up. I put this on with a shower cap over night and my hair turned so soft with just one application.  I will definitely buy this again.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple of weeks, I have to say I love it. I moved to idaho and my hair has been so dry. And this is a wonder drug for my hair. I will be using this at least four times a week.</li>
            <li> Gave the same results as a salon treatment--unbelievably great shiny, smooth, healthy hair after just one use.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and left my hair soft and detangled on the first use. Will keep using to improve my hair, it was pretty damaged from color treatments.</li>
            <li> wonderful product it does what it says it does I use it twice a week and my hair is fantastic</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to turn my dry, thick hair into a silky mane, and I finally found it. Very pleased with this purchase, and the seller.  **update** it has been two weeks that I have been using this hair mask, and I have received compliments on a daily basis at how soft my hair looks now...I think I am a fan for Lyfe now!! 5/7/2015</li>
            <li> the product helped with my dry, brittle hair after a bleaching/coloring.  the follow up email from the company was also greatly appreciated  with the helpful hints.  thank you!</li>
            <li> This really works for me I use it once a week. I have fine hair and it naturally gives me more volume.</li>
            <li> i like this product leave my hair healthy and shiny and i am in love with the smell</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use the treatment and love the lasting shine, smoothness, and the beautiful smell it leaves on our hair. I have recommended this to my family and will soon recommend it to my friends as well. We are very satisfied customers:)</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I use it twice a week and each time it makes my hair incredibly smooth, frizz free and smells great. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My hair has been through a lot over the past few years. After my first use, I noticed an extreme difference! My hair was softer, smoother, and much less brittle. Will definitely buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product line, I&#x27;ve been buying it for months now. I had previously tried the Moroccanoil line deep conditioning treatment, but it did nothing for my hair. The Arvazallia deep conditioning mask produced incredible results for my bleached blonde/ over processed and coarse, thick hair type! The oil treatment is great for a finishing touch.</li>
            <li> Silky soft hair. Left it in for a good 20 minutes while soaking in the bath. Total luxury minus usual $$.</li>
            <li> It is good but regular use</li>
            <li> So great!!!  After having my hair chemically straightened, it was in horrible shape!!!  After a week of using the mask, it feels healthy, soft and manageable!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This revived my hair. I&#x27;m now using this as a daily treatment and never have I felt my hair to be this smooth and soft.  Saves me the money to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> My wife is Latina and has thick brown hair that is quite healthy! She wanted to try a product like this after her stylist recommended some and after seeing the results from what her stylist used. Being the ever so savvy shopper that I am, I located this and based on the great reviews gave it a shot. Wifey says this one is a keeper! ;-)</li>
            <li> This mask is everything !!! This product left my hair soft . I can comb  through with ease. This left my hair shiny  , moisturized . My hair had body &amp; movement . And I love how there products smell you need to try this &amp; there ultra curl defining cream &amp; hydrating argon oil hair mask .</li>
            <li> The smells is great! The mask is the better cream I bought since I arrived in the usa. My hair was so beautiful and curly,but now it was very damage and dry. I already bought others famous brands and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;This mak really reduce the frizz! Better than the ultra curly defining cream.&lt;br /&gt;O loved! And I will buy a lot of them, when I go back to my country.</li>
            <li> Works great on my color treated hair</li>
            <li> The product was half full no signs of leakage ripped off!  Want my money back or a full bottle of the thing</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair mask for my daughter who has long, straight hair down to her waist. She often has trouble with tangles and dryness on he ends. She said that this was the best hair mask ever and it left her hair soft for several days. I can&#x27;t wait to try it if she share with me!</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my hair smelling great and very soft!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Made my dry hair come to life again!</li>
            <li> one of the good hair masks</li>
            <li> After hearing so many positive reviews on this product, and to how all the dirty hippie blogs worship argan oil like the holy grail of luxurious locks, I have to say that I went into this purchase with extremely high hopes and was let down, to say the least. I have seen no difference between this mask and the average off-the-shelf daily conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experimented and tinkered with every last drop in the jar in different ways, and feel that I have given this product a more than fair chance to prove itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few tries, I wore it just for the duration of my shower, all through scrubbing, shaving, and so on, before rinsing it. Then, I tried combing it through my entire damp head of hair, wrapping the gooey mess of hair up in a clip atop my head, totally rocking the Jimmy Neutron soft-serve icecream curl for several hours while I did chores before finally rinsing it. I&#x27;d hoped that after several days off and weekends in a row that maybe my results would be cumulative, and that parading around in my undergarments with dairy queen dollar menu dessert for hair might be worth it someday, but I was eventually running out of mask and not seeing results. Finally, with the last bit left, I wrapped it up and wore it overnight and rinsed the sludge out of my hair in the morning, even going so far as to take my chances with not quite rinsing it all the way. It didn&#x27;t even look heavy and greasy like I&#x27;d been so worried it would. By this last attempt, I became entirely certain that this product was not in fact doing me any favors at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it smells pretty damn nice. So there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle. It really makes your hair feel great and my daughter and I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this just a couple of times now, and it seems to make my hair look very healthy, even received compliments on my hair, which is rare!  :)</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair and this is like heaven for hair!!! Love it</li>
            <li> I have never heard of Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask by Arvazallia.  I was searching the Amazon website one morning for hair products to give my hair a new regime schedule with products different than what I normally use, and came across this product.  At first I thought another product “hyping” up their product and the results you would receive, plus all the discounts that were attached to various products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not inexpensive, I decided to give it a try because of the ingredients in the product such as Argan Oil, vitamins and nutrients. It has a very light scent that is not unpleasant, it smells like a mixture of olive/argan oil to me, definitely not an over-powering scent.  I love that it repairs, restores and strengthens weak, damaged and over processed hair. It also conditions, hydrates and moisturizes your hair for a soft and silky texture, allowing manageability and improving elasticity. Since most people want shiny lustrous hair, I was impressed that it revives dull and dry hair giving it a beautiful shine while strengthening your hair.  I was impressed that Argan Oil and essential vitamins and nutrients were in the ingredients helping to protect, shield hair from damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I started to use this product I noticed that my hair become silkier and moisture held longer than usual while using this product, and shine was in my hair which appeared natural, rather than when you have a shinier look from applying a hair product that gives the appearance of a greasy look, which this product did not do, rather a natural shine to the hair which was impressive.  I noticed a lot does not need to be applied for your hair to feel the effects of the product strengthening and revitalizing your hair.  The Seller has described this product accurately.  I would definitely use more products in the Arvazallia line and would recommend to others who may be looking for a hair product that covers all the basic and important areas of your hair regime.  I wanted to know about the product, and I visited Arvazallia website to find out more information about the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask which was very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have started a new regime with my hair, enhancing all areas of my hair; restoring, strengthening, moisturizing, conditioning, and giving a natural shine to my hair I have found that this product can be added to my hair regime products with all of the benefits it gives my hair in just ONE PRODUCT.  I am AMAZED, and FASCINATED by yet another hair care product that gives results.  If you are looking for a product that can handle all of your hair needs, then you should give this product a try, you will not be disappointed.me.

            <li> Amazing hair mask... better than the Perfect 10 mask in my opinion. Must try!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, unless it&#x27;s really worth it. This stuff is BEYOND amazing! I have tried everything at every price and this one is by far the best. So glad I decided to give it a try!</li>
            <li> absolutely amazingggg!! I use it 1-2 times per week and it does wonders for my hair! makes it really soft and healthy</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Leaves hair SO silky soft! I leave it on for 5 min or so and then rinse it out. Makes brushing the hair much easier. My hair length is about mid-back and fairly thick. We live in Houston where the sun is baking almost year round on the hair. We have a pool so before I started using this product, my hair was extrememy dry and damaged from the chlorine and sun. This treatment not only smells fantastic, it does wonders for the hair. It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite product! Can&#x27;t wait to try the oil treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from color and heat. This stuff helped a lot and made it soft and manageable plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Absolute LOVE IT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I am on my third jar of this deep conditioner and I love it. I have fine, frizzy, fluffy hair that I get highlighted and usually control with a flat iron - so my hair deals with a lot. I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week (or a bit more often if I want my hair to look particularly good for something) and it leaves my hair feeling extra soft and smooth. Probably the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve tried over the years. Plus one jar will last for a while if you&#x27;re only using it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this hair mask!!  I have long, dark, thick, course, slightly wavy hair.  Since using this product, my hair is so soft, shiny, split ends are far less noticeable, and hardly any tangles.  The smell is amazing!!  I rarely buy a second bottle of &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; hair product, because I am not usually satisfied with them...but I have already bought a second jar of this!!!  It is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels.  I will definitely be purchasing this regularly in the future.  The price is unreal because you need to use such a small amount that it lasts for months.  I&#x27;m replacing my regular conditioner with it.  Thank you, Arvazalia</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Loved it! ! The mask went on smooth and i can see my curls soak up the product. After allowing the mask to sit for 20mins under heat,  my curls felt soft and juicy. After rinsing,  my hair felt silky and the smell was awesome!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, usually oily and brittle at the ends. This product helps smooth out the bumps without making your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Not a good conditioner</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, dry, curly hair... and I like to dye it. I&#x27;m always trying something new in attempt to tame my hair, but nothing (not even high end salon products) have ever been as effective as this. After one use, my hair was softer, shinier, and less frizzy... which I never thought was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair, ring some of the water out, apply the argan mask, and let it sit in my hair while I finish showering (approx. 5-7 min). I also bought the oil, and I apply that after slightly towel drying my hair. The argan oil also works well if you want to add shine and softness to dry hair. My only disappointment, is that the mask doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger container. You don&#x27;t need much though.</li>
            <li> Really does great things for your hair.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product. .</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and manageable. I used this product right after dying my hair and it was very soft. I love it! I use it weekly. I recommend it to anyone that wants softer beautiful shinier hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and usually takes an hour to brush it out after a shower.  This conditioner allows for me to easily brush it out in minutes.  I love it and definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> i bought this to use with a new flat iron.  It worked well on my naturally curly hair that sometimes will get frizzy also.  It did not weigh down my hair with an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this is seriously a miracle worker for my hair!  At first upon reading the directions for this mask I was a little skeptical. Nowhere on amazon does it say it&#x27;s not a leave in conditioner... I was thinking I could put it in my damp hair and go. At first I was thinking that I was definitely not going to wash my hair, get out of the shower and dry my hair, only to get back in and put the mask in to wash it out. I ended up just squeezing most of the water out of my hair then applying the mask (no towel dry needed). I definitely wouldn&#x27;t leave this product in the shower though. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem to be too shower proof. I also applied the ultra curl cream after brushing my hair. The results after letting it air dry are amazing! I&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s but my hair has seen its share of damage. It felt like straw. This mask brings me back to my pre teens when I just washed my hair, brushed it, and let it dry. Before I used straighteners, curling irons, bleaching treatments, and sea salt sprays. My husband even mentioned the smell and softness if my hair! I think I&#x27;ll buy this as a gift for my sister, who has the same woes about her hair that I used to have!</li>
            <li> I have never before purchased a hair product that satisfied me 100%. It actually works on delicate curly hair. I enjoy soft, defined curls without holding them with mousse or gel. Thank you. Good job!</li>
            <li> This hair mask really hydrated my hair and makes it feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing hair mask! Makes my damaged hair shine and feel very soft :)</li>
            <li> smells so good. everyone coments on it.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the best hair mask I have ever bought, I&#x27;m startin to get back my strong and health before 3 pregnancies.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a transformation on my hair!! Well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I have paid over 50 dollars for conditioner before and the results don&#x27;t even compare. My hair detangles automatically, shiny, but not greasy, and is growing quickly. I am completely in love with the price and results!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a really moisturizing conditioner. You know, the ones you get with a box of hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it had any great benefit to my hair after a couple of washes. It is very moisturizing the first time but after that, I don&#x27;t know. I feel like it would only really work if used every time after shampooing. It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair mask. It made my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Omg this is the most amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of iffy about buying this product, for the reason that I&#x27;ve tried several others and non of them have helped my blonde hair! I highly recommend this for anyone, leaves your hair EXTREAMLY soft, no tangles and gives it shine!</li>
            <li> Absolutley love it. Smells great and leaves my hair feeling awesome. Living in humid Texas, it&#x27;s hard to keep my hair from going frizz central. With this conditioner, it actually doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair a red ombre and it absolutely killed my healthy ends. I bought this hoping to  repair it and after just one week I could see a huge improvement. I don&#x27;t use regular conditioner as it is and wash my hair 2-3 times a week. I&#x27;ve been using this in the shower each time and about once a week I leave it in over night. My husband even loves it. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve found on a fluke. Bought as an impulse purchase but it smells great and feels really soft on my damaged, treated hair. Will be buying again. I use it as regular conditioner and leave it in a few extra minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Reviews are right about this product- hair is very soft and shiny after I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I got bored of my long curly hair and started experimenting doing different things. After a few bad hair cuts, color and a relaxer(!!!), I have totally damaged hair. This product has helped so much in restoring moisture to my poor hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> Made me hair ridiculously soft! Smells divine. Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to find a conditioner that felt as luxurious as the deep condition treatments that you get with at home hair dye kits, and now I&#x27;ve found it. Super rich and think. Definitely see a difference after using just once. My hair is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. I use it once a week and this is my second bottle. Smell delicious and when your hair moves in the wind you can smell the fragrance. It makes my hair soft and shiny. This together with the argan oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely IN LOVE with this hair mask! It&#x27;s amazing and my hair has been really happy with it! Makes my hair very soft and the smell is great. Love it and for sure I&#x27;ll be buying again! 😊</li>
            <li> My wife said it is amazing. And that is all.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  If you have dry or frizzy hair this is the solution for you. I use this as a once a week mask and it keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  This is a curly haired girl&#x27;s lifesaver :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it once a week and it worked really well. It lasted about five months.</li>
            <li> Simply put: the best conditioner I have ever used.  My hair was getting really dry for the first time in my life, and I think I made it worse by obsessing over it.  I tried a bunch of different shampoos and conditioners, and I eventually found this product.  I left it on my hair for 45 minutes (the instructions say 5-7 minutes, but I waited longer).  When I washed the conditioner out, my hair was so silky smooth and it felt wonderful.  When my hair dried, it was perfect - back to the way it used to be before it got dried out.  I have very long and thick hair, so I tend to deep condition it every time I wash it.  Now I just leave it in for 5 minutes and I let it work its magic.  My hair is always smooth and shiny and it looks really good!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I have gotten on my hair since using this product.  I got my hair and makeup done for my friend&#x27;s wedding, and all the makeup artists were marveling at my hair.  I should also add that this conditioner smells incredible :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this product with the Arvazallia Premium Argan Oil Hair Treatment - it is a leave-in serum that you can use on your hair when it&#x27;s damp.  Use these two things together, and your hair will be transformed!  This is truly an excellent brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it softens my hair and was especially good at smoothing out my damaged ends. I will keep ordering this! I am on my 2nd batch and it lasted me for months.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times, once per week, and it is effective. Once a week is enough for me. By the end of the week I can feel that it&#x27;s time to go through another treatment as my hair starts to go a little coarse and dry. I have oily scalp but using this product have not aggravated it. It does not leave my hair limp either.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff. Makes your hair sliky soft and healthy looking without weighting it down. also try the Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia also. You will fall in love!</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is AMAZING.  It made my hair so healthy and shiny without weighing it down.  I have long, fine hair that gets very dry and damaged looking at the ends.  I needed something that would provide a deep condition but not make my hair lose all its volume.  This did the trick.  I use it about two times a week and comb it through my hair as instructed.  Will definitely be buying again, especially because it&#x27;s such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is really good for hair!</li>
            <li> amazing for bleached and dry dry hair!!! works like a miracle</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference when I use the Argan mask.  My hair is smoother and looks healthier.  The only thing I would say if you have baby fine hair, just use a dime to nickel&#x27;s worth of it or it can weigh you hair down.</li>
            <li> Gives my frizzy hair smoothness without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that worked on my hair! used it just once yet, and can&#x27;t stop touching my hair :D</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy frizzy hair and this helps add moisture. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves your hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> no tangles after showering!</li>
            <li> Probably not the main demographic for this product but I am a guy with long hair. My girlfriend said I should do a deep conditioning so I tried this. It&#x27;s totally awesome - I&#x27;m hooked. It makes my hair really smooth and untangled. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It healed my brittle any breaking hair in just two treatments. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> To start, I received this as a nice holiday gift since I needed a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had accidentally wrecked my hair recently with body wash (without glasses in the shower I couldn&#x27;t see the difference) so I needed a conditioner to recover it. Although I&#x27;m a man with short red-brown hair, it was visibly dry and frizzy and literally squeaked in the shower when shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT: My order was a fluke- they have agreed to replace my not properly-filled container with no problem at all. They even offered expedited shipping for my trouble.&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC Customer Service!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now- the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is thick. Surprisingly thick, even for a conditioner. It has a nice pleasant light scent that didn&#x27;t bother me, and was a simple off white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all of the instructions on the container very clearly, leaving it in for about 6 minutes after brushing it through my hair (suggestion was 5-7 minutes leave-in time). When the container said use the product generously, I did have to. Maybe because my hair was pretty destroyed? Not sure. Due to the viscosity I had to use a little more than expected to work it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing the product out, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at first. As usual, I pat-dried my hair with a soft towel, brushed it, and let it dry before checking how it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I noticed, wow! Less frizz. Not only that, but my hair was smoother and even a bit darker looking! Totally unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous to using this conditioner, as I initially said my hair was pretty dried out and dead. Not from color dying or anything (I&#x27;m a man FYI) but from using the wrong product accidentally. My hair is naturally dry anyway (red hair) but either way the conditioner worked quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product, even if the cost is a bit high. Not high in comparison to similar products, even, but high for me as I don&#x27;t generally invest more than $10 in a container of this size. But this is more of a mask for occasional hair repair than daily-use.more of a mask for occasional hair repair than daily-use.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My hair is much smoother. I asked my husband to use it on his goatee and it really improved the texture. We are over 50 yrs. old and our hair has become much more brittle. I use it every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this hair mask! I bleached my poor LONG hair to death and bought this to use in preparation- using coconut oil pre-bleach, and this after, my hair is crazy soft and surprisingly strong. The mask smells wonderful, and leaves your hair totally detangled and silky. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product smells fantastic. I love the way it makes my hair feel. My hair is baby fine. It has become dry and fly away. After one treatment it feels totally different. If I have a complaint, it is the font of the directions is so small I had to get a magnifying glass to read it.  I will try more products from Arvazillia.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask for about a week now. While it is recommended to be used less often I have used it as a conditioner by leaving it in my hair for just 2 - 3 minutes after washing my hair everyday in the past week.  While I didn&#x27;t follow the directions out of the box, I felt my hair really needed deep conditioning more often because it has dry and frizzy ends from years of chemical treatments.  I&#x27;m now ready to follow the recommended use because it has really improved my hair a great deal in the past week. The ends are not nearly as dry as they used to be and it looks smooth and feels soft after just blow drying. Before using this product I had to use a flat iron or curling iron to smooth out the frizzy ends.  I know that flat irons and curling irons are hard on your hair when used often, but they seemed to be the only option to help manage my hair. Sometimes I apply Argan Oil to the ends after drying my hair or put a drop on the palm of my hand, rub my hands together, and then run my fingers through my hair keeping the oil away from the roots.  I also use a very small amount of Argan Oil before blow drying my hair which also helps the process. Amazon had a great price on the mask so I bought several jars.  I don&#x27;t think you can beat the price for the results I got after using it for only a week.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. I treat my hair with relaxers 4-6 times a year. It started to look like straw. I have been using this mask twice a week, for a month. At first I didn&#x27;t notice a difference but after a while, my God it shines, and falls on shoulders so beautifully. My hair has returned to its natural color, it smells wonderful, and it has become so soft. I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today.</li>
            <li> My wife started using this last week and its worked wonders on her hair.  Her hair is much softer and healthier looking.  The only thing she&#x27;s changed is using this about 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks now, and so far I love it.  I have really damaged hair that hasn&#x27;t been trimmed forever and this product has made a difference.  Once I finally get around to getting it cut, I&#x27;m sure this will keep my hair soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a lot of moisture. It smells great and showed up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair was dry ad breaking and I use this product to moisturize  my hair. I will be purchasing more of this product in the future</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It has made my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! It includes strong chemicals which destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok seriously I never writethese type of reviews. I received this conditioner the day that my hair was so messed up and I could barely get my brush through it. I am a swimmer and chlorine water always gets into my Swim cap so it makes for a very sad situation for my hair. Well anyhow I use this stuff hoping that it would help. I wish I had taken a before and after picture  It is insane how well this worked. My hair was able to be brushed right afterwards which is quite the feat. I was able to use my fingers to break up the rats nest. Seriously buy this stuff. You will not regret it. My hair is so youthful and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arvazillia Hydrating Hair Mask for about two months now, and I am THRILLED with this product! My hair is naturally coily, frizzy, and dry, and each application of this product leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, and intensely hydrated, and comb out is a breeze! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair mask. It leaves the hair shinny and silky.</li>
            <li> Flaked and dried my hair out more</li>
            <li> My hair was really dry due to self-coloring that I did with the store bought coloring products. As soon as I started using this hair treatment, my hair is softer and feels easier to manage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair is so much healthier. After the first use i could tell the difference. Love it!</li>
            <li> This definitely conditions hair leaving it very soft. It also gives my hair, which is straight and fine, more body.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It left my hair feeling nourished and healthy. I haven&#x27;t been able to run my fingers through my hair in a long time! I used this product twice, once I left it on while using the sauna and steam room and my hair was unbelievably shiny and healthy. I received a compliment as soon as I dried my hair! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> went through two tubs like nothing! amazing stuff</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it in my hair and it seemed to work. I really fried my hair right after using it and had to switch to Olaplex but will go back to this eventually. I felt it was working for regular type damage.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied. Leaves my hair soft and bouncy. I usually keep it on for 45 minutes and my hair has never been this soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and my 4C hair loves it so much! It really gave my hair some much needed moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> Really good hair mask. My hair got really soft after I used the hair mask.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is the best thing I have ever purchased for my hair. In the last few months my hair had become very dry and brittle from coloring and flat ironing. (I am mixed African American) I have tried several different products and nothing seemed to help. I read the reviews on Argan products and thought I would give it a try and thank God I did! This hair mask is all that it claims to be and more. Even my hairdresser asked what I have been doing and commented on how healthy my hair is and that is just after using the Argan a couple times. I don&#x27;t even mind the price cause it is worth every penny! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Smells good. My hair is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time but sadly it was cracked from the bottom so the cream was leaking ..</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair mask wanting to try a deep conditioner for my naturally curly and very dry hair.  It really conditions my hair, and I love it.  It rinses out cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I read all of the good and bad reviews about this product before purchasing it.  I was very skeptical because I’d tried so many different products and none of them worked.  But I thought, oh well I might as well try this one too.  I got the product from the mail and tried it right away.  I can’t believe the result!  My hair is colored and as brittle as straws.  I wash my hair on a daily basis and I also blow dry and use hair straightener.  The first time I used this product my hair became baby soft again (I left it on overnight).  It’s been so much easier to manage and style too.  I have long baby fine hair that turned straws like due to all of the abuse.  Now, my hair is back to normal again.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Will go back to my other brand</li>
            <li> Product was leaking when received...</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached platinum blonde and this conditioning treatment is amazing. Because my hair is so damaged, I use it more than twice a week. I&#x27;m on my second container and will be ordering more soon. Definitely recommended :)</li>
            <li> I really, really love this hair mask.  It truly does what it says 100 times over.  I am a 56-year-old black female who used to have curly hair.  But the abuse I gave it in my younger years (relaxers, dyes, and blow drying) had caused my hair to look and feel like straw, dull and lifeless.  Tried all sorts of natural conditioners and reconstructors but to no avail.  Being the avid shopper I am on Amazon, I searched and found this Argan oil hair mask.  Was very skeptical but after the first time I used it,  I knew this was my hair rescuer.  I loved the way my hair looked and felt after using this great product.  It has a nice fragrance and natural, not harmful ingredients. This will be the only mask/conditioner/reconstructor that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It works well. The mask leaves my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! my hair is smooth and silky and the smell is Devine !</li>
            <li> I like this hair mask. It gives not only a good natural  looking, but also keeps my hairs in style.</li>
            <li> This adds wonderful hydration and shine to my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this hair mask. It conditions well and leaves my hair super silky!</li>
            <li> I have never taken time to review a product until now.  This product is fantastic!  I have very long fine hair that I get colored and highlighted every eight weeks.  The last two winters have been very drying to my hair along with the chemical processing.  My hair was starting to look like straw.  I tried many products and home remedies and nothing was working.  I had resigned myself to believing I would have to cut my hair.  Then I saw this product and the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I have used it twice and the transformation already is incredible.  My hair is soft and shiny and healthy looking and it is full of body without using styling products or blow drying.  I have already ordered another jar.  Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended if you have dry frizzy hair like mines!</li>
            <li> I definitely saw an improvement in my hair texture from the first couple of applications. These improvements seem short lived so far, but I am hoping with regular use that I will see more long-lasting changes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I just bleached my hair and it makes it feel super soft. Smells very good, subtle. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that easily gets knots when it&#x27;s wet. It&#x27;s a pain to deal with, but using this hair mask has really helped with managing it. The texture becomes softer and I find that it really doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. The smell is very pleasing. I sometimes use it as a leave-in conditioner at night.</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says it will but it does not weigh hair down.  Smells awesome too.  Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using this treatment for more than two years, this one really make it look better my bleached hair.  leave my hair more soft and shiny,</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used. It was featured as a related product to a brand I previously used, and I decided to give it a try. My hair is so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly magical. My hair has never been so smooth</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have used this product only a few times but I have noticed a difference in my hair every time I use it. My hair definitely feels softer and it smells so good. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have noticed change in the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I think my hair feels so much better.  I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair done next week and see if my stylist notices...I think she will.  A really great product -- I plan to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Left my hair feeling wonderfully soft. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a week for about a month now. I will blow dry and straighten my hair maybe once each every 2 weeks. I also had a perm done 7 months ago which is why im trying this product. I still have breakage but my poor hair is so brittle now. This product though has helped make it a lot softer and smells amazing. I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.....very easy to use, and my hair feels so good after using it, almost silky....most likely to re-order</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I came across the brand on a youtube tutorial and decided to take a risk and purchase it. Definitely improved my hair texture in just one week (two applications). I greatly recommend to use with the oil too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the army, and every day I have to put my hair in a tight slicked back sock bun. Which, at the end of the day when I take it down, leaves me with this awful broken half-fro with my ends snapping in half.&lt;br /&gt;Using this once has seemed to revert all of the damaged hair caused by tight buns and field exercises and dollar tree shampoo back into silky civilian majestic unicorn hair and I love it. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in ages. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Even a tiny bit goes a long way. It smells absolutely heavenly and works well with the condition-shampoo-condition method. Mixing a small amount of this with the first and/or 2nd stage of the conditioning wash makes a noticeable difference with less dryness. Highly recommend and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Very hydrating! Leaves hair smelling awesome!</li>
            <li> I have dark hair I&#x27;ve been dying into blonde submission for a year or so now..and it&#x27;s finally had enough. I know I need to stop because my hair is getting brittle and dry..maybe next time. Anyway, I purchased this to help alleviate some of the frizz and grossness. I&#x27;d go with 3 stars on that one, it feels great right after you rinse it out but I haven&#x27;t seen any long term effects after using it 3x week for 3 weeks. That said, the non-highlighted pieces of my hair are receiving this better. They are more shiny and soft so..I gave it 4 stars. It&#x27;s not going to reverse self inflicted damage, but it&#x27;ll help you people just looking to improve dryness and frizz on non-damaged hair.</li>
            <li> WOW! Okay, that doesn&#x27;t really count as a review, huh? When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-) After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free and paraben free, these are safe for all hair types including processed and color treated hair. I&#x27;m often skeptical when shampoos and such claim to work on all hair textures, but I believe it now. My hair is super fine, oily and fairly damaged and using the shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel silky soft, look amazingly shiny and super clean without being stripped. I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo, being sulfate free, doesn&#x27;t overfoam and strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural, scalp protecting oils but still makes it crazy clean. The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all. Usually such deep conditioners make my hair limp and lifeless, but this actually had the opposite effect. After being basically bedridden the last 2 weeks, I used the hair mask to try and bring it back to life and it did that and more. This does not look like the hair of someone who&#x27;s been lying in bed like a dirty mop for half a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, a subtle fruity scent that had The Mister burying his face in my hear repeatedly. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and he&#x27;s 6&#x27;4&amp;#34;, so he spends a lot of time smelling my head! This passed the hubband head sniffer test :-)</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow. I have tried so many hair treatments and this by far is the best. This is a very thick, pasty like mask which is the best because you can tell its moisturizes &amp; hydrates. My hair is a 3B and it&#x27;s dry and frizzy. It&#x27;s course due to dying and bleaching. I did this mask and left it on a few hours. My hair was silk soft and my curls were better than ever. I can see the difference in the first use. I highly recommend this item and will be buying again. After much reading reviews I decided to buy and I&#x27;m so glad.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Best  mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  Keeps my hair soft and less frizz. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> made my curls feel super soft, helped DE-tangling much easier and it smells sooooooo good.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it!</li>
            <li> great stuff, keeps my hair on point</li>
            <li> Amazing my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Ouse this as a weekly deep conditioner. I wash, rub it in, leave a couple of hours while I do my weekend chores around the house, rinse, perfect!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not too bad it smells really good ... But I don&#x27;t notice a hue difference after I use it ... It&#x27;s a tiny bit more moisturized but nothing amazing. My hair has lots of highlights and I need lots of moisture</li>
            <li> I brought this item since it was highly rated here on Amazon. And I made the right choice!! My hair is dry and frizzy and this mask helps control it. I use it once a week and it works for my hair. My hair is smoother and less frizzy. I also recommended my friend and she has fallen in live with the product too!</li>
            <li> Left hair very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> It is a decent moisurizer but not super intense and the smell of the conditioner smells like something I could get a Walgreens.  I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; but It works okay</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and tons of it. I color my hair dark with highlights, and after switching back and forth from brown and blonde for a few years it was very damaged on the ends and had a weird straw like texture. I bought this along with some keira Shampoo and conditioner. This is my favorite hair mask i have used! It makes my hair so soft, the first time i used it i was shocked after drying my hair to not even have to straighten it because it was silky and smooth. I use it once a week and use enough to put through my hair roots to ends. First I shampoo and condition like normal and then put this in and comb it through and then leave it about 5 minutes. I have been using it a couple months and still have over half the tub left, and my hair is about to my waist. I will be re buying!</li>
            <li> Great product, received quickly, as expected!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that gets extremely knotted. This hair mask takes out the knots and leaves my hair fuller.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair really soft and while it may be hard to find time for a long shower with a new baby, this gives me the feeling of a little &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; visit. Treat to myself.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far, and my hair feels and looks very shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> I used this in place of my conditioner for the first time and I can already feel the difference.  It makes my hair feel so amazing and soft!</li>
            <li> Has done wonders for my hair. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Since using this I have noticed a considerable difference in my hair. Just using it twice a week as instructed on the bottle my hair has become much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> Very perfume-y, and a temporary fix. May as well simply use a decent conditioner. The overwhelming scent was not good.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife and daughters they love the crap out of it. We live above the arctic circle and it is extremely dry here. My wife said her hair has never felt softer, and she loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair really soft and my curls look really good!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it great  product makes hair grow and very soft shinning  and new</li>
            <li> I have oily yet dry frizzy crunchy hair from years of coloring. I know that may sound weird but usually after it is washed, my hair is still dry feeling and within a day or two it begins to feel oily. This product has fixed that. After I shampooed, I left this product on for 10 minutes even though it recommends 5-7 minutes. Once I washed it out and towel dried it, I almost didn&#x27;t want to blow dry it because there were no tangles and my hair felt soft. I sucked it up and used the hair dryer thinking it wouldn&#x27;t keep but omg this product really works. My hair is soft, not frizzy, and doesn&#x27;t have that crunchy feeling anymore. This product has restored my faith in beautiful hair again and it smells so good. I&#x27;m definitely recommending this to my girls at work.</li>
            <li> This conditioning mask is amazing!  My hair has never been softer or looked healthier!  I have very coarse, curly hair, and I am thrilled to have finally found a product that works to tame crazy curls and eliminate frizzy bad-hair days!  Thank you Arvazallia!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and love it, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down, like some conditioners and I love the smell.  My hair comes out so soft and shiny.  Would buy this again in an instant.</li>
            <li> I am a BELIEVER! This product definitely did it&#x27;s magic on my dry dull hay hair. My locks looked awful and I was desperate. Thank goodness I found this product on Amazon. Thank you for recommending this product.</li>
            <li> This right here is my new hair Holy grail. This is amazing. Bleach blonde stringy hair turned into silk in one washing. If you leave it on longer you have tangled free, virgin looking hair. Best conditioner ever with an unbeatable price</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do much for my blonde processed (with new grey wiry hairs). I tried to love it be of the review but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this over cheaper conditioners. It doesn&#x27;t have a mask effect on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Graet for your hair,makes fly aways but curl iron tames it.leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Instantly hydrated my hair! Will keep using this until it runs out and I&#x27;ll get another one!</li>
            <li> This product gets great reviews so I gave it a try.  My hair has been so dry recently it is breaking . The 1st use I used as directed, It left my hair oily and yet dry at the same time.  I had to wash my hair a couple times to remove the oil so that another conditioner could moisturize my hair.  I decided to try again -not as directed- using less on top of another conditioner to try to seal in the moisturized hair. The not as directed way worked better but so far In my two uses ,this stuff is not great or even better than a drug store conditioner. The smell I think is unnecessarily strong and gives me a slight headache, also the tub I received says Made in China.  Other Argan oil products have not worked well for my hair type either but this was worth a try based on price and reviews. UPDATE 6/13/15  I just found out that reviews can be filtered by verified purchases out of the 1500 or so reviews on this product 140 are actually verified purchases-also among the verified purchases all the critical reviews including mine have been marked not helpful. Some people just do not like the strong smell or the way it works on their hair. Some people love this conditioner too and good for them!- however the results on my hair and several others were left with dryer hair after using this- why was this marked not helpful??  The fact that it is made in a county that has very low quality control such as allowing melamine in baby formula and pet food - is a legit concern for some people.  I have reduced my 2 stars down to 1 star because clearly some sleezy marketing tactics are involved. Since good reviews matter to me prior to a purchase-had I known so little of the 1500 reviews were actually verified purchases- I would not have even bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product! I have had issues with my hair being severely dry for a couple of years now.... No products seemed to work. This product has finally given me my soft hair again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have only used this once but it lived up to the 5 star rating.  My hair was very dry from ocean swimming, over processing, and sun damage and this product hydrated and made it very soft.</li>
            <li> Been using this 1-2 times per week for the past 6 weeks.  Product is not as good as I was hoping for from reviews.  For me it was not more hydrating than most deep conditioners in this price range.  In fact I prefer to still use coconut oil with it.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.  It even works better than it smells. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products in this line.  It gives my hair the ultimate  hydration.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!  Great results &amp; totally awesome fragrance!!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is visible. Just after one use i could see how much silky my hair was! This product works exactly as described.My hair has not felt as healthier as it is now...it smells amazing. and I can see the product doesn&#x27;t leave a residue build-up .&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best! I love this product. It does help my hair, but it cost me a lot to buy 2 bottles in 1month.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Love love love</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and reported that she loved the wide mouth container so that she can scoop it out easily, the instructions were easy to follow, was easy to apply and rinse out, and made her Hawaiian-sun damaged hair silky smooth and new again.  As her husband I can report that her hair smells great and that she can brush her own hair now effortlessly without asking for my help.  This product is a win-win for both of us.  Thanks for making it.</li>
            <li> While I do like this product for leaving my hair soft and healthy looking, the smell is a little more &amp;#34;elderly&amp;#34; perfume than I would have preferred. I have a sensitive nose and prefer more subtle, natural scents to this. If you aren&#x27;t opposed to very strong smelling deep conditioners and want your hair to look and feel healthy, I would go for it!</li>
            <li> It was okay there&#x27;s way better for cheaper smells good tho</li>
            <li> Works great.  Not a miracle, but nothing is.  It works better than  most of the other products I&#x27;ve tried and usually paid much more for.  I would purchase again.  I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is AMAZING. It says to leave on for 5-7 minutes, but I left it on for 40 and washed my hair after. It was so smooth. I have naturally thick, wavy hair, and this re-hydrated my hair and took away the frizz. DEFINITELY recommend. And it smells really yummy too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased it ,and oh boy -let me tell you honestly after first use -hair was silky soft ,manageable ,shiny .i rarely write reviews -bit this product is worth it .i have damaged blonde wavy hair -and it was super unmanageable because of all the sun exposure and coloring .but this mask is really a miracle in disguise .highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the product seems to be working! I had my hair fried during a bad coloring process--which had to be corrected the same day. Double processing is not good for the hair but this conditioner seems to be helping. My ends feel dry right now but once I wash &amp; leave this conditioner in I&#x27;ll have soft locks again. I&#x27;m going to keep using it in hopes of not having to cut all my hair off.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair really bad from bleaching it. I went from black hair to red and back to black so my hair got really fried,got split ends,was shedding and every time I brushed it my hair broke off but after doing extensive research I decided to buy this product since it has 5 stars and I&#x27;ve got to agree this mask has given me amazing result on just the first wash!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick curly hair with a lot of dryness and frizz. Using this product a couple times a week is absolutely making my hair softer and more managable. Much easier to get a comb through it, and it looks so much healthier. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Really a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It makes my bleached curly dry hair feel softer for sure.  I give it a 4 .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used it for the first time ever and this mask is AMAZING. My hair is shiny and feels like silk. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it 2 times a week as a conditioner replacement. It makes your hair so smooth and manageable. Not to mention that it smells amazing. Already purchased more!</li>
            <li> I love this! I was amazed at how softer and smoother my hair felt after I used this mask. After just one use my hair looked healthier than it has in a long time. I love this product! I will definitely recommend this. I am for sure sticking with it. It had done wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. My hair is processed and between chemical overload and the FL sun very dry. I put this on in the shower a couple of times a week and I feel a noticeable difference. My hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and lives my hair very silky and smooth, I&#x27;m happy with the healthier look of it.</li>
            <li> great buy, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really great product! The price is fair (fairly inexpensive when compared to what salons charge for similar products). After only a couple of uses, my hair does feel softer and looks so much more healthier. It has a nice, brilliant shine to it. Not sure if its the product working but my hair is also a bit easier to maintain and style. It doesn&#x27;t have any weird chemical smell so that is a plus. Great buy!</li>
            <li> We live in FLA - and chlorine, saltwater and sun do a job on your hair.  This hydrating Argan Oil Mask is perfect to keep our hair looking great even in the FLA summer!</li>
            <li> leaves hair super soft and moisturized.  I highly recommend trying it out!</li>

            <li> Love the way it feels. Would definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this hair mask is amazing. I donate my hair every few years and the hair dresses can never believe how healthy the donations are! I would recommend this to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Argan oil products and the Arvazallia product line.  This is a great mask that will make your hair noticeably silkier and healthier.  My stylist complimented me on the healthiness and condition of my hair repeatedly the last time I got my hair cut.  Use it once or twice a week for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I am a single mother of two girls in their 20s and we all think this mask is amazing. It makes your hair feel like silk</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair mask!! My hair feels incredible and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue - just soft, silky hair.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty good about the product, hair is silky, though I only used it once after purchasing, Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> my hair feels and looks amazing and getting strong and healthy!</li>
            <li> Great product, I have curly, long hair and use a straightening iron which is so bad for the hair! I love argan oil and this is a great product and a (GREAT!) company to deal with! Thank you again!, sincerely,  Teresa</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair feels much softer &amp; looks healthy &amp; shiny. Also, the scent is wonderful. I plan on purchasing more. This line of products is amazing. I am using several of them.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is amazing. I went from using Paul Mitchell to this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I purchased this in addition to the system so that I don&#x27;t skimp on using it as recommended. :)  HIGHLY recommended to purchase their entire system.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I use the mask probably every third day when I&#x27;m not going to be blowdrying or straightening my hair, and ALWAYS before I do either of those things. The difference has been remarkable. I have curly red hair and AWFUL water conditions where I live, so throwing in some of that Florida humidity and it was a recipe for disaster. I found this when I was looking for a solution, and ever since I&#x27;ve had this hair mask stocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really, really creamy, without being greasy AT ALL. There&#x27;s enough in it for me to condition my shoulder length hair about 20 times - you really don&#x27;t need more than a small scoop. I work it through the ends of my hair and up and leave it in while I&#x27;m shaving and scrubbing, and usually by the time I&#x27;m ready to rinse it&#x27;s been well past the recommended 7 minutes, closer to 10. It washes out really easily, and when my hair would normally be tangled even with a little regular conditioner, this one lets me work my fingers through without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the final product is what makes this worth it for me! I have smooth, pretty curls rather than frizzy, chunky ones, and my hair takes to styling much easier. For the price it is now - significantly discounted - it&#x27;s worth it. Would I pay $40 for it? No. But for less than $20, this is an amazing mask.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable. Have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair at all; thick dark relaxed hair (transitioning to natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave it to a friend and, on her hair, this product did all the wonders that description states. She had very thin blonde hair and this product made it incredible gorgeous. She really really loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say this product does work, but not on all types of hair, of course.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I absolutely love it. Makes your hair feel so soft and healthy</li>
            <li> Love it. It makes your hair strong. The elasticity it gives your hair is amazing! It also seems to be straightening my hair out. I have 4B hair and I wear it naturally. I only use a comb to spread the mask throughout my hair. When I go to bed I section my hair and twist it. I just smooth it with my fingers. I haven&#x27;t used a comb daily since I started using the mask 3 weeks ago. I just use the comb when I condition my hair once a week. Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is not hidrate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product regularly 2 to 3 times a week for about a month now. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change. Kind of disappointed by the reviews.</li>
            <li> Amazing - left it in overnight and very curly, frizzy hair washed out smooth and easily detangled! Great purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife a couple months ago,  she liked it so much she asked me to buy it for her again. All I can say is it makes her hair look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my super delicate hair and this product is amazing!!! My hair is bleached and dry but has improved so much after using it! It even has a shine before it looked dead and dry. It last forever worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great hair mask. Makes hair soft and silky. Love it. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Good buy!</li>
            <li> I used it many times and feel it great for my hair. My hair become more smooth after using it. And this can hydrate your hair. However, you must do as the director says, it need to stay in your hair at least 10 minute I think.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells amazing and leaves my hair hydrated and silky!</li>
            <li> This mask deserves a 5-Star review!!!  I love this deep conditioner!!! I have natural, 4C, kinky hair &amp; it makes my hair SUPER soft, Manageable, Moisturized, and Dehydrated! The first time I used it, I used the whole jar in 1 use. Truth is, you can realistically use it twice on my med  length hair. I guess I was loving how it felt on my hair so I kept piling it on.  If you&#x27;re interested, I have videos on YouTube of the application process using this wonderful conditioner! The videos are under my business name, Uology! Hope this was helpful. [...]</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  I&#x27;ve now purchased for a friend, and my mother because I believe that it works so well.  Quick shipping, and friendly customer service.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioning mask!  I&#x27;ve been using it 2 x&#x27;s per week and it&#x27;s made a big difference in how soft and healthy my hair looks.  No static, fly away hair and no greasy, heavy residue!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it, I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! love the protection from harsh winter on my thick hair!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Everytime I use it my hair feels silky and healthy the next day. Leave it in for 5-7 minutes like they recommend! A must buy!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair frizz free smooth and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!! It says to use only 1-2 times a week, but I use it three times a week and I just love it! I love the smell, how soft it makes my hair, and the overall effect it has on my hair! It&#x27;s noticeable too. Since I started using it I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on how healthy, shiny, and thick my hair looks, and literally in January my hair dresser told me I had extensive damage due to straightening my hair everyday. I swear all that damage is gone now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention I love this product!? Just buy it if you are unsure, it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s money for sure!</li>
            <li> very strong perfume..  it has too much alcohol and fragrance.</li>
            <li> For 16.99 you would expect a decent amount of product but no you don&#x27;t get a good amount. The jar is small and to top it off; you open up the jar… it is not filled all the way!! It is about half way, and looks used.  I am very disappointed, if you have thick, long hair do not buy</li>
            <li> SO GOOD! This mask feels rich and thick and really conditions the hair well without weighing it down. I have thin fine hair and this did not create a greasy feel that so many products can. Love the smell too! Very nourishing. I got mine in exchange for a review but I have no problem rating things down when they don&#x27;t perform which you can tell in some of my other reviews. I love how this made my hair feel salon perfect! I felt as if I had just applied a gloss as well because my hair was so super shiny. You have to get the whole set if you are going to get results like mine because the shampoo and conditioner are amazing too!</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged due to dyeing and I don&#x27;t want to spend too much for treatment. Why shell out money going to the salon when you can get treatment in the comforts of your home right? I love this hair mask because it reduces frizziness and makes my hair more manageable. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and I&#x27;m happy to say it left my hair very soft and manageable,to all my natural sisters please try it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it twice a week , I think that more times a week leaves your hair greasy , and less won&#x27;t let you see the results</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It&#x27;s comparable to the Morracan Argan oil deep conditioners out there. Keeps my hair really soft and shiny. I use it around 3 times a week, very lightly on the ends and amazing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times and I would definitely buy this again!  My hair can get so dry and damaged but this always helps me smooth it out and improve the quality of my hair so quickly! It also has a lovely scent :)</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated blonde hair. Immediately after using, my hair felt great although I did not notice any pronounced difference over time.</li>
            <li> This has transformed my hair. I will never use any thing else. Love love love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair a lot in the last year (brown to blonde to blonder to red) and now it&#x27;s a little dry and brittle. This stuff smoothed everything out and smells really good! I use it twice a week and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Expected more with all the raving reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask weekly to repair my recently fried hair and it is helping a lot!  I leave it on for several hours, it rinses clean and my hair is soft and manageable.  My hair is feeling less like straw!  It has a soft scent which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair that has been damaged over time from dyes and highlights. This made my hair so soft and silky with just the first use so I had to write a review. I like the smell too. It smells like salon products. Not fruity or anything but a pleasing smell.</li>
            <li> I love it! I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels after using this! I use it differently than most, probably, in that I apply it to dry hair. I wait 10-20 minutes, then go take my shower. I rinse it, then shampoo and condition as usual. My hair still smells of this, which I am grateful for because the scent is wonderful! I wanted to get moroccan oil, but I love this so much I think I might just get this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: when applying, the conditioner feels smooth and creamy, not at all greasy. I am careful not to put any against my scalp though, as I am someone who has naturally oily hair, and it is my ends that suffer from severe dryness (over coloring and heat products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a daily conditioner though... this is definitely one that deserves the time to sit and work it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> works very well on dry hair and the price was right</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! And it smells amazing. I live in CO and my hair gets so dry. This really did the trick for my dry damaged hair!</li>
            <li> Amazing results.  Makes my hair look healthy and sleek for days afterward.</li>
            <li> i just love this, its amazing how it feels in the hand</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt softer. It also looks shiner and healthy.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so so so many different products, it&#x27;s ridiculous. That last few years (I&#x27;m 43), I started having so much gray and I now color it regularly. It became so dry and frizzy. I do have thick hair, but not curly. I always have used an oil before blow drying. Right now I use HSI which I really like. Any heavy conditioners/masks I used, I needed to use a lot to get results and still always used the oil. This stuff is flipping amazing. I barely use any, goes through my hair so easily and does an amazing job. I still use a little oil for protection from the blow dryer and straightener if I decide to use it. But my product use is a fraction of what I have used in the past. And my hair is so much healthier. I don&#x27;t need to straighten my frizzies if I don&#x27;t want to. My hair looks great drying and using just a roller brush. The fact that it works great, and I use less fits both my wallet and my beauty needs. How often can I say that????</li>
            <li> Use it 3 times a week leave it for 10 minutes comb hair and it leaves it like new. I straighten my hair 5-6 times a week so I do major damage to it but this product renews it and leaves it soft and smooth plus I love the smell. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have been coloring (highlights etc...) my hair since I was 20, I am 48 so it&#x27;s been awhile.  I&#x27;ve just added blonde highlights to my hair and the highlighted areas were very dry or hay like.  I have tried high-end products and every conditioner under the sun but have never had results like this with an over the counter product or even with professional products.  I have only used it twice so far and the change and improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture, manageability and shine has been wonderful.  I followed the mask by applying a couple of pumps of the same brand oil to hair along my regular styling products, I have been very pleasantly surprised at the improvement after each use, after blow drying my hair, my hair looked healthy and felt very supple and was soft all over.  I am a believer and will continue to use and recommend this product.  I think my results are only going to improve and am thrilled with the results after only two treatments!</li>
            <li> It works, going to buy the shampoo and oil.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is perfect for dry hair. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use it but all 3 of my daughters (12,11 and 7) use it.  It&#x27;s amazing - especially after a summer in the sun and pool!  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> My Hair: Baby fine, blonde, color treated, straight, dry, brittle, split ends, frizzy, dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a million and one hair masks in my time. Only a handful give me results that I am happy with. This one is one of the masks that truly work wonders with my hair. As you can see by my hair description above, my hair needs all the TLC it can have. Right before I started using this mask, I did a full trim of my hair, and was sure to go through and remove any split ends. I then began using this mask about 3 times a week, for 10-15 minutes. I have been using this along with the shampoo and conditioner by Arvazallia to achieve maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first use I noticed a big change with my hair immediately, but also days after. My hair felt softer, looked smoother, and was just beautiful! I am still in the early stages of using this, but so far I love how it makes my hair feel. I tend to concentrate this towards the middle of my hair down through the ends since that is where I need the most deep conditioning. This doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which is rare because I have such baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great mask. 5 star rating from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this deep conditioner.  Love it!  Also has helped with strengthening my hair.  Since used my hair has grown at least 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> Used it on my newly bleached hair and now my hair is soft. No longer dry and stringy!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Loved it. Works great. Smells great. My hair is beautiful after using this product. 110% recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write reviews for hair conditioning products, but for mine (Asian) it&#x27;s great.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Really feels nice on my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Helps reduce frizz and makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> They are very smart ( in a bad way)  here they showing  two creams, like two products, but actually is only one and the name of the mask is Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask AND Deep Conditioner , l think is too bad to put 2 products in the foto if u are selling 1 only.</li>
            <li> I normally dont leave reviews so i must really Love this!!! I was skeptical at first because my hair is so damaged and I have tried so many products.. but it really made a difference...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a week since I received it a month ago. It has really helped to restore body and shine to my 62 year old hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing, just amazing. Use it almost every day and I love the way it makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s so soft now.</li>
            <li> Former hairdresser---I&#x27;ve used all the professional products out there-as well as naturapthic shampoos and conditioners. This product is over priced-yes it does smell good -but there are other products out there that so a lot better. I leave in my hair and rinse the next day-just average as far as conditioning.                                                 Update- after writing the review I decided to try another product I had  used previously &amp;#34; Nexus Pro mend&amp;#34; and nexus Polymedic emergency reconstructor&amp;#34; (deep conditioning for damages hair) Bc of the experience of highlighting /coloring my hair and my daughters hair -I Know that damaged hair can be repaired -(just like burning your skin )  I had highlighted and colored my hair 4 days ago-2 chemical processes that left my hair very dry. I used this product first few days and it was ok to say the least. Last night I applied the Polymedic reconstructor (slept in it -as well as this product first few days) and the difference the next morning with Nexus was undeniably twice as good!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I have highlights in my hair and I notice the difference if I use a regular conditioner as opposed to this hydrating mask.  The Argan Oil mask makes my hair really soft and manageable and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing! I really like it. Just after two uses, I&#x27;ve already noticed my hair smoother and easier to comb through throughout the day. My hair gets tangled really easily and it seems like it has helped relax my hair. I don&#x27;t see my hair getting greasey any faster than it normally does so that&#x27;s a plus too. Oh the seller even reached out to me, giving me more detailed instructions on how to use it! I&#x27;ve never bought hair mask before this but from my experience, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really do not leave the house without applying this . It&#x27;s such an integral part to my daily hygiene and cosmetics. I&#x27;d feel ugly if I left the house  without it.</li>
            <li> I literally do not have one negative thing to say about this incredible product. At first, I was VERY skeptical of buying this because I had never heard of the brand before. After reading reviews I decided to take the plunge and purchase this hair mask, and I am so glad I did. This hair mask makes my dry, brittle, damaged hair feel soft and like I just left the salon. The scent is also incredible - sweet, but not floral, and maybe slightly nutty. This hair mask makes my hair feel incredibly luxurious, and I had to hide this product so that my friend didn&#x27;t use all of it after I let her try it (she has since purchased her own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is heavier than a conditioner, make sure you rinse out ALL of the product before getting out of the shower so that your hair is not weighed down or greasy. I also found that I get best results when I leave the product in for an hour or more. Most Sunday mornings, I wake up and go for a run, then immediately jump in the shower and wash my hair before applying this product. I shave my legs, wash my body and face, and exfoliate while I let it work. I then get out of the shower with the mask still in my hair. I wrap it in a Turbie Twist and clean the apartment, do some homework, and throw my laundry in before getting back into the shower to wash it out. When I do this and let it sit for 2-3 hours, my hair feels and smells incredible until the next time I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone, and I would pay a lot more for it than what they ask for. If you have dry, brittle, or damaged hair, then this is definitely the hair mask for you!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I bleached my hair twice in a row to dye it a silver and fried my hair. I bought this to help it, and my hair is so soft and feels healthy again!</li>
            <li> I almost have a collection of all different kinds of hair masks. This one is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft! Really works</li>
            <li> Great for my fine dry frizzy hair. After trying so many products, I think I finally found the &#x27;ONE&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this conditioner I was blown away. It left my hair soft, shiny, and manageable. I will definitely purchase this conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this product! Works very well as an interim replacement for my regular conditioner. My hair is softer and less frizzy when air dried. Still need a bit more uses (it&#x27;s been about a week) to see if my split ends decrease or are less visible.&lt;br /&gt; The seller sent me an email with additional tips on how to use the product, i.e. leave in longer for deeper condition or add a few drops of their Argan oil to the mask for a boost.</li>
            <li> The best hydrating mask for my hair! You feel the difference on the very first use</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it makes any level of damaged hair feel healthy and soft on the first use!!!</li>
            <li> It works really well with my damaged dry hair. It has done alot for it since I purshased and used it the next day. Its makes my hair really soft and tangle free, will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; .. smells nice</li>
            <li> Didnt really work. Its more like a regular conditioner actually.</li>
            <li> This mask works very well and leaves your hair with a light feeling.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it was badly damaged from a bad chemical straightener. This product saved my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product one time thus far, but was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this once a week for a while now and I cannot really tell the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  Makes my hair soft after using.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this hair mask.  I absolutely love it!  Made such a difference in the softness of my hair after using it only once.  I have heavily highlighted hair and it&#x27;s hard to keep it hydrated.  This stuff does just that!  Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good hair treatment without going to the salon. I used this for the first time the other day and it made my fine blonde hair very managable. usually I have massive tangles. I used Color-Proofs shampoo Detox to get rid of buildup, then shampooed like normal using my Redken. After that i liberally applied this product and left it in for 7 mins. Rinsed out easily and didn&#x27;t cause irritation. I&#x27;m only giving four stars because the product was way too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; for me. It was very strong. Seemed like that&#x27;s all I smelled for hours. As long as it stays this price, I will be a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good  product though it builds up residue fast</li>
            <li> Loved it! Gave one to my friend with hair issues as well. Trying to re-order it but it is not available. No!</li>
            <li> one of the best mask that i have used.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about this product. My daughter literally put her hair through the ringer between bleaching, blow-drying and straitening her hair. We were so close to cutting it off until I came across this product. It was on sale and had great reviews so I thought why not? I&#x27;m so glad I did. I combed it through her hair and could literally feel the difference while three minutes into it. Her hair is Amazing again. Like it has never been damaged at all. It is silky smooth again. It looks, feels, and even smells great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once and I&#x27;ve been falling in love with this product. I didn&#x27;t expect too much because the price was very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;But, I really wanted to try this after reading all the good reviews. My hairs have got damaged after many times of dye, perms and other things that&lt;br /&gt;could damage my hair. So I had to try something that WORKS OUT. I have only used once. But, my hair was changed to so soft and I could&lt;br /&gt;brush my hair so smoothly and easily. And the scent is so nice.(I am very sensitive and picky when it comes to scent of hair products.)  Honestly, the scent lasts more than 24 HOURS and I love the scent SOOOO MUCH! I am so happy that I found this product. Definitely will purchase this&lt;br /&gt;again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but I&#x27;ve had better leave in conditioner. It takes too long to really penetrate.</li>
            <li> I barely write reviews. But this one is really good. It&#x27;s the second time I purchase it. I fell in love with my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> great service, wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I only used the product once so far and am thoroughly impressed but I need to use it a few more times before I really see the results as it seems my hair likes new products in general.&lt;br /&gt;Love it after first use, made my dry, over-processed hair look shiny and healthy.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it again.</li>
            <li> Gave it a month after purchasing it and now every time I shower I can&#x27;t wait to put it on! Hair is soft and silky. It&#x27;s perfect as a leave in (I use it as a leave in only) I will continue to purchase it!!</li>
            <li> Great mask for damaged hair - I could tell a difference after the very first use!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the overpowering flowery smell so I gave it to one of my kids</li>
            <li> I like this product alot. My hair was over processed and it made it so soft and so much easier to manage. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this product. It softens my coarse, unruly curls twice a week gives them several days of definition and calm. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and saw a difference from day one that has been consistent. I am aware there may be other more expensive products out there that may work better for two or three times the price, but I am pleased with the quality offered by this one and not eager to fork over extra for a marginal difference. My curls usually soak up product, and one pot of this will last me 3-4 months. It feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> AMMMAAAZZZIIINNNGGGGG Don&#x27;t think twice just buy it. It&#x27;s amazing how even after the first use what a difference it makes. I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product, my hair became more healthy and the percntage of dryeness reduced 80% , I really like it</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is easily weighed down by, well everything. It is oily at the roots and dry at the ends. I&#x27;ve tried  other hair masks and I didn&#x27;t like ANY of them. This product is honestly, great though. The directions are easy to follow and the results are undeniable. It makes my hair soft and shiny without greasiness or loss of volume. The fragrance is nice and it lasts long after I&#x27;ve rinsed. My hair is color treated, but I&#x27;ve had many compliments on the health of my hair from multiple stylists. Using this product has without a doubt improved the overall health of my hair. It&#x27;s definitely a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> FANTASIC HAIR MASK :)))</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews, I thought this product would be great. It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. (I process my hair a lot). Hair still kind of dry and dead looking. Ojon works better. My hair looks much healthier and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking fried.Pricier, but works better than this product. I tried to look for a cheaper alternative, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to ojon until something better and more affordable comes up.</li>
            <li> Loved it. The first time I used it I knew that there would be a difference in my hair. I never ever leave reviews on Amazon but this product has made my hair shiny and soft every single time I&#x27;ve used it. Definitely a life long customer. I use a flat iron almost everyday so this conditioner has been a lifesaver.  Also the seller sent me a coupon after my purchase which I thought was very nice and attentive of them.</li>
            <li> As an AA woman that is 13 weeks post relaxer I have to say I am trilled with this product. My hair is fine textured, but the gray hair can be a bit rebellious. This product truly does what it says. My hair (new growth) is so manageable and easy to comb through once I used this product in place of my conditioner. I am so glad I followed my instinct and ordered after I read all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and has always been silky, but after dying it a couple of times it began to feel like straw. I purchased this product and noticed an immediate difference after the first use. I left it on for 5-10 minutes in the shower, clipped up out of the way since my hair is really long. After the second use my hair was back to normal. The scent is really nice as well!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing and makes my hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for curl hair! Less frizz and it feels so soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love the way this has transformed my hair!  I have never had such silky hair that feels so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Well, I decided to try the mask because I really enjoyed their serum, for it has improved the quality of my color treated fine hair. I have spent alot of money on deep penetrating conditioners that don&#x27;t live up to their claim. This mask has a strong perfumed scent. The product is thick and my hair felt soft while it was on my hair. When I rinsed out the mask and let my hair air dry, my hair was so soft and conditioned. This product delivers.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair. This made my hair feels soft, but dry at the same time. Feels dry, but isn&#x27;t dry. I guess it&#x27;s soft and just doesn&#x27;t make my hair silky smooth is all. The whole purpose of getting this was to hydrate my very dry scalps and help me stop all the dandruffs, and it worked so so so perfectly. It did it&#x27;s job amazingly. I don&#x27;t care much about how my hair feel because I&#x27;m a guy I guess, but mostly I just care about the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed. I ruined my hair by putting too much protein in my hair and now it is super dry. So this product with argon oil was recommended to me and I love it. My hair feels like my hair again. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair mask once or twice a week now and am in love with it! It leaves my hair super soft and manageable. Normally my hair is impossibly dry and tangles itself in knots within minutes of being brushed. This product has made a huge difference and I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair immensely soft and smooth, and makes them appear fresher for long. Doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells heavenly too!</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner for overly dry hair.  The product is very thick, so it seems to really coat your hair evenly. The longer you leave it in, the softer your hair is.  I only wish that in came in bigger jars, as I run out fairly quickly.  This seems to be the best mask I have found so far.  I use it on my color damaged hair weekly.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really soft, and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> The Hydrating Argan Oil Mask is good and smells fresh as well, and is conditioning and gives my hair a fuller feel. While it is conditioning and hydrating, I think the repairing conditioner did a better job. I was sent this for review, however t does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Really helps bring back the soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine, dry hair feeling awesome and smooth. I use about every 4 days (shampoo, dry hair, apply hair mask and leave on for 30 min).</li>
            <li> I just bleached the tips of my hair to nearly platinum blonde , it was getting dry so I left this product on for around 1hr and 20 min. I washed it out and it feels like my hair has never been bleached! My hair was very healthy before the bleaching process but this product still helped add all the amazing moisture and shine back to the tips of my bleached hair! For those who bleach or due their hair often, I definitely recommend you buy this! And if you are going for a pastel hair color you can mix your hair dye with this hair mask and leave it in your hair for as long as possible and the result come out greater than with a regular white conditioner because this product is just so nourishing and moisturizing for your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and damage and this product helped a little. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product I recently bleached my hair and bought this to make it look better and it works. My hair looks and feels better than it used to before I bleached it. I&#x27;ve never been the kind to care for my hair because I&#x27;ve always been skeptical but I love this this is great it&#x27;s lasted me a lot I still have more than half and I use it regularly and plenty of it. I really like it. I reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil hair mask!!!!! I have THIN/WAVY hair that is damaged because i always blow-dry and straighten my hair soon after i shower so i have a bunch of split ends!! i love the length of my hair however i am always contemplating about getting a hair cut/trim because of how damaged it looks. The other day after not being able to schedule an apt with my hair stylist until a week out i started searching for hair products and i am sooooo happy i found this particular one!!! I received it in 2days Thanks to prime shipping and soon after trying it out, i was a satisfied customer! not only did it exceed my expectations by leaving my hair silky smooth and noticibly minimizing my split ends but i no longer felt like getting a hair cut because of how much better my hair looked quickly after. I will definitely be repurchasing this before i am all out!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product. I have ridiculously think hair so I was kind of skeptical with this product and if it would actually work. After I tried it my hair was noticeably softer and felt very lightweight. It also left my hair with a great shine to it. Normally I can only go 3 days without washing my hair because at this point my hair starts to get slightly oily. But I&#x27;ve noticed with using this product it keeps my hair conditioned for much longer without letting my hair get greasy, flat or heavy looking. I think I went 4-5 days without washing just my hair and I was amazed. Especially because not washing every day is much healthier. I would definitely recommend this product for all hair types. It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and over-processed hair and this mask really moisturized and hydrated my hair. I&#x27;ve tried many masks recently and this one is by far the best. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Perfect hair mask! I use this mask 2-3 times a week and it&#x27;s not heavy at all. Lush, creamy, smells great, and when you rinse it out your hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this product, I wish I could bottle it as they say! I wish I could get that fragrance in a lotion! It works great!</li>
            <li> Great mask especially if you have 4c hair:)</li>
            <li> My first  review ever... I had very damaged hair from relaxer and others harsh treatment my hair was dry , brittle and looked  really bad, after using this amazing mask I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair I&#x27;ve been using this mask for a month now and I&#x27;m surprise how much soft and Healthier may hair looks</li>
            <li> This hair mask provides instant results, seriously. My hair is instantly more silky and smooth and I absolutely love it, especially considering how color treated and damaged it was, extremely highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Loved it</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> sure does make my hair nice and soft, so much so that it loses it&#x27;s body and bounce. too heavy for my medium-thick, wavy, mid-back-length hair</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product Works just like it says!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling really silky. I&#x27;ll be trying the daily conditioner next.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair mask that I have been recommending to all my friends ever since I started using it! It really makes my hair super soft. I use it twice a week and leave it on for around seven minutes. It comes off easily. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping it would be. After one use, my hair feels super soft and it shines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deep conditioners ranging from cheap to expensive for my bleached, fine hair. It&#x27;s hard finding a good deep conditioner for fine hair because so many are targeted for thick hair, and as a result most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried would completely weigh my hair down and make it look disgusting. I needed to find something because my hair was a frizzy mess with split ends and flyaways from putting so many highlights in. I decided to try this on a whim since the price wasn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, I use it after a clarifying shampoo and leave it in for about 5-10 minutes. My hair feels soft and healthy after using it, rather than greasy and gunky. I also find with other deep conditioners that the results don&#x27;t last after the first shampoo afterwards, my hair hair would go right back to being dry and frizzy. With the Argan Oil conditioner, I find the results last for 3-5 shampoos. Ever since using it 1-2x/week, I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to use as much anti-frizz serum after styling which is nice because that would often make my hair oily. I plan to repurchase this as long as I keep getting the results I want.</li>
            <li> Loooove this Mask!! It really smooths my frizzy ends. I don&#x27;t have to style my hair every day with this wonderful hair mask. It leaves my hair smooth and silky. Will purchase this and only this product from now on, because no other one that I have used can compare with this one. Highly recommend it to everyone with damaged hair that wants a smoother and healthier looking hair. Best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever tried. My ends were pretty ruff, after frying everyday and bleaching it from ombre. But thanks to this awesome mask, my hair looks and feels much healthier, shinier and smoother. I don&#x27;t even have to use the straightener every day now, which I really love. A small amount goes a long way. This mask will always be in my house from now on.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dry hair!</li>
            <li> Works so well, feels like you got a nice salon treatment!</li>
            <li> my grandaughter was desperate to soften and relax her hair and this product saved the day!</li>
            <li> My long, fine, curly hair had suddenly become fried-feeling in certain spots. I thought it was permanent damage and that I&#x27;d have to cut my hair short. After some research, I bought this product. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my hair is no longer fried. It&#x27;s not hair-product commercial beautiful like it was 20 yeas ago, but it is remarkably better. I don&#x27;t have to cut it off (yay!). Granted, I leave it on for about 2-3 hours, but the results exceeded my expectations. It did a better job than pure coconut oil. Also, I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to fragrances and this product didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It smells nice. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair are so soft now, and then smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great smell, not at all greasy or oily.  We use it on our 3 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and it has worked out great.  She has very thick dark hair, and this stuff adds a nice shine, and more importantly, makes it more manageable to put in ponytails without a lot of brushing etc.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner. It left my hair very, very soft and the scent is wonderful. It is really comparable to more really expensive deep conditioners. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!!!! After the first usage my hair has improved so much :) It was very, very dry w/summer/heat, etc... Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask! I use it at least once a week, and my hair always feels refreshed and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why such a fuss around the mask, it does not do any miracles if you fluffy and wavy hair. Can it good but smoother and straighter the hair will not do it. and screw it impossible without hair spray.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when reading the reviews but I have noticed a significant increase in manageability since using it. I am a natural brunette turned blonde and my hair was very dry with a lot of breakage. Not sure why the instructions say use 1-2 times a week.... I use this 3-4 times (everytime I wash my hair).</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with Argan Oil Mask and it made my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve color treated and bleached my hair, but this mask made it feel silky smooth again.</li>
            <li> Great on my overly processed hair, even apply small amounts on the tips of my hair before curling as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells great. leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this. My hair is in the stars after starting this! Recommend it to everyone I know! Definitely a customer.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very soft the day after but it goes back to dry and brittle after one day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product; but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be formulated for coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This mask made my hair a great deal softer after only one use. After multiple uses, my hair was much healthier feeling, smoother and silkier. It did not weigh down my straight hair as other treatments have, and left no greasy residue. It smells pleasant - strong when you first apply it but after it&#x27;s washed out, only a faint scent remains. The jar is a good size and you don&#x27;t need much, even for long and thick hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with damaged, dry hair, and will definitely be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, leave my hair super soft, and smell grest, just wish it was more amount.</li>
            <li> I just simply love it! The first two days that ive tried it i saw the results right away no lie my hair is softer brighter &amp;its looking healthy if you want this to really work you have to stop using your heat tools to get good results.</li>
            <li> my hair is like new after one use... unbelieveable</li>
            <li> My long frizzy hair has never looked and behaved better ...ever!  Love it and will buy a lot and keep it in case they stop making it.</li>
            <li> This product IS NOT for African American people.  I thought because you mentioned the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; it would work with my hair but it&#x27;s more geared to every other etnicity except black hair!!!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used, and  I use professional products. I have thick coarse frizzy hair and this makes it soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> I like to try new products to see what works best for my hair. I have curly frizzy hair and it works wonders on it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Saved my hair from being chopped off. It repairs split ends and even helped control the frizz. My hair feels really healthy and soft now.</li>
            <li> Once every two weeks I like to use a cleanser that basically takes all the build up out of my hair. It leaves your hair feeling very dry. This product works so amazing that it got me hooked on buying the whole hair care line. A little bit certainly goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had to cut out some bad habits I had with my hair and now with this product it seems that my hair is more soft and less dry. It does get oily faster during the summer but besides that it smells and feels great on my hair!</li>
            <li> Everything positive you are reading about this product is true. Leaves your hair soft and shiny... and the smell is great! Recently visited Aruba and my hair was severely wind-blown and dry - Didn&#x27;t bother trying to comb thru it for fear of losing half my hair, but rather applied some Hydrating Argan Oil Mask in the shower and (Voila!) the tangles and dryness just disappeared. Would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have mixed natural hair I should probably be taking better care of . I purchased this product as a weekly deep conditioner. I section my hair, slather it on, and let it sit for a few hours. When  I go to rinse it my hair is definitely smoother, shinier, and feels great.  I will continue to use it and will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My hair feels alive again after months of frizziness and split ends. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair routine for good. I no longer use a bunch of hair masks, hair serums, styling creams, or end up having my hair up in a tight pony tail / bun. I was always confused about what to do with my hair, mainly because It used to be very dry at the end, but somehow greasy in the roots. Because of split ends, I ended up trimming my hair every month or so, but a week ago I started using Arvazalia Hydrating Argan Oil Mask and everything changed! I shampoo my hair like normal, but instead of using conditioner, I use the Arvazalia Oil Mask. I just leave it there for 5-7minutes ( while I do something else), and when I wash it out, my hair looks and feels WOW. My hair immediately felt so soft. I also feel like it reduces the frizziness.  AND I no longer wear my hair up in a Bun (:  I find the smell a little bit strong for my taste tho, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, so its not a problem for me. I just use a little bit of product twice a week. Im already thinking about buying 5 more, before they get pricey or out of stock.  Just one week and I love my hair again!! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> 100 % RECOMMEND IS BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles</li>
            <li> it works great as a hair conditional but it smells quite bad. but once you wash it off, its okay tho.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I love the smell and it has made my hair feel amazing. Sometimes I even use a small portion before I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing, it makes my hair soft, shine, and easy to style. I have a very frizzy hair, I am going to buy it again, for sure :)</li>
            <li> The mask was just as advertised.  The product was new in the package and the seller has checked back with me to verify that I was satisfied with the product.  The mask makes my hair soft and shiny again.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky soft and shiny! Has a nice pleasant smell, not too over powering! Little goes a long way. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smells GREAT and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp, so I don&#x27;t shampoo.  Using baking soda and vinegar is great, but over time, my hair needs a boost.  The argan oil mask and argan oil conditioner really helped!  I avoid getting the on my scalp but my hair is soft and my scalp didn&#x27;t break out!</li>
            <li> Looooove this product  a must try :)</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and leaves my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> I like this product real well.  I&#x27;ve used it mostly in the shower by adding it to my squeezed out hair, leaving it in, doing my other shower stuff and then rinsing.  My hair feels very manageable and soft. I like the smell, soft and feminine but then it fades and isn&#x27;t a problem at my &amp;#34;no perfume office&amp;#34; later on.  I like it as its intended purpose, a hair mask as well.  I&#x27;m looking at trying this company&#x27;s Argan Oil too because I do still have some fly away hair from time to time.  One concern would be the cost of this product, it&#x27;s a little pricey if you want to keep it in your beauty arsenal all the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing! I felt the difference in my hair after one use and I could not wait to shampoo my hair and use again this morning! I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s easy to use and smells wonderful and really works!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free for being a vip insider. I love it. It works great. My hair is thick curly frizzy and unmanageable. This product gave it some moisture and tamed it down. It is softer and shiny. It smells good. It is easy to use on wet or dry hair. I would recommend this to anyone who has dry hair on needs a moisture treatment. I will tell my friends and family and I cant wait to try the Argon oil. That looks great and the sale prices are wonderful chance to try all these products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using the It&#x27;s a 10 for awhile, and needed a change. So glad I found this. Definitely a must-have in my shower  now.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really softens my hair and helps with breakage. I perm and dye my hair so it is a mess without this stuff- I use it two-three times a week and it doesn&#x27;t build up or get oily at all. I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS COMPLETELY DIIFERENT&lt;br /&gt;SOFT SHINY AND SMELLL GREAT&lt;br /&gt;NOTICE WHILE DRYING&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT&lt;br /&gt;THANKS&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I WILL ORDER MORE</li>
            <li> Luv it.. smells good too</li>
            <li> Omg!!!! Works amazingly!!! And instantly as you put into your hair!</li>
            <li> See my review on the shampoo product page.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel amazing, soft and shinny. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver for me, especially when my hair gets extremely dry over the winter. Will definitely be ordering another one to restock on this!</li>
            <li> I have fine, long, colored hair that was starting to feel very brittle. I used this once, following instructions (left in for 10 minutes in the shower) and it made my hair soft and silky. I only ran it through the ends, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or oily. I&#x27;m going to be using this twice a week as I grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> Amazing after the fist use my friends noticed how shiny my hair is. I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle sometimes I leave it for an hour or two . My hair just feels alive and vibrant and fuller</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing mask I have ever used and you can not beat the price! I have also used a smaller amount as my daily conditioner, although it isn&#x27;t recommended for daily use on instructions...don&#x27;t know why. Regardless, my hair was really dry and damaged and this brought it back to life, making it feel so soft and hydrated. I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Love the hair mask. My hair feels so soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for 3 weeks but I have noticed significant changes with my hair (I also started dry-blowing - that may be another factor). My hair  is visibly less frizzy, and feels lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this hydrating mask.  It smells amazing!  My hair is very long and wavy (mostly frizzy) if I let it air dry.  After the first use of this mask my hair was noticeably smoother, softer and didn&#x27;t feel dried out, it also made my split ends look better.  For an added boost, after I rinsed out the mask in the shower, I put more on my hair and wrapped it in a towel and let it sit for about a half hour and rinsed it out.  Worked amazing!  My hair felt incredibly moisturized (I wouldn&#x27;t do that on a day that you need to style your hair though because mine was too soft and slightly weighed down because of the heavy conditioning to stay curled or in specific style).  I only use this product about twice a week, if you use it more, it might be too much because it is such a heavy conditioner.  I used a lot of other brand name, high end products such as Moroccan Oil and Pureology, and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the company has stellar customer service.  The conditioner can be used as a regular, even daily, conditioner.  Or, it can be used as a deep hydrating mask.  Both work great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loved it! She lent it to one of my daughters and she loved it as well. So I will need to buy one for her as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. I do not relax my hair. When I want to flat iron my hair for a smooth look, this product makes the process so much easier. I do use a thermal protectant as well. I have tried the other popular Argan oil deep conditioner. It does not work very well for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Item came with less product than I thought. As soon as I opened it, I saw how little product there was. I am disappointed I paid 16$ for an item that wasn&#x27;t even filled remotely to the top.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and makes my hair really soft</li>
            <li> It a Great product! Last long because it is thick and you just need to use a small amount to see the effect. My hair just love it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Makes your hair soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped it would be, left my long thick hair super soft and strong.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved what it did for my hair.  My hair feels smoother and it feels more voluminous.  I absolutely love how it made my hair smell as well.  Great customer service too, they sent me a $4 off coupon and ordered the Arvazallia Premium Argan Oil Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Hair looks great but hair too damaged from pregnancy to actually do what i wanted it too.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell and quality of this product. Great price. I have bleached my hair over and over again and this product has helped improve its texture and smoothness.</li>
            <li> Excellent for coarse, dry, color treated hair! I used this product twice last week &amp;d each time my hair did not feel like straw after a day, which is what I normally experience with standard conditioners, even &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; conditioners. What I also like about this product is that it is sulfate free! Next time I use the product I&#x27;m going to add some to my damp hair, to give it that extra softness.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my hair softer and price is very affordable. Would love to buy it again once I finished :)</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t try this product please do, love the way it makes my hair feel it&#x27;s soft and manageable, first day I use it coworkers ask what did I used cause my hair looks so good.I just think this is the best deep conditioner I ever used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. Not only the customer services is awesome and fast with the replies and concern, but the product works as long as you use it as instructed. I also tired &amp;#34;HSI PROFESSIONAL Hydrating smoothing Anti-Frizz Hair Mask with Argan Oil,&amp;#34; but it did not help my frizz hair. I live in Miami, and the weather here is pretty humid, and the Arvazallia Hydrating Hair Mask makes my hair way less frizz. Thank you Arvazallia for this awesome pruduct :) !</li>
            <li> Wow! Has really made a difference in my hair only after a couple of weeks use. Will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li> It works like any other argan oil deep conditioning treatment. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is amazing...but it still does leave your hair soft.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair manageable and shiny after each use. I love the way it makes my hair look shiny and wavy when my hair is pulled backing a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my hair much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> absolutely loved it. I bleached my hair for the first time and it left my hair very dry and with out a natural bounce. I used this conditioner as a deep conditioner, my hair is back to normal!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! It&#x27;s a GREAT hair mask for a great price! I highly recommend it. My hair care routine and review is here: http://abbymaried.blogspot.com/2015/05/your-hair-so-fine-hair-mask-review-best.html</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, as well as the entire line of Arvazallia products. These products really work, and they are reasonably priced for the quality. I&#x27;m hoping they will extend their product line!</li>
            <li> I would like to tell you this product does seem to help hair and not only your hair but your skin. When you put it in your hair put on your face too. Makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> love this so much! my hair has really come back from the dead with this. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for a few years now, lately been going the blond way and as a result my hair has been very dry and normal on the stand hair products just made the situation worst, so started to look for other solution, came across a few reviews that praised the quality and effective result, ordered and arrived just on time. Bought this together with the Argan Oil for Hair Treatment and the results after using it for two weeks have been amazing. my hair no longer look like someone killed it! i&#x27;m so happy! it&#x27;s really not oily at all, more like silky feel and the smell is super nice.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used on my hair it&#x27;s soooooooo soft and shiny.I will defiantly buy this again thanks:).</li>
            <li> This made my hair incredibly soft, and a little goes a very long way! I&#x27;m absolutely loving it, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Just wrote a review on the oil too... Simply awesome. I don&#x27;t know if both together did the trick or what, but I&#x27;m sticking with both when this runs out.  AH-mazingggg stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Have not tried long enough to give a review but they keep asking for one.  So far, no noticeable difference.  The few times I&#x27;ve used it my hair has been softer but no noticeable difference yet in improvement</li>
            <li> Had tangled unmanageable broken hair .. feels and looks healthier</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask. Makes my hair super soft and silky without weighing it down. I used it twice a week. People are always complimenting at how shiny and soft my hair is. I never got that before this mask. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells great &amp; makes my hair soft. The best product I have found to hydrate my hair. I found this product about 6 months ago when I was searching for products to help my hair. My hair kept breaking off - which I later discovered it was the well water. Now I only wash my hair with distilled water. This product has helped my hair recover from all the damage. Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works. My hair was literally dead, specially on the tips and I have been using it for two weeks now and I can totally see the difference. It says to use it instead of conditioner 2-3 times a week but I use it instead of conditioner every time and it really works. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as brittle as it once did, I can&#x27;t tell if it has helped my split ends yet but at least it feels completely soft!</li>
            <li> This smells great and leaves my hair noticeably softer and shinier vs regular drug store conditioners. My only complaint is the packaging. I much prefer squeeze tubes and bottles than a jar. Otherwise it&#x27;s perfect! :)</li>
            <li> Hair looked and felt better after the first use!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super soft and it smells great. I would definitely try this again</li>
            <li> This condition is amazing and helps me and my daughter&#x27;s long thick frizzy hair to be smooth and soft and silky.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It leaves your hair so soft and it smells so good! I wish I could use it everyday. The seller also sends an email with info about the product which I though was great. Definitely something a every girl needs.</li>
            <li> I have years of coloring and highlighting my hair. It tends to be straw-like and coarse. This product made my hair soft and brought out my natural waves. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This definitely works! After searching long and hard for a product to repair my dry, brittle, over-processed hair, I finally found it! I had read all the five star reviews prior to buying this hair mask, which made me want to purchase this product that much more. Of course, I was skeptical because for the past 6 months I have been trying many different conditioners and they didn&#x27;t give me that silky, smooth, naturally shiny, healthy-looking result I desired. Nonetheless, this product met my standards. I&#x27;m elated that this product actually performed and did what it promised.</li>
            <li> My hair is trashed from working out and throwing it back in a ponytail. I have tried many deep conditioners, and even at home concoctions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this the first time and left it on for a long time and the results were my hair was super soft, managable, and smellled great. But it left it somewhat oily at the scalpt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second time I left it on for just 5 min in the shower and still left my hair much better then my normal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to figure out the perfect time for my hair to leave it on, but this product actually works. If you have always dreamed of soft, managable, moveable hair, try this.</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Hair looked great</li>
            <li> I had colored my hair at home and needed a product to bring back the softness, shine, and moisture.  After the first use I felt and saw a remarkable improvement in my hair. Now I use it once a week and will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> This is the first time I write a review, but because I could see the result from the first time I use it, I decided to write this review. This is an awsome product!!!</li>
            <li> Second time buying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use this product about 3 times now.....and I love it.  I use it once a week, though it says you can use it up to 2x per, and it has been a real help to my dry hair.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I felt the price was reasonable for the small amount I have used each time.  It should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great for repairing summer sun damage.</li>
            <li> This an excellent product. It really does what it says. A must buy it! I will keep using this for ever. I have high lights in my hair and with this my hair is soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and the Arvazallia conditioner makes it soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. And yes is work great, the smell is fantastic I definitely recommend this products</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very silky.</li>
            <li> Its very good..making your hair soft and moisturized ,but ingredients are far from organic.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shine and soft that I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> I adore this product and will not go without it. Keeps my hair in amazing shape regardless of how horrible I treat it ---like sunburning it, blow drying etc etc..... Truly amazing</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel. I think my hair is actually getting stronger from&lt;br /&gt;This and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. Rub on split ends!!!! Love this.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how good this product actually would end up being. I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand before and the price was rather low, but I thought hey why not! OMGA if you purchase this you wont be let down. This product is a must have, I have been using it once a week on my hair and soon I will move over to twice a month. My hair is so soft and so smooth, the product smells great the texture is almost like yogurt but man this product is so worth the cost! Trust me every girl needs this!!!</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair smooth and looks amazing....loved this product</li>
            <li> Mmmm ! It helps 30% I guess 😁</li>
            <li> My hair has been very dry lately, and I desperately needed a good mask.  I&#x27;m a student, so I was hesitant to spend $17 on a hair product, but after using the product for awhile, I can say that this is a good product if you use it every time you wash your hair. This would not be as effective for me if I only used it every other wash.&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package, I was disappointed to see that the container was only about half-full. I e-mailed customer service about this, asking if something was wrong with my order. I got a very nice response right away, and also another mask for free.&lt;br /&gt;I give the product 4 stars, but the customer service was so nice that I had to rate 5</li>
            <li> Okay so i have dry wavy hair and for some reason the hair stays nice and smooth for 6-8 hours  at most , say for the evening when i take a shower after gym or so and use both the products together . My wife loves the shampoo and musk both . Maybe it just my hair type and i need something else to retain the softness for a longer period.</li>
            <li> This tamed my frizzy hair. I have long waist line length hair which is wavy, dry, frizzy and damage hair so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for hair products that will make my hair smooth and soft. This mask smells amazing and has made my hair feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Work good on overly treated hair</li>
            <li> This hair mask was lovely and worked great on my hair the first couple times. It made my hair shiny and smooth. After a few times of use, the effects wore off and I didn&#x27;t see any results. Maybe this was user error, but I ended up returning the product. I hope it works better for someone else. Maybe someone with dry brittle hair would love this.</li>
            <li> Love it, Hair is super manageable !</li>
            <li> This conditioner is all that and more. It&#x27;s great! I have wavy/curly thick hair that is always dry and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> Works ok but I&#x27;ve used better products. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time 2 days ago. All I have to say is WOW!</li>
            <li> This mask does miracles for my hair. It makes it so soft, shiny, and it smells amazing! This is my favorite hair product I own. I&#x27;ve already looked into getting more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair mask for a while.  I do have damaged hair because I&#x27;m constantly straightening it.  It was well rated and I decided, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;  I have course hair and have been using a Motions mask before this one.  I also bought the Argan Oil for Hair Treatment which I rated a three as well.  I just didn&#x27;t see any results.  I&#x27;d say the jar lasted me 3-4 treatments, so about a month to a month and a half. The texture was smooth and it reminded me of perfumed lotion.  Heavily perfumed lotion. The smell wasn&#x27;t bad but it was better in moderation. It, at least, made my hair smell clean and the smell did linger on for days. My hair felt rough afterwards so it didn&#x27;t really feel like a hair oil mask.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t see where the oil was. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells prefectly and makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this product. I have dyed/dried out hair and this conditioning creme has hydrated my hair and made a huge difference in overall appearance. I absolutley love it and recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product was just another disappointment in dealing with my over processed hair. It felt like straw. Now it is so silky that I am in love with my hair. I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry if you try this for yourself.</li>
            <li> The hair mask worked like magic. It leaves my hair manageable and soft. I have damaged ends from straightening and heat damage but this leaves it so silky and the smell is a great bonus. Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It took 50 years to find something to turn my naturally curly/frizzy, high-maintenance mess into low-maintenance, fabulous curls with body and shine.  I get tons of compliments on how my hair looks and smells.  For the first time EVER my hair is manageable and easy to style.  I can even wash and run, if I want to- which was impossible before using this product.  I won&#x27;t go a day without it!  I recommend it to all my friends with natural curls or permed hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend, she loves it so much.</li>
            <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Really makes your hair soft!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Works great and you feel results right away!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was as advertised. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> save my hair. very good at hydrating. you definitely want to use it when your hair feels dry and tired. try it.</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy, dyed hair that gets frizzy very easily. In between the heat and humidity of summer, it can be extremely difficult to tame. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different conditioning products that really did nothing for me or just made my hair worse. Somehow, by the grace of the hair care gods, I stumbled upon this mask one day and decided to give it a whirl. Let me just say, IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. I use this mask about twice to three times a week and it not only makes my hair incredibly soft, but there is minimal frizz left behind. It also smells great!! I&#x27;ve battled with my hair for years and now I can wear my hair naturally with no product. Even after going platinum, my hair looked very healthy.</li>
            <li> Receiving the product I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on a variety of hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found the results to be great when used either as a light conditioner or deep conditioning with the added benefit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it revives dull, dry hair, giving it more elasticity thus managability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished with a drop of Argon oil for added shine the results are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unadvertised benefit, works great as a hand cream... softness without the least bit of greasiness..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introductory special price or otherwise, I would highly recommend the Arvazallia Oil and Mask for those seeking a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> This mask works great, noticed an improvement in my hair after just one use!</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling soft and luscious. I use it every other wash to hydrate my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have very long, fine, dry and damaged hair that is always hard to brush, not luxurious blah blah blah and I put this in my hair for 30 minutes and when I washed it out it was so soft and silky! I could easily brush my hair, i could run my finger threw my hair and it just look amazing! I definitely recommend this product :) !</li>
            <li> It smells amazing! I color my hair, but I also just have dry/ wavy hair and was looking for a hair masque. I have only used this once so far, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a really good find. I will see if it keeps moisturizing like it did the 1st time... Made my hair baby soft!  (Which can be bad if you need it to have more stiffness)</li>
            <li> I only had to use a small amount because of the thickness of the product. This was worth every penny. I will soon be looking into other products that Arvazallia has. I used this as a deep conditioner and sat under the dryer for 20 minutes. I have to say I am impressed. I can tell the difference. The scent is light and smells good. Being as though my hair has been damaged from previous things used and hard wear and tear I really wanted something that was effective and able to show some results. I saw results in one use and I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after a couple more uses. I would recommend this product to chemically treated and transitioning African American hair type.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great and is great on my hair! My hair is softer, feels, and looks healthier! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair is so much healthier. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy! It is an amazing product I recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so silky and shiny! and I love all the compliments and HIGHLY recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Hair feels great. Great product, does not dry hair. Makes hair feel soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very good product,i have been using this product for two weeks now,and already see my hair softer and more manageable. Im not giving you the five stars because of the time. But so far so good!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells good-- it conditions very well! It reminds me of those really good conditioners that come with home hair dyes--- so good!</li>
            <li> My hair is oober soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I satisfied. Its really shiny and soft. completely reveal your damage hair but takes time. I suggested to buy.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! My hair which is very damaged by years of dye is now silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very high price for a low quality product. It is not as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and I am liking it. I love the smell &amp; my hair combs through easily after the shower. It leaves my hair feeling nice &amp; soft &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> this hair mask is amazing.After first use  my hair feel soft and shine and smell really good.Bottom line I&#x27;m in love with this hair mask,because it do magic on my freeze and dry hair.I hope they create the full line that include shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Exceeds expectations! Even after just 2 uses my hair feels so much softer and definitely  less frizzy!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive this product to review and give my honest opinion on it. First off, I love hair masks and this new product now and one of them. It&#x27;s keeps my hair soft and moisturized with my really love. It smells really nice as well. I would definitely recommend this hair mask for those who have damaged hair and want to really repair and nourish their hair back to it&#x27;s healthy state.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; its my 1st time using it! After my hair dried it instintly gave it this fresh look &amp; feels soft something that my regualar shampoo/conditioner dont really do for me. Im only giving it 4 stars because I widh the bottle were bigger, other that that its great!</li>
            <li> Its the most amazing hair mask/conditioner it leaves your hair really smooth and lasts well unto the next wash.</li>
            <li> I felt that the mask really nourished by hair and even though it was thick it was easy to rinse out!</li>
            <li> I get that most products just need to be scented these days for some reason, but I couldn&#x27;t even stand to go a full day after using this. It smelled so strongly of perfume my eyes were watering. If you love overly perfumed stuff then you&#x27;ll like this. If you don&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Hair felt silky and hydrated after use, not greasy.</li>
            <li> If your thinking about buying this, just do it! Loooooove this product!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like silk!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I was not impressed. However, I can honestly say that I am now a fan. I&#x27;m a product junkie so I try something new every chance I get &amp;  rarely purchase the same thing twice. However, I am seriously considering repurchasing this. This DC is extremely thick &amp; provides decent slip while rinsing. But the real kicker is after I get out of the shower. I apply Olive oil to my ends (which have not been trimmed in two years), and I use shea moisture leave in spray. My hair feels AMAZING right now. Baby soft (ESPECIALLY the ends, which is crazy). Which might have more to do with the olive oil than the DC but still. The rest of my hair is soft too. This is an awesome conditioner with an even greater price.</li>
            <li> I always get a deep conditioning treatment every 6 weeks from a salon, which last about a week and keep my hair smooth. This stuff is AMAZING and works just as well. I use it once a week inbetween my salon appointments.  This is one of the best products for my hair I have ever had. Try it.  It won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and felt very smooth and hydrated after using this product.  I have very thick hair that I just recently highlighted.  This conditioner gave it some of it&#x27;s shine back.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING Mask! I was skeptical but it has done wonders for my hair. I try to leave it in as long as I can (normally a few hours) and it leaves my hair feeling like cool silk. I have butt length, thin, fine, pin straight hair that&#x27;s dyed red. I definitely recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Smells lovely. Has pretty good slip, and made my hair feel like pure silk and look divine. I have relaxed African American hair and my hair loves this product. I must admit, I was a little doubtful at first, but hey, we gotta be be wrong sometimes. Can&#x27;t wait to order a couple more!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for relaxed hair!! Should make this product in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry curly hair and this product is amazing!!!!  Will definitely buy more in the future . It smooths and keeps frizz down</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair feels very soft and healthy after using it</li>
            <li> smells amazing, enjoy every time using the mask. definately will buy it again, for this price - the best product</li>
            <li> This hair mask has made my over processed hair soft and shiny again. It smells good to!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long blonde hair and found a little goes a long way. Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer support.</li>
            <li> I can really see and fee the moisture in my hair. I can also feel that my hair gets stronger and stronger after each mask&lt;br /&gt;Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> i love this Hair mask so much. it makes  my hair feel so soft, i will keep using it thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This hydrating Argan oil hair mask is amazing, I love it , I&#x27;ll buy again!, thank you for have a great product at good price...absolutely recommend a friend!</li>
            <li> i love this product. it does what it says, i will buy it again. i used it with the argan oil and shampoo. it doubles the shi ne and moisture.</li>
            <li> Great products, works wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times. It&#x27;s been good. Nothing spectacular,  nothing bad. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if I have any results in my dry, color treated, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Mehhh... did not do anything much for my color treated dry hair. My hair feels more humid when I use it. It does not make it shiny or silky like when I use other masks. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product works as stated. It took my dry, over processed and brittle hair and turned it to a shiny, soft, manageable miracle.</li>
            <li> I love the way it make my hair feel</li>
            <li> Great for my thick dry hair! Highly recommend giving it a try. Personally I prefer it to the Morrocan oil brand mask.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many hair masks like this one so I can&#x27;t compare very well. The only other one I have used is the Organix line hair mask. While I love all their products I must say this is a much better deep conditioner that I will buy in place of their version from now on. There is a noticeable difference in the softness of my hair after use and less frizz. I bought this product in favor of the more expensive versions out there. I would like to compare the Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating mask and see if there is a difference. I must say for the price though that this one will be hard to beat.</li>
            <li> It works as described. It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I thought; it looks like a smooth cream, but it&#x27;s an almost solid paste. Work it through with some water. You can even leave it in the hair, if used sparingly..</li>
            <li> Hair feels great after using, found my my new mask!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have used - and I&#x27;ve tried everything! I feel like most deep conditioners are so heavy and they don&#x27;t get absorbed easily. This product makes my hair feel super silky soft in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels when I use this product, I only use it twice a week but I can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> This hair mask is great.  I use it once a week, and it keeps my hair looking good.  My hair had been so dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my own hair pretty regularly for years. Last summer I made the mistake of getting lazy and letting my salon tone my hair after I had already bleached it. A lot of my hair was damaged and burned off. I&#x27;ve finally cut off most of the long damaged hair I had and have been growing the rest out. This mask has really helped improve my hair in the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it. My hair is significantly smoother and seems to be growing in a little better. Will definitely be buying another tub when I run out.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I have long hair and so do my kids. You only need to use it once or twice a week because of how rich it is. The product doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. My family has tangly hair and that&#x27;s why I got it. It did it&#x27;s job by leaving us with little to no tangle and our hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair mask on the planet and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry, naturally, wavy hair. I live in Florida so it is always humid and I am always at the beach. I have a very hard time finding conditioners that really make my hair soft and manageable. I had high hopes for Arvazallia&#x27;s hydrating argan oil hair mask after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t live up to hype. I was truly disappointed. My hair didn&#x27;t feel any softer or look any healthier after several uses.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soOoOoo soft. So glad I purchased</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Leaves my hair soft and silky without weighing it down.  I left the product on for about 20 min and it worked wonders. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> So far I like it. It makes my hair soft and my daughters too. Her hair is curly mine is closer to just being straight but it&#x27;s great for both of us. Nothing heavy left behind. It smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I dye my hairs every month. So it becomes dry and stiff.  I tried to use different conditioners to improve it and the results ware very limited. I searched Amazon site for better conditioner and uncover this product. Read all the reviews and thought giving it a tried.  After using several times, my hairs are really different. soft, shining and easy to comb.  The product works for me.  I am 100% satisfied with it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  I am using it weekly to give myself a deep conditioning treatment.  I provides lots of moisture and keeps my natural hair soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice treatment.  My hair was badly damaged from a year&#x27;s worth of mistreatment.  Two uses of this line of products &amp; it looks better than it has in a decade!</li>
            <li> Repaired my hair in one use. I would suggest anyone who loves healthy, shiny hair to use this product.  It an essiential for my hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!  It smells like chemicals, gives my scalp a burning sensation, and is no better than any other (cheaper) conditioner I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely do NOT recommend this.</li>
            <li> My hair was really damaged after I tried this product I start to love my hair again!! My hair is getting better and look healthier.</li>
            <li> Arvazallia argan oil  is a Great product I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it left my hair very soft by  second hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smell great and I order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer after using this product.</li>
            <li> Only used it once. Will update you when i see results.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I straighten it very often. That being said - it dries out very easily. I put this in my hair when I shower and then when I straighten it it is soft and smooth again :) very happy! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.. Incredible shine, will continue to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great smell and really helps to condition dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair in a greasy mess. The packaging also seemed shabby. I don&#x27;t know how to explain that, other than it felt like a copy-cat of another product. It was very thick and almost felt like more of a balm styling product than conditioner. It did smell nice.</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves my hair smooth ALL THE TIME! And I have dry hair. I leave on for about an hour or so after I shower and it works wonders. :)</li>
            <li> Works great! I do not see the over powering perfume smell that another reveiw said.  It works better that the previous ones I tried.</li>
            <li> After the first my hair went from dry &amp; brittle to soft, silky &amp; shiny. This product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Product came shrink-wrapped and secure. Directions indicated to use it for several minutes on damp towel-dried hair, I left it on for several hours with good results. It&#x27;s not a messy application nor does your hair feel greasy after application.</li>
            <li> This works very well for my naturally curly hair! I have a hard time finding the right conditioner, and this works well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair .I have products that give me much better result than him .</li>
            <li> You know how usually (if you bleach your hair or dye it) when you dont wash it for a day or two, the roots are super greasy and the ends of your hair are DRY AS HAY? well not with this stuff! i love it! when i use it my hair says soft. the ends feel fantastic. They feel like i just had a hair cut. I will definitely be buying more of this when i run out. (I recommend using it like every other wash). I just wash my hair and use my regular conditioner on my root/hair area and then put this stuff on the ends on my hair and leave it sit for 5 minutes, then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Okay, seriously... I never write product reviews on Amazon or other websites....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you a little thing or two about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had virgin straight, thick, black asian hair once...you know the one that all females gawk over and comment how they wish they had your perfect hair...it seriously wasn&#x27;t that great to me...well I took it for granted. That was over 13 years ago...and I&#x27;ve had color-treated hair since...the damage became noticeable recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist recently took me from long, red to short brunette/ombre. Then went to blonde/brunette. So....needless to say there&#x27;s been a lot of bleaching, coloring, cutting, hair damage from previously having to pull back my hair in a bun for 4 years in the military, enduring Texas heat, other hairstylists going to town with the razor and etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recommended I look into Moroccan Oil Hydrating Mask because he loves their products. Well I had my hair deep-conditioned at the salon one day by him using it and honestly didn&#x27;t feel any difference. So you know me, I start researching and what do you know?! A newer brand with all perfect reviews and a fabulous introductory price of $15.99....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product yesterday morning and jumped in the shower right away!&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo your hair, put the product from roots to end, comb through with an actual comb, let sit for 5-7 minutes...go do your other things...shaving, etc ...whatever you do in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash it out...and VOILA!!! I can easily see myself looking forward to this mini-pamper session 1-2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, after only ONE treatment...I&#x27;ve already bought 3 more. Just because I know that great price won&#x27;t be there forever!&lt;br /&gt;What are you waiting for?!&lt;br /&gt;Buy some and gift some. I&#x27;m sure my blonde sister will definitely appreciate a jar for what&#x27;s left of her hair. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH YEAH! It smells AMAZING! Even my clueless Marine husband commented on how amazing my hair smells and how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY HAIR PHOTO FOR THIS PRODUCT! :)how amazing my hair smells and how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY HAIR PHOTO FOR THIS PRODUCT! :)</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit intense but mellows out once your hair is dried. This conditioner helps soften and revamp my dry processed hair. Take heed on using too much at your roots. It&#x27;ll be too greasy</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hair became very brittle and dry after having it lightened. I used according to package instructions and my hair was noticeably softer after my first use. I now use the product as a leave-in because my curly hair became very frizzy and less manageable after the lightening. This product makes it more manageable. I am purchasing a 2nd to keep in my pool bag to comb through my hair after I go swimming while the price is still reduced.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as other products; but what I really disliked were the telemarketing calls that came with the product. I don&#x27;t believe that buying a product comes with implicit consent to receive telemarketing and &amp;#34;survey&amp;#34; calls.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  My hair felt shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I got this product based on reviews of other customers. It is great for detangling my overly processed hair and smells wonderful. I even use just a little bit every day and don&#x27;t rinse it out and my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Coloring hair caused my wife&#x27;s hair to become coarse.  She used this one time and her hair felt super soft after one use like her hair used to feel years ago.  I don&#x27;t know if this product will work on all hair like it did on her hair.  Based on her results, we would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for hair. I use it myself and on my daughters&#x27; hair. It makes brushing out their  hair super easy with no argument! (As a mom anything that does that deserves praise!) Great price also!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair mask! I don&#x27;t particularly dig smells in general, but this one is fine. I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t notice too much irritation. I have also put this in the night before on just my ends and put my hair in a bun to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Love this hair mask i have very thick curly hair this is the only hair mask that makes my hair smooth and easy to comb i have tried other products nothing works on my hair like this product does love it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this conditioner. It really gave my blonde hair LIFE... I&#x27;ve always had black hair so transitioning into blonde was a bit traumatizing.. My hair texture changed and was dry. I tried a conditioner prior to this one and it did absolutely nothing for my hair it actually felt worse. As we all know blonde and pool water don&#x27;t mix my hair came out looking like a dry poodle, after using this conditioner I&#x27;ve never felt my hair so moisturized, silky and just full of life... I recommended it to all my social media followers that&#x27;s how amazing it was</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask!  I have very thin and fine hair. It is also curly therefore it gets pretty frizzy. This mask completely eliminates all of my frizz but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It makes my hair shiny, soft, and there are never any tangles in my hair after I use this either!  Love it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I finally found a great result of a product that I just take a chance to use. ..I got course long hair, you can guess how it&#x27;s hard to manage, well, since I started using this mask, I feel my hair getting soft, hydrated, easy to comb after rinsing, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the result. ..no more hard time for me !&lt;br /&gt;  MaryNorman, silver spring md</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that breaks easily and shows every bad thing that has ever happened to it, which has made it difficult in the past to find hydrating products that don&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy. This product not only rinses out cleanly, it works a lot better than I was expecting. I&#x27;ve noticed that in the month that I&#x27;ve been using it (twice a week, roughly), my hair has gotten noticeably softer and healthier. It could be that my results are so dramatic because I went from using no deep conditioner to using this (see aformentioned bit about having a hard time finding good products for my hair texture....), but I will say I&#x27;ve had much better results with this product than I have had with anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I will be continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever for damaged hair!! I tried the Moroccan Oil first and it was okay. This was a cheaper option but I wanted to give it a try. Best decision ever!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, my hair is so shiny and a lot less frizzy when I use this mask.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. My hair is noticeably smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> Your Feedback My hair is much softer and shinier after just one use. Great for my thick, coarse hair. I can now take a brush through it without hitting lots of tangles, and it feels healthier all around. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works great and you feel it after the first use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, but already I can tell its amazing. I have mixed hair that is heavily processed (I have a Brazilian blowout) and my ends were extremely dry/split as well as my scalp. I used the argan oil shampoo before using this mask. I decided to leave the mask in because of the state of my hair, and when I went to straighten my hair, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was! On top of that, my ends looked at least 80% better. My hair is still soft about a week later and I am very happy with this product (pair it with the shampoo!)</li>
            <li> Love this product, my hair feels soft and healthy after using.  Would reccommend!</li>
            <li> I have course, thick hair and could tell a difference in smoothness and texture after one use. I like it because while rich and thick, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look oily.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask, my hair was bleached FOUR times to get a bright red out of my hair..... and believe it or not I toned it as well FOUR TIMES, and if that didn&#x27;t do enough damage I also ran some manic panic through my hair in order to get the color I wanted!! (I LOVE my color right now but getting here was a huge process) I used this after leaving my hair dry brittle and breaking. I DID mix this with a high protein conditioner for extra hydration. It has (along with the protein conditioner) worked wonders for my hair. Don&#x27;t be confused though this is only one container of product and is not full to the brim. It is a thick consistency and mixes well with my &amp;#34;hi-pro-pac&amp;#34; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair highlighted, which is a much needed change for my dark brunette locks. I thought I would love the look (I do; golden is pretty) but I completely ruined any bit of my manga me locks. I don&#x27;t have unruly hair. I just have minimal hair and it becomes coarse due to sun damage and ponytails. I can&#x27;t hate my hair, nor myself, so I&#x27;ve grown to accept these locks of tragedy. And by accept, I mean flat iron and occasionally cry about becoming bald at forty.    After this momentary lapse in judgement to further make my follicles cry, I was in desperate need of repair. Getting a comb through my hair after conditioning would be a struggle, but I don&#x27;t own a comb, and my broken handled hairbrush was fighting it even more. I was 26 and meh going on my 40 and bald. So I&#x27;m desperate. Hence why I slugged away my hairbrush for a glass(es) of wine and ordered this beast on amazon.    I&#x27;ve tried other masks and had hopes for help that have later been unfulfilled. This, however, worked on my tresses. Am I runway material? Nope. But I am ready to face the world with less split ends and hair I can manage to blow dry, yet not be weighed down by the obscenities I did to it previously. Deep conditioning is always a pain for me: do I shave my legs and wait for this to soak in? do I fight my hound dogs off of my delightfully smelly hair as I watch Friends on netflix? do I pretend to read a book while I scoop junk off of my shoulders? Good news. This s*** stays where it&#x27;s supposed to- on my hair and on my head. I look forward to the next time I blow dry my hair out and see what it looks like. So in six weeks, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> great...ordered another jar. my hair looks better and smells even better..</li>
            <li> For my hair, which is curly, dry, and definitely tangly, this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it twice now.  I had previously tried a different hair mask, so&lt;br /&gt;I could compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;Arvazillia is the best for my type hair. It felt softer. After I straightened&lt;br /&gt;It, which I  do about half the time, it  did not look dry or straw-like.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> its a wonderful , it leaves hair soft and silky and also it repairs my damaged hair , i wonder how it will be if also we have serum and shampoo with the same effect , wowww</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good condition. This stuff makes my hair soft and shiny. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great mask! I use heat on my highlighted hair daily. This helps keep moisture in.</li>
            <li> I do like what this product does for my hair. Makes it softer and shiny. The only I don&#x27;t like is that it starts to make me break out around my face. I only use it a couple times a week, so now I&#x27;m extra careful to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on my face.</li>
            <li> Great for my Hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Curly natural hair made silky</li>
            <li> Started using this and it already has done some nice things with my hair. My only gripe with it is the application procedure. Its kind of annoying to wash my hair, apply the conditioner, and then leave it in and wash it out 5 minutes later. But for the price and quality, it&#x27;s really good. (bought it as $15)</li>
            <li> Best hair mark ever! Super hydrating and makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this mask at least once a week, and I love it. It makes my hair so soft and silky, and really helps with manageability in these humid summer months. You don&#x27;t need a ton of product to make it work well either, so it&#x27;s definetly worth every penny.  I would definetly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works great on my over processed hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. I leave it on for 20-30 min. I also use a little oil on the really dry areas before I flat iron.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my dry, curly hair, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and my hair definitely looks healthier on the days I use it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. what I can say more My husband also noticed the difference. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> This product changed my life because it removed all the stress of maintaining my hair,The unintended dread locks are gone and the long high volume fine hair is back!.I wish I had been aware of these products years ago.I am aware now and will continue to purchase and utilize them in the future..I was ready to cut it all short  because the odds of successfully  untangling my hair  were very slim.This works like magic.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after one use.</li>
            <li> this mask has left my hair feeling silky and manageable.  I definitely will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service is very proactive and attentive.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry and dull for quite some time.  I decided to try this product and am so glad I did.  It is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;After one treatment my hair is soft again.  Will definitely keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to actually review the product, as I have used it once only, but the low rating is due to a marketing machine which stepped over the intrusive line today.  Since I ordered the product, I have received at least 3 emails soliciting feedback, which I don&#x27;t mind, but somehow I was data-mined such that they found my home phone number (not in my amazon profile) and called me at home.  That&#x27;s downright creepy.  I wouldn&#x27;t like this if I had bought a car, but it&#x27;s a hair mask, for goodness sakes!  Please stop stalking me.  I might have bought the product again, but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> my hair is chemically treated ( blonde ) and very porous... trying to find a conditioner that actually helps to make it feel soft and this is by far the best ive found !  ... i will be back to purchase again...  also love the arvazallia oil ! .. great combo !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged guy with short, graying hair that&#x27;s pretty dry. This is the first product in a long time that I could actually feel make a difference. I like to use it in part because even the day after I use it, when I wash my hair again, I can feel the difference--it&#x27;s thicker and stronger and looks better.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft, but it dried my hair out more than it was, it contains alcohol and I know thats not good for hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of a recommendation and I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  It is amazing.  I have used a popular mask for several years and I find that this is just as good for half the $$$$.  I also purchased the hair oil and that is a gift for my hair.  It is unbelievable.  After using this product I rubbed the oil into my wet, thick, course and dried out hair and then styled as usual and my hair looks better than it did In my teens.  The sellers sent it to me quickly and it was wrapped well.  They even followed up the order with a e-mail to see if I had any concerns and a big list of how to use the product to get the best results and various other ideas.  Today they even wrote to me again and sent me a coupon off my next order. Amazing.  Great product and sellers.  I&#x27;ll sure be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The hair mask is great for my 45 year old - stressed out highlighted hair. It smells wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> Just received this, which I bought for my daughter, and read the ingredients.  It contains Methylisothiazolineone and EDTA both of which have been the subject of studies raising health concerns.  Not worth the risk.  Will not be using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try the product. It made my dry hair shining. It is really helpful. Great!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair and live in a humid climate, which does not help!  The mask, when used with the oil, has made a real difference in the look and feel of my hair.  I am very impressed with the professionalism of their customer service personnel.  They really followed up and were genuinely concerned about whether or not their product was working.  I will definitely purchase their products in the future.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. makes my hair soft and voluminous for a few days after use. it always feels a lot healthier and smells great for days. will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> My dry wavy hair is now hydrated and smoother. No more static electricity, easy to comb after washing. SO much better!  Also, the formula is very rich, so the product should last a while. I&#x27;m hoping the seller puts it on Subscribe and Save, I often make purchases depending on if I can get that 15% discount!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I am so grateful to have found it.  I had permed my hair way too soon after bleaching.  The damage I did really scared me.  After trying several remedies, I found this one...and it made such a difference to my hair.  Thank you Arvazallia!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I used it for first time and my hair turned out great.</li>
            <li> I loved it - I&#x27;m shocked effect of my hair after using the mask. I later buy it for gifts for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I recently had the &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; and cut off 6 inches of my frizzy and dry hair so that I could begin the long process of healing and bringing life back into my sad frazzled strands. It advises using the mask 1-2 times a week, however I doubled it due to the condition of my hair. Its been dyed many colors over the years, and I straightened it every single day for about 10 years. WOW! The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair! I was in disbelief at how soft it was. After two weeks, my frizziness and split ends have noticeably reduced! I would highly recommend the product and a nice perk is that it smells just lovely :)</li>
            <li> The hair mask has helped my hair to be softer, hydrated, and shinier.  Love the scent.  I will be trying the oil hair treatment too in the near future.</li>
            <li> Love it , it makes my hair soft and smells really great 😏</li>
            <li> My wife just love it.</li>
            <li> Thick cream, spreads easily, hydrates, and leaves my hair shiny, clean, and smelling gorgeous. I used this between bleach sessions and my hair is almost the exact same texture as it was before. Totally saved me.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I opened it and used it as soon as it arrived (which was actually 1 day earlier than the expected delivery date). I color my hair and this hair mask really helped in moisturizing my dry ends. The ends of my hair feel so soft now!</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker but REALLY good! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Awesome product. This mask was great the first day and the next day. My hair came out smooth and it smells great. I saw it on Amazon and looked at the reviews. The price was good and it delivers on my hair. Smooth and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is horrible, not only does it smell like men&#x27;s after shave, i don&#x27;t see any different in my hair, i think it made my hair even more dry, i can&#x27;t even return this product, very unhappy with this.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good conditioning product. I use it about once a week and it leaves my curls looking very healthy, but when I straighten my hair my roots look a little greasy so I have to use dry shampoo right after washing my hair, although it is possible I use too much of the product. I don&#x27;t really feel like this is a must-have product, but it is helpful for dry ends. Great customer service, they checked in with me to make sure I liked the product and sent me a 15% discount toward my next purchase. Not sure if I&#x27;ll be buying again though.</li>
            <li> This mask it is amazing !! I love it</li>
            <li> I have super dry no chemical hair! I have disregarded and thrown out the idea of ever utilizing a perm ever again. I tried the keratin and it broke my hair off and I have been nursing my hair back to health for the last two years and have seen such tremendous changes. This product will breath life back into your hair and the smell is ABSOLUTELY YUMMY! This is a must have product for any african american woman looking for an add on to their daily regimen of fan favs.</li>
            <li> It conditions great but not as great as other reviewers said. Its a great conditioner , deep conditioner don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I have thick virgin hair and purchased this because it was a little dry. Yes, it did leave it super soft but it also left my hair greasy. I only use a little on the ends. I think this product will benefit those that have their hair colored.</li>
            <li> My hair only stays moisturized the day I use it . It&#x27;s been 6 uses and it feels like it hasn&#x27;t improved my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Keeps my hair moisturized. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because of the positive reviews, but it&#x27;s not for me. I have naturally curly hair and it caused frizz and I didn&#x27;t like what it did to the texture of my hair either. I used it twice. It does smell good and it helped with tangles, but that is the only good things for me. I think my hair just does not like argan oil. I had previously tried a different brand of conditioner containing it and had a similar experience.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t write many product reviews, but Arvazallia&#x27;s Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask is a product definitely worthy of a five-star review!  I LOVE this product! I initially purchased this for my daughter who had severely over-processed color treated hair.  She had tried many of the better-known products to help the extreme brittle, breaking and thinning condition of her hair that she was experiencing. She could tell an immediate improvement with the first use, which continued to improve over the next several weeks. She first started using it every day, then backed off to 2-3 times per week as the condition of her hair improved. After a month, her hair looks great!  It&#x27;s healthy, shiny, smooth and she has a ton of new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with my daughter&#x27;s results that I started using it myself.  Wow!  Love it!  Not only did it improve the condition of my hair, but my color was immediately deeper and much more vibrant. I now use it in advance of coloring my hair and 1-2 times per week to keep my hair feeling healthy, soft and smooth. I love how my hair looks and feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  It smells fantastic.  It leaves your hair soft, shiny and manageable without it feeling heavy or oily; and it smells great!</li>
            <li> It worked so well! To start off, shipping was amazing! (3 days). The product itself, worked  beautifully!  Not to say how damn good it smelled! I had BLEACHED, not dyed, my hair ombré and plus I liked ironing my hair a lot! then I started to notice my ends of my hair were getting dry and rough. Then I decided to buy this mask (thanks to the reviews) and wow! My hair was incredibly soft and smooth. I couldn&#x27;t find the right product for it! My friends said its because I need to but more conditioner, well that is not the case! I declare this hair product to be the best hair product of the year!</li>
            <li> Probably the best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and until recently, I was a loyal Kerastase mask user. It left my hair so shiny and healthy that a friend commented he hasn&#x27;t seen my hair look so good.</li>
            <li> delver was on time. the product was what i expected it to be. made my hair silky and smooth</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff for curly hair that&#x27;s been abused by flat irons, dryers etc. big difference in my hair with only a couple of uses</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the market. It Left my hair smooth. Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations for this product, but after 4 uses I can say that I love it. I have long, frizzy, color treated hair and after I blow dry and straighten, my hair is shiny and smooth. I have tried countless other products to try and tame my hair, from crazy expensive high end to products offered in hair salons and thus far, this mask blows all the others away. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the fragrance could use some tweaking, but otherwise the formula for this conditioner is great - please don&#x27;t change the formulation! When I run out, I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for a great price. It is truly reversing my dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Have used many deep, leave-in conditioners and this works the best. My hair is significantly softer after using and it has helped reverse coloring damage. I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar and will continue to purchase. I look forward to using this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing makes my hair soft and shiny 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves hair very smooth!</li>
            <li> I used this hair mask once so far and it left my hair feeling so soft and smooth. It felt so great that I have been looking at the complete range of products to determine if there is any other one in the line that I may want to try.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft, love it</li>
            <li> I have combination hair, and recently changed back to brown hair from blonde. After years of bleaching , you hair was quite brittle and fine. This conditioner is amazing. Within 2 uses my hair was % 65 healthier and after 2 weeks it&#x27;s like I never bleached it. Love this product !</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and I can really feel and see a difference in my hair!!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner once, but I must say it&#x27;s the most hydration conditioner I&#x27;ve used for a long while.  After shampooing, I applied the condone, then left it on for twenty minutes for heat.  My hair is quite dry, so I had to use a good amount.  I shampooed, towel dried and applied Argon Oil and CHI Straight Guard.  I blow dried and was amazed at how soft and manageable my hair was.  I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair has never been so silky!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Really works</li>
            <li> Great product! I wish it was bigger, but a little goes a long way. I have natural hair this product leaves my hair very soft. I also bought the oil as recommended by another reviewer, and the pair works wonders on my hair. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service by the way.</li>
            <li> Great hair mask - leaves my hair so soft! I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so we&#x27;ll see if it stands the test of time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for a month now and it looks like this is not working for her. Her hair seems to be dryer and has more split ends.. I had high hopes considering how great most of the reviews are.. I guess just not for her hair type. She has really thick straight hair that has been damaged by ironing and blow drying..</li>
            <li> I just got it and used it once but it seems to be doing a good job.  I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to leave it on my hair for so long.</li>
            <li> The only product in the world that completely transformed my dry, frizzy, tangled, brillo pad hair!  My hair is now almost tangled free, soft and easy to manage.  I&#x27;ve spent $$$ of dollars trying to find a product that delivers!  I&#x27;m beyond happy.  I use to spend 4 hours weekly trying to untangled my dry and matted hair.  Now I only spend 1/2 hour.  I purchased 20 of the hydrating argan oil mask by Arvazallia in the last 2 weeks and plan to purchase more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone one for writing a review for this awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never stop making this product!!</li>
            <li> Just started using, I usually buy It&#x27;s a Ten Mask.  We&#x27;ll see how this competes.</li>
            <li> A great product. Really has helped to add moisture to my hair and leaves it with a soft finish.</li>
            <li> This product is made in CHINA!!!!!!!......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients and where is from!!!!... I thinking is to expensive for the price.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and works wonders for my over bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. Its a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> So last weekend, I really abused my hair like BAD ! I decided to go from very dark brown to blonde, which is stupid to attempt at home, but I&#x27;m a bit too impulsive at times. So I bleached it a few time, one after another. Stupid, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part ? It wouldn&#x27;t lift enough to tone, so I ended up dying it back to dark brown. You could imagine the state of my hair, which is waist length &amp; very thick, so I have a ton of it, which sounds great, I&#x27;m sure, until you fry it in one weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used this mask &amp; the oil from the same brand, &amp; wow ! I still need to do a protein treatment &amp; trim a few inches off, but my hair, after everything I put it through, is SUPER shiny &amp; with the exception of the the few inches I&#x27;ll get cut off, it&#x27;s actually very soft ! Color me amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more. Very fast shipping too. If you&#x27;re debating this, get it ! Seriously ! If it could make my hair soft after all of the torture I put it through, imagine what it can do for yours. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works after my protein treatment &amp; trim :)</li>
            <li> I ordered it based on the review like everyone else here. Used it 3 times with leaving it on for 5mins, 15mins and 30mins as suggested by many users. It does make my hair soft, but the softness will despair the following morning.(I wash my hair at night) It still feels like straw when I wet my hair. Mine is coloring and heat damaged vey dry fine hair. I can NOT notice any MIRACLE result at all. The scent is nice but generic, and it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.. I used Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Mask which I bought in the same order 2 days ago. my hair is still soft with the floral scent after 2 days. It costed me $3. I will have to returned this conditioner cause it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair at all and not worth $15.</li>
            <li> amazing!!! best hair mask ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I use it as directed--twice a week or so-- at night.  Following wetting and styling my thinning, colored hair the next morning, it is full, soft and behaves beautifully.  I like to use it before the monthly coloring, so it is in tiptop health before application of all those chemicals.  My stylists agree that my hair is in great shape.</li>
            <li> I love it,  my hair is damaged,  and this product is recovering it,  my hair is more healthy and soft</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiny! Love it.</li>
            <li> Did not impress me at all. It honestly is not worth the money and I feel like i could put this money towards a better product. I plan on returning this product.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used so far! After I rinse out the mask I use the leave-in conditioner for an even more amazing result. My hair has never felt so soft. Definitely buying bulk for gifts come Christmas time.</li>
            <li> Kind of dry when I opened it but the product near the bottom of the jar was useable.  I have a lot of hair so not really sure how well it worked with one little use. But the delivery was quick.  Slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve encountered. I have extremely long and thick hair (longer than kardashians Lol) and this product is AMAZING! It Keeps my hair really soft hydrated and oh so very shiny. I love it. I will continue to buy this hair mask from seller. Seller has great customer service and item always arrives on time in great packaging. Never damaged. If u are looking for deep hydration and incredible shine this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fine hair- wavy when dried naturally.  It has become fairly dry and damaged - too much heat styling over the past 10 years. Nothing crazy or drastic, but the ends of my hair are becoming wispy and dry and on bad days, straw-like, and over all my hair is a bit more frizzy.  I have tried many different professional-brand conditioners and balms. All of which have been &amp;#34;OK&#x27; but nothing that really Wow-ed me. Until Arvazallia and I have only been using it for like 3 weeks. First of it smells GREAT. But my hair has felt better, stronger, and it LOOKS much more lustrous and silky, just like how it used to.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this product and others from their line in the future</li>
            <li> I have extreme dry hair.  I tried this product for the first time and it left my hair manageable with a pleasant scent -- I didn&#x27;t have to use a detangle solution.  I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, but so far I am pleased and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Makes hair super soft!  Great product!</li>
            <li> So I dont write reviews cuz Im just plain lazy. lol. But this product here!!! So Im a 2nd time around natural and Ive been relaxer free for 9 months. Im currently transitioning back to natural and Im a type 4C. So this product HYDRATED the crap out of both my natural new growth and my relaxed ends. ESPECIALLY MY ENDS! My hair was sssoooo soft and I was able to detangle it eassssyyyyy!!!! Im so inlove with this. I kept it on overnight as a deep conditioning treatment and when I washed it out..... WWOOWWW!!!! Any 4C ladies DEFINITELY get this. Natural or chemically treated, your hair will love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weigh down my hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it will last a long time. My hair feels nice but nothing revolutionary. I have long, medium thickness, curly, coarse hair and it does the job. My hair is soft and less frizzy.</li>

            <li> Excellent product. Leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have tried everything for my dry fragile hair and I found what really works. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have used ....makes hair smooth and shiny and people ask if I got a keratin treatment to make my hair so straight and smooth! It&#x27;s the conditioner leaving hair so smooth and easy to straighten my curly normally frizzy hair .....bought again and lasts a while a little goes a long way....great product wish there was a shampoo...too</li>
            <li> Wow, from the first use my hair felt so much softer and smoother.  Almost tangle free from the rinsing out of it and made it a breeze to blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> I have very thin/fine bleached hair. Experiencing hair breakage and fried ends. The first time I used this I left it in for 20 minutes. My hair is amazing thicker and healthier feeling. I will continue to use this two times a week. I am also allergic and sensitive to many products, I had zero issues with this product. Love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice so far and leaves my hair feeling so soft. I leave it on for a while to work.</li>
            <li> In the last six months, I have been experimenting with argan oil products to improve the condition of my hair, which I color regularly (lighten) but rarely blow-dry.  In general, I would say they are all pretty effective, as long as you choose a good source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I --and my daughter--am especially pleased with this product, used weekly, and with its ability to improve the overall quality and suppleness of my hair.  After applying, I brush through with a wide-toothed comb while in the shower--and the effect is like combing butter.  I now use less of the post-shower oil, except on the vulnerable ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, my 13-year-old daughter can&#x27;t get her friends to stop touching her hair. Ah, the problems of soft hair...</li>
            <li> PERFECT, I have all the products because  it makes my hair manageable.  I alternate between conditioner and the this product.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and the smell of this product and I will buy it again when I use up my current one.</li>
            <li> This really does leave my hair soft. I love it. I use it with the leave in treatment as well.</li>
            <li> Once a week I put this on with a plastic bag, slightly heat it, leave on 5 minutes and my hair feels like I had a salon treatment.  After 3 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement where my hair isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; but is generally softer.  So for older hair this is a good investment.</li>
            <li> I am loving my Arvazallia hair mask! It works just as described. I use it a couple times a week instead of my regular conditioner and It leaves my hair very silky and smooth!. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and ordered this after reading all the positive reviews.  I have fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it. Thought my hair was &amp;#34;Arganed&amp;#34; out after using so many of the same products and didn&#x27;t think me hair would respond.  My hair is in the worst shape it&#x27;s been in after being blonde, going black, adding red, and now trying to get back to blonde.  I use this every morning and let it soak in for 5 minutes while shaving.  A little goes a long way.  It isn&#x27;t heavy and my hair is soft, shiny, and not as coarse if I didn&#x27;t use this. My hair actually feels like hair again. I can&#x27;t believe how hydrated and moisturized it makes it.  Bye bye tumbleweed.  Along with 10,000 mg of daily Biotin, this is now a part of my hair care regime.  It smells delicious.  Ordering my second jar.  After a month after receiving it, I still have 1/4 jar left, but don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I only wish it were a little cheaper, but for what it does I&#x27;ll pay $16. Much better than Kerastase and when you look at the price that way it seems a bargain.  It is much better than the $120 BOGO Trusse kit I purchased.  I truly love this stuff.</li>
            <li> FIRST, A NOTE ABOUT HAIR PRODUCTS CONTAINING ALCOHOL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty alcohols also known as &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; condition your locks. Here&#x27;s a tip: say yes, to the alcohols that start with &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;s.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Cetearyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Stearyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s easy to see why &amp;#34;alcohols&amp;#34; are confusing to the average cosmetic label reader. People misinterpret ingredients that have alcohol in their name to be the volatile alcohol that we&#x27;re most familiar with (ethanol). But, as mentioned above, fancier fatty alcohols, such as cetyl alcohol are not drying; instead, they are actually conditioning to hair and skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Cetearyl alcohol is a white, waxy, solid material in the form of flakes. It is oil soluble, but it is not water-soluble. It is a mixture of fatty alcohols. An alcohol in this sense is not a fermented mixture; it is a chemical compound of a certain molecular structure based on carbon and oxygen. Fatty alcohols were originally prepared from fats and oils by hydrolysis, which produces fatty acids. These were then hydrogenated to form fatty alcohols. More efficient forms of hydrogenation enable fatty alcohols to be formed directly from triglycerides (vegetable oils). Cetearyl alcohol is a wonderful emulsifier. In creams and lotions, it supports the main emulsion system and gives texture to the product. In conditioners, it creates a thickening effect. Cetearyl alcohol in combination with other ingredients in the formula (such as triethanolamine and stearic acid) forms an emulsion. This stops the oil and water from separating. They break down easily when applied to allow the lovely ingredients to benefit the skin/hair. Its emulsifying quality enables effective fresh ingredients to be emulsified. Cetearyl alcohol is used across our entire range of fresh products as an emulsifier. The result is an effective product, which detangles the hair, leaving it with shine and excellent condition.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND NOW, ONTO MY REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try some hair mask products, and in my search, I stumbled across several reviews of Arvazallia and what appeared to be legit before and after pictures. I also noticed this product had an AMAZING introductory price on Amazon. So I figured–why the hell not? I bought the hair conditioning mask and the oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing, I received several follow up emails from Arvazallia, who appear to be extremely invested in the satisfaction of their customers. Shorty after that, the product arrived in the mail. Simple, easy to use packaging that wasn’t leaking (plus!) and it smelled HEAVENLY! I’ve tried other argan products in the past (will review them eventually as well) but none have smelled this wonderful. Between the great price and the fabulous scent, I was hoping the product would perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used the hair mask 4 times (twice a week since it arrived) and have used the oil treatment every day for 2 weeks. If your hair isn’t as treacherous as mine, you could probably use the hair mask once a week or twice a month or once a month or whatever suits your hair care needs. The treatment only takes 5 minutes, however, due to how damaged my hair is, I did my treatments: 30 minutes, overnight, 30 minutes, overnight. I figured . . . why not? Might be overkill if you hair is generally healthy, though. The oil I used daily on the ends of my hair only, which gave a nice immediate improvement in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I love about this product: Smells fantastic, easy to use, leaves hair smooth and manageable, perfect packaging means no leaks that waste the product (considering how often this happens with beauty products, it’s worth mentioning). Quality and Value are also worth mentioning, at least at the price I bought this at. The price was unbeatable compared to similar products and a little goes a long way, so I can see this lasting me a long time. The mask may go a little quicker than the oil, only because so little oil is needed for the hair and you get so much of it, but also because I am using the mask twice a week which is probably not necessary for most people. However, I did notice that the first time I used the mask, my hair seemed to soak it all in so much that I needed to use quite a bit, but after that, the moisture in my hair was so improved that I needed much less conditioner on subsequent applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that my results are NOT due to suddenly conditioning my hair every day when I wasn’t before. I have been doing a deep treatment conditioning of my hair for months now in the same manner and using hair oils for a couple months now (and I’ve always only washed my hair once a week–before you say eww, this is actually REALLY healthy for your hair.) Those products DID give me results, however, I would say that this product did for my hair in 2 weeks what those products took 4 months to do for me, and I think by this point I was capped out on what those products could do for me. I also had to use a detangler then, but I no longer need one! So . . . yeah, I guess I’m a fan of Arvazallia now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, what I find impressive and what you find impressive may differ. My hair problems might also be different from yours. My hair is INSANELY dry and the dead ends have gone to epic extremes, so my hair needed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I will now let the before and after results speak for themselves. Check the customer images for more, along with details about how I take my before and after pictures (always on product-free, residue-free, naturally air-dried hair).he oil, only because so little oil is needed for the hair and you get so much of it, but also because I am using the mask twice a week which is probably not necessary for most people.

            <li> This conditioning cream is wonderful. I can let it sit in for a bit after taking a shower and then rinse it off later. It&#x27;s really helped with my dry scalp. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> This mask has done wonders for my hair.  It has taken care of the dryness and the breakage slowed.  I&#x27;m sure it I keep using it the breakage will cease.  Not only that is smells wonderful.  I would recommend it to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Godsend! I use it following the directions. I leaves my hair smooth and fresh. Highly recommended. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product works well at de tangling and conditioning hair but concerned with toxic ingredients from Chinese manufacture. I saw on the label that product is made in China and worried that contents may include toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and others.  Prefer a more natural ingredient product if using this product weekly on my hair. Can u confirm this product is non toxic to hair and skin by American standard?</li>
            <li> Great produt, hair feels great after the second week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice, and it&#x27;s ok.  It does the same as all of the other drugstore and even cheap conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have coarse (4c) natural hair, that hits at my shoulders when in its shrunken state.  For the price I would have expected it to be extremely moisturizing but it&#x27;s not.  After my hair dries it just feels bland, but not very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Another winner by Arvazallia.  The hair oil and this hydrating mask work wonders for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! Shopping as fast! Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Excelent treatments, leaves hair really smooth</li>
            <li> Tried this hair mask for the first time, left it on after shampoo for couple minutes, my hair feels soft and looks great too.</li>
            <li> The stuff goes a really long way. It makes my hair instantly smoother and shinier.  I use it once to twice a week as a hair mask and my hair has never been healthier. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! Really helped my color treated hair look healthy again!</li>
            <li> This really does make my hair feel stronger. I just put it in my hair before i go take a shower and let it sit in my hair for ten minutes and then wash it out.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  My hair seemed to be frizzy all the time and be getting split ends because of my shampoo.  It just looked damaged in general.  After using this product for over a month I still can&#x27;t wait to use it again and again!  It smells absolutely amazing - I find myself sneaking a sniff at my hair from time to time throughout the day (which I&#x27;ve NEVER done before) and it makes my hair shiny and smooth.  Amazing product, I can&#x27;t recommend more highly.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! After conditioning my hair once its already so soft and has stayed touchable since!</li>
            <li> Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask by Arvazallia seemed to condition my hair very well.  I left it in longer than suggested (got busy and forgot to check the time).  It left my hair extremely soft.  I would recommend this product.  I also use Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia on towel dried hair after shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair became dry after a Keratin treatment (I know it shouldnt have) After trying different conditioners I ran across Arvazallia when I was searching for hair mask on amazon. The positive reviews and prices was the reason I decided to try it. I also ordered the oil and was amazed at the transformation. My hair was restored. I like to leave the mask on for a couple of hours, when time permits.&lt;br /&gt;However it still works when I leave it in my hair for a 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say the customer service is great!!! They send a follow up email with tips and tricks</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Loved the smell and results! Arvazallia was prompt and thoughtful -making sure i was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for dry bleached hair!!! Love.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice. I&#x27;m a male with thinning hair, and this product seems to make my hair bit thicker and gives it volume instead of my old, armpit-looking hair. This product introduced me to Argan oil and I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a very long time (hopefully!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I bought this product earlier, there was a gab in the cream, showing the bottom being empty. When I sent a review to the seller, they instantly sent me email explaining that the gap occurs due to shipping, and to ensure my satisfaction, they sent me another container free of charge! They even sent a follow-up emails regarding the product and how to use it/whether I received my new shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product by itself deserves 5-stars, and the customer service from these guys also deserve 5-stars.</li>
            <li> This hair mask smells amazing! I wish I had a conditioner that smelled as good as this. My hair good easily go 2 days and still smell great. It takes a little extra time to do this mask but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> After having my first child, my hair (which is long, and used to be a lot thicker) has been falling out like crazy AND it has felt very dry/hard to comb out. I do color my hair every 6-8 weeks as well. I found this product and HAD to try it from all of the rave reviews -- after 1 use I cannot brag on this product enough! It is absolutely fantastic, and my hair felt amazing after rinsing it out, and after fixing it. I am blown away! I will definitely keep using this product. WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> My hair are black, straight, thin and started to become dry. Every time I apply Argan Oil Mask mask my hair become really soft and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I&#x27;ve tried macadamia mask, Moroccan oil masks and nothing works as well as this! Love how smooth and silky my hair feels. (:</li>
            <li> First use made my hair silky, but then my hair became even more dry!!!!</li>
            <li> My bleach ravaged hair is starting to look like normal hair and not straw thanks to your product! There is hope afterall!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Truly amazing results within 2 - 3 weeks. As its mentioned, leave the product for 5 to 8 mins before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and silky hair for 4 to 5 days&lt;br /&gt;Less hair fall&lt;br /&gt;Dense hair appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Less Organic ingredients, but wouldn&#x27;t stop me recommending to my friends.</li>
            <li> didnt notice a difference, except that my hair was super oily.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really soft highly recommend</li>
            <li> Read very good reviews and have yet to try it. Going away, will try it when I get back.</li>
            <li> Honestly who knows if this is making a difference. My hair was dry at the ends before I cut it and I guess it feels pretty good? This is fun to use once a week either way!</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product a few times and have seen NO improvement&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am 62 and know that your hair changes over time, it is color treated, and very coarse and dry......SO HELP what may I be doing wrong? Left it on 7 minutes 10 minutes and 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for replies</li>
            <li> Great product, it stopped my hair from shedding</li>
            <li> I had very long hair that was very thick but coloring it destroyed my hair. I was highlighting it blond. My hair was just breaking off. Now my hair is so damaged. This is an amazing product. It make my hair very smooth. I have tried so many conditioners but nothing worked. I was using Kerastase and that was not doing anything for my hair. This product makes my hair so smooth. I only need to leave it on for a five minutes and it works. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap. This is the best product on the market. Service is so amazing. It is delivered in one day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; great customer service</li>
            <li> Excellent product that made my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive and I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my hair after using it.  I&#x27;ll go back to regular $5 conditioned.</li>
            <li> Bringing my hair back to life! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This Hydrating Argan Oil is a FANTASTIC product - I love the way it makes my hair moisturized and straight even without using a flat iron. It is literally saving my overprocessed/dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...makes my hair soft, easy to comb and calms the frizzes.  My hair is overly processed and this Argan oil boost the shine plus it restores &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; back into the strands.  Wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> I got it for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she said she likes it a lot. I would recommend it and it also smells really good.</li>
            <li> Only used it once but my hair felt great after the treatment and it felt stronger too!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.  I have really dry frizzy hair and this definitely helps.  It feels softer and looks better.  It&#x27;s not like a complete fix but it is an improvement for sure.</li>
            <li> Great mask. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair, which is very thick and long, feeling soft and manageable. I like that it is a quick mask...no need to leave it on longer than a few minutes and no cap needed...perfect for a busy mom like me.</li>
            <li> Let me start my review by saying I am a beauty product junkie. I buy a lot of beauty products on Amazon. I have tried most of the popular products for beauty. I really liked this hair mask and it was better than let&#x27;s say 3 minute miracle but its not a miracle cure for damaged hair.I use this along with other products. I really liked the Jar the mask comes in its pretty and I like that is not another plastic bottle in my bathroom.The mask itself is thick and you don&#x27;t need much to fully saturate your hair which is a plus. I use this twice a week and it has helped repair my hair from being processed. I notice fewer split ends and it provides the moisture my fried hair needs. I really like the smell also which lingers a bit after styling so that&#x27;s a plus in my book. Over all for the price and how much product you get I would say buy this if you need to repair your hair . It&#x27;s great for an everyday deep conditioner or a 20 min. hair mask.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. I received a couple compliments the day after I first used this. I would recommend to anyone. Just wish it cost a little less.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.  I relax, color and flat iron my hair.  The perfect formula for damage if you&#x27;re not careful.  This mask has made a noticeable difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s so soft before I blow dry and stays that way after.  Using the oil Arvazilla has in conjunction has my hair silky smooth.  I have psoriasis and eczema and both products have made a huge difference in my scalp.  I will be getting more for sure.</li>
            <li> i have a lot of thin hair. I bleached it a month ago. Found my hair to be brittle and dry. Used this once for 5 min in the shower and my hair was transformed. So soft, shiny, manageable, i even cancelled my hair trim app since it was so healthy.</li>
            <li> Making my long hair really smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> From the first use I felt and saw the difference.  I felt in love with my hair all over again.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best hair conditioner in the whole wide world. It seems like a small bottle yet it lasts a long time because it&#x27;s very thick. I use it twice a week (I would recommend this method) and the smell is just gorgeous and lasts for days! I&#x27;m like in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for every time I use about a spoonful of this conditioner, apply it, then leave it on for about 5 minutes, and wash it off with warm water. It makes my hair very smooth. On top of this, I use the Arvazallia argan oil everyday which keeps my hair nice and smooth. I really wish they would have shampoo along with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Stop hesitating and give this a try; the results will surprise you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updates: 03/11/15&lt;br /&gt;Just purchased 3 more and I&#x27;m gonna share it with my friends! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good hair mask, but didn&#x27;t change my life.</li>
            <li> I hardly write reviews on products because none of them have impressed me much. I am 48 and find it hard to tame my hair as I get older due to aging hair. I color, so it&#x27;s dry, I straighten so it&#x27;s damaged, and its brittle due to both. I have tried so many products and most have not helped my distressed hair. I was poking around amazon looking for something that would help and I stumbled upon  the Arvazallia hydrating argan oil mask. Since my hair just doesn&#x27;t absorb moisture anymore I was skeptical but I read the reviews and figured why not?. Well I received it today and decided to try it immediately. I LOVE it!! Honestly my hair has not been this soft in about 6 years! It&#x27;s amazing!  Not only is it soft but it shines too. So only one use made a huge difference, I can&#x27;t wait to see my hair in a month from now. This product definitely does what it says it will do, I am hooked, I will buy again and again!. I do love my hair again!! Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> amazing for the coarse, dry hair I have.  Repairs and silkens just as promised.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.  I&#x27;ve never bought hair products online before, but the positive reviews convinced me to try it.  I have not been disappointed!  First off, the scent is quite good.  I have tried other hair products that have an overwhelming smell or scent that just won&#x27;t go away, but the Arvazallia hair mask is not like that.  It does have a noticeable scent that is a touch strong when I apply it to my hair in the shower (if you can&#x27;t do scents, this is definitely not the product for you), but once I have blow-dried my hair (blow dried or blown dry? Anyway, I digress...), the scent that remains is very gentle and barely noticeable.  For me, this is a positive thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the main issue: does it work? -- I will start out by saying I have very straight brown hair of normal thickness that I am currently trying to grow out (not that it really matters, but it&#x27;s hangs to about the bottom of my shoulder blades right now).  I have been having trouble with the middle and ends of my hair getting dry and breaking.  A few months&#x27; ago, I started using coconut oil as a hair mask once per week.  That helped a great deal to make the ends of my hair soft and smooth.  My only complaint with the coconut oil was that I have to leave it in my hair 45 minutes before showering.  I started looking for a product that didn&#x27;t take quite as long to &amp;#34;cure,&amp;#34; so to speak.  That led me to try the Arvazallia hair mask.  I use it 2-3 days per week and it really has been working well for me.  It keeps the ends of my hair soft, smooth and moisturized.  I am not having nearly as much breakage as I have in the past.  I only have to leave it in 5 minutes or so in the shower and it doubles as my conditioner on the days that I apply it.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this hair mask and I expect to purchase it again when my current tub runs out.  If you are having trouble keeping the ends of your long hair soft and smooth, then I would recommend you try this.  It has definitely helped me.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I love this stuff. No overpowering smell. It is like the consistency of tacky coconut oil. It did leak a bit during shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever!  Makes my course hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I love my previous argan oil hair mask from EVA NYC, but I was looking for a cheaper alternative and decided to purchase this one. I did not like the strong fragrance that is in this mask. It was really overpowering. It also didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair. I only bought this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair mask &#x3D;&#x3D; I have very dry hair and I look for good conditioners/masks that not only provide moisture but a lot of slip as well.  This does ALL of that.  I use this as my regular conditioner as well as a 2x week hair mask along with coconut oil 2x a week.  GREAT STUFF!</li>
            <li> Great product... quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Product works just as well as advertised--and the service from this seller was awesome</li>
            <li> My hair is so shine, smooth and pretty!!! I let this product in my hair for over a one hour and a week later my hair look and fills even better!!! I LOVE this product..</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing and makes my hair feel like silk. I little goes a long way. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have tried the product and I am satisfied so far with it. I have only used it once.</li>
            <li> Smooth as can be....for bleach blonde hair. Best product so far to restore smooth hair. Don&#x27;t be unrealistic though. If you screwed up your hair you should probably go to a salon first. Then use this as a supplement.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down my fave hair conditioner of the moment! It is thick, moisturizing and I like the light scent it has also. I found that using the hair mask every time I wash my hair (2-3 times a week) works well and leaves my hair shiny, healthy looking and more manageable! I also enjoy how the hair mask is very hydrating (it&#x27;s a deep conditioner) after leaving in your hair for about 5 minutes. Overall an excellent product, I would definitely repurchase this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and was dry and frizzy.  The product made such a difference after just the first use.  My hair feels silky and is smooth and has some shine.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hair restoration product. Especially after a long summer being in the pool with the kids, this is the best product to get my hair back in shape. Will continue using forever.</li>
            <li> I color my hair blonde, from a box, and I keep it pretty long. But even after a major trim it still looked dry and frizzy. So after reading all the reviews on Amazon I bought this miracle. My hair is shiny, soft and everyone tells me how good it smells. Once a week at night, after shampooing and towel drying my hair, I comb the mask through, pile my hair on my head, put on a shower cap and sleep through the night. The next morning I wake up, wash it out and ta-da! Beautiful, soft, amazing hair!</li>
            <li> Love this!!  I use it 2 times a week and it has helped my hair so much.....Cant go with out it now!!!</li>
            <li> Really great product, but I had to use a lot each time to fully condition my hair(which I have a lot of), so it runs out quicker than I would like. It does leave my hair really soft and smooth, especially when paired with the curl cream after.</li>
            <li> This was amazing.. It made my hair feel so soft for quite a few days :)</li>
            <li> Best hair mask you will ever have!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair mask that has given my hair softness and moisture. Not the best product I have ever used, but it certainly works for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great!!!  I have no tangles when I get out of the shower and brush my hair and my hair is softer.  I will definitely purchase this again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I really like argan for my dryhair  This is a very good quality version of it.</li>
            <li> did not full feel the expectations. ..</li>
            <li> This was my second time buying this conditioner and I still love it. It keeps my hair hydrated and leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Seems to hydrate pretty well. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Great product. Best deep conditioner I have ever used. Smells really nice too!!!.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week and i previous had thinning hair in the front and since ive started using this, my hair is much more fuller and softer</li>
            <li> This is the best hair mask I have ever used so far!! My hair is so soft and shiny. It smells great!! I would definetely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product as a conditioner once or twice a week.  Just a little bit after shampooing, I don&#x27;t wait more than a minute to rinse it off.  It leaves my hair tamed and shiny,  clean and not a bit greasy - better than other products!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical upon ordering this, but I totally loved it now and am just glad I gave this product a try!  It smells great!  It made my color treated (not to mention thick &amp; course) hair soft.</li>
            <li> Great product! I tried much more expansive brands, with the same effect. Great price, great hair!</li>
            <li> After one use my hair was noticeably healthier. My hair has been color treated for years, thin and always prone to dryness. This is far better than the Moraccan Oil or Purology Mask I was using. I used it on my friend, and she was sold too after one use. She requested I order it for her and she doesn&#x27;t care how much it is she loves this. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Amazing product! The best in the market. and I tried the best and most expensive. But this product leaves my hair so smooth and really takes away all the frizz. I have long hair and this is the very best product I had used. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this Hair Mask.  It leaves my hair softer.  I also use the Argan Oil, which has made a big difference in softening my wavy frizzy hair which is always a challenge to tame.  These products really help</li>
            <li> I have extremely tight dry curls. I use this overnight with a cap and sometimes use a heating cap for 20 minutes. Leaves my hair feeling so soft. I put a little bit on my ends before putting on my hair gel.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this hair mask after the wonderful reviews that I read.  I am an African-American woman with thick, curly hair that requires a lot of moisture.  When I received the product, I was initially disappointed with the size of the container for the price.  I have paid far less for more with other products, but I reserved judgment until after my first use.  I applied the product liberally to my hair (using about 1/3 of the jar), put a treatment cap and sat under heat for about 10 minutes.  Once I rinsed, my hair was not detangled and did not seem particularly moisturized.  I am currently wearing my hair curly without heat, so I applied my go-to products for finishing my hair and I was not pleased with the results.  I have used conditioners from the drugstore that have performed much better.  My hair was dry and the curl pattern was less defined as a result of less moisture.  This mask is marketed as an argan oil-based and I felt misled when I reviewed the ingredients list.  Argan oil is near the bottom, which means there is only a small amount included in the product.  Needless to say, I have not used any more of this product and will not purchase any in the future.  There are far better masks on the market that are much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  If only my frizzy hair had found this product years ago!!!</li>
            <li> Despite years and years of bleaching, I&#x27;ve always considered myself to have a healthy, full head of hair.  Living in an area with high humidity, my biggest concern was keeping &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; under control.  However, after just a few applications of the Argan Oil Mask, my hair feels amazingly smooth and silky throughout the day and even beyond shampoo to shampoo.  Initially, I had expected the need to use the oil after each shampoo but not so.  It&#x27;s lasting conditioner remains with your hair - truly a must have!</li>
            <li> Gives me silky soft hair. Shiny and healthy looking hair after use. The transformation is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, and damaged hair.  This mask did a good job restoring some softness.  I only used it once so far but I think it will help a lot with further use.  The scent is very pleasant also - would recommend.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome for my hair!  i just got highlights again, i had been coloring it all dark and I had forgot how much bleach fries your hair.  ANYWAY this stuff is super thick and oily, which at first freaked me out bc my hairs is fine but WOW it is wonderful and is making my hair like SILK :) i was concerned by the price that it was going to be cheap and low quality but it is just a great bargain and I am a happy happy customer!</li>
            <li> I have used the mask twice now. I can tell a difference both visibly and to the touch. My hair is smoother, softer. I have thick, course hair. The five minutes it takes in the shower are definitely worth it! I have also put just a small amount in my hair after the shower and left it, no heavy feeling, just more smoothness! My only very minor issue is that the smell is a bit strong and off-putting going on, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so so so soft and moisturized.  This is the best oil mask ever and I will never use anything else for my deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Oooohhhh wow, it is one of the best masks that I have used, and here is how I use it, I wash my hair then I towel dry, and them a ply the mask and leave it for 2 hours and rinse</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and brittle after a chemical treatment. I use this mask as a conditioner on a weekly basis and saw drastic results.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!  I color treat my hair and it tends to be dry. I noticed a difference after the first use.  I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Argan oil, which I LOVE, and I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I have very dry hair and I live in Florida (dry hair + humidity is a disaster). I will never be without either product again. Honestly, you can&#x27;t go wrong. This mask leaves your hair soft and silky and it smells amazing. You will love it, don&#x27;t hesitate to try!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have for years tried many others and none have given me the soft, smooth &amp; hydrating feeling. My husband, friends and family have commented &amp;#34;what have you being doing, you look great&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This product was very moisturizing to my hair. My hair was very dry and breaking off. It did moisturize my hair but didn&#x27;t really stop the breakage. I still enjoyed the mask a lot! I would suggest you sit under a dryer 30 minutes for extra moisture, like I needed. I would definitely buy another jar. This is a great deep conditioner and an alternative to a protein treatment .</li>
            <li> The best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells nice</li>
            <li> its really nice but the quantity is not worth the price. you can get equally great product for less the price</li>
            <li> excellent.  Just don&#x27;t overuse, will make your hair flat rather than straight.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and was expecting it to be awesome, but it&#x27;s lackluster. I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a guy, 60, and I keep my hair shorter than years past. But, for whatever reason, when short my salt and pepper hair is wiry and dull. Tried a couple products, then this one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Washed my hair, smeared this stuff on and went to wash the car. Got home, rinsed it out easily with warm water only, and VOILA! Hair was a noticiblly softer and shinier!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this did not weigh it down. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is straight up AMAZING. If your looking for a deep conditioner i definitely reccommend this! For years my hair is damaged from all the heat from straightening everyday and the first time i used this just rinsing out my hair in the shower i knew this product was fabulous. Everyone is different, i shampoo then apply this product then put my hair up in a towel for about 20 minuets. Then rinse :) i swore on Its a 10 products for deep conditioning but this blows them out of the water. I use this product once a week. You WILL fall in love with your hair again!</li>
            <li> This product saved my hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, colored, DRY hair and once I used this product it turned my hair to silk.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable item that I will be sure to keep stock of.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves my thick and frizzy hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> One of the best intensive treatments for my hair. My hair is very fine, dry and tends to loose it curls 1-2 days after washing it. 2-3 days later it tends to turn into a spider web material. This product added body and structure to my hair without weighing it down and maintained the curls for a whole week. I didn&#x27;t use it for a long time yet, so it remains to be seen how it holds up several months down the road.</li>
            <li> One of the better masks I have tried. I&#x27;ve used it three times so far and really like the shine and softness. Still on the hunt for a better one though. I will use up what I have but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Yes! This is the Best Hair Mask and Conditioner, I have ever used. It does not leave your hair weighed down.  It leaves your hair feeling light and strong. You will feel and see the different in one single application.  It works on all hair textures.</li>
            <li> Gift for someone else, but thank you!:)</li>
            <li> I just answered that I hadn&#x27;t had a chance to try this yet, and when I tried to submit it, it didn&#x27;t submit.  Now it seems that maybe it did go, when I was on another email.  If not and you don&#x27;t get  my first answer, send this again. Thanks  Now I can&#x27;t submit this either. I&#x27;ll have to complain to my computer person, but it will have to wait till tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Amazing, smells great, leaves my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I have horrible split ends--always have and always will. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, expensive and cheap, with very little difference. This one, though, has helped tremendously. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It makes my hair softer and it seems healthier after using this mask. I have blonde hair with highlights and my hair is naturally wavy so also a bit dry and prone to frizz. I try to use it twice a week. I have long hair and want to keep growing it so I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this mask.</li>
            <li> Oh where oh where have you been all my life? I have thick, coarse, curly, crazy hair that needs something to nourish and love it so that it will behave and this stuff does the trick. I am so mean to my hair. I wash it everyday, I use heat on it everyday. I blow it dry, I flat iron it, I color it because I have gray hair, I am just abusive to it. And this stuff just seems to take all of that abuse away. It makes my hair soft, it makes it lay down better and it smells good too! This is now added to my must haves in hair products. If you are on the fence, get some, you will see!</li>
            <li> My individual hair shafts are fine, but I have a lot of hair and it is somewhat wavy. It gets very dry and brittle particularly on the ends from coloring and using the hair drier, flat iron and hot rollers. This product, on first use, softened the broken ends and seemed to retexturize my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it did or not, but it certainly feels different and it seems to work better than having my hair conditioned at the salon. I use it about twice a week. This is more than recommended, but I really love how it makes my hair look and feel. When I use it, I don&#x27;t use my conditioner. I&#x27;ve also noticed that using the mask has even helped my hair on days when I only use a conditioner. My hair shines more. And I just can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference after the first use, I&#x27;m loving it. I hadn&#x27;t wash my hair for 5 days and it was already oily before and I&#x27;ve terrible flyaways. After shampooing last night, I put a lot of the product on my hair and waited 15 mins to rinse it. After it&#x27;s almost completely dry, I apply  coconut oil. I woke up this morning and omg, It&#x27;s like a different set of hair on my head, doesn&#x27;t look oily but super silky and looks healthier. I wish you could use it more often!</li>
            <li> Great product! Really helped to make my hair smooth and less dry now that the weather is colder and air is drier.</li>
            <li> Great Product, left my hair smeling great and very soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement. If anything felt like it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> One of a kind hair conditioner! After reading all the reviews and deciding to purchase it, I have to totally agree with other people that this hair mask is the best! I&#x27;ve had my hair bleached a lot and it became dry, frizzy and dull. I thought of finally doing something good for my hair and reached to Amazon to find this mask! Just after one application my hair got really soft, hydrated and easier to handle. Besides, I love the smell of it. It&#x27;s worth all the money and what&#x27;s more important it regenerates the hair in such a wonderful way. I would definitely buy it again! Happy good hair day!😀</li>
            <li> This product is well worth purchasing. I have stressed hair from coloring and heated styling. Although I have a lot of hair it is very fine. My concern was this product wound leave my hair feeling heavy. I&#x27;ve experienced just the opposite. My hair is looking healthier, it&#x27;s more manageable and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair is fine and color treated. This treatment leaves my hair silky, shiny and very easy to style. I recommend this product with no reservations.</li>
            <li> This definitely makes hair smoother, but for me, the results don&#x27;t last any longer than normal conditioner. I also have to leave it on ends only, as conditioners leave my hair greater than I like. I would buy again, but I wish I could find something that truly has lasting results. Smells really nice though and I can get massive snarles out of my daughters hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this hair conditioner so far. I could not resist buying more than one. It leaves hair soft and supple. I use twice a week. So far I am in LOVE</li>
            <li> hair Fall got increased :(</li>
            <li> My favorite hair treatment product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair mask! I can truly feel &amp; see a positive difference in my hair after just a few uses of this stuff! Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it</li>
            <li> I loved it. My friends noticed the difference when I used it. My fine hair look fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> This is a really good, hydrating mask for damaged, Latin hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it smells great and makes your hair soooo soft! I use it twice a week and leave it in for about 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair soft. Just make sure to wash it out thoroughly because it left my hair oily</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference</li>
            <li> first though when I saw it was &amp;#34;China product&amp;#34; baah.  but when I tried I was impressed. It really brings more nutrition and shine to my hair. I&#x27;m really satisfied. it smells delicious! actually I used it as conditioner every other day. love it !</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional and far exceeds my previous expectations. I have used the hair mask for the past few weeks and it has made my hair healthier, more shiny and prevented breakage. Lyfe and Style Goods was very professional and dilligent in following-up with me to determine if I was satisfied with the purchase. They also sent me a detailed email after purchase which explained how and when to use the hair mask. I highly recommend Lyfe and Style Goods.</li>
            <li> My hair is 3 feet long and silver/white (natural) - lately, it&#x27;s been snapping off at the slightest provocation.  In an effort to curtail the breakage, I invested in Kerastase conditioner plus a couple of other popular brands.  Kerastase didn&#x27;t change anything about my hair for even one day and it&#x27;s supposed to be one of the best.  This Argan Oil Mask kicked its ass all over the place.  Problem is, I liked it so much, I started using it as my daily conditioner.  With hair my length, it lasted about a week.  I&#x27;m ready to whack a foot or so off of it so hopefully the one I order today will last a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I did not receive any free product - I&#x27;ve never gotten anything for free in the history of &amp;#34;ever&amp;#34;.  Besides, I hate not being able to trust reviews because of all the corporate ass-kissing that goes on behind that practice. I would never lie to my peers just so some company could sell another bottle of conditioner or whatever. (People, you gotta quit supporting corporate greed like that.  For the uninformed, if you want to know how corporations work against us, google &#x27;Monsanto&#x27; for a little enlightenment.)  The way I see it, no one will be truly honest because that would be the end of the freebies.  Yes, I digress.  Wanted to unload that while I had the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, loved the hair mask.  Kinda wished it smelled differently, not that it smells bad or anything.  Just not my personal aromatopia.  So 5 stars earned from me.  And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve probably earned some nasty comments regarding my opinions so bring &#x27;em on.</li>
            <li> WOW!! I was super sad as my hair resembled a stack of hay if I may say.. but this mask does wonders... When I apply it my hair feels wonderful, manageable and has a shine. The in between days that I don&#x27;t I still can feel its effect. My hair has definitely improved that is all I can say!</li>
            <li> The best hair product I&#x27;ve used so far. I have really fine/dry hair that gets tangled like crazy no matter what I do. The very first time I used this product, my hair felt so silky and strong! I actually use this as regular conditioner 3-4 times a week which is much more frequent than what the instructions suggest, but haven&#x27;t noticed any problems yet.</li>
            <li> This product is simply awesome. It gives my hair life and makes it so soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair look &amp; feel. I have thick, long, silky hair naturally...all i wanted was nourishing. this does just that. Hoping it would repair split ends.Why only 4 stars? Well am starting to think this is making me flaky...all my life Ive never had dandruff...for the first time..after about 4 uses of the mask...am seeing flakes on my scalp. Is it taking away from my scalp, the good its doing to my hair?! Not quiet sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a region with dry air so I need mositure for sure.  This is a great conditioner to add but I havent used it long enough to observe any significant improvements to hair.  Smells good also.</li>
            <li> Loved, loved, loved this hair mask.  After using it my hair is super soft.  My natural hair color is dark brown almost black and have been bleaching it blond for the past year and a half.  My ends are sometimes dry after blow drying and straightening my hair.  And after using this product my hair looks and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after just purchasing my second Hair Mask, which tells you by itself: I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly, however I straighten it every day. I think my hair is naturally a dirty, strawberry blonde. Although, I&#x27;m not really sure, because I&#x27;ve been coloring it for awhile. After being (an idiot) adventurous, I went from blonde to brown and back to blonde. I had never had issues with my hair until I went back to blonde. It started looking fried. I tried a few masks, but was not impressed until this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the texture and it&#x27;s easy to get out of the container. I get the best results when I put it all over my head and then, using a wide tooth comb, comb through my wet hair. I&#x27;ve left it on for as little as three minutes and as long as ten. It does work better the longer you leave it on, but even at 3 minutes, I love the results. My hair is so soft and the smell, oh man, the smell is amazing. I&#x27;m a little sad about probably getting &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to the smell like we humans typically do, because I have to sniff a little harder now. My boyfriend loves the hair and how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m interested in trying it as a leave-in and letting my natural curls roam free. I hate them though, so, as much as my hair might enjoy that, I always feel like a poodle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, totally buy this!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time using the product. I have no idea how well it will work &#x27;repairing&#x27; my hair, it is an excellent conditioner. A little goes a long way. Immediately softened my hair!!! Will add to review add a later date if it restores my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I bought both products for my hair since I wanted to try something different, and I am very impressed with the results,  my hair looks silky &amp;  manageable plus the smell is amazing! !! Cant complaint, great price, great quality....</li>
            <li> I have been using the Arvazallia Oil for the past couple of weeks and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently started using the Hair Mask and it has become one of my favorites.  I was previously using the Kerastase Mask but this mask moisturizes my hair a little better than the Kerastase.  I usually keep the mask on for about 15 minutes, with or without heat and once I&#x27;ve rinsed it out I apply the Hair Oil and proceed with blow drying and flat ironing my hair.  My hair looks so much more healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the past few times I&#x27;ve used the Arvazallia mask I have less shedding/breakage than I did before.  It also makes my natural hair really curl up and shine.  It also smells great so that&#x27;s also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this as my primary conditioner as long as it continues to work as well as it has been.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair so soft, really takes frizz. I&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding conditioners and hair products that tame frizz but don&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This does exactly that!</li>
            <li> Amazingly surprise with the results!! Love it.</li>
            <li> Wow great product and outstanding service, thank you!</li>
            <li> Is a fraud! I don&#x27;t think it even has argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even bother!</li>
            <li> I am in awe of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always been thick, frizzy, and generally poofy so I&#x27;ve had to contain my natural waves with gel products that left my hair feeling gross and took away my volume. On top of that, lately my hair has been very brittle and breaking easy, so I thought to try a deep conditioner to help with the dryness. I&#x27;ve used a keratin mask before and another pricey product by Redken, but saw no noticeable difference in the texture of my hair. Thank goodness this popped up on Amazon or else I would have never known its wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the mask a couple of days ago and left it on for seven minutes. I could already feel a difference in my hair when I was rinsing it out--it felt heavier, fuller, but not in a weighed down way; it felt healthy. I air dried and put no additional product in just to see how my hair would naturally look with just this change alone. Unfortunately, my waves lose all sense of shape without some holding product and my hair still got frizzy/poofy, but I wasn&#x27;t put off by this because that&#x27;s hoping for A LOT with my hair. I ended up straightening and my hair was so incredibly soft, sleek, and shiny so I was very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try deep conditioning again last night and left it on for about 20 minutes. My hair felt even better than before when I was rinsing it out! I decided to add a lighter mousse to contain my waves and let it air dry over night. This morning when I woke up, my waves were absolutely gorgeous. They were fully formed and voluminous, they were soft, and they were shiny. My hair has never looked like this before! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have bleached super processed hair colored with purple. This is one of the only conditioners that will allow me to wear my hair straight without looking damaged and overly processed. For the folks that need extra moisture due to processing I highly recommend it! smells great too!</li>
            <li> Amazing! My hair has never been so shiny!</li>
            <li> This is the First time I am buying something to treat dry hair. After the long winter, my hair got so damaged like never before. I have only applied this product once, so I am going to have to update this review after a few more tries.&lt;br /&gt;So far, your hair gets incredibly soft and it really changed how it looks. It does not help with frizziness tho, but it does get softer and silkier.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair conditioner I have used. I take medicine that affects my hair.  My hair is very dry and is very damaged.  I have used It&#x27;s a 10, Macadamia, Moroccan Oil and a few other good ones, but this is the best</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing product that I cannot be without anymore. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now, it&#x27;s that good! Be sure to try ALL of their products, you will NOT be sorry!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product great results! Natural look with confidence!</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged ( poor coloring job - outside in Az sun &amp; swimming)  Add to this I am very close to 70! This product really works! It is a keeper! I leave it on for about 30 minutes every other day. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a month so far. It has not stripped the color from the hair, either. My hair looks really great!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s fine in texture but the hair is dry. This product is great. It moisturizers the hair and never leave the hair too soft or flat. I use this product two to three times a week.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very smooth and manageable!</li>
            <li> I did not expect much and extremely skeptical.  I have tried so many brands on earth.  I gave it a try because of those crazy positive reviews.  In my mind was thinking &amp;#34;really?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy and fast delivery. Smell not bad. FEEL fantastic (both hand and hair).  Does not dry/dehydrate my hair (I have dry hair).  Like it very much.  Feel way better than my Paul Mitchel&#x27;s Hair Repair which I have been using in the last twenty years. Much better result.  Will keep buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product leaves my blonde hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely coarse and dry due to extreme process.  I was desperate for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this amazing product and from the first use I use it I was hook on it .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Isabel</li>
            <li> it works well and have seen improvement. I die my hair a lot and have it curly so this product is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> luv it..my hair us really smooth and soft ...easy to comb</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great and works great! Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It didnt really do anything to my hair. Used it on the first night for 10 mins and no results. Thought i&#x27;d give it another shot the next day for a longer period of time and still no difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your hair reeking of an overpowering (bad) men&#x27;s cologne. I hate how pungent and long-lasting the smell is even after my hair dried. I regret spending my money I spent on this jar. I definitely will not repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel soft after using it, but there are plenty of hair conditioners and masks out there that can do that AND smell good.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this conditioner. Makes my color treated hair soft and silky and healthy looking for 5 days at a time. I use it every 5 days, leave in for 20 mins, followed by Morrocan oil and my hair looks and feels amazing! A definite must have!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try the Moroccanoil brand restorative hair mask, but it is SO expensive. While searching Amazon, I came across this mask and for a way better price I decided to try it. My hair has been so dry for the past 6 months and the only thing that seemed to help was deep treatments at the salon. This mask is so rich and creamy! My first application I was hoping for just a mediocre amount of moisture and I was very impressed. After one use my hair was shiny and healthier looking - like after my salon visits! I have long hair (almost to my butt) and was afraid I would have to use half the container but honestly, a little goes a long way. I used about a Tablespoon amount on my hair (just from neck down - I don&#x27;t condition the top of my head). So this will last me quite awhile. I use it once a week as suggested. Hope they don&#x27;t change this! When I run out I certainly will want more! Oh - and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I love the results I am getting! My hair tends to be frizzy and dry but when I use this (twice a week) I have noticed the frizz going away and my hair is looking shiny and healthy looking. I will defiantly be purchasing this again once mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth and soft. I love it and I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great Mask for fizzy, curly and color treated hair. I use once a week with a cap... smells great too!</li>
            <li> .After hair oils, hair masks are my next favorite thing. I always make sure I never run out of hair mask because without it, is just not the same for my over-processed hair. After I tried Arvazallia Hair Oil, I could not wait to try their hair mask. Arvazallia Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask smells wonderful and untangles my hair instantly under the shower. The results are conditioned, moisturized, soft, silky and healthier hair. Another great thing is that this mask is 100% sulfate and paraben free, but unfortunately contains silicones, which I wanted to mention in case if this is something you are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;_______________________&lt;br /&gt;PR Sample. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who does everything to their hair. My already dry tresses were getting pretty worked over by the curling iron and the coloring. One use of this and voila! Silky, more controllable hair. Light, fresh fragrance too. I was starting to get into  the $25 conditioners, so I&#x27;m glad I found something that works really well for a little less.</li>
            <li> My hair is visibly and physically softer after using this hair mask. I get so many compliments about how soft my hair is, it&#x27;s worth every cent. The smell is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product more than one month ago, and have been using it once or twice every two weeks along with the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner, the mask makes my hair so soft and I do have colored, thin but strong hair, and it detangled my hair so well and make it so smooth. Will definitely buy this product again for future hair mask.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! After first use my hair was silky soft. Love it! Good price too.</li>
            <li> I used this product weekly until my hair became softer and had more body.  Now I only use it once a month.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Hydrating ArganOil Hair Mask is very nice and you use very little so for the price it will be worth it.  I would buy from this seller again.  I was pleased, it was on time and sealed well too.</li>
            <li> It is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> great smell and fantastic conditioning. my hair is so healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> This hair mask was nice an thick. I used it as a pre wash deep conditioner and then as a leave in and was really happy with the way that my hair felt. I would definitely try this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I love it.......</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely oil....the softness was somewhat there but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The oil smells great and does leave a nice sheen. More importantly, the company stands by their promise of customer satisfaction. The pump on my oil didn&#x27;t work after a few uses so they replaced the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve had great results with my hair. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the product is sourced from China. And while the formulation is good now, who knows what it could be like in the future. We&#x27;ve all seen stories about how China sneaks in cheaper or dangerous ingredients when no one knows. So I like this, but encourage the company to source it from the US.</li>
            <li> After trying many different (failed) hair products, I stumbled upon this one. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try because it has such great reviews and it&#x27;s a pretty good price. It came in last night and I immediately hopped in the shower. My hair gets tangled SO easily and it&#x27;s always frizzy. I felt this condition and detangle my hair the INSTANT I put it on. And on top of that it smells sooo good! I left it in for 6 or 7 minutes and then rinsed it out. My hair wasn&#x27;t tangled at all and I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it. Even 24 hours later, my hair is still so soft and shiny and my sister wants to order some now. I definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> It did exactly what everyone said it would do.  My hair feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have used the Hydrating Argan Hair Mask twice since I received it in the last month and already I have noticed that my hair ends look healthier.  Additionally, I loose less hair when combing and brushing.  So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.  My hair is very long and wavy.  The mask has also made setting my hair easier.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this hair mask! I have thin hair that tends to dry out in the heat and this product moisturizes it nicely without a heavy feel. I will be ordering this again when my tub runs low.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair since I was 18, and as such is tends to be very dry. This product really helped that</li>
            <li> First time I used this product and it made my hair soft and silky. Glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Great product i fell in love with this hair mask.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silky soft after using this! I have colored hair that is rather thin and flat. This conditioner gives it gloss without making it heavy or greasy. I wish I had the time and money to use it more often!!</li>
            <li> I have dry curly/wavey/frizzy hair, and this product makes my hair very soft and manageable. I use it once a week and it has made a big difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, I just haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything amazing and the consistency is a little strange (it&#x27;s kind of chunky).  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, it just isn&#x27;t as good as many other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I love these products. The oil smells great and it&#x27;s not greasy!! I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is growing. I have frizzy, curly fine hair. The mask is awesome too. It leave my hair so soft and managable. I will most definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this hair mask. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because a little goes a long way (I have very long and thick hair and found that this small jar lasted several uses) and because it leaves your hair smelling AMAZING. Aside from that, I did not notice a difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper! My hair felt super soft, moist &amp; light; not coated or weighed down. I love Argan Oil. Pleasant smell too. I have 3b/3c hair and the curl pattern is amazing</li>
            <li> My hair feels sleek after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use this product，It&#x27;s really wonderful！I love it so so so much！It smells good and my hair looks much better！</li>
            <li> If you like putting crappy product in your hair ,then this is just for you!</li>
            <li> leaves the hair moisturized</li>
            <li> Love it. Saw a youtuber rave about it &amp; i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> MIRACLE WORKER!!!!!! I had been suffering from extremely dry hair for the last 2 years before I purchased this product. My hair had been severely damaged due to (4) failed attempts to do an ombre color on my hair. Instead of the beautiful, magazine-like ombre, I ended up with fried hair that looked, and felt, like hay. I tried every deep conditioning hair product out on the market (because regular conditioner was a joke)....and nothing worked. That was until I found this Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner. It has been my lifesaver!!!! Not only did it exceed my expectations, but it smells amazing. You will notice a significant difference in your hair after your second use. My hair feels like silk, and all the damage has been reversed. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone battling the &amp;#34;dry hair&amp;#34; blues. I will never ever use anything else!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Have used many conditioners and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I bought this 3x already and i love this product. Highly recommended EXCELLENT 100000 stars :)</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm : ) soft silky curls.. MAKE SURE YOUR HAIR IS SOMEWHAT WET LIKE AFTER YOU WASH IT AND RUN A TOWEL OVER IT. It will absorb much much better and is amazing ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> This hair mask is amazing!  My hair was so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and have noticed an improvement after the first time I used it. Someone else posted in a review that they use it overnight and I think I might try that and see if I get even better results!</li>
            <li> This hydrating mask made my hair feel smooth and look healthy.  I have relaxed hair and is in need of a touch-up at 8 weeks when I first used this product. This made my hair look like it is newly relaxed with beautiful shine and body. When I rub my fingers through my hair, I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and silky the strands felt and so much body and shine!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the hydrating argan oil hair mask.My hairdresser told me to find a product that adds moisture and  strengthens.&lt;br /&gt;I have super fine very curly hair and so usual curly dry hair products weigh my hair down. Not this one! It&#x27;s a winner with regular treatments and I even put in alittle for a leave in conditioner to help smooth hair and ease comb out.&lt;br /&gt; I would  buy this again.</li>
            <li> best hair product ever ! hair was baby soft for days after use</li>
            <li> Pretty good..didn&#x27;t stop breakage..but soft manageable hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing ... Left my hair super soft !! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Leaves my hair feeling soft and looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair feels soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I have only tried this product once so far.  It made my hair look dryer and more frizzy.  I will give it another try before forming a final opinion.  I feel that&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great and it makes my hair very soft. I will continue to purchase these products.</li>
            <li> This hair mask smells amazing and works very well. I got it because I planned to do a lot of swimming this summer in a chlorine pool. It&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very soft and healthy feeling. I tried a different product a couple of years ago that cost more and found no difference in the feel of my hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best! my thick super long coarse frizzy hair is smooth and soft after just 2 uses. the price was great. I love it!</li>
            <li> Its no work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Oh my god! I&#x27;m addicted to this product now. I&#x27;ve never had such a silky hair after using it</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all! Great product!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to friends and family.  You can see the difference in your hair from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product! It feels great, smells great, and other people notice the difference it makes when I use it.</li>
            <li> This hair mask smells great and works wonderfully on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and shining. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I loved how my hair felt! I have never had so much shine and the smell was amazing. I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has changed my daughter&#x27;s hair completely. She has very very dry, course thin blonde hair. After just 1 use her hair is smooth as silk. We only shampoo and condition 2-3 times a week. After wasting tons of money on produces finally something that works!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my hair feel absolutely amazing. My hairs currently in recovery from all of the ironing and bleach put in my hair over the years and this stuff makes my hair feel like there was never any damage done. Its super hydrating and my hair will feel weightless and look super shiny and healthy. I use it once a week on the day where I&#x27;m going to use a hot tools and it treats me phenomenal. My ends are smoothed and there&#x27;s very little frizz. Will definitely be ordering again along with the argan oil serum.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair mask in the market!!&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and color treated medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to apply additional products after I leave in on for 5 min with shower cap.</li>
            <li> I had intended on ordering another brand that was much more expensive and then saw this as I was searching.  It is equally as good and about half the price.  I will order other hair products from this line as I run out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I noticed the difference after first use. My hair looks and feels much smoother. Great product for the price. I will buy more from the same brand. Highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Love it! :)</li>
            <li> So far so good. Every time I use it I get immediate results. I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now and am very pleased with how soft and less frizzy my hair becomes -- I just stay to live running my fingers through my hair! I&#x27;d recommend this. I also use Moroccan oil which it&#x27;s nice but this works better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!  I have been using this religiously every week.  I apply it on my entire head and wrap my hair in a towel and in the morning wash as usual and reapply on the ends and it has brought my &amp;#34;damaged hair&amp;#34; back from the dead.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this is the only one that has worked.  A must try!</li>
            <li> Turned my frizzy curls into bouncy hydrated curls!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST conditioner I have ever used!!  I have purchased this twice now, use once a week and my hair has never been so silky and healthy!!</li>
            <li> Good product for hair treatment. Recommended for loss hair problem..</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing!!!!!!!  I am African American with curly/wavy hair.  I stopped processing my hair a few years ago.  So I have found it difficult to maintain a straight/blow dry look without it getting frizzy.  This stuff works awesome!! I live in the Atlanta area, so the heat and humidity are fierce.  This condition leaves my hair soft, bouncy and still holds my curls in the heat.  It makes my hair look like I just stepped out of the salon.  I have just purchased the hot oil treatment to go along with it.  I still use the Mizani smooth guard serum to blow dry my hair.  With this conditioner, the serum works even BETTER!  I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair looks shinier and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I love the oil so I got this to try. I used it last night and my hair has never been this soft. It looks soft and shiny. I love the smell, I love smells on hair and makeup products but did find this almost too strong but it&#x27;s worth it. I will continue trying this and update in the future. My hair is basically all white under my jet black hair color so it&#x27;s coarse and fades fast. I absolutely love the oil and what it&#x27;s done for my hair. Wonderful products and cheaper then most salon stuff. Give these a try if your struggling with your hair. It took a week of using the oil to get what all the rave was about and I&#x27;m hooked. My hair soaks it in. These are my HG treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I love it. I think I can fairly say it&#x27;s better than any mask I tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried some high end stuff!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. You can definitely tell it is making a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soooo incredibly soft. You have to be careful and not use too much, though, or your hair will be INCREDIBLY greasy and weighed down. Pretty much a perfect product. Only thing I would change is the packaging (kinda boring) and the scent (not really good). Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff. I use it almost every time I condition because I have such dry hair. The only other thing that would work as well would be an expensive salon brazillian blowout.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. It moisturizes my hair all day, and it still keeps the hydrating a few days after I used it. The scent is also good, and the price is not expensive, which makes me feel free to use it abundantly. You know using a great amount of it is better than using a small portion of another better one. All in all, I can rate it as five stars.</li>
            <li> This product is AH!Mazing and smells great! My hair feels and looks healthier.This is now my go to conditioner.</li>
            <li> Hair was coated and dry. I have normal kinky curly hair. My hair is dense, armpit length, 4a. I tried clarifying and applying, as a rinse out conditioner, as a deep conditioner, as instructed and a couple other ways, but in the end my hair was not happy.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.  Is heavy conditioner so don&#x27;t use it but once a week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. And after so many try-and-fail&#x27;s with other conditioners, I honestly feel like I finally found one that works (yay)! First let me say that I have a mixture of 4a/b hair and my crown is 4c. I also have low porosity hair. My regimen is to put this in for about 10 minutes under a cap and I feel it inject a volume of health to my hair.  When detangling, it just melts like butter.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hair Mask. Helps to preserve my color and hydrate my fine hair. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> When an Argan hair mask that I had previously been using was no longer available, I went in search of a substitute that, like the other, was in cream form for easier application.  I settled on this brand, and I haven&#x27;t regretted it.  Although the cream is a little loose and can slip through my fingers, it&#x27;s much easier to use than straight oil.  I leave it in my hair while I complete my shower, then rinse it off to get super-silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this only once a week, although there&#x27;s no reason why someone couldn&#x27;t use this every day, especially if you have straight or treated hair.  It does relax curls a bit, so if you&#x27;re going for a curly effect, it would be better to use a different conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week and it makes my hair smell so good and feels really soft that I cant stop running my hands through it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deep conditioner to use. I put it on once a week and sleep overnight with it, and my hair stays soft and shiny the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful and the smell and texture of the product is great. It isn&#x27;t runny but it also doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great hair product! This leave in conditioner and mask is the best my hair has never felt better been thicker with great shine.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft. This is truly the best mask I have ever used;)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful conditioner for your hair.  You can use it as a mask or even as an everyday conditioner.  It is not super heavy.  Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair mask at the moment, as it makes my hair soft and well moisturized. I use this 1-2 times a week because I use a heat tools on my hair and it needs as much moisture, nutrients and pampering that it can get. I used it once and I seriously saw results that had me hooked on this product! It&#x27;s made of high grade materials and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced - it&#x27;s truly worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve found. First I use a good clarifying shampoo, then I put this stuff on and leave it in for a little while I finish the rest of my shower. It makes my hair feel like butter!  You do have to be careful to rinse it thoroughly or it&#x27;ll leave some build-up.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this Hair Mask.  It not only works great..... but smells WONDERFUL  !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This mask makes my hair incredible.  I also put it in my curly headed daughters hair.  Normally she has very Frizzy hair and now she has wonderful, beautiful curls and everyone thinks she used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that. I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like so that’s why I need something that actually helps to nurse my hair back to health. Most shampoos/conditioners/hair masks nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is great about the Hydrating Argan oil hair mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sulfate free. If you didn’t know then sulfates is what makes the shampoo turn into a thick lather in the shower and is also used in other household cleaning products. This is what actually causes frizziness especially in curly hair and damages hair that is color treated and makes it fade off quicker. It might take a little getting used to it because it doesn’t bubble up like typical shampoos do. It is also known that sulfates might cause cancers so that’s something to take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;*Paraben free. It has been found that parabens contain agents called xenoestrogens which are what mimic estrogen in the body and what has been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues.&lt;br /&gt;*Includes Argan and Macadamia oil. Argan oil is one of the best oils to use in your hair, especially because it improves the texture of your hair follicles, also works as a repair treatments and heat protectant. Macadamia oil on the other hand helps to prevent against hair breakage by penetrating the scalp and hair follicles to improve hair strength and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;*got a fresh floral scent to it&lt;br /&gt;*is for all hair types&lt;br /&gt;*helps to repair the heat damage and fully hydrate your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big junkie when it comes to hair masks because of my frizzy ends and trying to find as natural products for it as possible. I used to use coconut oil but argan oil is hands down the best for everyone&#x27;s hair. The way I used it I just applied it on my bottom half of hair (never apply hair masks and conditioners on scalp because it has no effect other than making it oily) and left it in for about 15 minutes before washing it off. Besides smelling really good my ends felt moisturized and definitely weren&#x27;t as frizzy or dry. I attached a picture to my review so you can see how it made my hair look silky and soft without any frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free in an exchange of an honest review.oil is hands down the best for everyone&#x27;s hair.

            <li> Works well for conditioning my dry and brittle hair but it stinks. The fragrance is awful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Works well on curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with naturally curly hair. I used this two days ago on wash day. I washed my hair, towel dried it, applied the conditioner, and let it sit for one hour under a plastic cap. After rinsing the conditioner out, blow drying, and flat ironing my hair I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this because my hair felt kind of oily, but soft. I wrap my hair nightly under a satin scarf. In the morning when I let down my hair it did not feel oily anymore but still soft. I think I will continue to use this product. I can&#x27;t say that this is the best product ever, but it met my expectations. I think it is also worth mentioning that I have been experiencing hair breakage (from using too much keratin) , and that my breakage slowed down after using this product</li>
            <li> Luxurious.  Great smell.  My hair is softer</li>
            <li> The good: The one time I used it, it did make my hair softer. The bad: This smells like an old man&#x27;s aftershave and my co-workers kept saying I smelled like a man. :( Even my husband hated it. Not for me, wish I would&#x27;ve known the smell before purchasing it. Yuck-o.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil Hair Mask seemed to seep into the hair and make it softer and more pliable. I will continue to use it a few times a month to keep my dry ends up to shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent  conditioner,  a little bit goes a long way. My hair was extremely dry prior to using this conditioner. I would say this aid works for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hai very soft until the next wash and then all of the benefits go down the drain. Probably not worth the price but I&#x27;ll enjoy this tub while it lasts.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible!  I am bi-racial, and I have crazy, curly, colored, and dry at times hair.  This product is what is says it is.  It hydrates, it detangles and leaves your hair feeling healthy and good after just one use.  I am so excited that I found this deep conditioner, and I will definitely keep using it.  I have had really good luck with their shampoo and conditioner too!  Definitely good stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.I got it over and over again.It has wonderful aroma and it makes my hair look healthy and smooth.Best argan product I ever had :-)</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this deserves it! I have been bleaching and dying my hair often for the past 5 years. One use completely brought my hair back to its natural healthy feel and made it shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how soft my hair feels after using this product. The company recommends leaving it on for a few minutes but I leave it on for at least ten, twice a week, and get great results. I have wavy/curly hair that is always dry on the ends and so has been hard to grow out because the ends keep splitting and my hair looks bushy. This hair mask really smoothes it out. My ONLY slightly-not-great review is that the scent is a bit masculine, like AXE body wash, but the product is so good that I don&#x27;t care. The price is fantastic for such a large jar of it, too. Finally, I appreciated the two follow up emails that the company sends to make sure that you have no issues with the product and to offer a coupon as a thank-you gift. Buy it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so good that I honestly don&#x27;t care what dark powers were summoned or how many virgins they had to throw into volcanoes to make it happen.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now and it has stopped breaking</li>
            <li> When I first got this I noticed it was past the expiration date so I was pretty bummed expected it not to work well but tired it anyway. I left it on for about 20 mins. It work very well. My hair was very soft and felt healthier.</li>
            <li> What a great product! Noticed a huge difference with just the first use.</li>
            <li> Great product. i bought this product couple times and never had any problems nor dissatisfaction. Excellent quality  And excellent service ,fast shipping</li>
            <li> Makes my natural hair soft and moisturized. Great for twist outs.</li>
            <li> Amazing...  love this product</li>
            <li> Thickening and soft , with small amounts . Smells good if you&#x27;re hair is dry and brittle then this is for you.</li>
            <li> The smell is so awful it reminds me of the cheap aftershave that men used in the 70&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again and get this horrible smell out of my nose. As nice as my hair feels after using it, the nauseating fragrance cancels out the benefits.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this Deep Conditioner Mask in my hair care routine. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after going through most of the reviews, but I am glad I went with the majority and decided to buy it. I am black and my hair is really curly and kinky. I took a break from my straight hair and decided to deep condition and moisturize my hair before I went back to flat ironing my hair again. I used this conditioner at least twice a week and my hair did feel softer and moisturized. I will definitely be including this in my curly to straight hair regimen! Oh by the way did I mention it smells good??</li>
            <li> Smells like a dream, works really well. My hair felt very soft after using it. BUT it is a very small amount for the price. It is not as full as the picture shows, not even close. Just over 8 ounces for that price? I will stick with my products from Sallys that give me much more bang for my buck and work just as well.</li>
            <li> This extremely hydrating hair mask is my favorite in the bunch. I’ve used a couple hair masks in the past and this is definitely my favorite. As soon as I apply it to my hair, I can feel a difference. It makes my hair extremely soft, 100% tangle free, shinier and just easier to manage. Best of all, it does all of this in 3 - 5 minutes. If you don’t have much time in the shower, no problem because you don’t have to leave this in for a long time to reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this once or twice a month in place of the regular conditioner. After rinsing it out, my curls are more defined than with regular conditioners. When my hair dries, it’s not dry and fragile as usual, but keep in mind, I do use a leave-in moisturizer as well (by another brand). Regardless, I definitely think this is the product to thank for more manageable curls and less frizziness and dryness once my hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use a hair dryer or blow dryer; I simply braid or twist up my hair and let it air dry. The end result is a head of hair that I can be proud of!  received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> My hair had been very dry and brittle at the ends, but after just one use of this stuff, it was soft again. It is amazing! My only complaint is the perfumy smell, but it goes away after I style my hair with my regular hair product.</li>
            <li> I dont see a big change in my hair after using this product but it does feel really soft when i rinse it and it easier to comb after using this</li>
            <li> Is the best hair mask for my hair.i love it</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I can feel the difference with just one use. It has helped my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference by the first try! I have really thick curly hair and it worked great. It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I have recently tried this hair mask and the results were amazing!  I have a naturally dry and unruly mane and this product left my hair soft and manageable...I was most impressed!  I will definately purchase again and look forward to trying other products by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li> I received this hair mask a month ago in mid july and was so frustrated because I had high hopes for this product since the reviews were so positive. This product had EXPIRED since March and that is 4 MONTHS AGO. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!!!! I JUST WASTED $17 ON A PRODUCT I WAS HOPING WOULD WORK EVEN A LITTLE FOR MY DRY HAIR. This did NOTHING for my hair. There&#x27;s really no difference between this expensive EXPIRED hair mask and the cheap ones you can get at Walmart. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li> The immediate difference in my hair after the first use is amazing! My dry, flyaway hair that resisted taming with several other treatments is now soft and shiny without any greasiness. I&#x27;m so impressed with this product I want to buy as gifts for my friends who have the same complaints as me about their hair (the over 60 crowd).</li>
            <li> Really great product. Saw results after first use. Nice, attentive sellers too!</li>
            <li> After searching thru Amazon and ulta, I chose this product. Even tho I was a little concerned with the reviews because I have fine hair, I must say it&#x27;s wonderful!!! For almost a year now I have been using Redkens Body Full, my hair just seemed to be getting very dry. I used this mask the very first day and it was just a wonder how silky and shiny the results were. I would just say go for it, this mask is worth the dollars and the time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my hair is always so soft and manageable after using it.</li>
            <li> I did not see a miraculous hair transformation, but using this along with a good hair trim has gone a long way to making my dry, over processed, over colored hair look much healthier!  It is definitely easier to manage along with being softer and shinier.  Good deep conditioner :)</li>
            <li> This is great for all hair types! I use this before using a home steamer. My hair feels revitalized and super smooth!</li>
            <li> I would not have given any star if i had a choice. I had an allergic reaction to this product. After the first time use, my skin broke out and my ears around the hairline became so red and itchy. My skin has not been that sensitive to any products in the past and this is the first hair product that i had an allergic reaction. I&#x27;m returning the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using its a 10 but sick of paying the high $$ I found this on amazon and thought I&#x27;ve been paying double this whole time and this is much better. Smooths my hair great no frizz soothes damaged hair seems to restore hair after the wash but once you use another product the effect doesnt remain what I mean is using your normal conditioner, but hey if you could afford to use nothing but deep conditioner every wash you&#x27;ll be fine.For me thats not realistic because I like to leave this in for an hour and blow dry before rinse. give it a try</li>
            <li> One use and I was hooked. I color my gray hair and it leaves it dry. This product made my hair smooth, silky and shining like a diamond! Couldn&#x27;t stop running my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Hair feels really soft and silky.  I would recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Max123</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good. I&#x27;ve used several products like this one and I can tell you that my hair feels really smooth right after usage. I would continue to use the product to see any long term effects. Overall, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> No obvious enhancement of my hair quality after couple weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! My hair is so soft and smooth after I use it! I will continue purchasing this!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have chunky highlights and mosturizing once a week is a must for me. This product leaves my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and I apply this every after shower and my hair is so smooth! I will difinitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this! I will buy it again and again! It made my coarse, dry hair soft and touchable. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Took a couple treatments to notice a difference but since then it has kept my long hair feeling soft and healthy. I use it 2x a week.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! Makes my color treated hair super soft and tangle free.Have tried more expensive products but this really gives results!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair is so soft and strong  thank you</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle for women with curly hair! I have tried many products without having much success. This makes my hair smooth, frizz free and managable. Do not hesitate to try this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!!! In one use my hair felt so healthy, i box dye my hair straighten everyday and this is some amazing stuff highly recommend</li>
            <li> IF YOUR SEARCHING FOR A PRODUCT TO HYDRATE YOUR HAIR, THEN THIS IS IT!  IT LEFT MY HAIR &amp;#34;LIKE BUTTER&amp;#34;  SMOOTH &amp; MOIST.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this product makes brushing an ease...shines and smells good also.</li>
            <li> After I rinse, I put this on after my morning swim twice a week, and then shower when I get home (my pool is a 5 minute walk :). It really helps with that nasty feeling you get from chlorine. My hair is super soft, shiny and smells great! And, I&#x27;m pregnant, so it helps...</li>
            <li> Love how my hair looks, smells and feels after this treatment.  Helped get my hair back after using that terrible Dr. Bronners peppermint soap on my hair!!</li>
            <li> I love it! My hair is dry and terribly damaged.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using all kinds of treatment mask pack or oil. some were good but some were useless.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can feel much better the day after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb diggity. I was hesitant to purchase but this conditioner is fantastic, it leaves my hair manageable but not heavy. I recommend highly if you have thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The best Hair Mask I ever used!</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask. It&#x27;s thick and creamy but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. My hair is very happy with this mask. It leaves it softer and has more shine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it almost three times a week. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask twice so far.  I like the smell and gives my fine, highlighted hair more volume.  The reason I only gave it four stars is because previously I had been using Moroccan Oil Hair Mask and had slightly better results.  I decided to try this brand because of the great reviews and better price.</li>
            <li> Excellent - my hair is so soft my 10-year-old granddaughter remarked on it. -</li>
            <li> I have Curly thick hair, This product moisturizes my hair and leaves it feeling soft and less frizzy and smelling wonderful. I do find it to be less creamy and it just feels like a regular conditioner, unlike the Moroccan brand where it is thicker and feels more like a treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, I put it on my hair for couple hours and when I wash it off, it makes my hair shiny and bouncy. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Luv this product! Leaves hair soft and silky! Just ordered another jar!</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;m satisfied of the result!</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells really good and because the product is very dense, it leaves my hair super soft afterwards, I will definitely repurchase once I&#x27;m running low!</li>
            <li> Truly amazing results within 3 to 4 weeks. Thank you, finally hair product that I can trust.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and silky hair&lt;br /&gt;Hydrated scalp for 3 to 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;No/ Less Hair fall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Less Organic Ingredients than expected but this wouldn&#x27;t stop me from recommending to my friends</li>
            <li> Wow oh wow! I just received this in the mail yesterday and tried it out today. My hair feels amazing! I have tried so many types of shampoos and conditioners, attempting to soften my coarse hair. This was fantastic. One use and my hair feels smooth and silky. I cant wait to use it again. It performed better than even much more expensive conditioners that I have used before.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It does help to control (but not totally eliminate) frizz.  It smells really nice and you use it in place of your regular conditioner after shampooing.  You&#x27;re to leave it on 5-7 minutes, but for my hair which tends to be coarse, I will sometimes leave it on longer.  Overall a good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used to get the macadamia nut hair mask by another company but this works just as well, smells great and is cheaper!</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair the morning I was going to dye it.  I put my hair in a braid and left it in all day.  When I got home I dyed my roots without rinsing this.  Not only did it allow the dye to do its job but it didn&#x27;t cause my hair to be stiff or course after the dye was rinsed out.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great, even smells great and to top it off the company has first class customers service.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels amazing.  I always get compliments for my soft and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I really love this product after twice used. My hair feel soft and moisture. No doubt that I will use it more. Just apply it in your hair after use the shampoo, then slightly massage your hair from root and wait from 5 mins to 7 mins, finally, wash your hair with warm water. I feel great whenever I touch my hair now.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did nothing for my hair.  Would not purchase again!</li>
            <li> is all I have to say.  The moisture in the product supercharges my hair that is always dry.  Smells lovely too.  I just wish I had an option of purchasing a bigger container of this product because as now, this 16oz only last through 3 deep conditioning sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love it and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price because of how well it works on my dry, kinky curly hair.  I love using this product prior to straightening my hair because it helps seal the moisture into my hair since I only deep condition/straighten once a week!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates my hair without weighing it down.  Smells pretty good and the price is fair, although we always wish it was lower.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! I would definitely buy it again. My hair is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and smooth. It helps you to manage it way better. It also lasts long. I like it.</li>
            <li> This has helped my hair so much. Its softer and shiney but it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily. I wash my hair and then put in the mask with a shower cap and sleep with it on and rinse it out in the morning. My hair would look perfect if I trimmed the split ends off. I would  definitely recommend this, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I knew it is made in China.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, pure and simple. My hair felt - and looked - incredibly soft and shiny after just one use. (I sound like a paid spokeswoman, but honestly, it&#x27;s that good)!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium length, thick, and has a mind of its own, thus I&#x27;ve  been at its mercy, rejoicing when it decided to behave, and bemoaning its stubbornness  the other 364 days of the year. After using The Argan Oil Mask I&#x27;m finally able to style my hair and not worry that in 10 minutes it&#x27;ll look like a rat&#x27;s nest - or something you buy on a stick at halftime.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and smooth and dry faster</li>
            <li> My hair was already amazing. I met this girl who ran her hand through my hair and said &amp;#34;Is it always this coarse?&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t believe she knew what she was talking about but it got me thinking. The price for this product was low enough that I figured it was worth a try. I have only used it twice in one week. I did not like how my hair turned out the day after the first use, but now my hair is really soft. Still amazing but softer now. The same girl who made those comments about my hair hasn&#x27;t mentioned any positive changes, but she also hasn&#x27;t mentioned being coarse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there you have it.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes shiny after using it twice.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky smooth!  I have thin hair but many layers. I suffer from frizz and dullness. Very first application was mindblowing. My hair feels new. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. I&#x27;m so happy and I&#x27;m definitely buying from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This Hair Mask is the boom</li>
            <li> I COULD NOT GET TO MY COMPUTER FAST ENOUGH...i had to tell whoever is reading this review and thinking of buying ...do it .&lt;br /&gt;i spent the better part of last week crying because i thought u had ruined my hair..i was on amazon not really looking for something to fix it ...i came across this product....as usual you amazon reviewers came though for me again...this product is everything and more honestly my hair is back...they say &amp;#34;fall in love with your hair again&amp;#34; that is TRUTH in advertising.</li>
            <li> This stuff has such a nice scent and leaves my hair feeling silky.  I am fairly critical of hair products, but the only criticism of this is that it is expensive.  That being said, a little goes a long way.  This impressed me enough that I will be investigating other products by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My hair has been damaged and very dry and brittle, the first treatment was a huge turn around. Left my hair smooth and silky!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CONDITIONER! Smells and works great. 5 Stars...</li>
            <li> love it love it want more</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves my coarse, curly hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> This really works to smooth my hair and keep the curls/waves without the frizz!</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.  It smells fantastic and makes your hair super soft!  I have fine hair that gets greasy quick (yuck), however I actually use this every single day as my conditioner.  I use it from the middle of my head and downwards, trying not to get my front, or top hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or feel like there is a film of buildup on it.  My hair feels so soft and the smell lasts all day.  Great product, will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have used in a very long time.  Used with their curling cream and just LOVE the results.  Smooths and defines with a small amount of product.  A little goes a long way.  Happy, happy, happy hair...</li>
            <li> Protect my hair and works well.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner!  Works well for my thick, wavy, rather dry hair.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> After years and year of putting my hair through the ringer, all that dying, flat ironing, curling, and blow drying has final caught up with me. And now the struggle to get my hair back to it&#x27;s original healthy state begins. My hair is pretty damaged thanks to my colorist&#x27;s royal screw-up-- long story short she fried my hair to breaking point when I went back to blonde. I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair somewhat healthy for over 6 months now-- I dyed it back to my original brunette color, trimmed it, limited heat exposure, put in oils, used the best shampoos and tried just about every treatment I could think of. And unfortunately for me and it&#x27;s still pretty damaged. While some products and treatments helped--the state of my hair wasn&#x27;t improving as much as I would have liked it to. That was until I tried the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Care System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product truly work wonders. Much like all of you, I was skeptical about trying these products. I thought what&#x27;s so different about this line compared to others and how can it really help my hair become healthy once again when I&#x27;ve tried so many others who&#x27;ve failed. Well I&#x27;ll tell you why this product really works and how much it&#x27;s improved the state of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first time you will notice a huge difference in your hair. Not only does the texture improve but that dry, unmanageable hair becomes silky, soft and luminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these phenomenal products to all of those people who&#x27;ve given up on the idea of restoring damaged hair and also to those who want to prevent their hair from ever getting to the point of no-return. Not only will this hair care line help you restore already-damaged hair but it will nourish and hydrate curly, color-treated and heat-exposed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review on my blog- Meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.

            <li> I use it for my daughter&#x27;s they get horrible tangles....I put a small amount on in the last few minutes of their shower and their hair feels wonderful and combs right out! I use it in my hair as well for the same keeps my hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> Excellent treatment. Somehow magically allows me to start from scratch with my hair when it gets damaged and overworked!</li>
            <li> This hair mask .is enriched with Argan oil .i apply only once a week,it works well ..i m very much impressed with this</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have dry curly hair and this product really makes my hair feel and look soft!</li>
            <li> This helps my hair a lot....feels so soft!  Great!</li>
            <li> Been using it as my main conditioner for every wash. Love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair smell. I only used it a couple of times but its amazing ! Esp with my frizzy dry hair from hard water!!</li>
            <li> New customer, for life. I lol love how soft and shiny my hair is. I&#x27;ve used it twice a week for two weeks now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I do leave it on a lot longer than recommended in the instructions though, as a little extra treat for my hair once a week.</li>
            <li> The tub was not as full as it could have been (about half) but I love the product! My hair is soft and shiny as promised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Recently bleached my virgin hair after 18 years of refraining and was appalled by how it stole the lively feel from it. Luckily, I found this stuff, which is more effective than the Biolage products I use, and it is totally repairing my hair. My stylist told me to leave it in for 30 minutes and rinse it in the shows. You will NOT regret the decision to purchase- it really works.</li>
            <li> I love it . I love the oil more that this but is works well</li>
            <li> I used in my daughter that have a blonde curly hair, and because she likes to swim and go te the beach always her hair is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;Really  this product work fantastic, the hair looks silky , soft and shinny,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomended  this treatment for everybody with very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and easy to manage and the smell is nice.works for my daughters hair also.would recommend definitely</li>
            <li> This smells really nice and makes my hair soft. I am not sure how much it repairs damage, but generally seems to work well. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This really helped my sun bleached summer hair.  A friend recommended it to me and it is very good quality.  A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair feel really soft and smooth after I use it. I find that I get around 7 or 8 uses out of the container. I have really long hair and apply a good amount each time. I think it works best if I take a shower and only shampoo my hair and then put it in and let it sit over night. I will definitely buy again and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this product; It has revitalized my hair that was dry and brittle. I will use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It makes my somewhat damaged hair from a straightener nice and smooth again!</li>
            <li> Really terrific mask and YES, it really does take ONE time only to see results!&lt;br /&gt;Very hydrating, yet hair feels and looks clean and shiny. I&#x27;m happy I went with the rave reviews I read and gave this a try....a total winner. You can safely apply it from the roots to the ends, without the hair looking flat...smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very  subtle and pleasant., great deal.</li>
            <li> Anything that is Arvazallia is the best hair product you can buy. This product has transformed my hair. It is stronger, thicker, longer and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Frizz -gone! I cannot say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER! Is like magic in your hair. Love it</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff if you have dry frizzy hair. really works</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the rave is about on this product. My hair actually feels extremely dry after I use it, even when I leave it in for a long time. I was really disappointed with it, especially after reading all the hype about it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and will never go back to regular conditioner again. Thank you for changing the way my hair looks are feels. SO soft!!!</li>
            <li> Fix my hair up really nice.</li>
            <li> Is ok! Not like I want it!!</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  Great smell.  Made my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Really good product, I use it twice and my hair is soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my very dry hair.  Some actually make my hair worse!  This is really different, though.  It makes my hair very soft and shiny without taking out the curl. It also smells really good without being overwhelming. Very nice product!  It&#x27;s a keeper for me!</li>
            <li> Great product, made a huge difference in my coarse hair. My hair never felt so soft before.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two so fair and I will continue to order. I have tried everything for my dry hair but when I order this I fell in love with it. One wash and you can see and feel a deference.</li>
            <li> I have insanely overprocessed hair, this stuff has saved my hair! My hair went from feeling like dried up straw to feeling like a newborn kitten. VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> My hair is getting better!!!!</li>
            <li> My new best friend! Feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most effective conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried. After using, my curly hair is bouncy and I always love how it looks. It feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is, I think my hair is too damaged that when I don&#x27;t use the product, it comes back to its damaged and dull look.</li>
            <li> Just as a FYI, it&#x27;s only one thing. I was under the impression that it was two separate  items,  unfortunately I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Wow. Just. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What my hair has been through: Two bleaching sessions (one left in far too long, leading to scalp burn), four dyes, and very irregular conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two treatments and...it&#x27;s like the hair I had at twelve. Just a stroke of the brush on any section and it&#x27;s tangle-free. Even the tips, which had become so damaged that I had to attack them with my brush, are now separated and I actually can&#x27;t even see any split ends! How?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting this in my husband&#x27;s hair, soon. Not that he needs it. But just to see what it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended.</li>
            <li> This conditioner mask is great- It leaves my hair feeling so silky, and when I comb through it wet after the shower, my hair is nearly tangle free. It smells amazing and works wonderfully. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is great hair mask I ever used....great product!</li>
            <li> It does make my hair more shiny, i feel. I dont use it everyday though... twice a week.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter, she told me she loves it</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She says it works very well. Leaves her bleached and damaged hair feeling silky smooth and is helping along the repair process. She did complain that it smells like musky men&#x27;s cologne so 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I simply loved it. It is the first time I buy this product and my hair was soft and brilliant.</li>
            <li> I use the mask 3 times a week plus their Argan Oil and Cream daily.  My curly/wavy hair is soft and shiny now.  I love these products.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, saw a difference!-</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job! My hair feels a lot better!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair monthly for the last 2 years or so and it can feel pretty fried sometimes. I&#x27;ve been using this twice/week and when I do my hair feels like it does when I get home from the salon! It&#x27;s very thick and super hydrating but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily whatsoever. I highly recommend this stuff and plan on buying more as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick, dry hair which after 10 years of highlighting and processing and now with some gray has gotten very course and dry.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different conditioners and this is the first that leaves my hair silky smooth right out of the shower. I typically have to put some sort of detangler on my hair to comb it out before styling, and I don&#x27;t have to do that with this conditioner. It works great and I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It makes my hair so soft and the smell is sooooo good. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioning product.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair soft and shine. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my GF for Xmas and she is absolulety in love. Her hair is so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I just received this jar today.  But I was surprised that it is made in China.  I don&#x27;t expect that this conditioner is from China.&lt;br /&gt;I will return it without trying.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product one time, and had to throw it out.  The fragrance is so heavy that it will knock you over.  If you love perfume, you will love this product.  But I hate it.  Applied it in the morning, and my hair smelled &amp;#34;perfumed&amp;#34; all day, didn&#x27;t have time to shampoo and wash it all out until the next day.  A little bit of fragrance is nice, but way too much in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Left my hair beautiful after just one use.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! My hair is shoulder length, thick and wavy/curly. Back in October I had my hairdresser strip it from red (which I&#x27;ve had for years) to a light brown with blonde highlights. So, I needed something to really condition my hair as I&#x27;m trying to grow it long again. I&#x27;ve only used this twice, about two weeks apart. I washed my hair and towel dried it, then put a nice amount of this on my hair and left it on for about an hour. It left my hair incredibly soft and strong. Love it!! Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This Stuff SMELLS SO good and it makes my hair feel AMAZING!! i highly suggest this product. :) i will for sure buy it again!</li>
            <li> Very fine product.  Leaves even the most chemically processed hair feeling healthy and revitalized.</li>
            <li> Saved my hair. I posted a review on the oil as well but wanted to share about this product as well. This is amazing. Not only is my hair soft now but it looks super healthy. I am deployed and the water was doing some serious work on my hair. It looked dry and I was terrified I would have to cut it. Thanks to this my hair again looks healthy. Well worth every penny spent. I will continue to order this even after I go home.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after my first use, and my hair is DRY.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft. I dye my hair very often and for about 20 years now. It&#x27;s very dry. This helps put moisture back and soften it up!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product really keeps my hair nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I love this product the first time I used it my hair felt so soft and looked so healthy.......love it !</li>
            <li> It gives a really nice shine to my hair, and as an additional plus, I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> This made my hair very soft. It feels a lot healthier now! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this deep condtioner!  It smells really good too. Leaves my hair feeling so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky soft and very manageable</li>
            <li> The description is right on point! Love how my hair feels ;)</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but it worked as advertised.  The product rinsed out without leaving my hair oily but instead it was soft and lustrous.  It smells nicely, too.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hair treatments I&#x27;ve ever used. Even my hair stylist loves what it does to my hair. I will never use another product. Although I think I&#x27;ve tried all the other ones out there already. You need to try it for yourself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nope did not see what fuss what all about, not for my hair</li>
            <li> I was really excited about using this based on the reviews and the fact that I use pure argan oil on my hair with great success. However, this just isn&#x27;t doing it for me; it smells great and feels soft while on, but always leaves my hair feeling dry and looking frizzy. It always takes a couple regular washes after to get my hair feeling normal again. I&#x27;ve tried leaving it on both longer and shorter times, but always get the same result. I have fine, wavy hair so maybe it&#x27;s just not the right product for my texture.</li>
            <li> I have been battling with dry hair for as long as I can remember. It gets so brittle and damaged (especially because it is on the thin side). I have to use so many hair products in an attempt to keep it hydrated. Before this hair mask, I used the Macadamia hair mask (http://www.amazon.com/Macadamia-Oil-Deep-Repair-ounces/dp/B002WTC37A/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1433441510&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;hair+mask). It was alright and I thought it was working. BUT after using this mask I was absolutely blown away by the immediate results! After just ONE use my hair has become SO soft and SO hydrated I can&#x27;t believe it! I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair! How is it possible to have MY hair this soft? (WITH JUST ONE USE!!??)&lt;br /&gt;This mask is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair and this is one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. It is heavily perfumed, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for how much of the product you get. However, the quality of the product is not impressive. It seems like cheap really thick conditioner.  I do really like the smell its a very clean but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Works great my hair has never felt to soft and silky</li>
            <li> Loving this so far need another:)</li>
            <li> This works great! And it smells so good!  I cant wait to try the rest of the line!!!</li>
            <li> It works as described.  It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I thought; it looks like a smooth cream, but it&#x27;s an almost solid paste.  Work it through with some water.  You can even leave it in the hair, if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I recently permed my hair and my hair got a lot drier. So i got Arvazallia hair mask to condition my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of my hair definitely got lot more stronger. And my hair definitely got a lot more shinier. And the permed curls are well maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product for curly or permed hair.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to test this product! I have fully highlighted hair, and was shopping around for deep conditioners as my $150/tub of Oribe was quickly running out. Very happy to report that Arvazallia not only produces better results, it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m definitely trying their other products!</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair!</li>
            <li> Love it! Only after one use, I can feel my hair is so soft and easy to handle!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent that&#x27;s great but when I applied it to my hair it dried really fast but leaves hair feeling sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It felt like I had glue so even when trying to comb my hair gently it was getting tangled.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is it attracts dirt it&#x27;s like a dirt magnet for your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as my everyday. But everyday I do, my hair feels smoother, silky, and less brittle. I&#x27;ve got dry thin blond hair and this mask conditions and infuses my hair without weighing it down. I have Moroccan and Bumble products as well, but this is my new fave.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I use it as a deep conditioner, once a week, and add a little extra Argan Oil.  My hair always feels so soft afterwards. This is my new go to deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and great seller!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Wonder mask. Left my hair feeling like sil. Great, great conditioner</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is having hair issues.  Her hair grew back after chemo with very coarse out of control hair.  Then she added hair dye which didn&#x27;t help.  So, she tried this and it made her hair softer and she doesn&#x27;t look like a live wire anymore.  She is happy with it and is using it 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this 2-3 times weekly and my hair is soft and more manageable. I have highlights in my hair and my hair is damaged with dry ends. This also smells so nice and my hair is so silky soft after.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very curly and frizzy hair. When I straighten my hair, it is still frizzy. However, if I come out of the shower, put this stuff on my hair (I leave it in for about 10 minutes before washing it out), let my hair air dry overnight, then straighten it, it is much much sleeker and shinier than if I had just used my regular conditioner (which I still use). Another plus is that it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-The tub is SMALL. I have a lot of hair, so I go through it pretty quickly and it is not that cheap.&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t see the results unless you use it. For example, if I was my hair today and use it, and don&#x27;t use it next week, it&#x27;s not like my hair will still be shiny and sleek because it was actually repaired from the previous week&#x27;s use. If you use it, you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, made my bleached hair soft and silky after just one use, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this mask. Not to heavy OR too light. Definitely will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product. Have been using it for about six months now and planning for the next order now. I used to have wavy and frizzy hair but this product has solved all those problems for me. It&#x27;s made my hair soft, silky, shiny and straight. Love the smell too. I definitely recommend this product to everyone who have dull and frizzy hair. Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> As reviewers have noted, this is truly an excellent addition to a hair-care stash</li>
            <li> Just used this product for the first time and I must admit, it works really well!  I have fine but very curly hair that is greatly affected by humidity (which in NC in June is high).  I probably didn&#x27;t even keep it on as long as suggested and it still made my hair smooth and really soft but still very curly.  I love it!  It does have a stronger scent than I would prefer, but that rinses out.  If this smelled like Aveda for curly hair it would be a perfect product...but I will buy again as it really works.</li>
            <li> I have my hair colored on a regular basis and I have quite a bit of grey.  So, my hair is dry.  This mask makes my hair soft and shiny.  I would recommend it for anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other hair masks, but this one is the best!  First of all, I have very thick, wavy, color treated hair.  I also have dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and then worked this through.  I wrapped a plastic bag around my hair and let my hair soak it up for almost 10 minutes. Rineed hair as directed.  It was so easy to comb!  After I blew it dry, I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth it was!  It is shinier and more manageable than it ever was.  I will always have this on hand. I love my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Worked well on colored/bleached out hair</li>
            <li> I have hair damage from extreme coloring (blond). Smells great. My hair feels soft and looks smoother after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients list several silicone-ish products, but considering the sporadic (1x week) recommended use, not going to worry about it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> MOISTURIZING! I had recently lighten my hair from virgin black to blonde, so with that comes dry, brittle hair. This conditioner is essential as it revitalizes your hair. I wash my hair every 3-5 days using this product. It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Smells great and works even better!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Good packaging; no leakage. Love the stuff. Even though it is not specific for hard water, it helps to untangle my snarls from the water and my dry hair.  I am a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really WONDERFUL.  My hair has never been more soft and silky, and the results truly last through to my next shampoo (about once a week)!  I have type 3c hair, fine and soft tight curls.  I was in dire need of another Brazilian keratin treatment until I used this conditioner.  It makes my hair so silky, it&#x27;s super easy to comb through my hair after using it.  You&#x27;ll want its partner, the Argan Oil Hair Treatment, for extra shine and styling manageability.  So it&#x27;s saving me money by extending the time between my expensive Brazilian keratin treatments!  I&#x27;m usually a product junkie and switch brands often, but I&#x27;m sticking with Arvazallia Hydrating Argan Oil Mask (and the hair treatment) for a long while.  Even if I end up trying something new, I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;ll come back to Arvazallia&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> withholding a few stars as the hydrating mask  does have a cloying perfume scent.  Would prefer either scent free or a more natural scent like coconut oil - even lemon oil ,etc</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair bleached for the ombre look and although my hair stylist was careful not to fry my hair, it was very dry after. I already have naturally dry hair since it&#x27;s curly so processing it only made it worse. I waited 2 days to wash my hair after I dyed it and used this deep conditioner. It immediately made my hair incredibly soft. I was able to detangle it very easily and when I washed it out it felt like silk. I&#x27;ve since used this 2 times and each time it is amazing. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I relax my hair every six weeks and the damage can be really brutal.  I have tried dozens of products and this is one of the best! I would recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from hair color. I ordered a few products to try and I&#x27;ve been really happy with this one. It makes my hair soft and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t have that dried up colored look anymore.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly, good product</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. My curly hair is tamed and much softer with reduced frizz after using it as directed. That said, it takes 5-7 minutes to work on towel-dried hair and then has to be rinsed out, so one has to plan for that. I tend to take short showers, so that&#x27;s a bit of a hassle for me. Nice customer service follow-up with a coupon.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing mask!! I needed a mask that would provide good moisture without leaving my hair heavy and greasy. ..this mask does that!</li>
            <li> I guess its very early to say but I can feel my hair softer and better.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Really made my hair smooth and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;this product makes my other conditioners obsolete.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because i have really dry hair after i got it dyed and i was recommended to use a deep conditioning..i read great reviews and decided to buy it...i recieved it on that said..but i was very disapointed becuse its been expired since march...😔</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says, my hair is much softer and manageable. I bought this as I have relaxed hair which is extremely damaged and now I&#x27;m definitely looking to try more products from this line!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter she is a mixed race and it works great in her hair.</li>
            <li> This mask is hydrating and smells great.</li>
            <li> Miraculous conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I could write a ton, but no time.&lt;br /&gt;I have chemically straightened, colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product restores my hair to near virginal health in terms of hair strength, stopping breakage and brittle-ness, makes hair SHINY and completely lightweight and tangle free , hydrated beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prob bought 100&#x27;s of hair conditioners over the years.  Maybe thousands, lol.  This is one of my top 3 favorites!  Add a cap of Babyface protein and you have a $150 salon type intensive conditioning treatment.  Truth:  my friend who works in a very $$ salon gave me this inside info.  And I&#x27;ve loved her for it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u have distressed hair, try this and the Babyface protein additive.  You&#x27;&#x27;ll be THRILLED and appreciative of these Amazon reviews that help us all achieve hair heaven ;)</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels! Does not leave residue</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and more importantly, it freaking works! Hooray for awesome hair dasy, every day.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary customer service&amp; great product! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a week in the shower, leaves my hair smelling great and feeling SO soft to touch!</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair.  And course.  I also have been experiencing some trouble with hair loss.  This product is fantastic for my type of hair.  Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I love the way you can feel it melting into your hair . And rinsing smoothly and soft .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and have long virgin hair that seems to be perpetually dry no matter what I do. A friend recommended I try a shower hair mask a few times a week, so I did some research and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients seems relatively standard, the reviews and price were good, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. What I expected was a bit more moisture and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got instead was WOW. I mean WOW. I don&#x27;t know what kind of magic they put in this delicious smelling medium textured conditioner mask thing, but seven minutes in my hair in the shower made my hair a silky soft shampoo commercial. It was crazy. I&#x27;m used to having to put a ton of product in my hair, letting it air dry, dealing with resulting frizz, more product, etc. not with this. I was rushing to a friend&#x27;s with wet hair. When it dried it was shiny, soft, manageable, bouncy, etc. I went salsa dancing with her, and it looked like I had done my hair for the event (I have kind of wavy hair that curls up at the bottom when it&#x27;s layered- when it&#x27;s healthy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in a month. I never want to be without this product again.</li>
            <li> I should have realized this would be very per fumy. I will say I am not big on fragrances but I had hoped it wouldn&#x27;t smell like very strong and I was wrong. It did soften my hair so the one time I used it so it does do that but the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!! Loved it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this mask/conditioner.  I use it as a mask but I also use a little bit as a conditioner when I shampoo.  It leaves  my dry color processed and straightened hair soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m also happy that it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  I will continue to purchase it from this seller - nice purchase - perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have fine hair and a lot of it. This time of year static is insane. This product has my hair feeling back to its soft healthy self. It is a litte oily for me after the first day of use but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because I don&#x27;t buy hair products online but I decided to get this product after readinf the reviews online. I have no regrets, my hair is soft, hydrated and manageable since the very first used. I absolutely love it! Great product. I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of keeping my hair healthy and it also smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for some miracle product that gives me the hair of my dreams and this stuff doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It smells fantastic and actually stays with me for several days even without washing my hair everyday. I have very long, straight hair and this hydrates it without weighing it down. Definitely making its way into my beauty staples bag.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Put it in my hair n covered it with plastic cap. Left on for an hour.  Only had to use this one the entire week even after shampooing.  Amazing product n didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all.  A+</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write negative reviews, but this product was just a big no for me and I&#x27;m bummed that I feel like I wasted $15 (I&#x27;m not going to return it - I used it, wasn&#x27;t for me, clearly tons of other people love it, so yeah).  Two things:  (1) the fragrance is more like the stench of someone who&#x27;s trying to mask a foul odor, and (2) the actual conditioner is nothing I haven&#x27;t used before and that I really don&#x27;t like - it&#x27;s that slippery, slick type of conditioner that feels like you can never wash off completely.  But the smell is what really put this one over the edge for me - it&#x27;s like patchouli-musk.  :|</li>
            <li> nothing great. annoying smell</li>
            <li> Happy with it, it does what it claims for</li>
            <li> Miracle for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Used it once and saw an IMMEDIATE difference in my hair. My hair is thick, very curly and VERY damaged from straight ironing it 2x a day for over a year. Recently I decided to stop and give my hair time to grow and repair...this is like a miracle in a jar. My hair has never felt so amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that tangles and breaks very easily, this stuff works wonders on my hair. I leave it in for 10 minutes when I really want a deep condition, or I use it just as a conditioner when not deep conditioning. A++++ I recommend this to anyone who wants soft beautiful shining hair.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money. It didnt do anything to my hair plus it has alcohol which can dry ur hair out. Very strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!! It moisturizes my long, dry, curly hair perfectly. Even if I go out in a humid day, if I have used this in the morning or the night before my hair will be much less frizzy. I use this 2-3 days a week and that is the perfect amount for my hair. If I use it every day my hair starts to feel a little oily, but I am extra prone to an oily scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Twice a week with leaving on over night is promising with favorable results.&lt;br /&gt;Fr. Jude, S.J.P.</li>
            <li> It is really wonderful !</li>
            <li> This the first hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, but with that said, I do love it. The smell is AMAZING and it lasts for days! I can even smell it a little after I&#x27;ve washed my hair the next time. I like it so that&#x27;s a plus for me. I put it in while showering and wrap my hair into a turbie twisty, shave my legs and that fun stuff, then rinse it out with cold water. It is very conditioning. It&#x27;s noticeably softer than my regular conditioner. I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great from the first time i used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair shining&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is one of the best hair products I have seen. My hair is now really nice, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Makes my hair so soft and smells great. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this review for those who have virgin hair, like myself, as I couldn&#x27;t find much below. Virgin hair is undyed/unpermed hair. If you shamppo and condition regularly, your hair is fairly soft to begin with. This product works best for DAMAGED hair to repair and soften. For me, this hair mask does make my hair feel softer the day I apply it but the day after, it feels the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this mask is simple, simply apply this product generously into your hair and comb it to even out the mask all over your head. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes (although longer wouldn&#x27;t hurt). You are supposed to do this 2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say the smell is AMAZING. It clings to your hair faintly the next day which is a plus. If you don&#x27;t like the smell, it could be easily masked with hair spray or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review after using this product for a while longer. Will post if any changes happen.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT MAKES MY HAIR SMELL SOOOOOOOOO GOOD AND SOOOOOOOOOO SOFT &#x3D;) !!!</li>
            <li> smells good, works well</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I use this twice a week and leave it on for 7 minutes.  My hair is very damaged from using a flatiron daily and even regular haircuts don&#x27;t help. The hair mask helps restore moisture and makes my hair manageable.  I sometimes don&#x27;t even have to use a flatiron after.  Smells great too and a great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair and this hair mask mad a BIG difference in how soft, shiny, manageable and how my hair actually set with my short hairstyle. Although it says to let it stay on for 5-7 minutes,  because I have chemically treated hair, I applied it and covered my hair with a shower cap, and sat under the dryer for approximately 20 minutes on warm temperature setting. I noticed an immediate difference!  A must have!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!! I am an African American 29 year old woman with dry, thick, at times brittle hair. This mask feels like silk on my hair. It gives my hair so much body &amp; makes my hair feel &amp; look healthy. I&#x27;m not too happy re: the price, BUT, what this product does for my hair, I&#x27;ll continue to bear the brunt of the cost. Anyone that is thinking about trying this product, my advice, TRY IT!! I have tried SO many other hair products &amp; by far, this one is the best and I am sticking with this mask!</li>
            <li> This mask works great and smells great too.  I have tried many masks and this product is the best.</li>
            <li> I like some time to use the product before making a review.  The hair mask works as described.  My hair did feel stronger after use. I was losing hair when I washed but very little after using the Argan Oil Hair Mask twice. I would definitely buy this product again.  I have 4c.hair. so it wasn&#x27;t straighter but it was more manageable. My daughter is making it part of her regular routine.</li>
            <li> Bought after a hair treatment made my hair dry and brittle.  I had hoped an overnight mask would help, but honestly I&#x27;ve had better results with Pantene conditioner.  Decent as a run of the mill product, but not as expected for an overmight mask</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair, I needed something to help make it soft and regain moisture again. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. It has a very sweet scent to it, and it works very well. Just shampoo, and replace your regular conditioner with this. Its that simple. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will give you results after the first use, you can&#x27;t go wrong trying this! It saved my hair!</li>
            <li> Very surprised, it actually helped to repair my super damaged hair</li>
            <li> The argan oil hair mask is a great conditioner. It leaves the hair manageable and it looks 100% healthy.  I will definitely continue to use as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have already used it and was very happy with this product - made my hair shiny.  I left it on about 6 minutes and will leave it on longer next time.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it - defintely!!!!!!</li>
            <li> As good, if not better than the deep conditioning treatments I get at the salon.  And one jar of these is about the same price as one professional treatment!  I was torn between four and five stars simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect (doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair super soft like others claim), but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.  I put my hair through a lot of abuse:  Perming it straight, coloring (blonde), flat iron, and curling iron.  My hair is also naturally dry (due to the natural curl and coarse texture, on top of the dry climate of which I live), so it&#x27;s safe to say it gets a little stressed out.  All the Redken, Chi, and Biosilk products I use to clean, nourish, and style my hair just aren&#x27;t enough to manage it and/or replenish moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the on-line instructions which state that this should be combed through the hair (rather than just applied) and stay on for at least 6 minutes; I leave it on for nearly 20.  My hair feels amazing as I rinse the mask off; results are immediate.  I find that I get best results when I let my hair partially air dry, but that&#x27;s not always feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of deep conditioners and this is by far the best.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for about 5 weeks and it seems to be making a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feel.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the holy grail of deep conditioners. Buy this now!!! Your hair will thank you!!! I have 3 b/c hair and it works wonders for conditioning. My hair is baby silky soft after every use. I usually leave on overnight but have left it on for 10 min only and was still satisfied with the results. This product is a must for all women, especially curlies. It smells super great also. And at such an affordable price, it can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve never been happier with a hair product. If this company runs out of stock I will shoot myself.</li>
            <li> I have fine over proccecced na dreally damaged hair that it gets so dry soemtimes but this is a very good mask , It makes my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li> OMG ARVAZALLIA DEFINITELY NEEDS TO GET MORE RECOGNITION!!!! I had got this item before for free when it first came out. I had my hair perm at the time &amp; I loved to use this item every time I deep condition. It definitely left my perm hair really soft &amp; nice. As I been natural now coming close to a year I decided to purchase this item &amp; I can say arvazallia is the best for \\&quot;all types of hair\\&quot; products. This really left my natural hair feeling really soft even after rinsing it out. They will definitely be my default company I&#x27;ll buy more products from.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing.  Leaves my hair feeling very soft, healthy looking and easy to comb through. I use it 2-3 times weekly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it weekly when my hair is good and every other day when it feels extra dry-like in the winter months. I rotate it with a daily conditioner and a second weekly condition and it helps my hair so much!</li>
            <li> smells amazing. don&#x27;t see a diff with my hair though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had an improvement in the dryness of my colored hair since using this product. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week. I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product saved my hair!! I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft after using this. I dont feel like it is repairing my hair though. I previously was using a macadamia oil mask that I thought was doing a great job. But I love trying new products so I figured I would give this a shot! Glad I at least tried this and it does smell really good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the Argan Oil Hair Oil this company puts out, read positive reviews about the hair mask and decided to try it out. I&#x27;ve tested it two ways: in the shower in place of a regular conditioner and I have also used it as a hair mask, leaving it in my hair overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well both ways. Very thick with an AWESOME smell (that&#x27;s my favorite part), it does well at detangling and adds a bit of moisture. It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, but in the top five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well, which is more on the finer side. Despite it being thick, it also has a bit of a whipped consistancy, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 5 stars--- Recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft! I have naturally curly hair and this seems to tame it even when I straighten it :)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother Inlaw.  She really likes it.</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve found yet to soften and combat frizziness. Excellent service to boot!</li>
            <li> ORDER THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME! GREAT FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it is great. The scent smells really good and it made my hair soft, silky and manageable. I highly recommend this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I bought this and bought Awphali shampoo/conditioner by Paul Mitchell. My hair is dry, breakage. I didn&#x27;t wash it for a week and like 2 days. Used the Shampoo then this mask. It says leave 5-7minutes. I left it on for 15 minutes. It WRKS!! My hair is very dry do to coloring it so much which I&#x27;m stopping. This mask made it soft, shiny and the middle to the ends look really gd, not perfect but man it&#x27;s nice to get something that actually wrks.  used it only once few days ago . I&#x27;m going to be using it 2 a wk. Also the jar is bigger then I thought which is a nice surprise. I&#x27;m also taking biotin, Collagen pills to help with the thinning. A little of each thing goes a long way I believe. Hope this helps someone..</li>
            <li> the product is great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Thick and creamy and subtly, deliciously fragrant --- and SO hydrating! I&#x27;m hooked forever and ever!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. I have dry and damaged hair. It brought moisture back to my hair and reduced frizz. I absolutely love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm on chlorine damaged hair.</li>
            <li> After only one use, I love my hair again!  It looks and feels like I just left the salon.  I love the scent of this product too!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It does all it claims and feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll switch back to Loreal Professional Nature Therapy conditioner in a tub. Very noticeable that this conditioner dries my hair, or at least provides very little moisture.</li>
            <li> Just one use and my hair is 100% softer, shiner and healthier feeling!</li>
            <li> Working well and a noticeable difference in my scalp and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Leaves your hair silky and soft! Great for damaged hair! I uses it once a week and its great for adding moisture back into the hair if you get blonde highlights or dye your hair. Smells great too!!! I&#x27;m hooked on this product!</li>
            <li> I like using this product 2-3 times a week and it really works well with me. It does not give me dandruff </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews before I bought it. So, I expected more than I got.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is softer after using it, but it is nothing more that any other Hydrating product can do .</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product.  The conditioner lived up to its claims and then some.  I have only used it once as you are only supose to use it two times per week but,  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Absolutely amazing!  My hair is so shiny, soft and conditioned!  I had over processed hair and it restored my hair to better than normal!  Will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> Creamy treatment. I love everything about it. The smell, the texture, quality and price. The most important is this product does such a excellent job!</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel incredible!!! I love it!! fast shipping, awesome!</li>
            <li> 100% Satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I am surprised how moisturizing this product is. I have badly damaged hair, from years of bleaching, coloring,blow drying and ( ouch ) flat irons. I love Arvazallia Hydrating Argon Oil Mask.I use it 2 of 3 times a week and leave it on as long as I can! My hair is softer and less damaged!</li>
            <li> African American with 4C natural hair, works well and has helped define some of my curls/coils. I Generally follow up with another conditioner (tresemme curly) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also put life back into my extensions immediately after bleaching &amp; coloring</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product for heat damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly fine hair that frizz easily and after a couple years of heat damaged followed by a period of experimenting with products. I loved how soft it left my hair. How no matter how many times I washed my hair the scent would not wash out until the third of fourth wash!</li>
            <li> Okay, i thought this was one of those products that is bragged about yet when you buy it, it doesnt own up to what it says it will do. i  was scared to use it because i get tired sometimes of the many products i use for my damaged hair trying to find ones that really work. well this product right here did impress me allright. my hair was shiny and soo soft and smooth. it was nicee.  great smell too by the way!</li>
            <li> First Time Using It Was Today. It Works AMAZING !! I Blow Dried My Hair And Flat Ironed It. Didn&#x27;t Even Have To Run The Flat Iron Through Twice ! Which Is Amazing Because I Have Really Thick Hair Which Causes Me To Run The Flat Iron Through A Couple Of More Times. I Absolutely Love This Product &amp; I Highly Recommend ! I Will Be Using This From Now On And I Plan On Buying Other Products From The Brand !</li>
            <li> Works really well to deeply moisturize hair.</li>
            <li> I love products with raga  oil.  Have very dry hair and I have found argon oil really helps to hydrate my hair</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever!!! My hair is soooo soft and silky! Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!  Top of the line! Trust me</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair. .... and could honestly feel the difference after using this mask the first time! My hair becameuch more soft, supple and much easier to manage.... highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My hair was fried from color treatments, and this mask helped immensely with softening and de-frizzing. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This may be the best hair product I have ever used. My hair is color treated. I&#x27;ve been letting it grow and since not cut regularly, was becoming very dry.  This product, after three uses, left my hair silky smooth.  I expect if I used as directed, the results would be better. I merely used as I would any other conditioner, I.e., lather on wet hair, leave on 3 to 5 minutes and rinse. AND!  It smells good, too!</li>
            <li> This is truly a great conditioner that softens hair.  Tangles? What tangles? All tangles appeared to be nonexistent.  Plus it smells wonderful as well. After application, I used a shower comb for even distribution. Normally I would use my denman brush, but my hair was damaged recently via bad stylist who appeared to have highlighted for the first time EVER. This conditioner is great for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my coarse hair soft!</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner to restore dry, over styled, and processed hair. I have been using once a week along with Argan hair oil daily. Has completely restored my ends.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I am happy with this purchase. My hair feels relieved after being bleached. My hair feels like it hadn&#x27;t been bleached. This stuff is a keeper.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!! love this conditioner, it made such a difference after the 1st application. my hair was so soft and silky and it helped so much with these high humidity days we are having. fast shipping and a very helpful follow up e-mail. A+++!!</li>
            <li> Great smelling product and keeps my hair frizz free</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Average results.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have EVER used.  Delivered what it promised. I put it in after my shower, cover it and leave it on for usually right about an hour &amp; my hair is incredibly soft &amp; has gotten its movement back!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I felt how smooth it was RIGHT after I washed it out when it was still wet!! I have never felt my hair this soft IN MY LIFE. I can&#x27;t stop touching it; my hair actually MOVES now. I still have a lot left but I just ordered another one. I don&#x27;t ever want to run out!!</li>
            <li> I have very oily, thin, fine hair that I&#x27;ve spent years abusing with colors and heat.  This mask definitely adds shine and made my hair very smooth and silky.  I have both used it in place of a conditioner and I&#x27;ve applied a small amount to my towel dried hair and didn&#x27;t rinse out, it worked great both ways.  It smells nice and was totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the Florida sun and salt air coupled with having course curly hair I was looking for something with lots of deep conditioning without the heavy oiliness. I towel dried and applied for an hour then washed it out. I could feel the difference right away when my hair was still wet. Curls were good dried but not frizzy. My hair was soft and manageable. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> My hair was dried out from the flat-iron. I used this and maybe I didn&#x27;t wash it out well enough because my hair was really flat after. But after the next washing, I think it did help and didn&#x27;t look so frayed. I plan to use it more but maybe once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was Okay (not bad at all, but nothing spectacular) in my natural 4C hair but since I&#x27;ve been getting texturizers its AMAZING! I have no need for any other conditioner! I haven&#x27;t tried it with their shampoo but that&#x27;s next. It really is Great stuff!</li>
            <li> The product is made in China and not a true Argon product  with the kernel oil being four up from the bottom of ingredients.  Better products on the market  with more concentration of Argon!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick Asian hair and this product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth without nasty residue! Absolutely love the smell and a little goes a long way. Would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> Love this hair mask! It always leaves my hair silky and smooth and it&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the other highly rated hair masks. I have very fine hair that gets greasy easily at the roots but I have dry ends and this hair mask really helps with that without making my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich conditioner, great for my daughter who has coarse, long hair that needs a lot  of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait to write this review but I just tried the hair mask for one time and my hair is straight and it feels so soft. The bottom of my hair has been blonde and pretty dry colored but now its just soft and straight,  totally recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been happier. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This product is affordable and deeply conditions your hair. My hair is curly, and frizzy and needs a lot of hydration.  I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that leaves your hair silky smooth, soft, &amp; shiny.  Smells great, too.  Could tell a difference after one use.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe the wonders this does for my hair. I swear by it. Use it twice a week!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my aging, drying hair.  Brings new youth to my silver locks.  Now, if I could just slather it on my hips and thighs!</li>
            <li> I have bleached blond hair, and this works amazingly to detangle and soften my hair. I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil and so many different conditioners - none of them came close! I was recently in Costa Rica for a month. When I got home my hair was a mess - it was almost in dreads because the store-bought conditioners were waxy and wouldn&#x27;t penetrate my hair. Combing my hair was a 30 minute long ordeal. Now I take Arvaizailla with me everywhere I go. I simply cannot live without it. I went from have dried, brittle bleached blond hair, to having very healthy, easily brushable hair. Worth every penny. I have had bleached blond hair for the past 10 years and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li> Very well package and on time delivery no complaint about that and the product is real.  My hair looking better than ever before and I try different brand names with no result I recommended it!!</li>
            <li> I have done Brazilian blow out and keratin to my hair, I have been coloring my hair since I was 16, I&#x27;m 28. My ends are always dry and damaged, and I need a haircut monthly. I&#x27;ve spent months trying products and reading reviews to find the best product.. something that actually works., I finally got this product... and couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied. I expected magic from all the previous orders.. and started to think maybe I&#x27;m asking for too much.. nope this product is magic. It says leave in for 5-7 mins. I was kind of in a rush and only had a 2-3 mins, but really wanted to give it a try. So I quickly put it in my hair, washed it out brushed through my hair and went on with my day.. my hair feels like someone else&#x27;s. I keep touching it because its so soft I can&#x27;t keep my hands off it. the split ends don&#x27;t look nearly as noticeable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this! Totally saved my hair. I was ready to cut my curly damaged hair. I always straighten my hair, but no matter what I use to protect it I would always get split and dry ends. Now with this my hair has its shine back and I don&#x27;t have to cut it. Thank you for this product. Wish I could&#x27;ve found it sooner,</li>
            <li> I used it on my mothers hair and I  satisfied with it she had been having some problems with her here due to illness and the product worked really well I have not used it in my own here yet but will soon.</li>
            <li> Nice- leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Used on my daughter; her hair was soft and easier to manage. She is natural and has very dry hair. This was my first time using and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer - it even smells good.  The smell is subtle and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine so I was worried about it just flattening out my hair - but oh my gosh - it makes it fall so nicely - I practically don&#x27;t need to brush my hair after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;The person who turned me on to the mask has significantly coarser hair, and hers is amazing too.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! Saved my hair this winter. I have long, curly hair. It was dry, brittle, and nothing kept it from being frizzy until now! I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week and it makes my hair smooth and smells wonderful. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> This does make your hair a little smooth but nothing miraculous. It is filled with silicones and argan oil is one of the last ingredients. I did not like the strong musky smell either. Definitely will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use this once every 2 weeks and it gives my hair softness. I really like this and it will last forever since I&#x27;m only using twice a month.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I am going back to Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> So far feel very good conditioner. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Put the exact amount and don&#x27;t leave it  longer than listed in the instructions. I thought if I used more and leave it around 30 or 35 minutes I would get better results. Oh boy! Was I wrong... My hair started falling off in huge amounts!!. For several weeks I would pass my fingers through my hair and large strands of hair would come with my fingers. I was in total disbelief, every time I would pass my fingers, I would get a new bunch of hair in my hands.  I only used it once but this lasted for several weeks and I lost lots, lots of hair. I used to put my hair up with a large hair clip and it was hard to close because so much hair I had. Now, I only use a small hair clip, the length of my index finger, to put it up.  At the present time, my hair stopped falling off. I am waiting for the hair I lost to grow back and see if I can recuperate what I lost. Needless to say, I fear to use the product again even though it left my hair soft and free of any freezing. I gave it four starts because they should warn people not to exceed the amount and the time.  It is a good product and it works, just don&#x27;t make the mistake I made. Do not use more than what it says in the instructions and do not leave too long!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and made my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Smells beautiful, and seems to really hydrate my hair! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This really works well..!</li>
            <li> Great customer service, very moisturizing mask - extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for hydrating my dry over processed hair.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! This deep conditioner left my hair feeling so soft and looking much healthier. My teenage daughter loves it too. Easy to use this argan oil mask helps repair damaged hair. Simply apply to damp hair, leave in for 5 to 7 minutes then rinse. Did I mention how good this smells? I love it!&lt;br /&gt;As a review blogger I receive product samples at no cost or at a deeply discounted rate. Whether I pay for a product or receive a sample for review purposes my reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, blond, and bone dry. At least, it was. My daughter&#x27;s comment after my second use of this conditioning mask was, &amp;#34;you have Barbie hair! It&#x27;s soooo shiny!&amp;#34; I am very pleased. The effect has been very restorative without greasiness or weight being added.</li>
            <li> This product works really well on my highlighted hair!!! Hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  My hair is long, dry, damaged, and curly, so I use &amp;#34;hair mask&amp;#34; type products as a regular conditioner.  I&#x27;ve basically tried every kind of conditioner that comes in a jar.  I chose this solely based on Amazon rating/reviews, and it really did work well and soften my brittle hair.  The smell is pleasant and unremarkable.  One of the best intensive hair conditioners that I have tried, short of Kerastase Masqueintense which costs around $65.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to buy again</li>
            <li> I love it. This is a great product and I can feel the difference after using for the 3rd time. It&#x27;s a thick hair mask hair so I don&#x27;t need to put a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more of this</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...Has helped hydrate my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is very effective. It helps restore moisture to my hair as it has been particularly dry and frizzy during the past few weeks. After 2 applications, I can see a significant improvement in my natural hair. I use products generously but a little goes a long way, also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> nice product , made my hair smell good and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I use it with the oil. It has completely changed the texture of my hair so it&#x27;s not so frizzy. It&#x27;s never felt softer. I am truly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Best hair mask for frizzy, coarse hair.  A great bargain!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I absolutely recommend this product if your hair is dry and damaged.! My hair feels awesome!</li>
            <li> my hair feels incredibly soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  I am a 60 year old woman with short curly hair.  My hair has a tendency to get very dry.  If I keep it moisturized my curl works much better.  I use it twice a week and I have great curly bouncy hair.  I would highly recommend this product!!!  I will buy it again!!!!  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizers my hair great. And the smell is DIVINE!</li>
            <li> This has really transformed my hair. I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair while in search of a new hair salon and thought I&#x27;d try this to attempt to reverse some damage since it&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve had a trim. I love the way this feels when applying it in the shower...I use a comb in the shower with it (per the instructions) and am able to detangle effortlessly (I have fine, thin, long hair that for some reason is prone to dreading itself overnight). I&#x27;ve been using it more frequently than it recommends to target my ends specifically and have really noticed an improvement in the texture and health of my hair, including my ends. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to or even possible, but I personally feel like it&#x27;s repaired my split ends noticeably. I feel like the container will last me quite a while, too, so it&#x27;s value is even further increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I tend to just use on my ends...while combing through, if it gets to my roots I&#x27;m ok with it, but I am very prone to greasy hair so I&#x27;ve just been trying to use it to focus on the ends. I feel like it might make my hair greasier (or get greasier faster) but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I am using this on the two different hair types: Asian/ European wavy and Asian/ African-American coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;Still a bit early to say if this product is working.&lt;br /&gt;It seems the coarse part of the hair has gotten softer.&lt;br /&gt;I will update if there is a major change in later time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! I am a hair product junkie and will try anything that sounds like it will help my hair. This stuff does what it says. I noticed a difference the 1st time I used it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have tried it once and are relatively happy with results so far. Look forward to that continuing to be the case</li>
            <li> One of the best hair treatments I&#x27;ve used! I noticed the difference after one use!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try this product; however, it as a big disappointment. When I used it on my hair in the shower, my hair was silky. That&#x27;s about it, once my hair started drying, it was frizzy (my hair is normally NOT frizzy)! Somehow I started getting dandruffs along with the frizziness. DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. I saw that this product is made in China. Was not informed about this. Well, I threw this product away and will be going back to the macadamia oil.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously awesome, I bleached my hair and this little miracle saver made my hair shiny again.  My boyfriend loves the smell on my hair too.</li>
            <li> works great on my soooo dried hair!!</li>
            <li> Really helps keep my hair from drying out. I process it a lot with color,  keratin, blow dryer and straightener. This takes the edge off. Leave it on for as long as you can. Nice fragrance too. I&#x27;ll get more.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuffff, smells great too !</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel really good for a while but, my hair got used to it so its time for another switch.</li>
            <li> Best product for dry damaged hair!</li>
            <li> Great hair mask. My hair feels real soft after application. I have permed and highlighted hair and it tends to dry out, but this mask rejuvenated it.</li>
            <li> Works wonders!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This worked right away on my dry, dry hair. After the first use my hair felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves my hair shiny and conditioned!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair mask!  I have my hair highlighted and I also use a flat iron..I was looking for a miracle and I found it.  My hair is so soft, shiny and looks very healthy.  It smells great too.  Since using it I have had so many compliments on my hair!  Excellent produce and excellent price!</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it supposed to do. My hair looks and feels amazing</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my hair look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with Arazallia argan oil hair mask. It is a penetrating deep conditioner that leaves my hair silky shiny and very healthy looking!  I leave it on for an hour and rinse with a very light shampoo once a week.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair, but pricy.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; even better seller. The Seller is great at following up and making sure you enjoy the product. My hair is always dry and this mask helps a lot. Thanks</li>
            <li> Completely transformed my hair. I have combination hair... Oily scalp and dry ends. The hair mask has made my hair silky smooth and healthy looking. Will buy again and again. I have thin hair and love the results. My hair looks fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good! when I first used it, about 2 years ago, I loved it! I still like it, but it seems that my hair always need some thing different! But it is a good product!</li>
            <li> WOW! This stuff is so awesome, I used it after I showered and it was awesome. It felt like I had just conditioned my hair with my expensive salon conditioner. I left it on for about 2-3 hours and then rinsed it out. I cannot tell you how much I love it and how great it made my hair smell and look. I will be back for more for sure! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Brought my absolutely dry and brittle hair back to life!  I was sure that I&#x27;d end up with a crew cut after watching it go from bad to worse throughout the tough Michigan winter!</li>
            <li> Made my hair silky and soft after use. I&#x27;ve tried many hair masks I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk after using this product</li>
            <li> Love this product, absolute must have!</li>
            <li> Great stuff I love it! Smells great too</li>
            <li> I bought this for my gf, and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Ok to use. It is just like any other conditioner. Makes hair soft but not shiny I feel.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week, and it really has done wonders for my hair! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My curls LOVED this mask.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this and promptly hid it in her room so I wouldn&#x27;t .. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s that good she isn&#x27;t willing to share with her mom ~ unless it&#x27;s her asking for me to touch her hair because it&#x27;s so soft. That&#x27;s all I get. spoiled brat and her soft hair..</li>
            <li> i love this product! i&#x27;m am always up for trying a hair mask and i heard about this one on you tube, it&#x27;s amazing. it makes my hair soft and shiny, and does not weigh it down. i have just repurchased this product because it&#x27;s that amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product! It makes my hair very soft and alive :)</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Makes maY hair so soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 2nd tub, this stuff works so well! I have really long, strait hair and I hate getting it trimmed when I start to get damage from brushing and everyday things like ponytails. I use this maybe once a week. It makes my hair shiny, heals my damage, gets rid of fly aways, and just makes my hair super smooth and soft. Totally worth what it costs!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...great customer review.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS &amp;#60;---- in my best gay man voice.  this stuff is ridiculous!  it&#x27;s makes my hair thick curly hair soft as silk.  the only downside is it&#x27;s so soft it&#x27;s hard to style.  i use it once a week and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Soooo hydrating ! I have a tight curl pattern, and enjoy flat ironing and dying my naturally black hair medium ash blonde. These were the results after using this mask on my curly hair https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5s7qmHOIdYs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the results on my straightened hair : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;TQUTP5V4rX4</li>
            <li> It works really nice and aceptable price</li>
            <li> I use with a warm head wrap.  Not as thrilled with the results as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very very dry brittle hair and I recently just dyed my hair so it was pretty fried. I&#x27;ve tried and thrown out so many products that claimed to do what this conditioner says. This stuff is actually pretty great. I immediately went and washed my hair once I got it in the mail. It smells amazing. The moment I put it in my hair I could feel the difference from other conditioners. It left my hair feeling super soft, with no tangles at all. You don&#x27;t really need a lot so I know it&#x27;ll last me awhile. I didn&#x27;t even need to leave it in that long which is nice if you&#x27;re in a rush. I always add a little argan oil afterwards before I blow dry it and I think the two really gives my hair the moisture it needs. I have somewhat frizzy ethnic hair too so I really think it would work on all hair types.</li>
            <li> Love, love Hydrating Argan oil hair mask. I used it only once so far and the outcome was amazing.  My hair looked healthy and was soft and shiny.  I will buy again and again...</li>
            <li> This is fabulous.  It makes my dry wiry gray hair soft and shiny.  The best conditioner I&#x27;ve found.  Service was great too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely luv this product and will buy it again once I run out!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It smells wonderful...has a great creamy texture and hydrates my hair wonderfully.  I bought this to use with a protein treatment once a month and it performs great.</li>
            <li> makes your hair sooo soft</li>
            <li> this deep oil mask was amazing i love taking my hair and putting it in braids and using it over my hair and letting it sit over night with a cap, my hair soaks it up and in the morning it looks like i havent even added globs of this to it. normal masks leave my hair so oily and nasty to where i have to use vinegar to actually tame it down this doesn&#x27;t and the smell is so perfect i was completely shocked when i woke up this morning and my pillow wasnt covered in oil or my hair cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).

            <li> I love this product! It is definitely worth the price for what it does. I have long, super fine hair which gets split ends easily. This product makes my hair feel lightweight, softer, and stronger, as well as making my hair smell really good. I dont follow the instruction on the container though. Once a week, I leave the conditioner in my damp hair overnight, wrapped up in a towel. Then I wash it out with cold water in the morning, blow dry it and then straighten it. It works really well this way. I highly recommend you invest in this product as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have the typical semi - curly Caucasian hair and I live in Colorado which was really drying out my hair.  I started using this product twice a week about a month ago and it has really helped smooth down my hair and delay the occurrence of split ends without making making my hair greasy.  I will definitely keep this in my regimen.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  After receiving and using once, my wife immediately ordered another.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, Helps with split ends.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, makes my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It smells amazing and makes the hair really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is life-changing.</li>
            <li> wonderful even after just one use</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff</li>
            <li> This work on this mixed girl hair. When I wear wet and curly I put it on everyday. It&#x27;s says once a week. But my hair does fine with it. The price is a little to expensive though</li>
            <li> Softened my hair and also made it shiny without weighing it down. Will continue to use regularly</li>
            <li> Love it best product I ever used so far.</li>
            <li> very effective , excellent product , my wife like it and happy with it</li>
            <li> It an excellent product to use alone or combo with the conditioner. My hair is over processed from bleaching, highlights and color. My hair is softer after one use.</li>
            <li> Almost empty and there&#x27;s no notable difference to my hair. Expensive conditioner with no benefit.</li>
            <li> loved it would recommend it</li>
            <li> A great deep conditioner for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair and it made her hair very soft and manageable. I recommend this product to anyone with thick unmanageable hair. I even used it in my hair and it was the same result as my daughter&#x27;s . Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Well, I can not say enough amazing things about this product. I am nearly out and about to by more. I have tried many things but this hair care product is amazing. My hair is silky smooth and I have seen a improvements with dead ends . Thank you to the person who made this product !</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS IT MADE MY HAIR FEEL SILKY N SHINEY.... LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I like the product. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but so far it&#x27;s great. My first received order, there was a problem, but I returned the product, and received a new jar and very happy. Always am with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I can honestly say thank you ladies for the feedback , it is an amazing product . After bleaching my hair several times it was really damaged and I couldn&#x27;t keep it healthy even though I tried coconut oil, egg and other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; products. I just came from Florida and my hair still feels silky even after beach and pool days.</li>
            <li> I did not like this.  My fine hair felt drier after using it.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I used this Hydrating mask first, then I used the oil that they sell separately, and curls looked great and shinier.</li>
            <li> Great, makes my hair soft and not so frizzy!</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed in this product. I&#x27;ve used it as instructed, and ever since I&#x27;ve begun using it my hair has gotten really tangled and gross feeling, becoming super matted and seems to be due to the build up this product is causing. I can&#x27;t be sure that it&#x27;s the reason but it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve changed up in my hair routine, so unfortunately I think it&#x27;s got to go... Bummed because I had such high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> Very good Hair Mask. I just colored my hair which made me drop a lot hair. This product saved me. It makes my hair soft and smell great. My hair is much better even without hair butter. Highly recommended this product. And the price is very very cool.</li>
            <li> This works very well and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used it only once and found it rather nourishing for the hair. However, if you have dry splits, this might not be the answer - a hair cut is!</li>
            <li> The best hair moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve been able to postpone hair cuts at tje salon because my ends are in such good shape now.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I spare no expense when I choose cosmetics and hair care products. I was using Shu uemura products which are quite costly when I discovered this brand. I love the smell... I love how soft and great smelling my hair is!!! I have found my new brand- the hair oil AND the mask.  AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works incredibly! I had damaged hair from being sun bleached and from chlorine. My hair was breaking from being so dry and after just one time using this product, my hair was so soft! I love this and encourage anybody to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this Argan Oil Hair Mask a few times a week, while using the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand daily. My hair looks and feels so much better thanks to these products! While the shampoo and conditioner both contain Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil, you really need this third product to see maximum results! This Argan Hair mask keeps my thick hair looking smooth and shiny without being to oily! A great product!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ! Made my hair so soft and healthy. My hair is so beautiful !</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Makes me hair shiny smooth.</li>
            <li> It was ok but not the miracle cream that everyone claimed, just being a bit more realistic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a gift to my hair. I use it once a week when I take a long bath. I put the hydrating Argan Oil mask on my hair and a moisturizing mask on my face. It&#x27;s the nicest thing I do for myself all week. The hair mask leaves my hair feeling super silky and healthy. A great addition to my self-care routine.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Does not weigh hair down. My hair is very fine, but colored and highlighted. This makes my hair healthy and shiny again. Will continue to purchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I used the product last night, and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I noticed a difference after one use!  My hair was very dry after being colored, but using this mask in place of my regular conditioner has made a world of difference.  My hair feels wonderful now.  :)</li>
            <li> I only used the product once so far but already felt my hair softer and more manageable. Would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner ever!  Hair feels like butter!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair felt to healthy and soft after! I got all my friends hooked on it too! Super hydrating and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy after.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have curly hair that started looking very dry after this winter. Never had this problem before! But this mask maks my hair easy to brush, looking healthy! Would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, put the mask in my whole head, massage a little bit and put a plastic bag or a heat retainer hat and leave it there for al least half an hour while I&#x27;m doing stuff around the house. Then I rinse it and VOILA! My hair it&#x27;s so soft and hydrated, when I blow dry it while be so shiny. Of course it won&#x27;t last forever. I use it once a week .</li>
            <li> Great smell, it really made my hair soft and shinny.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Made in china so it is tested on animals. Returning before I even use it.</li>
            <li> When I was younger we poured and slathered all kinds of things in our hair to lighten, soften and otherwise treat our hair. Most of which, I have later learned were either actually causing more damage or just a total waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product about four times but my hair does feel silky and soft after applying this mask. I would imagine with continued use, the results would only get better over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tamed my fly away hairdo which is a result of being damaged and thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> This was seriously a miracle for my hair!  I thought I needed to cut 3 inches of &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; hair off until I found this product and it brought everything back to life!  Will absolutely be reordering at this price.... And I started off by ordering 2 on my first purchase because of all the rave reviews, so glad they were justified!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling hair mask i have ever used. Usually hair mask smell like chemicals or treatments and that smell is just not pleasing for something you have to keep in your hair for a sustain amount of time. This hair mask is super thick and light but once you have it all worked though, you might notice a heavy feeling since your hair is going to be collecting the hydration. I would recommend using this hair mask once a week between your normal shampoo and conditioning routine. It says to leave it in your hair for 5-7 mins but since my hair can get really dry since it is kinda damaged, i like to leave it in for longer like 15-20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product for free, for testing and reviewing purposes ONLY!</li>
            <li> These products are great for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, light and smells nice ;)&lt;br /&gt;A recomandation for women with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair, the conditioner was great for smoothing out frizzy and keeping my hair looking shiney</li>
            <li> I have 4c natural hair. This is the first product that I&#x27;ve ever used that has totally moisturized my hair. This product also detangled my hair, that was accidently discovered while rinsing the product out of my hair. As I am writing this review,  it&#x27;s been a week since I washed my hair, I currently have it in a potential style and my hair still feel and look moisturized! I will make sure that I always use this product from now on. The way I used this product, after wash and shampoo my hair,  I put a plastic cap on and sat under the dryer for 20 mns.</li>
            <li> I just love this hair mask.  I have 50-ish year old thick, but very fine hair past my shoulders.  It is color-treated and it has a tendency to get very dry on the ends.  I have started using this after each shampoo on the lower half of my hair, keeping in in my hair for 3-5 minutes before rinsing it out.  The longer I have it in, the softer and younger my hair looks afterwards.  I was always using other conditioners before, but this really seems to make my hair less dry and it stays softer for a longer period of time.  It has a very nice scent that lasts in my hair for the first day.  My husband has commented on how nice my hair smells after I use this.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best conditioning product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, naturally wavy hair that has been a nightmare my entire life. It does what it wants, it gets extremely frizzy in both humid and dry conditions and it tangles easily. In the summer it&#x27;s even worse because I&#x27;m in the pool every day and the chlorine really takes it&#x27;s toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many different conditioners I&#x27;ve lost count. Some work ok, some don&#x27;t work at all and same made things worse. I&#x27;ve tried other products with Argan oil in them too and, while better than most, they still weren&#x27;t amazing. I found this product here last year during the summer when my ends were fried crispy from chlorine. I didn&#x27;t think anything would make that much of a difference but after reading all the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I am so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use just a little once or twice a week as a quick conditioner and then when my hair starts really frizzing and look dull and damaged - in the summer from the chlorine and in the winter from the dry air - I slather it on and leave it in for several hours. When I rinse and dry after that it&#x27;s like I have different hair. No frizz, no crispiness - it&#x27;s soft, silky and smells great! I also get far fewer tangles than I used to and the ones I do get are much easier to comb out, which is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews here saying the product left their hair greasy or it was too heavy. I have to guess they are not rinsing it out well enough after using. I could see that happening if you don&#x27;t rinse properly. But I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now, I always make sure to rinse it out completely and I have never experienced that problem, even after leaving it in for hours. No greasiness, no heaviness, just soft, silky, awesome feeling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me - and have tried everything and almost given up on finding something that works - give this a shot. I almost guarantee you&#x27;ll be glad you did. I know I am!be glad you did. I know I am!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that has been color treated and is feeling like straw and fuzzy.  I have tried a lot of conditioners, and some quite expensive over the past year and this is wonderful.  I just used it quick in the shower so didn&#x27;t leave it on very long because I had company coming and I was running late.  I then just let my hair air dry as it was hot out and I didn&#x27;t have time to dry it.  I didn&#x27;t put any other styling products on my hair.  It dried and was soft and absolutely no frizz.  Later in the day I brushed it and put the oil on and I am amazed.  My hair is so soft and silky and not fuzzy at all.  My biggest problem with conditioners is either my hair still feels dry and frizzy, or they tame down the frizz and dryness but then my hair feels waxy or gritty.  With this it just feels soft and looks amazing.  I&#x27;m sold hook, line and sinker.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My wife says that this works great on her hair</li>
            <li> I do want this to be a wonderful hair mask but unfortunately I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> This hair mask works wonderfully! My long blonde hair absorbs the oil, but does NOT weigh it down at all! Definitely has improved my hair health. For the price and how many treatments you get, it&#x27;s worth it. I recommend! Plus, smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the hydrating oil mask. Would definitly recomend to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks and hair feels healthier. Smells really good too.</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner I have ever used.It keeps the hair soft and avoid thinning of hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t perform the way it was promised. I really like hair masks so I&#x27;ve used quite a few and I don&#x27;t think this is very good. It feels just like regular conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t smell terrible but not beautiful either. If I was to try this without knowing its label, I would think it&#x27;s some generic brand.</li>
            <li> My hair has been processed for years and the top layer has been so dry it felt like straw. After reading reviews, I ordered this and the Argan shampoo. Wow! I noticed a big difference after one use! The first couple of weeks I used it every 4 days and now am down to once a week. My hair looks and feels the best it has in years!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with this product. I&#x27;ve used it twice, so maybe I&#x27;ll try it more regularly and see how that goes. I would give five stars for smell, though- it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love it! Helped soften up my suddenly dry hair after the second use.</li>
            <li> Very nice treatment for colored and keratin treated hair. I switch up between this and my Kerastase Masque (I think switching up is important).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! I have fine hair that that&#x27;s a few inches past my shoulder blades. After a few years of dying it blonde, the ends looked terrible and my hair felt very dry and fried. After one treatment of this stuff, my hair felt soft and healthy, including my ends. I am SO happy I bought this. Now I don&#x27;t have to cut 3 inches off!</li>
            <li> OMG - AMAZING.  Seriously, how have I not heard of this product before???  I covered with a plastic cap and let sit for about 10 minutes and could not believe how soft my hair was after rinsing out.  I have already ordered another jar to have on standby.  This has replaced my other deep conditioners as they don&#x27;t even come close to accomplishing what this one did for me.  The smell is a little intense for me, but after rinsing out, hardly noticeable.  Rcvd email from the company with helpful hint of using their Argan oil in with the mask and will definitely try that too.</li>
            <li> Looks like it was used.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing....I&#x27;ve been using since I first got it and my hair feels so healthy, soft, silky and looks way better than before. I&#x27;ve tried countless products to help me repair the damage to my hair and this is the only product that&#x27;s has been consistent and it also doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp</li>
            <li> These are all sulfate free and paraben free, which is a huge plus. They also have great ingredients in them, like argan oil and macadamia oil. The bottles also feel really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet. And all 3 items smell amazing (like what you’d get in a salon). I’m sure all 3 items would be good on their own, but they’re great together. They really have helped thicken and strengthen my hair and all produce a nice shine. My hair is also easier to comb after using the conditioner and deep conditioner, which is always a plus. All of the items are ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need. I saw a difference immediately after using the products and everytime I use them, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle. Great stuff and super beneficial to the hair and scalp. This is really, really thick and luxurious...one of the thickest deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, actually. And it smells amazing and instantly leaves my fine hair hair feeling great. After washing it out, my hair feels softer, thicker, and smoother. It also defines my curls without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff- smells good. the longer you leave it on the better job it does- but I do also use it as a regular conditioner (my hair is very dry) every day, sometimes I can leave it on for as long as they recommend (10 mins) sometimes it&#x27;s only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this hair mask twice a week. I have natural curled with highlights so my hair tends to get dry and easily tangled. This mask cream is thick and a little goes a long way. It makes my hair extremely easy to comb and afterwards th hair just sits in really nice. I always get many compliments for my hair, I&#x27;ve revived a lot more since using he arvazilla products.</li>
            <li> Felt the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Love the product, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> too heavy for fine hair and hate the smell</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Rich smells good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing results!My hair is so soft &amp; has an amazing shine!I used to hold my hair up without a scrunchie, due to its thickness. Now, it&#x27;s so soft &amp; silky, it actually comes apart, &amp; I have to use a scrunchie.I love it!I have advertised this to friends &amp; acquaintances. Not to mention, it was my daughter, Sharina who recommended it to me.So, we&#x27;re spreading the word.Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel amazing! And it smells good. Much less frizz now.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! My hair feels soft and moisturized! Also using on my clients!</li>
            <li> Like the product.  Makes my hair soft and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Ordering the second time! I totally love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It has a nice smell and seems to work well for my hair. I haven&#x27;t seen any major differences in my hair but when I use it my hair looks good and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great as everyone raves that it is.  It feels like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very effective deep conditioning treatment. I have long, thick hair and often notice wirey strands sticking out after blowdrying. After using this conditioner once, there were minimal fly-away pieces and straightening with an iron was a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter used this for the first time last night and was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Hair felt soft and so healthy looking after one time use.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my hair looked amazing--so much so that I made a point of using it once per week. After a few weeks, I noticed that my ends were almost permanently dry when this was not the case before. I changed nothing else about my hair care routine during this time. To try and fix the dryness I did a few long treatments of this mask following the directions over the course of one day.The end result was sticky and waxy feeling hair. After a good clarifying shampoo my hair is back to normal, but it never felt sticky or waxy before using this product. I&#x27;m unsure if it was just a one-off strange case or if it was the product, but none-the-less, I regret paying the price I did for it. I have since achieved the same result without the buildup by using raw coconut oil--which I can get for the same price.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS NOW FOR AMAZING HAIR!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is rather interesting. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used anything quite like it. I have long, wavy, baby fine (fly-away) hair. This product really makes my hair look and feel longer and silkier. I think it must weigh it down or something. I really don&#x27;t get it, I just know it looks really good. My hair also looks very shiny. So, I have to say that I have been very pleasantly surprised by how well this product works. I&#x27;ve also used the Ultra Curl Defining Cream by Arvazallia, and it works well also.</li>
            <li> The best of the best!</li>
            <li> I like the product! It works as advertised. I got on sale for 16$ by amazon, they said it was 50% off  but for the amount, i think wo the sale it would be overpriced.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how damaged my hair was until after I used this. What a difference. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Seriously - where has this been all my life?? This is a little hair miracle. I have naturally wavy hair, that I always only wear straight and I also color my hair - my hair dresser has been on my case to stop using my flat iron or I&#x27;m going to have to cut my hair because I am just killing my ends… this hair, along with cutting back on my flat iron, has genuinely saved my hair. My hair is so incredibly soft after using this. and it smells AMAZING! I would recommend this to anyone who has dry or damaged hair and wants to nourish their hair.</li>
            <li> My Hair feels nicely hydrated :)</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described. I have been struggling to find a product that works to help with a recent bout of dry hair that was not responding to my usual moisturizing conditioners. I have to date returned several products that did not work or smelled awful. The results of Arvazallia were instantaneous. My hair has not felt this great in quite a while. The product doesn&#x27;t leave a residue build-up and it smells amazing. I plan on using this regularly in my hair care. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. The mask is thick and my hair felt more moisturized- all at a great price</li>
            <li> Yes please! I love this mask and so does my hair! I have thick and wavy hair - so I feel like my hair can never get enough moisture. I use this mask few times a week and it does wonders for my hair. Great product... A bit on expensive side.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The conditioner is nice and thick, really feels like a hair mask, and it smells awesome. Product arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I never go out of my way to write a review but this stuff is amazing.  So much better than Morrocco oil products which are mostly filler anyway and it&#x27;s half the price.  My hair looks like I had a keratin treatment.  My boyfriend asked me &#x27;did you something to your hair?&#x27; the frizz is gone  I&#x27;m ordering three more.</li>
            <li> Daughter with biracial hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Great hair mask! Leaves my hair smooth (not oily) and reduces frizz!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it until 2 weeks in, but this stuff has really dried out my hair. My daughter&#x27;s too. I threw it away after using it 8 times. I regret this purchase. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Should have stuck with &amp;#34;Perfect 10.&amp;#34; This is not a good product, I am very disappointed. It does not hydrate as well as it claims and the paste can be difficult to put on your hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a super dry climate and have very fine, thin, dry hair so I basically look like I&#x27;m touching one of those electric &amp;#34;lightning&amp;#34; balls all the time. I just wanted a super hydrating deep conditioner to try and keep the frizz down. After reading all the reviews here I got this and was expecting miracles. What I got what a good deep conditioner that helps keep frizz down. Nothing super amazing but it does what I wanted it to do. The good: It moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make my thin hair feel greasy or lose volume. The bad: It didn&#x27;t give me different hair haha. I didn&#x27;t get as amazing results as many of the others reviewers here but it was good for what I wanted. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. I don&#x27;t use it as a mask though I just use it as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used it 1x a week and that&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li> I have only used this conditioner for a couple of weeks.  Thus far,  it has made a positive difference in my hair. It&#x27;s not a dry and frizzy.  Smells nice ( but quite perfume).</li>
            <li> Love it!  Keeps my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t dry it out with hair spray use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I think I&#x27;ll try something else next time. I have color treated hair. In the past, it was highlighted and I dyed over the highlights with permanent dye twice. I haven&#x27;t been very careful or gentle with my hair so it&#x27;s slightly damaged and I have dry ends. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner to help soften it and make it more manageable. Most of the time I used it as a normal conditioner but once I used it as an all-night hair mask; the results were the same no matter how long I left it on. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner compared to other ones I&#x27;ve tried but it&#x27;s not amazing. Still looking for the one for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Works fantastic The product was shipped promptly from seller Very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> LOVE HOW IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. I have thick, coarse hair that typically looks dull. I shampooed my hair, towel-dried and applied the mask. I let it sit for a few minutes and rinsed. I actually had shine to my hair after I blew it dry, and it felt much softer. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> This stuff has little argan oil in it and just coats your hair.  I have thick, naturally curly hair that I normally tame with a curling iron.  I also color my hair and live in a dry climate.  The first time I used this product I loved the way my hair felt, but after a couple more uses my hair started losing it&#x27;s volume and feeling sort of strange--I don&#x27;t want to say it was greasy but it quit feeling dry but it was only because it was coated with this stuff and not because it was hydrated.  Before this product I had only used the Moroccan Oil brand and I am back to that.  It&#x27;s a far superior product.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out. My color treated hair gets silky then the next day feels dry. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair mask I have ever used! The consistency is very thick and rich with a velvety texture. I have waist-length, very coarse, frizz-prone curly hair and this mask just melts into my hair, instantly de-tangling and separating my curls into glorious ringlets! A little goes a long way and gives great slip!. Smells great without strong linger. I will reorder this product!</li>
            <li> I use in the steam room for 20 minutes</li>
            <li> my hair damaged after i used it , not recommended to buy it</li>
            <li> Amazing results! I have blonde hair and normally have a hard time with tangles. After using this mask, my hair is tangle free and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for good hair mask or conditioner, this one is the BEST ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy hair. I have tried so many kinds of products, none of them has really good effect after I dry my hair. But after using this product, my hair is so smoothly and weighted. I really wasn&#x27;t expected it could have that good result, but this product really surprised me. I will never use any other hair mask in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, damaged hair.  I&#x27;ve used it once and was amazed at the results.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and smells great</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tends to get dry in colder months. This is a great treatment to help restore it and keep my hair looking healthy in the dead of winter. This is a nice, thick cream that stays in for the treatment period and rinses out easily. It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my hair at all, but it leaves it feeling soft and healthy and gives it a pretty shine that I normally don&#x27;t see without finishing spray!</li>
            <li> This Argon hair mask is amazing! I have very dry, chemically treated hair and have a hard time finding anything I really like. Now, I have found something that I brag to everyone about and it&#x27;s this product. It leaves your hair so soft it&#x27;s unbelievable! I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> Super product and delicious smell!!</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times now. It left my hair shiny and soft. I Would buy it again</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight but with so much frizz, I just tried this mask once and  the change was dramatic I can&#x27;t wait to use it next week and blow dry my hair this time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have long, fine hair but lots of it. It&#x27;s usually oily but it&#x27;s been dry from coloring.  I followed the directions and my hair was shiny and soft. My 11 year old daughter also used it. Her hair is medium, long and normal-oily.  She had wonderful results as well.  I had a question about the product that I received and the customer service was OUTSTANDING!! I bought it from Life &amp; Style Goods. They responded promptly to my email and provided superior customer service. I wish more companies were like them! I will be buying this and trying there other products too.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels wonderful after using this hydrating hair mask. I use once a week, especially in the winter. I just bought my second one.</li>
            <li> Beyond a doubt, this is an excellent product. My very thick, coarse hair responded really well and there was a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;After one treatment, my hair was not bulky or wire-y &amp; much more manageable. In addition, I got a little aromatherapy while applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;The subtle fragrance is glorious. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this mask about once a week for my long white hair.  I put the mask on, then a plastic cap on and wrap a warm towel over that.  I leave it on between 1-3 hours. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This mask softens my curly, wavy, color-treated  hair like nothing else I have ever tried.  I have shoulder length hair and the jar lasts me a long time.  I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil, mask, and curling cream. I love ALL of them! I was blown away after using each of the products because I have tried so many that just didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I have naturally wavy, thick, and dry hair that tends to break off at the ends. These products are definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> This really works for my hair, left my hair soft and easy to comb, smell nice.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT. I HAVE TINTED LONG HAIR . I USUALLY LIVE IT ON FOR 1 DAY ,ONLY IN THE ENDS NOT IN THE SCALP, AS A MOLDING SHAPER. THEN I TAKE IT OFF NEXT DAY . PEOPLE GIVE ME COMPLIMENTS WHILE I AM WEARING IT BECAUSE OF A DIFFERENT CURLY LOOK. THEN NEXT DAY  I TAKE IT OFF AN BLOW DRY . IT IS REALLY SHINY AND SOFT .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....not really any better than stuff in department stores</li>
            <li> I honestly can say I love this stuff! I have colored my hair for many years and this is the one stand out product I have used in the last 10 years. I am a huge fan! My hair is glossy and healthy looking. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Really great conditioner.  I color my hair so it cut down on the dryness and made it very smooth just after one use.  I also sent it to my daughter who has very thick and extremely curly hair.  She has a lot of trouble finding a good product and she also loves it.  We are both very satisfied with this product, have already reordered it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! It&#x27;s like fabric softener for the hair!! My hair feels instantly soft! Will definitely be reordering!</li>
            <li> Delivers as promised.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This has given my dry colored hair a new life.  I was excited about drying my hair and when I did it was a pleasant surprise to feel my hair so soft. I&#x27;m always skeptical when I try a new product, this has proven all that it claimed to do, I wish I had known about this sooner.  My hair actually feels soft again.  The bonus with this is the awesome scent, I want a candle that smells like this.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I will re-order soon ~~</li>
            <li> Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia for Dry or Damaged Hair - I love this stuff!  My daughters and I use this weekly!!!  Our hair has NEVER looked this good!  Blonde highlighted hair is so hard to maintain and this stuff really helps!!</li>
            <li> Decent moisturizer for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and my hair already feels a million times better.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing!  I love it.  It has a nice texture that is thicker than conditioner but yet is smooth and silky.  Glides on my hair nicely and makes it so soft and smooth.  I love that it is sulfate and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I use the mask once a week and it definitely helps soften my hair. I have extremely dry hair and issues with breakage. So far this product has been extremely helpful. I apply it in the evening after I wash my hair and wrap it overnight rinsing it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> This has not done nothing to my hair but make it feel soft i have very frizzy hair nd damaged it has not taken the damaged away ... Dont waist your money on this</li>
            <li> Great product! I have thin, but naturally curly/frizzy hair. I live in a humid area. When I first used this, I gobbed a whole bunch on to get a good dose of hydration. Even with my thin hair, it did not leave it feeling heavy or weighed down. Just left it feeling very very soft. The frizz was reduced dramatically. On rainy/humid days this is my savior! I highly recommend this product. The seller was great too. They emailed me to make sure I liked the product. I will be ordering this on a regular basis and from this seller.</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioner I have used so far..</li>
            <li> I received this for free for evaluation/testing purposes and my feedback is 100% mine and may vary from yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arvazallia Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner for Dry and Damaged hair is the perfect finisher for my other 2 Arvazallia hydrating Argan Oil products (shampoo and conditioner). This makes my hair moisturized and deeply conditioned that I feel it&#x27;s more shiny and smooth even if I have curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have overpowering scent but it still leaves my hair smelling fresh at all times when I use it. I use it twice a week. Since I am seeing improvements on my hair texture, shine and overall look, I think I will use it once a week thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a small portion to cover my entire hair area so you can save more for later use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product especially those chemically treated hair because it works.</li>
            <li> Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner is wonderful for my damaged&lt;br /&gt;hair and smells great. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and love it!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine indian hair which gets very dry and frizzy during the winter months and wanted to get something really moisturizing and organic. This mask was amazing right from the first wash its very moisturizing, completely transforms the hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a really good hair mask, like the scent and also moisturize my hair. My hair didn&#x27;t respond to &amp;#34;it a 10 hair mask&amp;#34;. This one is much cheaper and helps my hair.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second jar because I loved it so much.  I have really dry hair from coloring it all the time but I think this helps a lot and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells great! Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, it leaves my hair very soft and it is sulphate free so this is a safe product for colored hair. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the smell is too strong for my liking and the fact that it is made in China...</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, color-treated, and I flat iron and blow-dry my hair every other day. This and regular environmental causes leave my hair dry, brittle and frizzy. I have used this hair mask once and while it has a very strong smell, it does smell very good. There was an immediate difference in my hair, it is softer, shinier and the frizz is drastically reduced. I am in love with this hair mask and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this mask! It certainly showed results instantly, and the smell is the cherry on top of a sundae! Whenever someone visits me, I always brag and go on and on about it. I&#x27;ll definitely get more!</li>
            <li> I left it on over night hoping that it would condition better. My hair felt softer when it was wet as I was brushing it, but after my hair dried it kinda felt the same. It made my hair smell great though.</li>
            <li> A lot of products that promise these sorts of things have not worked on my hair. After using this, it was softer and more manageable than it had been in years. A great product from a great company.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with really dry, brittle and not very good looking hair until I tried this Hair Mask from Arvazallia! It is the best hair mask I have ever tried and let me tell you I have tried many! If you leave this hair mask on for the full five minutes like it recommends, it will make your hair look and feel amazing! The first time I used this hair mask I noticed a change in the way my hair felt, it was way softer and I also notice my hair was shinier than its been for a while! I can tell how much more moisturized my hair is now! I use hot tools and dye my hair so my hair was in need of this TLC therapy! WONDERFUL HAIR MASK!!!!! I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that has been colored for years ... tried several products including Wen and this is amazing!  You see results after the first use.  If you are looking for a product that hydrates and &amp;#34;de frizzes&amp;#34; your hair, try this!</li>
            <li> This stuff here is a miracle in a jar, I am not kidding.  I have naturally curly hair and the older I get (now 50) the thinner my hair is.  It is also hard to control my curl.  I bought his on a whim and condition my hair with it twice a week. My hair looks and feels amazing. It is thick and shiny and I have little to no hair loss anymore.  This stuff is the miracle I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be without it in my shower ever again!</li>
