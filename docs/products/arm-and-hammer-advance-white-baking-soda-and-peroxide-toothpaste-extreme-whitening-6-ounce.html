            <li>and it feels good when you use it.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste and of course, the price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to fill out this form with more words than I think I should add.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste ok with taste of soda and salt.  </li>
            <li>This paste is top of the line...</li>
            <li>Go out and give it a try, it&#x27;s one of the better toothpastes on the market.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, our dentist appointments go very quickly with this tooth paste (and with the help of our electric toothbrush).</li>
            <li>Stay Strong.</li>
            <li>My friends say it has a strong taste</li>
            <li>This is really great toothpaste, and yes, I order it from USA and have it sent to me in New Zealand, but it is so totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>but this one polishes and cleans your teeth thoroughly, primarily because of the baking soda.  </li>
            <li>So far I have a good experience with the toothpaste and experience no issues.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it lol its also white.</li>
            <li>It keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Arm &amp; Hammer...</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling like i&#x27;ve really cleaned.</li>
            <li>If you eat a lot of spicy food, I highly recommend this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Arm and Hammer.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty simple...</li>
            <li>This toothpaste not only cleans your teeth and brightens them, it cleans your whole mouth and removes any tongue coating.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Arm and Hammer for years and find the other brands don&#x27;t give us the same clean feeling as this one does.</li>
            <li>It really gives your mouth a feeling of cleanliness that other toothpastes don&#x27;t, other toothpastes leave a kind of residue behind like a film of gunk on your teeth</li>
            <li>It did take a few days to get used to the taste, but now we find we prefer this over the other brands that seem overly sweet now.</li>

            <li> The hygienist has minimal work to do when we sit in her chair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the toothpaste for little over month and it does seem to keep my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li> so I try not to use it everyday by alternating my usage with a smoother toothpaste</li>
            <li> Anything outstanding or awful is hand written.</li>
            <li> Once fully applied, I wait a small period of time, then remove from teeth via rinsing.</li>
            <li> usually Crest 3-D</li>
            <li> I usually use any toothpaste that my Mom buys for us from Costco but for the past 15 years if I didn&#x27;t like the Costco toothpaste I would buy this brand of toothpaste...</li>
            <li> and i dont&#x27; usually twrite reviews</li>
            <li> not really effective, ive been using it since 45 days, did not see any differences</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is ridiculous...</li>
            <li> , it cleans your mouth silly like you were in a dental chair, it whitens your teeth with every application</li>
            <li> But very disappointing on whitening power.</li>

            <li> Great product...fast delivery...as advertised................ ........... ............ ............ . .......... ....... ......... ........... ......... .&lt;br /&gt;This is ridiculous...I don&#x27;t have time to fill out this form with more words than I think I should add. If this is what I have to do I will not reply or give feedback anymore</li>
            <li> I have been using the toothpaste for little over month and it does seem to keep my teeth whiter.  So far I have a good experience with the toothpaste and experience no issues.</li>
            <li> Bought on recommendation of dental hygienist.  Toothpaste ok with taste of soda and salt.  But very disappointing on whitening power.</li>
            <li> I had given up and was having my teeth cleaned at my dentist four times a year because of stains.  I gave this a try in combination with an electric toothbrush (one of the sonic Phillips I think).  Anyway, I am back to two cleanings a year and owe it to this gunk.  It doesn&#x27;t taste very good, but who cares?</li>
            <li> This toothpaste and extra-whitening gel keep&lt;br /&gt;me smiling w/o the leave-on strips or the trays&lt;br /&gt;w/ gel I used to get from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, has a great combo of ingredients. I was excited to use it lol its also white. No color dye that is unhealthly. This paste is top of the line...</li>
            <li> not really effective, ive been using it since 45 days, did not see any differences</li>
            <li> This is really great toothpaste, and yes, I order it from USA and have it sent to me in New Zealand, but it is so totally worth it.  On a recent visit to my dentist he could not believe how white my teeth were.</li>
            <li> Great product for controlling plaque.</li>
            <li> This is a copy and paste to meet the requirements to rate the product. Anything outstanding or awful is hand written.</li>
            <li> I put it on my toothbrush, then I use the toothbrush to put it on my teeth. Once fully applied, I wait a small period of time, then remove from teeth via rinsing. Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty simple...you know....the only way it doesn&#x27;t work is if it&#x27;s User Error....you know what I&#x27;m saying? Yeah...give this 5 stars, or prove you don&#x27;t know how to read ingredients or use toothpaste. Thanks Arm &amp; Hammer...Stay Strong.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste a lot. It leaves me feeling like i&#x27;ve really cleaned. It&#x27;s a abrasive because of the grits in the paste so I try not to use it everyday by alternating my usage with a smoother toothpaste usually Crest 3-D</li>
            <li> My friends say it has a strong taste but I love it!</li>
            <li> I usually use any toothpaste that my Mom buys for us from Costco but for the past 15 years if I didn&#x27;t like the Costco toothpaste I would buy this brand of toothpaste... it tastes great, it cleans your mouth silly like you were in a dental chair, it whitens your teeth with every application and it feels good when you use it.

            <li> This toothpaste not only cleans your teeth and brightens them, it cleans your whole mouth and removes any tongue coating.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used.  I tried it out at my parents last year and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours.  If you eat a lot of spicy food, I highly recommend this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Look no further for the whitest teeth! We love this toothpaste and of course, the price! Highly recommend Arm and Hammer.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Arm and Hammer for years and find the other brands don&#x27;t give us the same clean feeling as this one does. It did take a few days to get used to the taste, but now we find we prefer this over the other brands that seem overly sweet now.

            <li> Been using this brand for 6-7 years now and I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent and i dont&#x27; usually twrite reviews</li>
            <li> Good price. But its toothpaste. What do ya want me to say?</li>
