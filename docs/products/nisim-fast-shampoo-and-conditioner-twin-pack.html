            <li>It is best of the best&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I hope every one looking for the best result to give it a shot</li>
            <li>I do like how it smells and my hair is in great condition!</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>I am happy with my results</li>
            <li>I think this product is good.</li>
            <li>hair longer than before.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is also good.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I just ordered more!</li>
            <li>Honestly after 2 weeks I had my hair measured again and there IS growth, YEAH</li>
            <li>but I do hydration cream when I wash my hair! :)</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It caused many split ends.</li>
            <li>This is the third time ordering this product it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest</li>
            <li>She stated that her hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to tell since I color my hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference In my hair growth</li>
            <li>The cons about this product are smell and yes, even the sulfate free version seems to be drying.</li>
            <li>the fact is in need of a cut.&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo lathers up well and has a nice smell, it is great value for money I will continue to purchase this hopefully for a long time as my hair does not grow at a fast rate.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with cancer way back in 2010 and this shampoo and conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li>Just pair it with a good deep conditioner and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to say Nisim Fast really works.</li>
            <li>after using this stuff my hair looks healthier and more volumized, its also really shiny, but I didn&#x27;t notice any faster hair growth.</li>
            <li>is the fact it DOES dry out our hair; so to combat that you MUST use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s made my hair grow more, but it&#x27;s healthy and has less breakage, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Also, if you use it for months on end your hair will get used to it and won&#x27;t grow as fast as it did when you first started using it.</li>
            <li>She claims that it has made her hair grow and much stronger.  </li>
            <li>Had to return because too much protein for my hair type.</li>
            <li>My hair DOES NOT typically grow fast.</li>
            <li>and I use Shea moisture for deep conditioning and sulfate free cream to style overall</li>
            <li>but this is more likely due to</li>
            <li>By 4 weeks, my hair had grown just over 1/2 an inch and by 6 weeks, it had grown almost an inch--almost doubling my natural growth rate.</li>
            <li>now nearly chin level.</li>
            <li>shampoo leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Caused major breakage for my Afro Natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am finally heading off to the hairdressers for a new style!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair dry</li>
            <li>I have been using FAST for just over 6 weeks now and already had amazing results, I had a bad haircut and in desperation needed to grow this out - Fast has given me some confidence back finally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most African-Americans don&#x27;t shampoo daily, but I&#x27;m natural and had the big chop almost 1 year ago with slow growth.</li>
            <li>I m an African American female... really like the product.</li>
            <li>It had the complete opposite effect from what it advertised.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical because hair growth is mostly connected to genetics, overall health and nutrition--topical products shouldn&#x27;t impact growth that much.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown a little faster, but it isn&#x27;t as fast as I was hoping.</li>

            <li> I can write a long review as to why I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can measure length easily due to the contrast between my roots and blonde color.</li>
            <li> ; This is not normal for me.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot healthier, I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions and even bought the wet dry hair brush</li>

            <li> My hair grows slowly--1/4 to 1/3 an inch each month, slower than the average 1/2 inch per month.</li>
            <li> Last September, a bad bleach job caused me to have my hair chopped much shorter than I can tolerate.</li>
            <li> It has possibly dried my hair out slightly</li>
            <li> I am on my second set and my hair is growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that my conditioner bottle is impossible to squeeze to get the product out, I had to put it into a different bottle which meant I lost some product.</li>
            <li> This product does help accelerate the growth of your hair but, has some serious drying effects.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to speed up growth and after conducting research, I decided to try this product.</li>

            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month now and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair dry but I do hydration cream when I wash my hair! :)</li>
            <li> I m an African American female... really like the product. It actually worked for me. I shampoo my hair weekly only skipped one week since I purchased product but still have growth. My hair was shoulder length before using product now it is mid shoulder blades. I have not use any other shampoo and condtioner just to see if I would obtain results. I DID! Thanks! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Last September, a bad bleach job caused me to have my hair chopped much shorter than I can tolerate. My hair grows slowly--1/4 to 1/3 an inch each month, slower than the average 1/2 inch per month. I was desperate to speed up growth and after conducting research, I decided to try this product. I was very skeptical because hair growth is mostly connected to genetics, overall health and nutrition--topical products shouldn&#x27;t impact growth that much. But.., I noticed results in 2 weeks. By 4 weeks, my hair had grown just over 1/2 an inch and by 6 weeks, it had grown almost an inch--almost doubling my natural growth rate. I can measure length easily due to the contrast between my roots and blonde color. The cons about this product are smell and yes, even the sulfate free version seems to be drying. Definitely add an intensive moisturizing conditioner after you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using FAST for just over 6 weeks now and already had amazing results, I had a bad haircut and in desperation needed to grow this out - Fast has given me some confidence back finally.&lt;br /&gt;I have just ordered a second order as I have run out of the shampoo, when I started the lengths were above my ears but now nearly chin level. I am finally heading off to the hairdressers for a new style!!&lt;br /&gt;I still have some way to go and probably need another 2-3 inches of growth to give me confidence again but thanks to FAST my bad hair days are almost over....&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable. It has possibly dried my hair out slightly but this is more likely due to the fact is in need of a cut.&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo lathers up well and has a nice smell, it is great value for money I will continue to purchase this hopefully for a long time as my hair does not grow at a fast rate.</li>
            <li> I can write a long review as to why I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again or recommend to anyone. To simplify it DONT BOTHER buying it.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell of this product.  My girlfriend loves this shampoo and condition.  She claims that it has made her hair grow and much stronger.  She stated that her hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily as well.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with cancer way back in 2010 and this shampoo and conditioner is amazing! I suggest everyone who&#x27;s trying to get longer hair try it!</li>
            <li> It is best of the best&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I hope every one looking for the best result to give it a shot</li>
            <li> It works great I have noticed a huge difference In my hair growth</li>
            <li> My hair has grown a little faster, but it isn&#x27;t as fast as I was hoping. I do like how it smells and my hair is in great condition!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner works well, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s made my hair grow more, but it&#x27;s healthy and has less breakage, which is a plus. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that my conditioner bottle is impossible to squeeze to get the product out, I had to put it into a different bottle which meant I lost some product.</li>
            <li> I like it because I feel like it makes my hair healthier. after using this stuff my hair looks healthier and more volumized, its also really shiny, but I didn&#x27;t notice any faster hair growth. maybe this is for people who have slower growing hair</li>
            <li> I think this product is good. It works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m making daily use this shampoo for 1month.&lt;br /&gt;My hair longer than before.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is also good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am on my second set and my hair is growing like crazy. Easy to tell since I color my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 3 weeks now. I&#x27;ve noticed a changing in my hair.. It&#x27;s growing.. I just ordered more!</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in the growth of my hair from using this product.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to say Nisim Fast really works. My hair DOES NOT typically grow fast. I purshased this product, had my hair measured and began to wash and condition daily as directed. Most African-Americans don&#x27;t shampoo daily, but I&#x27;m natural and had the big chop almost 1 year ago with slow growth. Honestly after 2 weeks I had my hair measured again and there IS growth, YEAH; This is not normal for me. I shared my shampoo and condition with my mother and niece. Each of us has since purchased our personal set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CON I have about using this product is the fact it DOES dry out our hair; so to combat that you MUST use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My hair has not been growing at a faster rate but it is a lot healthier, I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions and even bought the wet dry hair brush and I&#x27;ve been using the products for over two months</li>
            <li> Product left my hair brittle and dry. It caused many split ends. It had the complete opposite effect from what it advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the third time ordering this product it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest but it does its job I have noticed growth and I use Shea moisture for deep conditioning and sulfate free cream to style overall I am happy with my results</li>
            <li> This product does help accelerate the growth of your hair but, has some serious drying effects. Just pair it with a good deep conditioner and you should be fine. Also, if you use it for months on end your hair will get used to it and won&#x27;t grow as fast as it did when you first started using it. I use it for a month or two then stop for about three weeks and continue again so that my scalp doesn&#x27;t get too used to it.</li>
            <li> Caused major breakage for my Afro Natural hair. Had to return because too much protein for my hair type.</li>
