    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is one of the best bargains on the Amazon site.  </li>
            <li>Every piece--the electric hair cutter/trimmer, the scissors, the hair size adapters, the brush, the cape, etc., are all of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>The Andis line seemed to have the best reviews of all of the hair clipper units, so I went with this one.    </li>
            <li>These clippers are perfect for me and get the job done as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I have a perfectly even 1/4 inch Caesar every time.</li>
            <li>My daughter has already cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair and they look great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>An excellent kit for the price!</li>
            <li>He insisted on having some \\&quot;real\\&quot; clippers and these work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Taking it out of the box, I was rather impressed with the clipper&#x27;s look and feel -- and</li>
            <li>Real good piece of equipment real good build and</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the way these clippers handle, and all the attchments etc., included in the kit.  </li>
            <li>The unit itself works great.</li>
            <li>it work real good in any kind of hair trim loved it</li>
            <li>everything good</li>
            <li>GOOD HOUSE CLIPPERS</li>
            <li>It comes with a good number of accessories.    </li>
            <li>, amazon was amazing.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, very good product.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked for it to have more attachments.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap, but good pair of clippers to save money, this will do the job.  </li>
            <li>The best benefit is that they run so cool; they never even come close to getting hot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and cut very smoothly.</li>
            <li>so I could finish my haircut but be warned, the hot metal blade can still touch and burn the top of your ear (which I experienced firsthand) where the plastic guard ends and the metal is exposed.    </li>
            <li>and I was pleased.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you apply the oil that comes in the kit on the blade before you cut the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Haircuts are twice as fast with the great blade on this unit.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving precision haircuts at home for many years, and this product has revolutionized the process.</li>
            <li>the combs/guards fit the clipper blade nice and snug.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, the unit has the power to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to have a decent amount of good user reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Overall a great set of clippers, matginal quality guards.</li>
            <li>and I bought it for cheap.  </li>
            <li>That exposed metal blade was soooooo hot, it burned my skin!!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with my previous version and thought 7 years of solid use was good enough to convince me that this is a good brand and model.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses it to clean up my neck, around my ears, and my sideburns.</li>
            <li>It works much better than my old unit, doesn&#x27;t heat up too much (after 5 min or so), and even did a better job on my mustache/goatee than one built specifically for goatees!    </li>
            <li>you want a fast motor and perfectly clean cut, pay some more.</li>
            <li>This set has everything you need to give yourself a nice fade that looks professional.</li>
            <li>good luck getting it all back in!).</li>
            <li>This is a good unit and has all of the necessary items with it.</li>
            <li>THEY GET VERY HOT AFTER A WHILE.</li>
            <li>I started looking at all the options available on Amazon because nowadays, Amazon is always the first place I search for consumer goods in order to maximize my Amazon Prime membership.  </li>
            <li>but it gets very hot after a while.  </li>
            <li>The clipper was good for the price, but there were still minor problems with the clipper.  </li>
            <li>so most clippers usually work fairly well with my hair in the beginning.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful that I kept the old guards because I like them better.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The video is fun to watch though</li>
            <li>My original Andis clippers from 7 years ago came with a much sturdier feeling set of guards.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these for everyone intent on performing their own personal hair grooming.</li>
            <li>Cut my hair for the first time using these clippers without any problems.</li>
            <li>It blew a fuse on my first use.</li>
            <li>It got really really hot in the first 5 minutes into the cut.</li>
            <li>I just had my first hair cut using this clipper yesterday.</li>
            <li>it was so hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has many more attachments than what I previously had and my favorite is the biggest one which leaves hair long enough that I can do most men&#x27;s haircuts totally with this clipper which makes for an idioit-proof, quick hair cut!  </li>
            <li>The clippers have been easy to maintain, the blades are easy to change, and when you make the commitment to service and clean your tools, they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This new version is essentially the same quality, and seems to be doing the same excellent job at trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>When the clipper is put to the shortest setting, the clipper will cut hair pretty well as the motor is fast.  </li>
            <li>All those nice attachments will likely never get used, but this clipper does very well for less than $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No barbershops for me! :)</li>
            <li>Andis is of the very highest quality for the money.  </li>
            <li>If you do choose to go with this clipper, just make sure you keep your haircut time under ten minutes, always use a plastic comb-guard (which, in my honest opinion, defeats the purpose of the adjustable lever), and make sure you touch the blade from time to time to check its temperature if you&#x27;re cutting someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Because I cut my own hair and am pretty anal about perfection, my haircuts usually take about 30-40 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is completely unacceptible for a hair clipper to get THAT HOT.  </li>
            <li>It feels a bit better quality-wise but costs less.</li>
            <li>Wow this product works very well.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this new version is that the guards are a cheaper feeling plastic.  </li>
            <li>and I decided that it was time for some new ones.</li>
            <li>The assortment of attachments (including a 1\\&quot; comb attachment) and extra long cord are nice features of these clippers; however, they got very hot in just a few minutes&#x27; time.  </li>
            <li>So i can&#x27;t really use it if I have to wait 20 minutes between operation of 5 minutes for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>and it still works like brand new (I&#x27;ve probably given 20 cuts with it so far).</li>
            <li>The clippers were hot enough to burn skin before I could complete my son&#x27;s haircut.  </li>
            <li>The wooden brush felt pretty solid as well -- much nicer than the cheap plastic flat cleaning brushes you normally see in other clipper sets.    </li>
            <li>But for simple buzz cuts and fades, it&#x27;s not of much use.    </li>
            <li>No problem on the clipper so far.</li>
            <li>This by far out cuts any of them.</li>
            <li>then my old one.</li>
            <li>has work with no problems so far.</li>
            <li>I have only used this items twice, but it has performed very well.</li>
            <li>The instructional DVD was very helpful in determining how to cut properly.</li>
            <li>cord is long enough to not limit you at all and the attachments clip on nice and tight</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp and the motor is powerful.</li>
            <li>Just a few clean strokes against my hair&#x27;s growth grade</li>
            <li>I initially was expecting/hoping to be amazed at how much cleaner and faster it would be to only have to go through each section of hair in one pass.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same old buzzer for years and decided to upgrade.  </li>
            <li>This hair cutting kit cuts hair fairly well,</li>
            <li>The set with the accessories are attractive but completely useless when the shaver breaks down.</li>
            <li>The basic overall cut with the Andis takes only a few minutes, after which I add the finishing touches -- and it&#x27;s reduced the time it takes to give a good haircut by at least half.</li>

            <li> The DVD is very outdated and hilarious.</li>
            <li> It comes with several clips including a blender and two tapering units, a comb, scissors, a small and a large two-sided brush, oil, a carrying case, and a DVD.    </li>
            <li> not much use if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> Boy, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing with that old piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Runs a little warmer than my old Oster it replaced, but</li>
            <li> The DVD is informative if you are looking to leave your hair a bit longer or work on long hair.</li>
            <li> They worked better than a less expensive unit we have from Clairol.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of other cutters that were purchased at big box stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Wahl and Oster clippers in the past (as these are the two brands I find at my local drugstores such as Target or Walmart) and I&#x27;ve never experienced clippers that got hot enough to burn my skin -- not even after a 45 minute continuous hair cut, let alone 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> BLADES WERE SOMEWHAT SHARP</li>
            <li> RAZOR SHARP.</li>
            <li> IF ANYONE NEEDS THEIR BLADES RAZOR SHARP EMAIL</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the case doesn&#x27;t seem to stay shut, and it is difficult to put it all back in.</li>
            <li> It gets job done and a bit less noisy</li>
            <li> My previous clipper was a consumer-level clipper made by Wahl which I purchased from a Target retail store for about [...].  </li>
            <li> I had the same model (earlier version) for 7 years or hard use, and it finally failed.  </li>
            <li> this thing is supposed to have 4x the cutting power of a traditional magnetic-motor-based clipper (which I believe my Wahl is since I only paid $[...] for the kit from Target 3 years ago).  </li>
            <li> Also with the variation in attachments, you can make a very slight fade and you can take them off to get a skin close shave.  </li>
            <li> Had to return it, not sure if its defective or its just the way it works but within 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair since I was 16 years old</li>
            <li> I applied some clipper oil (small plastic jar of clipper oil</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did have to make a couple passes in various sections of my hair to get the strands that the 23745 missed.  </li>
            <li> The kit has everything you would possibly need for hair cutting or trimming, plus some.  </li>
            <li> We used the hair cutting kit today on myself and my two boys using the #2 length (short).  </li>

            <li> This is one of the best bargains on the Amazon site.  Andis is of the very highest quality for the money.  The kit has everything you would possibly need for hair cutting or trimming, plus some.  Every piece--the electric hair cutter/trimmer, the scissors, the hair size adapters, the brush, the cape, etc., are all of excellent quality.  Most importantly, the unit has the power to do the job.  It even comes with a \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video.</li>
            <li> Bought this to supplement my Flowbee. My wife uses it to clean up my neck, around my ears, and my sideburns. All those nice attachments will likely never get used, but this clipper does very well for less than $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No barbershops for me! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to cut my husband&#x27;s thick hair and it did not work at all.  His hair kept getting caught in the blades and I had to return this item.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, very good product.  everything good, amazon was amazing.  Now I can cut the hair of everybody in the family.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Runs a little warmer than my old Oster it replaced, but acceptable. I satisdied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I had the same model (earlier version) for 7 years or hard use, and it finally failed.  I was very happy with my previous version and thought 7 years of solid use was good enough to convince me that this is a good brand and model.  So I came to amazon.com looking for the same thing and here it was.    This new version is essentially the same quality, and seems to be doing the same excellent job at trimming hair.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this new version is that the guards are a cheaper feeling plastic.  My original Andis clippers from 7 years ago came with a much sturdier feeling set of guards.  I&#x27;m grateful that I kept the old guards because I like them better.    Overall a great set of clippers, matginal quality guards.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair for the first time using these clippers without any problems. The DVD is very outdated and hilarious. This set has everything you need to give yourself a nice fade that looks professional.</li>
            <li> The assortment of attachments (including a 1\\&quot; comb attachment) and extra long cord are nice features of these clippers; however, they got very hot in just a few minutes&#x27; time.  The clippers were hot enough to burn skin before I could complete my son&#x27;s haircut.  Same thing happened when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair several hours later after the clippers had cooled off.  I returned these clippers to Amazon and bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> GOOD HOUSE CLIPPERS BUT NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE. THEY GET VERY HOT AFTER A WHILE. BLADES WERE SOMEWHAT SHARP BUT AFTER I SHARPENED THEM THEY ARE NOW RAZOR SHARP. IF ANYONE NEEDS THEIR BLADES RAZOR SHARP EMAIL ME I CAN DO IT FOR $12</li>
            <li> We used the hair cutting kit today on myself and my two boys using the #2 length (short).  Everything went well and I was pleased.  They worked better than a less expensive unit we have from Clairol.</li>
            <li> It blew a fuse on my first use. It got really really hot in the first 5 minutes into the cut. The set with the accessories are attractive but completely useless when the shaver breaks down. Only option left is to return it.    Will not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I had a set of clippers for about 10 yrs and I decided that it was time for some new ones. The Andis line seemed to have the best reviews of all of the hair clipper units, so I went with this one.    It comes with several clips including a blender and two tapering units, a comb, scissors, a small and a large two-sided brush, oil, a carrying case, and a DVD.    The DVD is informative if you are looking to leave your hair a bit longer or work on long hair. But for simple buzz cuts and fades, it&#x27;s not of much use.    The unit itself works great. It works much better than my old unit, doesn&#x27;t heat up too much (after 5 min or so), and even did a better job on my mustache/goatee than one built specifically for goatees!    The only drawback is that the case doesn&#x27;t seem to stay shut, and it is difficult to put it all back in.</li>
            <li> These clippers are perfect for me and get the job done as advertised. Just a few clean strokes against my hair&#x27;s growth grade and I have a perfectly even 1/4 inch Caesar every time. The best benefit is that they run so cool; they never even come close to getting hot. I would highly recommend these for everyone intent on performing their own personal hair grooming.</li>
            <li> My daughter has already cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair and they look great! It has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> I just had my first hair cut using this clipper yesterday. The blade is sharp and the motor is powerful. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and cut very smoothly. Make sure you apply the oil that comes in the kit on the blade before you cut the hair. No problem on the clipper so far. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Wow this product works very well.  I have had a couple of other cutters that were purchased at big box stores.  This by far out cuts any of them.</li>
            <li> I cut my entire family&#x27;s hair regularly.  I have been using the same old buzzer for years and decided to upgrade.  I looked at a lot of units and decided on this one.  Boy, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing with that old piece of junk! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Haircuts are twice as fast with the great blade on this unit.  I wipe the hair out and give it a dab of oil (brush and oil included) before and after each cut and it still works like brand new (I&#x27;ve probably given 20 cuts with it so far). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has many more attachments than what I previously had and my favorite is the biggest one which leaves hair long enough that I can do most men&#x27;s haircuts totally with this clipper which makes for an idioit-proof, quick hair cut!  Also with the variation in attachments, you can make a very slight fade and you can take them off to get a skin close shave.  The kit also comes with a brush, comb, sciccors, smock and an instructional DVD (which I haven&#x27;t watched yet, so I can&#x27;t comment).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cord is long enough to not limit you at all and the attachments clip on nice and tight so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the occational fall off and buzz.  :)  Everything comes in a reusable case to store it in (which once you open up the smock, good luck getting it all back in!).</li>
            <li> Had to return it, not sure if its defective or its just the way it works but within 5 minutes I kid you not, this thing could scorch your skin it was so hot. So i can&#x27;t really use it if I have to wait 20 minutes between operation of 5 minutes for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my last Remington, which stopped working for no reason. It gets job done and a bit less noisy then my old one. It feels a bit better quality-wise but costs less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving precision haircuts at home for many years, and this product has revolutionized the process. The basic overall cut with the Andis takes only a few minutes, after which I add the finishing touches -- and it&#x27;s reduced the time it takes to give a good haircut by at least half. The clippers have been easy to maintain, the blades are easy to change, and when you make the commitment to service and clean your tools, they will last a long time. An excellent kit for the price!</li>
            <li> has work with no problems so far. I would have liked for it to have more attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend - a beginner at cutting his own hair.  He insisted on having some \\&quot;real\\&quot; clippers and these work perfectly.  He&#x27;s had them for over a year now without any problems, and can cut and shape up his hair like a barber. Saving lots of money too, you go boy!</li>
            <li> PROLOGUE:  Before I begin my review of the Andis 23745 Promotor hair cutting kit, let me first give you a background on myself when it comes to cutting hair.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair since I was 16 years old and I&#x27;m 34 now (I cut my hair about twice per month) so I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different hair clippers over the years.  Because I cut my own hair and am pretty anal about perfection, my haircuts usually take about 30-40 minutes.  My hair is on the thinner side (born with thin hair) so most clippers usually work fairly well with my hair in the beginning.    My previous clipper was a consumer-level clipper made by Wahl which I purchased from a Target retail store for about [...].  It served its purpose for the last 3 years but it was time for me to replace it because during recent times, I often found myself having to go over the same hair section several times to get all the hair strands.    PRE-USAGE:  I started looking at all the options available on Amazon because nowadays, Amazon is always the first place I search for consumer goods in order to maximize my Amazon Prime membership.  I read the description and reviews for a bunch of different models.  I ended up going with this Andis 23745 Promotor for several reasons... 1. It seemed to have a decent amount of good user reviews.  2. The Amazon description (as well as the description of this product on Andis&#x27; website) claims the motor produces 4x the power of a traditional magnetic motor. 3. It comes with a good number of accessories.    Taking it out of the box, I was rather impressed with the clipper&#x27;s look and feel -- and the combs/guards fit the clipper blade nice and snug.  The wooden brush felt pretty solid as well -- much nicer than the cheap plastic flat cleaning brushes you normally see in other clipper sets.    USAGE:  I applied some clipper oil (small plastic jar of clipper oil included in the set) to the blades to prepare it for my hair cut and attached the number 2 comb-guard.  I started trimming my hair starting with the sides and then towards the back.  I initially was expecting/hoping to be amazed at how much cleaner and faster it would be to only have to go through each section of hair in one pass.  Unfortunately, I did have to make a couple passes in various sections of my hair to get the strands that the 23745 missed.  That was quite disappointing considering this thing is supposed to have 4x the cutting power of a traditional magnetic-motor-based clipper (which I believe my Wahl is since I only paid $[...] for the kit from Target 3 years ago).  However, this is not why I&#x27;m giving this clipper 2 stars.  Read on.  After about 10 minutes of trimming, I decided to remove the plastic comb-guard so I could neatly trim the \\&quot;fuzzy peach-fuzz hair\\&quot; near the base of where my hair meets my neck and ear area.  Yooowwwzzeeerrrsss!!!!  That exposed metal blade was soooooo hot, it burned my skin!!  This is completely unacceptible for a hair clipper to get THAT HOT.  I&#x27;ve used both Wahl and Oster clippers in the past (as these are the two brands I find at my local drugstores such as Target or Walmart) and I&#x27;ve never experienced clippers that got hot enough to burn my skin -- not even after a 45 minute continuous hair cut, let alone 10 minutes.  Moreover, I did attach the plastic comb-guard back over the blade so I could finish my haircut but be warned, the hot metal blade can still touch and burn the top of your ear (which I experienced firsthand) where the plastic guard ends and the metal is exposed.    FINAL THOUGHTS:  If you do choose to go with this clipper, just make sure you keep your haircut time under ten minutes, always use a plastic comb-guard (which, in my honest opinion, defeats the purpose of the adjustable lever), and make sure you touch the blade from time to time to check its temperature if you&#x27;re cutting someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Real good piece of equipment real good build and it work real good in any kind of hair trim loved it</li>
            <li> This hair cutting kit cuts hair fairly well, but it gets very hot after a while.  Other than that it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the way these clippers handle, and all the attchments etc., included in the kit.  My only problem is finding repacement blades.  I wish these were offered as an extra at time of purchase.</li>
            <li> I have only used this items twice, but it has performed very well. The instructional DVD was very helpful in determining how to cut properly. This is a good unit and has all of the necessary items with it.</li>
            <li> The clipper was good for the price, but there were still minor problems with the clipper.  When the clipper is put to the shortest setting, the clipper will cut hair pretty well as the motor is fast.  On the longest setting, the clipper&#x27;s motor will practically stop and not cut hair at all.  Basically, I used the clipper on it&#x27;s shortest setting and have relatively no problems.  It does the job and I bought it for cheap.  The DVD that comes with it is garbage and doesn&#x27;t tell anything about cutting hair except how to ruin it.  It&#x27;s that bad.  If you want a cheap, but good pair of clippers to save money, this will do the job.  It you want a fast motor and perfectly clean cut, pay some more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair twice since this clipper arrived. The video is fun to watch though not much use if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair. The question is how will it hold up, and only time will tell. It seems to be well made, however.</li>
