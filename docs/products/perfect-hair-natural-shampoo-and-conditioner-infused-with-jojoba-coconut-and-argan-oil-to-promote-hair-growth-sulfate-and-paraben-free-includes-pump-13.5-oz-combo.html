            <li>I ignorantly thought women didn&#x27;t have to deal with this problem, then one day I realized that more of my hair had been coming out in the shower and on my brush,</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos and hair treatments to try and improve the shape of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I chose this shampoo and conditioner by FOCUS because it is safe for color treated hair, and I like to color my hair.  </li>
            <li>(Ok, it&#x27;s not that I like to color my hair</li>
            <li>My hair grows depending on many factors.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this time I will pay more close attention to the effectiveness of its intended purpose- to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>Dont know if my hair is growing faster but love the feel and smell</li>
            <li>but it smells good and leaves my hair smelling really good and soft</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>

            <li>The bottle size is pretty good too</li>
            <li>and looks like I have more strong hair...</li>
            <li>Smells great and my hair is super shiny and soft love it!</li>
            <li>makes my hair look very full.</li>
            <li>If fragrance were the most important factor, I would continue using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great for african american hair of all types, my hair dries great, and feels soft and silky and the product smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Once I used conditioner , I felt my hair easy to manage, comb , brush.</li>
            <li>Okay, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky soft but not greasy, fuller and smells wonderful and NO harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Whenever i comb my hair a huge bunch would fall off and be found on my comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I decided to start fresh, and this stuff has been keeping my hair healthy</li>
            <li>This product is ok, it works well enough and smells good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on relaxed hair, no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It has been a long time since I&#x27;ve used a shampoo that made my hair this beautiful and manageable.</li>
            <li>I got so excited that I had to write a review</li>
            <li>Love it thanks for adding hemp!</li>
            <li>Excited as I was</li>
            <li>I take great care not to use hair products with dyes to reduce discoloration and keep away from products that dry out hair, including anything requiring heat (blow dryers, curling irons, etc.)</li>
            <li>Nothing special shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody, notice - it is unisex.</li>
            <li>Seen results right after I used it!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The smell of this shampoo conditioner is not bad compared to ones you get for hair growth.</li>
            <li>The smell of this shampoo conditioner is not bad compared to ones you get for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really loved the conditioner and felt it was really moisturizing, but it had a strong unisex scent which I was not a big fan of.</li>
            <li>As an African-American woman with mild scalp eczema after using this when my hair dries it gives it</li>
            <li>As an extra bonus, it smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I recently been using this product and I love it!</li>
            <li>But made my hair oily real fast</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li>It smelled great, left my hair feeling soft and shiny, and it helped with my psoriasis on my scalp/buildup issues.  </li>
            <li>wow love it ....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m bold, then is hard to expect a lot of new hair, but to me is great!!!</li>
            <li>other wise it cleaned my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the hair growth because within a month my hair has grown the exact same length it has before I used it, but it makes my hair feel amazingly.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was my first wash.</li>
            <li>First, some background.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order one more time to see if I didn&#x27;t just get an off batch the second time.  </li>
            <li>And it really works!</li>
            <li>Yes.my hair is on a hair program wash twice a week.water 3 times a day hot oil twice a month.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it ; later that night when I tried I instantly fell in love ; first off my hair smelled so good all that night &amp; through the next day.</li>
            <li>Very nice feeling, but not super soft.</li>
            <li>I got this after a very bad,very short hair cut and my hair has started to look better.</li>
            <li>I have African American hair, the shampoo smelt really good.</li>
            <li>Came very well packaged &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft</li>
            <li>As a regular shampoo and conditioner they&#x27;re fine, and I like the smell.  </li>
            <li>The keratin ingredients in it smells pretty strong, but it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it leaves my hair straight.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know though.</li>
            <li>Only had it for about a month, have to say my scalp doesn&#x27;t look as light as it used to.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>Wow.....growing  fast</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference...</li>
            <li>Also it seems that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier to comb after showing.</li>
            <li>Then when I stumbled upon this I wanted to give it a shot as the reviews looked promising.</li>
            <li>This product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found it.the product has rich ingredients in it that brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, easier to manage and actually feels clean.</li>
            <li>and as I get older it just keeps getting thinner.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing deliverd fast only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem much different then regular shampoo (I&#x27;ve used 4 times) hoping that will change.</li>
            <li>I mean A LOT more!  </li>
            <li>BUT it leaves my hair amazingly soft, manageable, and looks much healthier after even one use.</li>
            <li>but I kind of have to color it if you know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally my hair is very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel the same after washing as it did with the first batch I bought.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the same product I got the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li>Made my hair kinda tangled more than usual</li>
            <li>bottle size is also pretty big</li>
            <li>Not sure if it made my hair grow faster, but it certainly didn&#x27;t grow slower and it made my hair so soft and healthy that the bad hair cut looked good within days!  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it, will be sticking with this for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling smooth &amp; soft; I also have like dry scalp &amp; always have flakes, it&#x27;s been two days since I&#x27;ve received &amp; have been using this product !</li>
            <li>to keep it reasonably soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>So far It&#x27;s already got me attatched</li>
            <li>A just pressed soft feel</li>
            <li>i have kinky curly hair so its very tangled anyways but made my hair feel dry</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it leaves my hair soft and without weighing it down and being that I am half Afro American and Puerto Rican.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I thought this product was mainly for African American hair types.</li>
            <li>My hair is 80-90% white (I can&#x27;t be more exact because the hair with color is in the back on the lower half of my head) and has developed a certain coarse frizziness to it that is apparently common with grey hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is long but it is not thick and voluminous...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve so far only used it twice, but I can see and feel the difference already.</li>
            <li>On the Amazon website only the natural ingredients are listed.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of chemical ingredients listed on the bottle that aren&#x27;t stated on the website, including but not limited to tetrasodium EDTA!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and extremely damaged from years of ironing, dying, and washing everyday.</li>
            <li>Usually I need to add double conditioner to make my hair soft and with a regular portion of this I am golden.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I barely received it</li>
            <li>so I had to use at least a hand full of shampoo to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Worked well the first few washes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for the first time a few months back</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner also left my hair feeling sooo soft ; my hair has always been so dry from straightening it &amp; whatnot</li>

            <li> Makes my hair silky soft but not greasy, fuller and smells wonderful and NO harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Whenever i comb my hair a huge bunch would fall off and be found on my comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided to start fresh, and this stuff has been keeping my hair healthy</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it works well enough and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good on relaxed hair, no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I&#x27;ve used a shampoo that made my hair this beautiful and manageable.</li>
            <li> I got so excited that I had to write a review</li>
            <li> Love it thanks for adding hemp!</li>
            <li> Excited as I was</li>
            <li> I take great care not to use hair products with dyes to reduce discoloration and keep away from products that dry out hair, including anything requiring heat (blow dryers, curling irons, etc.)</li>
            <li> Nothing special shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody, notice - it is unisex.</li>
            <li> Seen results right after I used it!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo conditioner is not bad compared to ones you get for hair growth.</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo conditioner is not bad compared to ones you get for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really loved the conditioner and felt it was really moisturizing, but it had a strong unisex scent which I was not a big fan of.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman with mild scalp eczema after using this when my hair dries it gives it</li>
            <li> As an extra bonus, it smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I recently been using this product and I love it!</li>
            <li> But made my hair oily real fast</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> It smelled great, left my hair feeling soft and shiny, and it helped with my psoriasis on my scalp/buildup issues.  </li>
            <li> wow love it ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m bold, then is hard to expect a lot of new hair, but to me is great!!!</li>
            <li> other wise it cleaned my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the hair growth because within a month my hair has grown the exact same length it has before I used it, but it makes my hair feel amazingly.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> This was my first wash.</li>
            <li> First, some background.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order one more time to see if I didn&#x27;t just get an off batch the second time.  </li>
            <li> And it really works!</li>
            <li> Yes.my hair is on a hair program wash twice a week.water 3 times a day hot oil twice a month.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it ; later that night when I tried I instantly fell in love ; first off my hair smelled so good all that night &amp; through the next day.</li>
            <li> Very nice feeling, but not super soft.</li>
            <li> I got this after a very bad,very short hair cut and my hair has started to look better.</li>
            <li> I have African American hair, the shampoo smelt really good.</li>
            <li> Came very well packaged &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft</li>
            <li> As a regular shampoo and conditioner they&#x27;re fine, and I like the smell.  </li>
            <li> The keratin ingredients in it smells pretty strong, but it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it leaves my hair straight.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know though.</li>
            <li> Only had it for about a month, have to say my scalp doesn&#x27;t look as light as it used to.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> Wow.....growing  fast</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference...</li>
            <li> Also it seems that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier to comb after showing.</li>
            <li> Then when I stumbled upon this I wanted to give it a shot as the reviews looked promising.</li>
            <li> This product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found it.the product has rich ingredients in it that brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, easier to manage and actually feels clean.</li>
            <li> and as I get older it just keeps getting thinner.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing deliverd fast only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem much different then regular shampoo (I&#x27;ve used 4 times) hoping that will change.</li>
            <li> I mean A LOT more!  </li>
            <li> BUT it leaves my hair amazingly soft, manageable, and looks much healthier after even one use.</li>
            <li> but I kind of have to color it if you know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally my hair is very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel the same after washing as it did with the first batch I bought.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the same product I got the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li> Made my hair kinda tangled more than usual</li>
            <li> bottle size is also pretty big</li>
            <li> Not sure if it made my hair grow faster, but it certainly didn&#x27;t grow slower and it made my hair so soft and healthy that the bad hair cut looked good within days!  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it, will be sticking with this for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling smooth &amp; soft; I also have like dry scalp &amp; always have flakes, it&#x27;s been two days since I&#x27;ve received &amp; have been using this product !</li>
            <li> to keep it reasonably soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> So far It&#x27;s already got me attatched</li>
            <li> A just pressed soft feel</li>
            <li> i have kinky curly hair so its very tangled anyways but made my hair feel dry</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it leaves my hair soft and without weighing it down and being that I am half Afro American and Puerto Rican.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I thought this product was mainly for African American hair types.</li>
            <li> My hair is 80-90% white (I can&#x27;t be more exact because the hair with color is in the back on the lower half of my head) and has developed a certain coarse frizziness to it that is apparently common with grey hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long but it is not thick and voluminous...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve so far only used it twice, but I can see and feel the difference already.</li>
            <li> On the Amazon website only the natural ingredients are listed.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of chemical ingredients listed on the bottle that aren&#x27;t stated on the website, including but not limited to tetrasodium EDTA!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and extremely damaged from years of ironing, dying, and washing everyday.</li>
            <li> Usually I need to add double conditioner to make my hair soft and with a regular portion of this I am golden.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I barely received it</li>
            <li> so I had to use at least a hand full of shampoo to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well the first few washes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the first time a few months back</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner also left my hair feeling sooo soft ; my hair has always been so dry from straightening it &amp; whatnot</li>
            <li> My hair is currently quite thick, but grows slowly and is constantly under attack by split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many of the reviews, I purchased this product based on the reviews stating that their hair was soft, manageable and shiny after use.</li>
            <li> end result is that although everyone&#x27;s hair is different and this may work for other hair types, it felt far too damaging for mine -</li>
            <li> it last a long time in my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> After my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t very soft ;( .</li>
            <li> Hair sternum when hot iron.if your serious about growing yr hair</li>
            <li> After desperately trying sooooo many products I decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> If your not careful you can use half the bottle in one wash.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and stiff after using this product - not just near the ends, but felt like straw all over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason it only gets 1 star from me is due to the lack of truth in advertising.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> The color of the shampoo is a clear-ish pink; the conditioner is a pearl-ish pink.</li>
            <li> It has Jojoba oil and Moroccan Argan oil which is widely acclaimed for moisture and nourishing properties.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought I had found one here, but unfortunately there exists a major discrepancy between the ingredients list on Amazon and the complete list of ingredients found in the product, which are listed on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to being 5</li>
            <li> I had to us my other conditioner (kerasilk) just to give my hair life.</li>
            <li> Active ingredients in Conditioner: Aqua, (Water) Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Zinc Gluconate, Biotin, Hemp Seed Oil, Simmondsa Chinensis (Jojoba)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth, I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks but got hair cut shortly after because I couldn&#x27;t take the dead ends</li>
            <li> NOT good for white hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing is it makes my hair dry and hard.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about spending this much on shampoo/conditioner, but I was at rock bottom with my hair and desperate.</li>
            <li> so this was really something I wanted to try, as it got to the point where I was getting very sad.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell and left my hair knotted after first wash.</li>
            <li> in addition to the unnecessary pink dye.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> have been using this from past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> After trying every brand in the drugstore and having every single one fail, I decided to do some searching online and found this.  </li>
            <li> I had a hair treatment that went wrong and ended up burning my hair and made it rough and brittle.</li>
            <li> guess my hair is too delicate, so this shampoo is not for me...</li>
            <li> I ordered a second set and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It makes my mare very hard and dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo was not great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was really thin and runny and it seemed like it took a lot of it to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner and My hair has grown at least an inch all around!!</li>
            <li> At this price, you cant go wrong with this combo.</li>
            <li> I got to the point were I ended up cutting 3 inches of my hair which made me feel sad.</li>
            <li> was getting very frustrating and depressing for me.</li>
            <li> did not work for me at all :(</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this!!!! My hair is softer, easier to manage and actually feels clean. I have a bounce to my hair- salon quality!!!! At this price, you cant go wrong with this combo.</li>
            <li> WORKS AS DESCRIBED..GOOD SHAMPOO-CONDITIONER. WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Very good hair product.  Makes my hair shiny, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair!</li>
            <li> I love them both greaaaaat smell it last a long time in my hair</li>
            <li> It really works. Im on my 2nd bottle and my hair looks great, everyone ask me what im using. Is brighter, and longer.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about spending this much on shampoo/conditioner, but I was at rock bottom with my hair and desperate. After trying every brand in the drugstore and having every single one fail, I decided to do some searching online and found this.  I&#x27;ve so far only used it twice, but I can see and feel the difference already. As an extra bonus, it smells pretty good too. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Ordered some for my son as well!  Did help with hair loss.</li>
            <li> this product made my hair limp..no body!  other wise it cleaned my hair</li>
            <li> Okay, but nothing special. Not worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my hair since I started using this.  My hair started thinning when I had kids and as I get older it just keeps getting thinner.  I ignorantly thought women didn&#x27;t have to deal with this problem, then one day I realized that more of my hair had been coming out in the shower and on my brush, etc...  I mean A LOT more!  I have tried many shampoos and hair treatments to try and improve the shape of my hair.  My hair is long but it is not thick and voluminous...and of course, that is what I want.  I chose this shampoo and conditioner by FOCUS because it is safe for color treated hair, and I like to color my hair.  (Ok, it&#x27;s not that I like to color my hair but I kind of have to color it if you know what I mean.)  Since using this shampoo and conditioner I have noticed hair growth and a change in the texture of my hair...it seems thicker and fuller.  It has been awhile since my hair has actually grown any until now so it is nice to see some growth!  I am really impressed by these products and the way they make my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. Love THAT! It seems to be working. I don&#x27;t really know though. My hair grows depending on many factors. I can say that my hair is healthy, detangles very easily, and smells fantastic. I haven&#x27;t finished the bottles yet but I will repurchase. Perhaps this time I will pay more close attention to the effectiveness of its intended purpose- to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing! Only had it for about a month, have to say my scalp doesn&#x27;t look as light as it used to. I think with continuous use, there will be substantial improvement in my hair thinning.</li>
            <li> * UpDate*&lt;br /&gt;My husband HAIR grew a lot he only USES it once a week. Great smell ALSO.Now everyone is asking him what he is using. Will buy again great seller.</li>
            <li> Great product. Dont know if my hair is growing faster but love the feel and smell</li>
            <li> did not work for me at all :(</li>
            <li> been using this 3 times a week for 4 monthes now haven&#x27;t noticed any change in length... but it smells good and leaves my hair smelling really good and soft</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> was ok will order again</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a month now and my hair is noticeably softer, silkier and even a bit longer. I got this after a very bad,very short hair cut and my hair has started to look better. Im impressed with the differences Ive been seeing. The smell is great too.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars. I have African American hair, the shampoo smelt really good. My hair is pretty thick so I had to use at least a hand full of shampoo to wash my hair. Once I used conditioner , I felt my hair easy to manage, comb , brush. Very nice feeling, but not super soft. This was my first wash. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair hopefully this works. After my hair dried it wasn&#x27;t very soft ;( .</li>
            <li> manageabl,hair shine last for days.</li>
            <li> As a regular shampoo and conditioner they&#x27;re fine, and I like the smell.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any enhanced hair growth.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell and left my hair knotted after first wash. I only used once and then returned</li>
            <li> did not make any growth</li>
            <li> First, some background. My hair is 80-90% white (I can&#x27;t be more exact because the hair with color is in the back on the lower half of my head) and has developed a certain coarse frizziness to it that is apparently common with grey hair. I take great care not to use hair products with dyes to reduce discoloration and keep away from products that dry out hair, including anything requiring heat (blow dryers, curling irons, etc.) to keep it reasonably soft and shiny.  My hair is currently quite thick, but grows slowly and is constantly under attack by split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many of the reviews, I purchased this product based on the reviews stating that their hair was soft, manageable and shiny after use. I have used both the shampoo and conditioner ONE time and here are my opinions based on that experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The smell of both products is very nice. If fragrance were the most important factor, I would continue using them.&lt;br /&gt;  The color of the shampoo is a clear-ish pink; the conditioner is a pearl-ish pink. NOT good for white hair.&lt;br /&gt;  My hair was dry and stiff after using this product - not just near the ends, but felt like straw all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is that although everyone&#x27;s hair is different and this may work for other hair types, it felt far too damaging for mine - in addition to the unnecessary pink dye.  I would recommend this for people who have very fine hair or those who&#x27;s oil glands produce an overabundance of oils.</li>
            <li> Great products, it also helped me with my study plus the energy</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the first time a few months back and I was soooo impressed.  It smelled great, left my hair feeling soft and shiny, and it helped with my psoriasis on my scalp/buildup issues.  I ordered a second set and was disappointed.  The consistency was different, the smell was different and the conditioner didn&#x27;t work as well.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel the same after washing as it did with the first batch I bought.  Something was off.  I&#x27;ll order one more time to see if I didn&#x27;t just get an off batch the second time.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll get the same product I got the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li> Very great job with my hair.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> I recently been using this product and I love it! It makes my hair feel really nice and soft. It even smells good too! I had a hair treatment that went wrong and ended up burning my hair and made it rough and brittle. I got to the point were I ended up cutting 3 inches of my hair which made me feel sad. Then I read the reviews on&lt;br /&gt;here hoping that it&#x27;ll help treat my hair. I took a picture of my hair length and in just 2 weeks I took another picture of my hair length and it grew 2cm. I got so excited that I had to write a review so you can know that this stuff works! Good luck!</li>
            <li> Love it! Seen results right after I used it! My hair is so soft and amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it works well enough and smells good too. The reason it only gets 1 star from me is due to the lack of truth in advertising. On the Amazon website only the natural ingredients are listed. There is a lot of chemical ingredients listed on the bottle that aren&#x27;t stated on the website, including but not limited to tetrasodium EDTA!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner and My hair has grown at least an inch all around!! It is great for african american hair of all types, my hair dries great, and feels soft and silky and the product smells wonderful. I will be ordering more. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Awsome awsome awsome so health my hair is Wow.....growing  fast wow love it ....godbless</li>
            <li> This product is pretty great, after just two weeks i can tell my hair feels and looks healthier! So far it hasn&#x27;t helped it grow any, but after each use my hair looks fabulous and feels great! I would recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> Awesome!! I love the smell! And it really works! I notice growth after the 2nd use! I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the hair growth because within a month my hair has grown the exact same length it has before I used it, but it makes my hair feel amazingly.</li>
            <li> I have tried hair products after another none worked for me.I am a mixed mutt Spanish to German.My search for a perfect hair product has come to a end I found it.the product has rich ingredients in it that brought my hair back to life. Gave it a shine and my hair looks Fuller and it looks like it finally growing.dose it work? Yes.my hair is on a hair program wash twice a week.water 3 times a day hot oil twice a month. Hair sternum when hot iron.if your serious about growing yr hair this is a great product.or if you want to revive your hair its perfect.I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.n smells great. Comes out thick.after using it 3 times I had complements.now people want to touch my hair or play with it.from frize to sleak I love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference... Thought it would work better</li>
            <li> Nothing special shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody, notice - it is unisex. So I guess it should work for girls and boys same way?&lt;br /&gt;Well that is my concern.&lt;br /&gt;I guess my hair is too delicate, so this shampoo is not for me... It makes my mare very hard and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Normally my hair is very soft and silky. So i not gonna get this product second time.</li>
            <li> I really loved the conditioner and felt it was really moisturizing, but it had a strong unisex scent which I was not a big fan of. The shampoo was not great. The shampoo was really thin and runny and it seemed like it took a lot of it to apply to my hair. I did not notice any difference in the speed of hair growth. Overall, not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditoner. I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I barely received it and it leaves my hair soft and shinny. The keratin ingredients in it smells pretty strong, but it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it leaves my hair straight. Like I like to have it! I totally recommend this to women especially if you&#x27;ve had your hair chemically relaxed. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair Product AAA</li>
            <li> Made my hair kinda tangled more than usual i have kinky curly hair so its very tangled anyways but made my hair feel dry but it smelled nice</li>
            <li> Smells Great!!! and looks like I have more strong hair...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bold, then is hard to expect a lot of new hair, but to me is great!!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for sensative scalp. Love it thanks for adding hemp!</li>
            <li> just got it in mail. I got this for my wife for her locks . she said it work well and doesn&#x27;t  have a residue.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft i love this product and Its smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would not give it 5 stars because i Dont think it&#x27;s making my hair grow</li>
            <li> Its good - don&#x27;t get brain washed into thinking you will regrow any hair - but it is good shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to being 5***** and the great reviews on it. I love the smell, it leaves my hair soft and without weighing it down and being that I am half Afro American and Puerto Rican. It&#x27;s good on relaxed hair, no harsh chemicals. I can&#x27;t say anything about growth yet since I only have used it twice but will repost later with an update on the growth! So far great product!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and extremely damaged from years of ironing, dying, and washing everyday. After reading reviews, I thought this product was mainly for African American hair types. After desperately trying sooooo many products I decided to give it a try anyway. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s making my hair grow BUT it leaves my hair amazingly soft, manageable, and looks much healthier after even one use. The smell is incredible! Can&#x27;t get enough. Usually I need to add double conditioner to make my hair soft and with a regular portion of this I am golden. Also it seems that my hair isn&#x27;t falling out as much and it&#x27;s much easier to comb after showing. Definitely recommend it, will be sticking with this for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Worked well the first few washes. But made my hair oily real fast</li>
            <li> love how it makes my hair feels but no growth</li>
            <li> so I ordered the item &amp; got it literally two days later &amp; on a Sunday, on a Sunday !!!! How awesome is that ! Excited as I was I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it ; later that night when I tried I instantly fell in love ; first off my hair smelled so good all that night &amp; through the next day. The shampoo/conditioner also left my hair feeling sooo soft ; my hair has always been so dry from straightening it &amp; whatnot but it left my hair feeling smooth &amp; soft; I also have like dry scalp &amp; always have flakes, it&#x27;s been two days since I&#x27;ve received &amp; have been using this product ! So far It&#x27;s already got me attatched, haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet BUT I&#x27;ve also only been using this product(s) for two days ! I&#x27;m ready to already buy another set to stock up ; will write a review later on about the growth :) than you seller amazing product, amazing price &amp; you&#x27;re awesome , on top of it all so quick to ship things out ; expect another purchase soon !</li>
            <li> Not sure if it made my hair grow faster, but it certainly didn&#x27;t grow slower and it made my hair so soft and healthy that the bad hair cut looked good within days!  It has been a long time since I&#x27;ve used a shampoo that made my hair this beautiful and manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing deliverd fast only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t seem much different then regular shampoo (I&#x27;ve used 4 times) hoping that will change.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner. makes my hair look very full.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used. I used them once and my hair feels like straw and started breaking as I combed it afterwards. My hair is naturally dry so I combined the conditioner with a moisturizing one and still got these results. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I have had a problem of thinning hair since 3 years now plus I have hypothyroidism so this was really something I wanted to try, as it got to the point where I was getting very sad. Then when I stumbled upon this I wanted to give it a shot as the reviews looked promising. I have been using this from almost 2 weeks and started to notice a difference. I&#x27;m not losing oodles of hair as before using this and I hope my hair fall stops totally &amp; my hair starts growing back! The smell of this shampoo conditioner is not bad compared to ones you get for hair growth. The bottle size is pretty good too so it will last quite some time. It adds good volume and shine to hair. Also this contains Jojoba oil and Moroccan Argan oil which is acclaimed for moisture and nourishing properties. So I can&#x27;t wait to see more good results! Came very well packaged &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and I can feel the difference it is making on my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Used for 6 months and its just another shampoo. Tresemee with Kariteen  works better then this.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair is super shiny and soft love it!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, have just used it twice but I absolutely love it.  Makes my hair silky soft but not greasy, fuller and smells wonderful and NO harsh chemicals.  I will be ordering soon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It smells AMAZING would totally buy it again. As an African-American woman with mild scalp eczema after using this when my hair dries it gives it A just pressed soft feel and it soothes my scalp. 10/10 would buy again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I was deceived by the way this product was being advertised on Amazon.  I wanted a shampoo WITHOUT potentially harmful chemical ingredients.  I thought I had found one here, but unfortunately there exists a major discrepancy between the ingredients list on Amazon and the complete list of ingredients found in the product, which are listed on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVERTISED INGREDIENT LIST: &amp;#34;Active Ingredients in the Shampoo: Aqua (Water), Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Wheat Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panax Ginseng root extract, Arginine, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Biotin, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Emu Oil, Citric Acid. Active ingredients in Conditioner: Aqua, (Water) Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Zinc Gluconate, Biotin, Hemp Seed Oil, Simmondsa Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Argan Oil.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTUAL INGREDIENTS:  Aqua, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Cocyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betain, Olefin, Cocamide DEA, Glycerin, (Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocyl Sacrosine, Wheat Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare, Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Poly Sorbate 80, Oleth-10, Tocopherayl Acetate, Hyrdolyzed Glycosamingoglycans, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arginine, Acetyl Tyrosine, Articium Majus Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein, Panthnol, Dimethicone, Ornithine HCI, Citrulline, Clucosamine HCl, Biotin, Hydrolyzed Soy Extract, Cluclosomine HCl, PEG 12 Dimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein, Tetrasodium EDTA, Hemp Seed Oil, Simmondsa Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Argan Oil, Emu Oil, Citric Acid, Etholyxated Ester.</li>
            <li> Just my best buy among all on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am NOT pleased with this product. The shampoo is like water, it runs out the bottle. If your not careful you can use half the bottle in one wash. That&#x27;s how watery it is. Another thing is it makes my hair dry and hard. I had to us my other conditioner (kerasilk) just to give my hair life. I will not purchase this product again! Sent product back &amp; received my refund the same day</li>
            <li> This product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a problem of thinning hair since almost a year now. Whenever i comb my hair a huge bunch would fall off and be found on my comb.&lt;br /&gt;This was getting very frustrating and depressing for me. Then i saw this product and read reviews about it and thought of giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this from past 2 weeks and i do have started seeing a d difference. I can notice baby hairs upfront. And i am praying that this continues to grow in a health manner. The smell of this shampoo conditioner is not bad compared to ones you get for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle size is also pretty big so it will last quite some time. It gives great volume and shine to hair. It has Jojoba oil and Moroccan Argan oil which is widely acclaimed for moisture and nourishing properties.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue using this product and hope it helps me as it has uptil now.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer! I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth, I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks but got hair cut shortly after because I couldn&#x27;t take the dead ends so I decided to start fresh, and this stuff has been keeping my hair healthy so thats a plus! All in all this stuff smells and works amazing for rejuvenating I will probably not go back to the Walmart brands!</li>
