            <li>I used to use this lotion years ago and loved how it made my skin shimmer in the sunlight; but when I went to purchase it one summer it seemed that every Jergen&#x27;s shimmer lotion had some sort of self tanner in it.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I use it every day and people notice how nice it looks on your skin.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Jergens Shimmer for many years.</li>
            <li>Oh well, glad we have Amazon to see that we can still get it.</li>
            <li>I give it top rating!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would have given this a 5 star rating because I love the shimmer of the lotion, it&#x27;s price point, but the smell is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, softens, smooths, and leaves a golden sheen on the skin while leaving a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>and it is such a good value!</li>
            <li>If you want the perfect glow without any of that self tanning mess, this is it.  </li>

            <li>I will definitely purchase this again if it&#x27;s available when I run out!</li>
            <li>A light soft shimmer</li>
            <li>I love Jergen&#x27;s Soft Shimmer, it gives you a soft glitterey glow throughout the day as well as moisturize.</li>
            <li>It was available in our local stores but we can no longer find it.</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin sparkle in the sun, but this lotion makes it smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>love this lotion not only does it soften my skin and keep it moist but has a soft glimmer to it.  </li>

            <li>B003KEHMUE Jergens Soft Shimmer Skin Radiance Moisturizer 7.5 Oz (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is not heavy on shimmer</li>
            <li>The price was worth it, as each bottle will last a while considering not much is needed per application, and the product is exactly the same as the one I used to use years ago, scent and all.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this product for 2 reasons, I felt silly paying over $30 for drugstore lotion (the 6 pack was the best deal when I broke down the price per unit), and I was also nervous about the product not being the same since it has been discontinued for a while.  </li>

            <li> This is not a tanning solution. It just gives your skin a soft glow. I use it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like it alot just didn&#x27;t get ecerything I ordered. Wish I would have got all of them cause I was giveing them for late christmas presents.</li>
            <li> Somebody please help,on the picture it shows 2 diffrent versions of the lotion which one is it the first picture or the 2nd one????</li>
            <li> I NEED this!  I remember the first time I used it in 2001.  Since then it has been near impossible to find in stores.  If you want the perfect glow without any of that self tanning mess, this is it.  The gold flecks are so very subtle, but (in the sun) your skin will be gorgeous.  GORGEOUS!    -The Mrs.</li>
            <li> Jergens didn&#x27;t give this product enough time on the market. It contains shimmery gold dust and is a great moisturizer, especially after sun. They no longer make this (they replaced it with a product that adds color). I can&#x27;t believe I found it and it is such a good value!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, it is now not in production and I found it here. YEA I will continue to use it until I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m the guy but I can tell you that my wife loves this stuff and when you find a product that your wife likes then you get it and as often as needed.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the soft shimmer it leaves on my skin.  I finally looked for it online and found here on Amazon - Great!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Don&#x27;t know why Jergens stopped making it. It gives my skin a great shimmer.  And it&#x27;s a skin softener.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this moisturizer, this is the second time we have bought it. It was available in our local stores but we can no longer find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens Shimmer for many years. Now it&#x27;s hard to find, so I ordered a bunch from Amazon. I had over 2 dozen hoarded in my closet. But everyone loves it so I&#x27;ve given it to girl friends. It doesn&#x27;t tan or turn orange it&#x27;s just a shimmer and smoother which is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love Jergen&#x27;s Soft Shimmer, it gives you a soft glitterey glow throughout the day as well as moisturize. I just wish they still sold it inthe stores. Oh well, glad we have Amazon to see that we can still get it. Thank you! Motherof 5!!!!![[ASIN:B003KEHMUE Jergens Soft Shimmer Skin Radiance Moisturizer 7.5 Oz (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> Love The Soft Shimmer Radiance Moisturizer. It gives you a hint if shimmer but enough that you notice it. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and when you buy it at Amazon in pkgs, of 6 you can&#x27;t beat the price. I use it every day and people notice how nice it looks on your skin. I give it top rating!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend.</li>

            <li> love this lotion not only does it soften my skin and keep it moist but has a soft glimmer to it.  WHY, did Jergens ever stop making it..PLEASE bring it back.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5 star rating because I love the shimmer of the lotion, it&#x27;s price point, but the smell is not my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but not fresh smelling</li>
            <li> The only place I can find this stuff now is online.  I bought a 6 pk so I don&#x27;t have to keep re-ordering.  It is great for summer.  A light soft shimmer and it smells great. I put it on my legs, arms and chest...anywhere my skin is exposed.  Love it!</li>
            <li> wifes favorite, thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Jergens has discontinued this great product. What a pity. It moisturizes, softens, smooths, and leaves a golden sheen on the skin while leaving a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I live in the land of sun.  Not only does my skin sparkle in the sun, but this lotion makes it smooth and silky.  Jergens used to sell it in stores but it&#x27;s impossible to find it now.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this but I believe Jergens has discontinued.  Moisturizes and has those gold accents to give your skin a glow.  I use it as my facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  My order was delivered quickly.  The moisturizer is not heavy on shimmer and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Very pretty in the light.</li>
