            <li>it&#x27;s so nice.</li>

            <li>I love it and,  </li>
            <li>I expect more from a $50 bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the bottles are mass produced in a sweat shop somewhere and cost probably $.50 apiece.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the smell...</li>

            <li>and I have had many people ask what I am wearing and then go out and buy it.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>

            <li>Received the sample from Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>, she says it&#x27;s ok but</li>

            <li>Okay, the bottle is shaped like a bust of Nicki</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>but since it was a gift for my daughter for her bday it was ok</li>
            <li>I love d scent,however mine didn&#x27;t come in a cellophane wrap .</li>
            <li>so i knew what to expect, but the fact of getting a 3.4oz bottle for the same price as a 1.7 was magical!!!!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>needed, you can reapply the fragrance so that the smell will be more prominent</li>
            <li>My grand daughter just loves this perfume.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure she will love it.</li>
            <li>This perfume aroma is very nice, kind of flirty but classy.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite!!</li>
            <li>the sweet smelling perfume made me want it more than I have ever wanted a perfume in my life!</li>
            <li>but it is more on the sugary side when comparing to flower scents and water clean type of scents !</li>
            <li>It has a nice sweet scent that I would not expect minaj too have.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for a celebrity perfume.</li>
            <li>The box was huge when I received it and the bottle was just as big, which makes this an excellent purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong or over powering which is what I love.</li>
            <li>However it was so much better than I expected I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>It was a great price and came super fast! ❤</li>
            <li>My mom however said it smelled good, so maybe older ladies would like it better,</li>
            <li>every penny smell is wow Great</li>
            <li>and we were both surprised at how great it smelled.</li>
            <li>It is lightly fruity, but also sexy and sultry...  </li>
            <li>Her perfume, however, is sweet and savory!</li>
            <li>I love love love it soo much!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Her hair and necklace get in the way of opening it easily.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong but yet feminine.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t like scents that are so strong that they make our dog sneeze</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell spicy or strong...</li>
            <li>Not too strong and has more of a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Even the box it comes in is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Perform sweet smell for the summer. :)</li>
            <li>then when i purchased this, i felt relieved that i bought my first nicki perfume on my own.</li>
            <li>The smell is perfect, not to loud or smelly, the bottle is pretty, overall this is a good purchase, &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying it</li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful and simple, I get tons of compliments for it.</li>
            <li>I love the mild scent....</li>
            <li>It arrived really quick!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and soft, unlike most celebrity entertainer fragrances which can seem a bit too fruity or way too strongly floral or musky.</li>
            <li>great price for the large bottle that it comes in my daughter loves the scent and was thrilled that she received a big bottle</li>
            <li>OMG didn&#x27;t know it was gonna be so huge</li>
            <li>The bottle was HUGE when I opened it.</li>
            <li>would recommend,not a huge fan of nicki herself</li>
            <li>This was such a great deal and the transaction was smooth from A to Z.  Seller is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell it fits my daughter nicely.</li>
            <li>cuz in macys you get the free bag, which i want, AGAIN.</li>
            <li>Excellent fragrance even though the scent does fade after a few hours...</li>
            <li>Smelled great &amp; last.</li>
            <li>Has some light vanilla and tropical notes.  </li>
            <li>I know this doesn&#x27;t sound like a compliment</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent of this perfume-not overpowering</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it and to be honest</li>
            <li>But it smells fabulous</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the fragrance settles, the fruitiness wears off a bit and a light vanilla scent begins to take over.</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased and recommend this to anyone who likes fruity smells and who constantly gets told they smell really good.</li>
            <li>The good reviews made me believe this was the WOW fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it smell so good.</li>
            <li>It smelled exactly like Alcohol!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, airy and wonderful ( not too sweet and not to musky but a little of both</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>This is a truly lovely scent -- it&#x27;s my daily favorite!</li>
            <li>It came with a beautiful pink purse with gold chainz...</li>
            <li>I moreso would recommend this if you collect unique or her bottles..</li>
            <li>It took me forever to smell this perfume just because it was Nicki, however, I fell in love after the first inhale and my admiration for this fragrance continues to grow with each use.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>The bottle is... unique, but that&#x27;s my girl Nicki for ya.</li>
            <li>SHE WAS SO EXCITED.  </li>
            <li>Came with coupons and packaged very nicely in original box.</li>
            <li>I am definitely not disappointed</li>
            <li>I really love the way this fragrance smells on my skin, when it is first sprayed...</li>
            <li>I think this mixture of vanilla and fruit makes it so unique.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; Super Price!!</li>
            <li>Pink Friday smells great</li>
            <li>Sort of sweet and has hints floral undertones.</li>
            <li>The bottle design is really cool too.</li>
            <li>Though I found it to be age appropriate, I refused to pay that much for a child&#x27;s perfume</li>
            <li>Not too sweet like candy</li>
            <li>sweet smelling and youthful.</li>
            <li>the bottle is cool looking.</li>
            <li>Really sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This perfume got to me very fast,I was really satisfied.</li>
            <li>I still really like it and the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li>This has a very young, sexy, vibrant kind of appeal to it.</li>
            <li>At first it is a bit too strong, but the scent stays even if I washed my hand with water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the bottle as well, it is unique like Nicki who dares to be so wild and unique.</li>
            <li>Fresh and soo clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Still, the price is super unbeatable.</li>
            <li>but as I said , I did not like the shape of it, should be more decent</li>
            <li>I have never gotten as many compliments, on how good I smell, by both men &amp; women, as I have since I started wearing this perfume a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this, love, love, love, love, would order again.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m just going about my day-to-day activities like when I&#x27;m in my college class or going out to grab a quick bite.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good lasting power as well.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love Nicki Minaj perfumemail so much, I&#x27;ll be buying this and her other ones :) :)</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume by far!</li>
            <li>I have worn it since it first came out!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, its a really nice sweet scent but its not strong smelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely one of my favorites and this bottle was at an amazing price</li>
            <li>This perfume smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I would wear it, and I was also surprised at how HUGE the bottle is!  </li>
            <li>I like very fruity, light, girly fragrances.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and crisp</li>
            <li>Pleased with it early arrival</li>
            <li>its worth</li>
            <li>Way worth the price.</li>
            <li>definately worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the official product and worth the price</li>
            <li>I waited ages to buy this perfume and was a bit worried incase it didnt smell as good as expected</li>
            <li>it smells a bit fruity but still pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>Not bad Roman ;-)</li>
            <li>The seller shipped pretty quick and described the item well.</li>
            <li>Very good product, large and very good for how much it is, compared it to an expensive one and they smelled the same</li>
            <li>pointing right in your face make the packaging embarrassing to leave out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Skeptical might not be the right word.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a floral scent and does not smell powdery at all which is amazing, especially during the way.</li>
            <li>It does last for a while and begins to wear off after about 4 hours but around this time, the scent will linger on your skin and makes a great personal</li>
            <li>the Pink Friday perfume is my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>It got here on time and very fast.</li>
            <li>The actual fragrance itself didn&#x27;t smell quite the same, but it was still very nice.</li>
            <li>She loved it until first the little necklace on the bottle snapped off.  </li>
            <li>Thank You so much!</li>
            <li>I bought the 1oz at first and paid $40 at the store for it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>You will have to carry the bottle with you to keep refreshing the scent throughout the day or saturate your clothing at the beginning of the day for the fragrance to last.</li>
            <li>HOT, HOT, HOT</li>
            <li>also, i have the 1.7 ounce bottle of pink friday to make up for not having the deluxe edition gold bottle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle and smell will definitely order again from this supplier.</li>
            <li>I first tried sample at Buckle</li>
            <li>and the box is pretty</li>
            <li>This was not my first time using the product</li>
            <li>Exactly the one I was lloking for.</li>
            <li>I love the scent however, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few fragrances that people continuously ask what I&#x27;m wearing because they say it smells sooooo good...</li>
            <li>This so far is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Scent is amazing although I wish it would last longer throughout the day and the sprayer nozzle shoots out like a hissing animal but other than that I love this perfume</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not super strong, it is definitely one of the girliest scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but that is actually a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume its so sweet scented and stays on long.. smells high...</li>
            <li>Very soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts pretty long--not for an entire day, but definitely a couple of good hours.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume, but unlike my other perfumes, the scent seems to fade rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>But overall I love this, and I really think anyone can wear this.</li>
            <li>Not only does the bottle look super cool</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li>Brand new in all aspect!!</li>
            <li>and it really stays on..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and really a quality product.</li>
            <li>I love my Nicki Minaj Pink Friday.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>IT IS THE REAL NICKI MINAJ PERFUME for those that are skeptic as to if you are getting the real thing when it comes to perfume</li>
            <li>my wife likes it so much she wants another one</li>
            <li>just got Tha perfume today &amp; it came fast</li>
            <li>and I will order again thanks</li>
            <li>honestly love pink friday.</li>
            <li>I too, don&#x27;t care for the shape of the bottle, but it&#x27;s very Nicki Minaj</li>
            <li>Im very picky when it simes to perfumes.</li>
            <li>I actually used one light spray while I was at her home after she opened it</li>
            <li>Not so much</li>
            <li>Did not like the bottle shape, ,but it smells very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a gift which was very much appreciated by my daughter</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very affordable</li>
            <li>So i wanted this perfume because i really like it</li>
            <li>so i checked amazon &amp; seen it was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap and its a big bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier just to order it on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent that lasts a short time and then needs to be reapplied.  </li>
            <li>its the real deal</li>
            <li>Love, Pink Friday...</li>
            <li>I really do like it.</li>
            <li>My husband said he could eat me up, haha, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li>the price was to much but the smell and bottle i lve</li>
            <li>The smell is very fruity.</li>
            <li>The bottle is actually much larger than I expected, so I did feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth, and the box is quite nice too.</li>
            <li>it smells very watered down, nothing like the real thing, VERY CHEAP.</li>
            <li>I love nicki minaj pink friday!</li>
            <li>you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this price for her first release fragrance.</li>
            <li>before i ordered this online, i had the deluxe edition gold one, but it was a gift, then it had to be returned, long story &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; so then i wanted to actually buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>People have different preferences to the way they want to smell of course, but this smells sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We had smelled both Nicki Minaj varieties at a department store in the past and really liked this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of fruity but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I buy a new bottle everytime I run out!</li>
            <li>&amp; it recently sold out everywhere before i was able to actually buy it.</li>
            <li>Although the bottle is completely silly looking, the perfume actually smells great!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the seller and the perfume.</li>
            <li>or I tend to mix it with something with a little more spice for night time-</li>
            <li>my wife loved it and ill be ordering more for her very soon as well as other things for this site</li>
            <li>The huge pink hair, gold face and the bra / boobs</li>
            <li>and once I got the real thing it was completely something else.</li>
            <li>I was shocked that this smelled so delicious, my niece received a bottle of this for Christmas</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but I love it anyway</li>
            <li>but her perfume does smell nice at least.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this everyday, but it has a nice sweet smell with a little musk.</li>
            <li>Came brand new</li>
            <li>this is my new go to scent..</li>
            <li>The bottle is bigger than expected, so make sure you have counter space.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>When our daughter opened her perfume and we all tried it out and gave it a sniff, we were pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and for me to say that means a lot!</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this classic perfume!  </li>
            <li>Only problem is you have to get really close to smell it</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a 16 year old that was on my list to buy for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud smelling.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want my kids or even my adult guests to see it on my dresser.</li>
            <li>AND WOW</li>
            <li>all in all this is my least favorite of her fragrances.</li>
            <li>I myself suffer from frequent bouts of nausea and this has never contributed to it.  </li>
            <li>She was so surprised</li>
            <li>It smells fruity, but in a fun and non-cheap way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the target demographic for this scent is about teenage to mid 20s, I am in my 30s</li>
            <li>I only paid $50 at Carsons today and it came with a free pink purse too!</li>
            <li>I prefer perfumes that lasts long other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to receive.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of sugared grapefruit but not sour.  </li>
            <li>This will definitely be my new and maybe final &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume because it sticks for a long time and is never overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells great but the scent is not long lasting which is disappointing.</li>
            <li>Once you get over the disturbing bottle, it smells amazing</li>
            <li>Ugly bottle great perfume.</li>
            <li>defiantly not what I expected from Nicki,come on now, you have that sexy appearance but not sexy smell????</li>
            <li>But, not Pink Friday, as I acutally don&#x27;t want to be without it</li>
            <li>My teen loves this fragrance, it&#x27;s young and fruity, as well as stays on all day.</li>
            <li>The bottle weirds me out a little but the scent is worth the quirky bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a sucker for sweet smells, and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance and its a lot different from what I typically wear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I expect more from a $50 bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the bottles are mass produced in a sweat shop somewhere and cost probably $.50 apiece.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE this</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> but since it was a gift for my daughter for her bday it was ok</li>
            <li> I love d scent,however mine didn&#x27;t come in a cellophane wrap .</li>
            <li> so i knew what to expect, but the fact of getting a 3.4oz bottle for the same price as a 1.7 was magical!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> needed, you can reapply the fragrance so that the smell will be more prominent</li>
            <li> My grand daughter just loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume aroma is very nice, kind of flirty but classy.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite!!</li>
            <li> the sweet smelling perfume made me want it more than I have ever wanted a perfume in my life!</li>
            <li> but it is more on the sugary side when comparing to flower scents and water clean type of scents !</li>
            <li> It has a nice sweet scent that I would not expect minaj too have.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for a celebrity perfume.</li>
            <li> The box was huge when I received it and the bottle was just as big, which makes this an excellent purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong or over powering which is what I love.</li>
            <li> However it was so much better than I expected I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was a great price and came super fast! ❤</li>
            <li> My mom however said it smelled good, so maybe older ladies would like it better,</li>
            <li> every penny smell is wow Great</li>
            <li> and we were both surprised at how great it smelled.</li>
            <li> It is lightly fruity, but also sexy and sultry...  </li>
            <li> Her perfume, however, is sweet and savory!</li>
            <li> I love love love it soo much!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did for such a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Her hair and necklace get in the way of opening it easily.</li>
            <li> Its not too strong but yet feminine.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t like scents that are so strong that they make our dog sneeze</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell spicy or strong...</li>
            <li> Not too strong and has more of a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Even the box it comes in is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Perform sweet smell for the summer. :)</li>
            <li> then when i purchased this, i felt relieved that i bought my first nicki perfume on my own.</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect, not to loud or smelly, the bottle is pretty, overall this is a good purchase, &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying it</li>
            <li> The scent is beautiful and simple, I get tons of compliments for it.</li>
            <li> I love the mild scent....</li>
            <li> It arrived really quick!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and soft, unlike most celebrity entertainer fragrances which can seem a bit too fruity or way too strongly floral or musky.</li>
            <li> great price for the large bottle that it comes in my daughter loves the scent and was thrilled that she received a big bottle</li>
            <li> OMG didn&#x27;t know it was gonna be so huge</li>
            <li> The bottle was HUGE when I opened it.</li>
            <li> would recommend,not a huge fan of nicki herself</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal and the transaction was smooth from A to Z.  Seller is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell it fits my daughter nicely.</li>
            <li> cuz in macys you get the free bag, which i want, AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance even though the scent does fade after a few hours...</li>
            <li> Smelled great &amp; last.</li>
            <li> Has some light vanilla and tropical notes.  </li>
            <li> I know this doesn&#x27;t sound like a compliment</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of this perfume-not overpowering</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it and to be honest</li>
            <li> But it smells fabulous</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the fragrance settles, the fruitiness wears off a bit and a light vanilla scent begins to take over.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased and recommend this to anyone who likes fruity smells and who constantly gets told they smell really good.</li>
            <li> The good reviews made me believe this was the WOW fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it smell so good.</li>
            <li> It smelled exactly like Alcohol!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, airy and wonderful ( not too sweet and not to musky but a little of both</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is a truly lovely scent -- it&#x27;s my daily favorite!</li>
            <li> It came with a beautiful pink purse with gold chainz...</li>
            <li> I moreso would recommend this if you collect unique or her bottles..</li>
            <li> It took me forever to smell this perfume just because it was Nicki, however, I fell in love after the first inhale and my admiration for this fragrance continues to grow with each use.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle is... unique, but that&#x27;s my girl Nicki for ya.</li>
            <li> SHE WAS SO EXCITED.  </li>
            <li> Came with coupons and packaged very nicely in original box.</li>
            <li> I am definitely not disappointed</li>
            <li> I really love the way this fragrance smells on my skin, when it is first sprayed...</li>
            <li> I think this mixture of vanilla and fruit makes it so unique.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; Super Price!!</li>
            <li> Pink Friday smells great</li>
            <li> Sort of sweet and has hints floral undertones.</li>
            <li> The bottle design is really cool too.</li>
            <li> Though I found it to be age appropriate, I refused to pay that much for a child&#x27;s perfume</li>
            <li> Not too sweet like candy</li>
            <li> sweet smelling and youthful.</li>
            <li> the bottle is cool looking.</li>
            <li> Really sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This perfume got to me very fast,I was really satisfied.</li>
            <li> I still really like it and the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> This has a very young, sexy, vibrant kind of appeal to it.</li>
            <li> At first it is a bit too strong, but the scent stays even if I washed my hand with water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the bottle as well, it is unique like Nicki who dares to be so wild and unique.</li>
            <li> Fresh and soo clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> Still, the price is super unbeatable.</li>
            <li> but as I said , I did not like the shape of it, should be more decent</li>
            <li> I have never gotten as many compliments, on how good I smell, by both men &amp; women, as I have since I started wearing this perfume a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this, love, love, love, love, would order again.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m just going about my day-to-day activities like when I&#x27;m in my college class or going out to grab a quick bite.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good lasting power as well.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love Nicki Minaj perfumemail so much, I&#x27;ll be buying this and her other ones :) :)</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by far!</li>
            <li> I have worn it since it first came out!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its a really nice sweet scent but its not strong smelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely one of my favorites and this bottle was at an amazing price</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I would wear it, and I was also surprised at how HUGE the bottle is!  </li>
            <li> I like very fruity, light, girly fragrances.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet and crisp</li>
            <li> Pleased with it early arrival</li>
            <li> its worth</li>
            <li> Way worth the price.</li>
            <li> definately worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the official product and worth the price</li>
            <li> I waited ages to buy this perfume and was a bit worried incase it didnt smell as good as expected</li>
            <li> it smells a bit fruity but still pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> Not bad Roman ;-)</li>
            <li> The seller shipped pretty quick and described the item well.</li>
            <li> Very good product, large and very good for how much it is, compared it to an expensive one and they smelled the same</li>
            <li> pointing right in your face make the packaging embarrassing to leave out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Skeptical might not be the right word.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a floral scent and does not smell powdery at all which is amazing, especially during the way.</li>
            <li> It does last for a while and begins to wear off after about 4 hours but around this time, the scent will linger on your skin and makes a great personal</li>
            <li> the Pink Friday perfume is my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li> It got here on time and very fast.</li>
            <li> The actual fragrance itself didn&#x27;t smell quite the same, but it was still very nice.</li>
            <li> She loved it until first the little necklace on the bottle snapped off.  </li>
            <li> Thank You so much!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1oz at first and paid $40 at the store for it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> You will have to carry the bottle with you to keep refreshing the scent throughout the day or saturate your clothing at the beginning of the day for the fragrance to last.</li>
            <li> HOT, HOT, HOT</li>
            <li> also, i have the 1.7 ounce bottle of pink friday to make up for not having the deluxe edition gold bottle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle and smell will definitely order again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I first tried sample at Buckle</li>
            <li> and the box is pretty</li>
            <li> This was not my first time using the product</li>
            <li> Exactly the one I was lloking for.</li>
            <li> I love the scent however, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few fragrances that people continuously ask what I&#x27;m wearing because they say it smells sooooo good...</li>
            <li> This so far is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Scent is amazing although I wish it would last longer throughout the day and the sprayer nozzle shoots out like a hissing animal but other than that I love this perfume</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not super strong, it is definitely one of the girliest scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but that is actually a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its so sweet scented and stays on long.. smells high...</li>
            <li> Very soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts pretty long--not for an entire day, but definitely a couple of good hours.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, but unlike my other perfumes, the scent seems to fade rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> But overall I love this, and I really think anyone can wear this.</li>
            <li> Not only does the bottle look super cool</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Brand new in all aspect!!</li>
            <li> and it really stays on..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and really a quality product.</li>
            <li> I love my Nicki Minaj Pink Friday.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> IT IS THE REAL NICKI MINAJ PERFUME for those that are skeptic as to if you are getting the real thing when it comes to perfume</li>
            <li> my wife likes it so much she wants another one</li>
            <li> just got Tha perfume today &amp; it came fast</li>
            <li> and I will order again thanks</li>
            <li> honestly love pink friday.</li>
            <li> I too, don&#x27;t care for the shape of the bottle, but it&#x27;s very Nicki Minaj</li>
            <li> Im very picky when it simes to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I actually used one light spray while I was at her home after she opened it</li>
            <li> Not so much</li>
            <li> Did not like the bottle shape, ,but it smells very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a gift which was very much appreciated by my daughter</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very affordable</li>
            <li> So i wanted this perfume because i really like it</li>
            <li> so i checked amazon &amp; seen it was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The price is cheap and its a big bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier just to order it on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light scent that lasts a short time and then needs to be reapplied.  </li>
            <li> its the real deal</li>
            <li> Love, Pink Friday...</li>
            <li> I really do like it.</li>
            <li> My husband said he could eat me up, haha, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> the price was to much but the smell and bottle i lve</li>
            <li> The smell is very fruity.</li>
            <li> The bottle is actually much larger than I expected, so I did feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth, and the box is quite nice too.</li>
            <li> it smells very watered down, nothing like the real thing, VERY CHEAP.</li>
            <li> I love nicki minaj pink friday!</li>
            <li> you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this price for her first release fragrance.</li>
            <li> before i ordered this online, i had the deluxe edition gold one, but it was a gift, then it had to be returned, long story &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; so then i wanted to actually buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> People have different preferences to the way they want to smell of course, but this smells sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We had smelled both Nicki Minaj varieties at a department store in the past and really liked this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of fruity but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I buy a new bottle everytime I run out!</li>
            <li> &amp; it recently sold out everywhere before i was able to actually buy it.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is completely silly looking, the perfume actually smells great!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the seller and the perfume.</li>
            <li> or I tend to mix it with something with a little more spice for night time-</li>
            <li> my wife loved it and ill be ordering more for her very soon as well as other things for this site</li>
            <li> The huge pink hair, gold face and the bra / boobs</li>
            <li> and once I got the real thing it was completely something else.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that this smelled so delicious, my niece received a bottle of this for Christmas</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but I love it anyway</li>
            <li> but her perfume does smell nice at least.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday, but it has a nice sweet smell with a little musk.</li>
            <li> Came brand new</li>
            <li> this is my new go to scent..</li>
            <li> The bottle is bigger than expected, so make sure you have counter space.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> When our daughter opened her perfume and we all tried it out and gave it a sniff, we were pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and for me to say that means a lot!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this classic perfume!  </li>
            <li> Only problem is you have to get really close to smell it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a 16 year old that was on my list to buy for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud smelling.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want my kids or even my adult guests to see it on my dresser.</li>
            <li> AND WOW</li>
            <li> all in all this is my least favorite of her fragrances.</li>
            <li> I myself suffer from frequent bouts of nausea and this has never contributed to it.  </li>
            <li> She was so surprised</li>
            <li> It smells fruity, but in a fun and non-cheap way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the target demographic for this scent is about teenage to mid 20s, I am in my 30s</li>
            <li> I only paid $50 at Carsons today and it came with a free pink purse too!</li>
            <li> I prefer perfumes that lasts long other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to receive.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of sugared grapefruit but not sour.  </li>
            <li> This will definitely be my new and maybe final &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it sticks for a long time and is never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great but the scent is not long lasting which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Once you get over the disturbing bottle, it smells amazing</li>
            <li> Ugly bottle great perfume.</li>
            <li> defiantly not what I expected from Nicki,come on now, you have that sexy appearance but not sexy smell????</li>
            <li> But, not Pink Friday, as I acutally don&#x27;t want to be without it</li>
            <li> My teen loves this fragrance, it&#x27;s young and fruity, as well as stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The bottle weirds me out a little but the scent is worth the quirky bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a sucker for sweet smells, and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance and its a lot different from what I typically wear.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first being that it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> LONG LASTING PERFUME AND</li>
            <li> However, I feel the that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> Although I must agree with the others, the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last as long as id like it too.</li>
            <li> The scent last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> The scent last very long !</li>
            <li> Looked around for a while and found a bottle half the size but more expensive at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> The things on her list was this perfume, makeup (which is hard to buy for without them there to try the colors) and last but not least she asked for a &amp;#34;DAD&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick with you as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s bigger than what I expected.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> So I can ignore the big pink plastic head.</li>
            <li> I hope this fragrance is around for a long, long time as I believe I have found my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> This bottle was bigger then expected!</li>
            <li> but our dog actually rolled in the Pink Friday!</li>
            <li> The scent also lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> surprised how big the bottle is, the headpiece is ridiculous, however it smells divine.  </li>
            <li> but I got bored of it quick.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it just spray for a little while.  </li>
            <li> But in the picture, I saw that it came with a pink hair extension?</li>
            <li> Pink Friday is a hit at my hospital</li>
            <li> The container is strange, but typical Nicki Minaj style.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long though, which sucks.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if the tester perfume was a lot stronger than the regular perfume.</li>
            <li> My friend bought hers from macys and this one smells EXACTLY like it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being a fake.</li>
            <li> I read other people&#x27;s comments before I purchased this perfume.</li>
            <li> Pink Friday is a keeper!</li>
            <li> However, the bottle is super slutty and just plain weird.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have never purchased a second bottle of perfume as I am usually tired of the scent by the middle of a bottle.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit different, but it adds a little something to my collection!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the bottle may be awkward to hold, but it ends up being worth it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little annoying but nothing to keep me from buying more.</li>
            <li> And it was way less</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because I&#x27;m not a big fan of Nikki or celebrity perfumes but this one proved me wrong.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not a huge Nicki fan so in order for me to 5 star her perfume</li>
            <li> it is usually $40 for the one half this size at the mall.</li>
            <li> (the small bottle was around $60.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> But when I got it the sprayer is broken and only sprays out a very thin stream of the perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little weird to me but that&#x27;s Nicky.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed some on my clothes, on my wrists, and behind my ears about 2 hours ago And can hardly smell it on my wrist anymore</li>
            <li> Not fair that we are stuck w this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter who is a DIE HARD Nicki Minaj fan, and she adores it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not in your face and intoxicating but not too weak either.</li>
            <li> Everything was in mint condition and i spray it on me everyday, and I get hundreds of compliments!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is just a knockoff!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying the perfume</li>
            <li> Must be that it doesn&#x27;t have an oil base to hold the scent.. not sure, but I am very disappointed in the fact that it is virtually undetectable in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> shes crazy about it</li>
            <li> but sadly it fades away within 1 to 2 hrs :-(</li>
            <li> Buy the product, you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed in the shipping it was late.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wear anything that might make a sick patient even sicker.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Get it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I seriously need to tell my hubby to get this for me asap!!!!</li>
            <li> If you purchase this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i am VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> smells terrible.  </li>

            <li> This smells SO good! I&#x27;m such a sucker for sweet smells, and this does not disappoint. I took a star off for longevity. If this lasted longer, it would be perfect. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Its my favorite perfume ever! It was a great price and came super fast! ❤</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value.  Cheaper than in brick &amp; mortar stores.  The scent is light &amp; powdery, very nice.  It doesn&#x27;t stick with you as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I love the mild scent.... Perfect perfume.. It has a nice sea breeze scent to it and it really stays on.. Even when I wash my clothes I can still smell it</li>
            <li> Love the scent ! I love the design. The scent last very long ! The quality is very good ! Would buy another one after it is finished !</li>
            <li> My woman has been bugging me about how she wanted this stuff. It smells sweet and crisp she puts on a good amount but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal and the transaction was smooth from A to Z.  Seller is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Gift for granddaughter</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift. It smells nice but like a knockoff of Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff smells soooooo good!  Get compliments every time i wear it!  Multiple times strangers have asked what perfume I was wearing!  NICKI MINAJ</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who loves it.  Packaging was perfect and it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> I use this for work and get many comments. It&#x27;s inexpensive and really a quality product. Makes a great summer scent! Sort of sweet and has hints floral undertones. Not over powering granny floral scent but a light and playful scent!</li>
            <li> My girl is happy so I&#x27;m happy.. 5 stars</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely gorgeous! I love my Nicki Minaj Pink Friday.</li>
            <li> Beautiful large bottle!  Packaged very well and didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to receive.</li>
            <li> I love it and,  I just wished it stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume for my girl cause smells really good Only problem is you have to get really close to smell it but still a good gift perfume</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its a really nice sweet scent but its not strong smelling. The bottle design is really cool too. This so far is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a 16 year old that was on my list to buy for. The things on her list was this perfume, makeup (which is hard to buy for without them there to try the colors) and last but not least she asked for a &amp;#34;DAD&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;That broke my heart, so I did the best I could to get this for her. I explained the gift tickets that I enclosed in the package in case she wanted to exchange it. She said there was no way she was exchanging it, she&#x27;d been looking all over for this perfume and she loved her gift!</li>
            <li> This is a truly lovely scent -- it&#x27;s my daily favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its so sweet scented and stays on long.. smells high... will difinetely buy again</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all! Not sure if this is just a knockoff!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stepdaughter.  She loved it until first the little necklace on the bottle snapped off.  Next, the pump stopped working.  I expect more from a $50 bottle of perfume.  Celebrities need to stick with their art instead of branching out into things they have no idea about.  I&#x27;m sure that the bottles are mass produced in a sweat shop somewhere and cost probably $.50 apiece.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume smells delicious.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Love it!! Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume</li>
            <li> Thank You so much! Will definitely buy from you guys again! The best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen on this product ;()</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell...fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this perfume. It&#x27;s not too loud smelling. I get a lot of compliments while wearing it too. Shipping was very fast.  I highly recommend the seller and the perfume.</li>
            <li> Its my wifes favorite she loves it</li>
            <li> This bottle was bigger then expected! My girlfriends going to love it! Cant wait til Christmas morning! This seller rocks!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Omg im in love with this perfume smells amazing!!!! but sadly it fades away within 1 to 2 hrs :-(</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but I love it anyway</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by far! I bought the 1oz at first and paid $40 at the store for it so when I saw the price here I knew it was a bargain. I got it shipped to my house two days after I ordered it and it was in its original box, in wonderful condition. The bottle came with its necklace too. I am totally pleased and recommend this to anyone who likes fruity smells and who constantly gets told they smell really good. My husband describes the smell as &amp;#34;almost edible&amp;#34; and that he feels he could &amp;#34;eat me alive.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Beautiful light scent!</li>
            <li> Very good product, large and very good for how much it is, compared it to an expensive one and they smelled the same</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it sticks for a long time and is never overwhelming. It smells awesome, light and floral. IT IS THE REAL NICKI MINAJ PERFUME for those that are skeptic as to if you are getting the real thing when it comes to perfume (i always am) but this is a great deal! it is usually $40 for the one half this size at the mall.</li>
            <li> I looooove this perfume and need to buy more. People are literally walking up to me and smelling me, even my boss complemented me! It has a nice sweet scent that I would not expect minaj too have.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter&#x27;s birthday and it&#x27;s bigger than what I expected. The box looks so nice perfect for her. I really like the smell it fits my daughter nicely. Here are two pics for your viewing pleasure :)</li>
            <li> I am NOT a perfume person at all but while I was in my local mall, I saw the tester for this and tried it. Oh my gosh, I fell in LOVE with it!!! I seriously need to tell my hubby to get this for me asap!!!!</li>
            <li> Came brand new and I would deff be purchasing this perfume again!!! I love it! Perform sweet smell for the summer. :)</li>
            <li> Once you get over the disturbing bottle, it smells amazing</li>
            <li> Pleased with it early arrival</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter for her birthday. She really loved it and said she would love to get more when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it has a great scent.  However, the bottle is super slutty and just plain weird.  The huge pink hair, gold face and the bra / boobs pointing right in your face make the packaging embarrassing to leave out.  I wouldn&#x27;t want my kids or even my adult guests to see it on my dresser.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my wife and she loves it. She let her mother sister and cousin smell it and the all were talking about stealing it. I also love the smell</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Smells great. It was in it&#x27;s original packaging and arrived in perfect shape. Was a great deal too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday, but it has a nice sweet smell with a little musk. Pretty good for a celebrity perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and nice sexy shape and price was rite my wife likes it so much she wants another one</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. You will have to carry the bottle with you to keep refreshing the scent throughout the day or saturate your clothing at the beginning of the day for the fragrance to last. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying the perfume its worth every penny smell is wow Great and it last for a while too</li>
            <li> The bottle looks nice. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong, but it smells good. Scent doesn&#x27;t last long though, which sucks.</li>
            <li> My 7yo daughter wanted this fragrance from dillards. Though I found it to be age appropriate, I refused to pay that much for a child&#x27;s perfume (the small bottle was around $60. I was delighted to find it at this price. The item is identical to what we tried at dillards. My daughter is thrilled!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It arrived really quick!</li>
            <li> I had got dis perfume set with Tha lotion hair mist &amp; perfume &amp; i fell in love with it my husband got it for me from macy! It came with a beautiful pink purse with gold chainz...just got Tha perfume today &amp; it came fast</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gift, smells nice</li>
            <li> I freakin love nicki minaj to the death of me i had to buy the big bottle when i saw it was $33 so now i have 4 bottles of this love it love it love it make sure to get minajesty</li>
            <li> my wife loved it and ill be ordering more for her very soon as well as other things for this site</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of Nicki Minaj&#x27;s style, especially when it comes to clothes and behavior. Her perfume, however, is sweet and savory! One spray on your wrist or neck, and you will be all the buzz. The scent lasts pretty long--not for an entire day, but definitely a couple of good hours. This might be just my perception, but I felt like it smelled better about an hour after I had it on than it did at the moment I sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> It smells fruity, but in a fun and non-cheap way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the target demographic for this scent is about teenage to mid 20s, I am in my 30s and I cannot resist it. I love the smell. At first it is a bit too strong, but the scent stays even if I washed my hand with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a tester so I am not sure if the tester perfume was a lot stronger than the regular perfume. Still, the price is super unbeatable. I can daresay this is one of the BEST celebrity fragrances. I bought lady gaga&#x27;s fame as well but I got bored of it quick.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume in Kohls one day and it was sooo wonderful I knew I had to have it. Instead of paying 39.95 for the 1.7oz in Kohls I thought I&#x27;d get the 3.4oz for the same price on Amazon. Once I received the perfume I immediately knew this was not the same as I had smelled before! Instead of the fruity smell It smelled exactly like Alcohol!! This is not the same perfume!</li>
            <li> MY AUNTIE GAVE ME THIS PRESENT AND WOW SHE LOVES IT. LONG LASTING PERFUME AND IT SMELL DELICIOUS.. HOT, HOT, HOT</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, my favorite perfume for fraction of price!!  this is my new go to scent.. i adore it and the bottle is so girly!</li>
            <li> The smell!! I love love love it soo much! I am not one for perfumes but the sweet smelling perfume made me want it more than I have ever wanted a perfume in my life!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, but unlike my other perfumes, the scent seems to fade rather quickly.  It may be my body chemistry or that I&#x27;m used to the more expensive perfumes that last longer.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful day time perfume.  Love this perfume</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the smell of this - this is the second Christmas we gave this gift.</li>
            <li> I was suprised with this. I do not like Nicki Minaj what so ever, but this perfume is nice.</li>
            <li> Thee best perfume bottle I&#x27;ve ever bought! Not only does the bottle look super cool BUT it smells really good! LOVE it and would soo buy it again!</li>
            <li> OMG didn&#x27;t know it was gonna be so huge but it&#x27;s great il have it for awhile packing great and I will order again thanks</li>
            <li> Brought this product as a Christmas gift.  Received it,  the spray nozzle was defective.  No options for return or refund</li>
            <li> I smelled the sample in Target and loved it and once I got the real thing it was completely something else. I tried to tolerate it and ended up tossing it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good its intoxicating! Buy the product, you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Not a huge Nicki fan so in order for me to 5 star her perfume it must be amazing ! People have different preferences to the way they want to smell of course, but this smells sweet. Not too sweet like candy but it is more on the sugary side when comparing to flower scents and water clean type of scents ! I love it and so does everyone around me. My friend bought hers from macys and this one smells EXACTLY like it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being a fake. It lasts all day. I spray it on around 7am and get home about 6pm and still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one of my favorites and this bottle was at an amazing price</li>
            <li> before i ordered this online, i had the deluxe edition gold one, but it was a gift, then it had to be returned, long story &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; so then i wanted to actually buy one for myself. you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this price for her first release fragrance. honestly love pink friday. also, i have the 1.7 ounce bottle of pink friday to make up for not having the deluxe edition gold bottle. then when i purchased this, i felt relieved that i bought my first nicki perfume on my own. definitely going to save up for minajesty. still debating if i should buy it here on amazon or in macys cuz in macys you get the free bag, which i want, AGAIN. what do you guys thinnk?</li>
            <li> I was shocked that this smelled so delicious, my niece received a bottle of this for Christmas and I was hooked. I had to get a bottle of it and I&#x27;m glad I did for such a great price on Amazon. The scent is nice and soft, unlike most celebrity entertainer fragrances which can seem a bit too fruity or way too strongly floral or musky. I too, don&#x27;t care for the shape of the bottle, but it&#x27;s very Nicki Minaj and I would expect this from her.</li>
            <li> This perfume aroma is very nice, kind of flirty but classy. However, I feel the that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> Ugly bottle great perfume. Im very picky when it simes to perfumes. I love this one!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance even though the scent does fade after a few hours... If you are going somewhere and you want to wear this,  wait until the last possible minute to spray the fragrance...</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday which she requested. I actually used one light spray while I was at her home after she opened it and I&#x27;ve go to tell you, this stuff is really nice. It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and that one squish lasted for hours. My granddaughter has good taste.</li>
            <li> Perfume smells amazing... One of the best in my collection. Although I must agree with the others, the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume just today and this is so big!The box was unreally huge,just like the bottle inside!It smells sooooo good!Now the Pink Friday perfume is my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE this perfume. it has the perfect scents all in one! the design of the bottle is so precise also!</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend luve it shes crazy about it</li>
            <li> I read other people&#x27;s comments before I purchased this perfume. It smells wonderful!!!! Its not too strong but yet feminine.  Everytime I wear it, I get compliments. I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything Nikki stands for  but my daughter likes how she smells. Nice smelling perfume.  Nikki  Not so much</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but it don&#x27;t last. I sprayed some on my clothes, on my wrists, and behind my ears about 2 hours ago And can hardly smell it on my wrist anymore but it&#x27;s still on my clothes. Wish it lasted longer. It&#x27;s a light, airy and wonderful ( not too sweet and not to musky but a little of both</li>
            <li> Did not like the bottle shape, ,but it smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift which was very much appreciated by my daughter but as I said , I did not like the shape of it, should be more decent</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I expected. Way worth the price.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite!!</li>
            <li> surprised how big the bottle is, the headpiece is ridiculous, however it smells divine.  So I can ignore the big pink plastic head.</li>
            <li> I though this was a gag gift and someone had made a Nicki Minaje fart in a can .. but no people assured me that the way it was suppose to smell.</li>
            <li> Fresh and soo clean smelling.  This perfume rocks!!</li>
            <li> I bought for daughter as a Christmas gift.  She likes the scent.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> Perfume smells very good.</li>
            <li> delicious, simply delicious.</li>
            <li> Omg ! It came in the most beautiful box ever and the perfume bottle itself is very cute not to mention the smell which is awesome. I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> Fun packaging and great scent.  I love this.</li>
            <li> The floral notes of this scent seem to stand out most on my skin, which I don&#x27;t like (rosey).. but on my clothing the fruit and floral notes stand out as a team.. all in all this is my least favorite of her fragrances. The good reviews made me believe this was the WOW fragrance. It&#x27;s okay, I moreso would recommend this if you collect unique or her bottles..</li>
            <li> Smelled great &amp; last.</li>
            <li> Love it. And it was way less then what I pay for in the store</li>
            <li> surprisingly love this frgrance despite not being a fan of the artist&#x27;s music.  sweet smelling and youthful. the bottle looks kind of crazy but guess that helps it stands out.  definately worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Came On time wife loves it</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what I wanted. Plan on reordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. The bottle weirds me out a little but the scent is worth the quirky bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great even though the bottle is WAY WAY over the top!  Will buy again though when I run out.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great! Love the smell! But when I got it the sprayer is broken and only sprays out a very thin stream of the perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the bottle, the smell, n also the price it&#x27;s very affordable</li>
            <li> My cousin, Summer, loves Nicki Minaj.  I do to.  She is a great artist.  I bought this for her birthday/ Christmas present.  Her birthday is two days away from Christmas.  She had no idea came out with her own perfume.  I&#x27;m glad to surprise her with this.  She loved her perfume.  the bottle is cool looking. something you don&#x27;t see every day. I gave it a 3 star rating  because I didn&#x27;t buy it for me.</li>
            <li> The bottle is gorgeous and smells amazing. Even the box it comes in is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> So i wanted this perfume because i really like it &amp; it recently sold out everywhere before i was able to actually buy it. so i checked amazon &amp; seen it was so much cheaper. When i received it, it came in the same box &amp; Everything BUT, when i sprayed the perfume, it smells NOTHING like what i smelled in the store. it smells very watered down, nothing like the real thing, VERY CHEAP. i am VERY disappointed. so PLEASE do NOT buy this item because you&#x27;re only wasting your time &amp; money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this fragrance and we got it for her for Christmas. All of her friends love it too. She is the hit of all!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! I received the body lotion as a freebie and just had to have the parfum. Looked around for a while and found a bottle half the size but more expensive at a local retailer. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It took me forever to smell this perfume just because it was Nicki, however, I fell in love after the first inhale and my admiration for this fragrance continues to grow with each use.</li>
            <li> I loved it shipping was fast and the perfume smells good. I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Really sweet smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite scent.  Price is amazing!!!  Mom likes that.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because I&#x27;m not a big fan of Nikki or celebrity perfumes but this one proved me wrong.  It actually smells quite yummy!  It&#x27;s sweet, not overpowering.  It reminds me of sugared grapefruit but not sour.  Has some light vanilla and tropical notes.  For a celebrity perfume, this one is a big hit.  I can&#x27;t wait till there is a matching body wash and lotion.  I love it and you will too!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my roommate who loves Nicki Minaj. I love the smell and it lasts very long. The bottle is... unique, but that&#x27;s my girl Nicki for ya.</li>
            <li> I like the smell it just works and the bottle looks great because Nicky is on it but my girl loves it</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong. If you have migraines or are prone to perfume induced headaches, be warned.</li>
            <li> Picked up today as a gift to myself. The bottle was HUGE when I opened it. It smells amazing to boot. I love the bottle as well, it is unique like Nicki who dares to be so wild and unique. I only paid $50 at Carsons today and it came with a free pink purse too! I love it.</li>
            <li> I loveeee this smell! I bought it for my daughter who is a DIE HARD Nicki Minaj fan, and she adores it! I actually like it too. Its fruity, but its not overdone. But in the picture, I saw that it came with a pink hair extension? Was I suppose to get it because I didn&#x27;t. But overall I love this, and I really think anyone can wear this.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a waste of money. The scent dies off within minutes. I was pretty disappointed considering I love the smell of the perfume.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume. When she took a whiff of the perfume she fell in love. Would recommend this perfume to everyone. Good job nicki minaj</li>
            <li> GAVE THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO ONE OF MY NIECES.  SHE WAS SO EXCITED.  THE FRAGRANCE IS VERY NICE.</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect, not to loud or smelly, the bottle is pretty, overall this is a good purchase, &amp; I&#x27;m enjoying it</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this perfume!!! It smells absolutely amazing!! If you like the Juicy Couture line, then you will love this.  The bottle is a bit different, but it adds a little something to my collection!!  Get it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and fell in love with it !!! Smells really nice n kinda fruity something like the Kim k in the purple bottle :-)</li>
            <li> Well, what can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said...My daughter and I purchased this perfume just after its launch and we were both surprised at how great it smelled. We don&#x27;t like scents that are so strong that they make our dog sneeze but our dog actually rolled in the Pink Friday! I know this doesn&#x27;t sound like a compliment but if you knew our dog you would know it is a big one!  I work at a hospital and I can&#x27;t wear anything that might make a sick patient even sicker.  Pink Friday is a hit at my hospital and I have had many people ask what I am wearing and then go out and buy it.  I myself suffer from frequent bouts of nausea and this has never contributed to it.  Also, I have never purchased a second bottle of perfume as I am usually tired of the scent by the middle of a bottle.  But, not Pink Friday, as I acutally don&#x27;t want to be without it and since I am at the end of our bottle, I just ordered the larger 3.4 oz. size.  I hope this fragrance is around for a long, long time as I believe I have found my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; fragrance.  Pink Friday is a keeper!</li>
            <li> i relly love this perfume it smells wonderfu great price!</li>
            <li> Cute bottle and smell will definitely order again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to all my friends. The price is cheap and its a big bottle of perfume. Thanks for the order.</li>
            <li> This perfume got to me very fast,I was really satisfied. The bottle is gorgeous,and the size of the bottle was good. The scent is amazing,and for the price of the perfume you can&#x27;t beat it. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of this perfume-not overpowering and I have received alot of complianments, I will buy this perfume again.</li>
            <li> We have sampled this perfume many times, just never stopped to buy it. It has a amazing scent. Just not to thrilled with the presentation of it. However, the scent is nice. It&#x27;s much easier just to order it on amazon. However, I am surprising my daughter on her birthday with it! She will love it. I may have to snag it and wear it some times. !</li>
            <li> would recommend,not a huge fan of nicki herself but her perfume does smell nice at least. have gotten compliments! smells great</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is completely silly looking, the perfume actually smells great!  It&#x27;s a light scent that lasts a short time and then needs to be reapplied.  Many compliments when I wear this product.</li>
            <li> Such a great price on wonderful smelling perfume. Would totally buy again.</li>
            <li> Scent is amazing although I wish it would last longer throughout the day and the sprayer nozzle shoots out like a hissing animal but other than that I love this perfume</li>
            <li> For her first fragrance line, I think Nicki did very good. This has a very young, sexy, vibrant kind of appeal to it. I loved it soon as I tried it. It has pretty good lasting power as well. Not bad Roman ;-)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see my older self buying that hideous bottle, but I couldn&#x27;t resist the beautiful scent!!  Glad I bought it because I get compliments every time I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
            <li> I love it.. Everything was in mint condition and i spray it on me everyday, and I get hundreds of compliments!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike Nicki but I&#x27;m also not a fan of hers however I am a fan of her fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. Well I can report that she was a happy camper! The bottle style is really creative and it smells delishhh. I think I will be purchasing one for myself, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girl and she absolutely loves it and to be honest i cant complain either.  its the real deal</li>
            <li> This gonna add to my collection of my favorite perfume. I&#x27;m surprised it smell so good. Received the sample from Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> My daughter kept hinting around that she wanted this fragrance for Christmas.  She was so surprised and I loved the price I was able to get it for.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume does not compare to what is sold at our local department store.  Not fair that we are stuck w this perfume.  Lesson learned and I will never buy from here again or on internet.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Just as described!</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t my style so i gave it to my sister for her bday, she says it&#x27;s ok but not something she would buy. My mom however said it smelled good, so maybe older ladies would like it better, defiantly not what I expected from Nicki,come on now, you have that sexy appearance but not sexy smell????</li>
            <li> My teen loves this fragrance, it&#x27;s young and fruity, as well as stays on all day. I was going to buy this at Kolhs so glad I waited and bought it here!! I saved money and bought the 3.4 oz for the price of the 1.8 oz. Fast shipping &amp; Super Price!!</li>
            <li> Great shipping experience! Love, Pink Friday...&lt;br /&gt;xoxo, m</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I first tried sample at Buckle then I had to have it. I immediately found it on amazon and ordered it. Long lasting, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> i bought it for my cousin after looking for it in stores &amp; only found it here!</li>
            <li> Great price for this size and the bottle comes full and the bottle design is so cool and the box is pretty and the fragrance smells great</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first being that it is so cheap. This product is everything as described. It lasts all day long. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> brought it for my wife for Christmas, and she loves the smell. This is the official product and worth the price</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!! Came with coupons and packaged very nicely in original box. Brand new in all aspect!! Thnks seller!!! 👍👍</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell. It doesnt last as long as id like it too. But the fruity, fresh smell it has compesates for that lol. I get complements alll the time!</li>
            <li> great price for the large bottle that it comes in my daughter loves the scent and was thrilled that she received a big bottle</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great but the scent is not long lasting which is disappointing. Great for people that like fruity sweet scents.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my favorite perfume ever. It smells fruity and vanilla -y. I have gotten many compliment on this perfume from men and women! The packaging is beautiful just like the scent. This would work for all ages (i guess not if you are under 10?)</li>
            <li> I bought some of this for my girlfriend for christmas.&lt;br /&gt;We had smelled both Nicki Minaj varieties at a department store in the past and really liked this one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice blend of scents and to me seems like a nice fall/winter scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my daughter-in-law. She loved it! Not too overpowering. The bottle is bigger than expected, so make sure you have counter space.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten as many compliments, on how good I smell, by both men &amp; women, as I have since I started wearing this perfume a few months ago. 2 thumbs up from this girl!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day. I still really like it and the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> Wow!  When our daughter opened her perfume and we all tried it out and gave it a sniff, we were pleasantly surprised!  It is lightly fruity, but also sexy and sultry...  Kind of like the name of the singer it represents.  I would wear it, and I was also surprised at how HUGE the bottle is!  I am definitely stealing some to wear to work!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Many compliments :)</li>
            <li> Okay, the bottle is shaped like a bust of Nicki Minaj.&lt;br /&gt;Did you read that?&lt;br /&gt;A BUST OF NICKI MINAJ!&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical might not be the right word. But I gave it a shot. Even after realizing my finger was between the bust&#x27;s, well, busts, I sprayed it and....&lt;br /&gt;Fruit and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;YUM.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not super strong, it is definitely one of the girliest scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but that is actually a good thing in this case. I really do like it. I tend to prefer stronger perfumes for nights out, so either this is just daytime or I tend to mix it with something with a little more spice for night time- either way, it does the job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Again, the bottle may be awkward to hold, but it ends up being worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my girlfriend smell delicious. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance But I was very disappointed in the shipping it was late.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! It&#x27;s kind of fruity but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance and its a lot different from what I typically wear. I like very fruity, light, girly fragrances. This to me smells like vanilla with just a hint of fruit. It&#x27;s not too strong or over powering which is what I love. My husband said he could eat me up, haha, so that&#x27;s always a plus. The box was huge when I received it and the bottle was just as big, which makes this an excellent purchase for the price. I am definitely not disappointed and I&#x27;m so happy I bought this. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very soft sweet smell. It got here on time and very fast. It was a gift for someone and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  And I loved the price.  The scent last a long time.  I tell people where I purchased it from. The only thing is it just spray for a little while.  Then it start just to shot out.  The company needs to check the spraying cap.</li>
            <li> I like the scent but somebody help this woman with her marketing/packaging. I am ashamed to have it out with my beautiful bottles. I hide it in the medicine chest.</li>
            <li> smells terrible.  Would not recommend this</li>
            <li> AMAZING price. I LOVE this</li>
            <li> Bottle is leaky but still sprays and smells great</li>

            <li> My daughter loves this. Great price</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells amazing. Not too strong and has more of a sweet smell. The bottle is a little annoying but nothing to keep me from buying more. Her hair and necklace get in the way of opening it easily. No biggy.</li>
            <li> the price was to much but the smell and bottle i lve but since it was a gift for my daughter for her bday it was ok she loved it</li>
            <li> I love d scent,however mine didn&#x27;t come in a cellophane wrap .</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter,she loves Nicki Minaj.It has a really lovely scent to it &amp; the bottle is beautiful.She will keep it to have just as a figurine it&#x27;s so nice.</li>
            <li> I waited ages to buy this perfume and was a bit worried incase it didnt smell as good as expected because im a big nicki fan.. However it was so much better than I expected I love it!!!!! one of my favourite perfumes at the moment cant stop smelling it!</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved this gift as it had been what she wanted. I liked the price and great service</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter at Christmas.  She likes it.  The bottle is a little weird to me but that&#x27;s Nicky.  The seller shipped pretty quick and described the item well.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance that I have ever used or owned! I am 43 years old and for me to say that means a lot! I first came across this wonderful fragrance a couple of years ago when I opened up one of my magazines and once I smelled it, I knew I had to have it! Pink Friday smells great yet it is not overpowering like some fragrances. The scent also lasts a very long time. This will definitely be my new and maybe final &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent. Once I find a scent that meshes with me in a good way, I am a longtime and very loyal customer! This is one of the few fragrances that people continuously ask what I&#x27;m wearing because they say it smells sooooo good...lol. Nicki Minaj and Elizabeth Arden hit a home run with this and I hope they continue to produce this wonderful fragrance! It also has a great price! If you purchase this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> This scent is beautiful!! I have worn it since it first came out! People always state how good I smell and it makes my husband happy!&lt;br /&gt;Love it and last forever!</li>
            <li> I love nicki minaj pink friday! This was not my first time using the product so i knew what to expect, but the fact of getting a 3.4oz bottle for the same price as a 1.7 was magical!!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY &amp; SMELLS AWESOME! !</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last long I prefer perfumes that lasts long other than that it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Ugliest bottle ever known.  Love the smell.  Ordered it here for price and to hide the shame of the packaging and the brand.  But it smells fabulous</li>
            <li> I really love the way this fragrance smells on my skin, when it is first sprayed...it smells a bit fruity but still pretty sweet. There isn&#x27;t much of a floral scent and does not smell powdery at all which is amazing, especially during the way. It doesn&#x27;t smell spicy or strong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the fragrance settles, the fruitiness wears off a bit and a light vanilla scent begins to take over. I think this mixture of vanilla and fruit makes it so unique. It does last for a while and begins to wear off after about 4 hours but around this time, the scent will linger on your skin and makes a great personal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If needed, you can reapply the fragrance so that the smell will be more prominent but I don&#x27;t find that necessary if I&#x27;m just going about my day-to-day activities like when I&#x27;m in my college class or going out to grab a quick bite.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it would buy again</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this classic perfume!  It smells wonderful and stays with you all day...</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly the one I was lloking for. Very pleased with price and product!!</li>
            <li> I was so nervous about this product! But I tried it for myself and OMG I&#x27;M IN LOVE! Not only did the bottle get like 1000x complements, but the smell as well! Love Nicki Minaj perfumemail so much, I&#x27;ll be buying this and her other ones :) :)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great value…my daughter was blown away at the size.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I got it for my niece it for christmas and she loved it . Thank You Ms Dorsey..</li>
            <li> I buy a new bottle everytime I run out! The scent is beautiful and simple, I get tons of compliments for it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter smelled this fragrance in a magzine and thought it smelled like fruity bubblegum, which she really liked. The actual fragrance itself didn&#x27;t smell quite the same, but it was still very nice. The container is strange, but typical Nicki Minaj style. The bottle is actually much larger than I expected, so I did feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth, and the box is quite nice too.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter just loves this perfume. It smells great and I&#x27;m sure she will love it. It came as described and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Really happy just what she want it</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, the smell is perfect. It&#x27;s not in your face and intoxicating but not too weak either. The smell is very fruity. You can definitely smell the mandarin.</li>
            <li> I love the scent however, it doesn&#x27;t last at all. An hour later and you can not longer smell it.  Everyone that has tried it says the same thing. Must be that it doesn&#x27;t have an oil base to hold the scent.. not sure, but I am very disappointed in the fact that it is virtually undetectable in a very short period of time.</li>
