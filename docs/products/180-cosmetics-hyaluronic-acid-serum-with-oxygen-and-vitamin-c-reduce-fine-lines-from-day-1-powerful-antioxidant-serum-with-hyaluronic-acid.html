            <li>Love Love Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>

            <li>The packaging is lovely and it works well.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles seem more pronounced after use.  </li>
            <li>By using a couple drops of this product under my moisturizer twice a day I noticed my skin had become more dense and lifted.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 weeks, the skin feeling smooth and bright, thank you so much !!</li>
            <li>Another great new product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin have a more smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product from dr Oz and it made me a true believer!</li>
            <li>This product works best when layered with other products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and can already tell a difference in the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>So if your looking for an product too help with pores and fine lines</li>
            <li>Was smooth feeling on skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker serum that goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to get a chance to try this product.</li>
            <li>My skin just looks more alive and healthy since using this product.</li>
            <li>It really is an OK kind of facial serum.</li>
            <li>The packaging and labeling are so professional and it lets me know that I am receiving a top quality product!</li>
            <li>very good covering those little lines..will purchase again</li>
            <li>Could still be true.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating unlike most hyluronic acid after application face feels taut not with this product</li>
            <li>QUICKLY ABSORBS INTO SKIN.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super nourished, hydrated and even feels smoother.  </li>
            <li>Seems to absorb well and is mild to skin.</li>
            <li>I am already a fan of Hyaluronic Acid because of it&#x27;s fantastic hydrating qualities,so I was really interested in trying this serum with Oxygen</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>It also has more of a natural glow.</li>
            <li>usually do not use serums because I am not worried about fine lines and wrinkles (yet),</li>
            <li>After applying this serum, I will put on my sunscreen and I am ready to go!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li>After using this my skin feels soft, smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>Have used twice a day for the last 5 days or more.</li>
            <li>Remember thinner products go on first.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly into my skin and I highly recommend it for people who are looking for a non-oily moisturizer to wear under sunscreen or makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its nice but not a miracle, also use with other products.</li>
            <li>The product is very good, but it needs to come in a larger size because it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>180 Cosmetics sent me their Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Oxygen to review for my blog GlamRiver.  </li>
            <li>I think fine lines will take a little longer to smooth out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used for a couple of weeks, but I believe it is diminishing some of the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li>would like to know how much C vitamin in that serum?</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t do as much for my skin as I hoped and I won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smooth and I only need to use 3-5 drops to cover my face.</li>
            <li>Great product, shipped poorly and one item arrived damaged and leaking.</li>
            <li>I really like this serem.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays moist enough to give you time to rub the product in</li>
            <li>Did not do much (anything) for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In just the short time I&#x27;ve used it, my skin seems to glow and my makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Is not what I expected, maybe If I use it more timeðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old Filipino and since I started using last year 2014 the product made my skin smoother and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>I feel the areas around my eyes a little more tighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard and read nothing but good about hyaluronic acid, and the public must also know about its benefits because the prices have doubled in just a few years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 star for right now only because I&#x27;m still testing the product out.</li>
            <li>just a new look ...</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product after only a few days.</li>
            <li>and all I can say is that my face is the same as the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>Left prior review stating that this &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; version did not leave my skin silky soft like the original version.</li>
            <li>and then it dries quickly so that you can get on to putting on your other moisturizer/primer/makeup.</li>
            <li>but she applies it at night only so it doesn&#x27;t bother her that much.</li>
            <li>I try to get the fullest effects and replaced my old serum with this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed no difference after a month, but I am 58 -- perhaps too old to gain benefit.  </li>
            <li>This fully absorbs into the skin so thereâ€™s no icky residue left on your skin.</li>
            <li>After a few days I could already tell a difference my skin was not so dry anymore which is a huge plus.</li>

            <li> I usually just use pure Vitamin E Oil under my sunscreen, but now that I have this serum I will definitely be using it instead.</li>
            <li> With the moisturizer and oxygen properties, fine lines and wrinkles should fade or at least be less</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any results.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so disappointed because I was willing to pay the pricey charge (the bottle only holds a limited number of &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34;), but regardless to what they say, something &amp;#34;is different&amp;#34;... the silky soft results are simply no longer there.</li>
            <li> My skin personally is a bit on the dry side</li>
            <li> TINY, TINY, BOTTLE, SO DOESN&#x27;T GO VERY FAR AS YOU NEED TO USE AT LEAST 2 X&#x27;S PER DAY.</li>
            <li> Sinks into my skin quickly, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> LONG TERM AFFECTS NOT KNOWN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing what I expected it to do upon read about this product.</li>
            <li> Would like a refund of money spent.</li>
            <li> Its better than the real expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> Just thick enough and not watery.</li>
            <li> is getting smoother and less wrinkles...</li>
            <li> But, it is heavy on my skin</li>
            <li> She also says it is heavy on her skin</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t has heavy feeling after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference in my pores just after a few days of usage.  </li>
            <li> i have started using this product for the past one month</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I am unable to rate this product due to it being broken when received.</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed</li>

            <li> excellent product -perfect around eyes  -just would like to know how much C vitamin in that serum?</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks, the skin feeling smooth and bright, thank you so much !!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected. They didn&#x27;t do as much for my skin as I hoped and I won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li> it is excellent for tightening the skin and reducing wrinkles so ladies and gents think twice about plastic surgery for this item is great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for close to a year  and I love, and have received so many complements on my skin, and no one can believe my age.</li>
            <li> Was smooth feeling on skin. Made skin tighter and more toned.</li>
            <li> Great product .....worked very well the very first time !!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> The product is very good, but it needs to come in a larger size because it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I really love the look of this product. The packaging and labeling are so professional and it lets me know that I am receiving a top quality product! This serum goes on smooth and I only need to use 3-5 drops to cover my face. I feel that this can also be used as a primer for makeup since the hyaluronic acid helps to fill pores, lines, and wrinkles within the face.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not use serums because I am not worried about fine lines and wrinkles (yet), but since I go to school in California and run outdoor track almost year-round I do worry about my skin aging from exposure to the sun and wind. I usually just use pure Vitamin E Oil under my sunscreen, but now that I have this serum I will definitely be using it instead. On days when I know that I&#x27;ll be out in the sun a lot, I will use this serum after applying my toner. After applying this serum, I will put on my sunscreen and I am ready to go! This serum has a pleasant smell and the glass dropper helps in the ease of use. It also absorbs quickly into my skin and I highly recommend it for people who are looking for a non-oily moisturizer to wear under sunscreen or makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me at no to low cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped poorly and one item arrived damaged and leaking.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin have a more smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> I really like this serem. It goes on smoothly and stays moist enough to give you time to rub the product in and then it dries quickly so that you can get on to putting on your other moisturizer/primer/makeup. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and can already tell a difference in the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not do much (anything) for me. I did not expect miracles but I did expect something.I give my age as to why it did not work as it was advertized. Could still be true.</li>
            <li> is helpfulï¼Œwill buy again</li>
            <li> this is a very nice product, love the way it disappears into my skin, I will be purchasing more when needed. Thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any results.  However, I love the way it feels on my face and how my skin feels tighter when applied.</li>
            <li> best stuff out there.  Makes my skin look and feel refreshed when used.  I follow up in the morning with good moisturizer.  Love this stuff.  and you simply can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I just finished the bottle which lasted one month and all I can say is that my face is the same as the first day I used it. No change at all.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating unlike most hyluronic acid after application face feels taut not with this product</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I have been using it for a while and will say that it is a wonderful moisturizer. But, it is heavy on my skin and I really don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; anything on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read in the materials that it would be good for acne so my daughter tried it. She LOVES it! She also says it is heavy on her skin but she applies it at night only so it doesn&#x27;t bother her that much. This is actually our second bottle of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the ingredients, this product should make a big difference int he condition of your skin. With the moisturizer and oxygen properties, fine lines and wrinkles should fade or at least be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you struggle with acne breakouts in addition to aging skin. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t has heavy feeling after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing what I expected it to do upon read about this product.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. Its better than the real expensive stuff.  Please do not stop making it, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2494156ecce20fd7ef6318aa9fa46216]] While I did receive a sample of this to review, all opinions expressed are my own</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker serum that goes on smoothly. I&#x27;ve only used for a couple of weeks, but I believe it is diminishing some of the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. This is the second one from the company I have tried. I notice a difference in my pores just after a few days of usage.  I feel the areas around my eyes a little more tighter. So if your looking for an product too help with pores and fine lines this is defiantly a must have!!</li>
            <li> GREAT TO ADD MOISTURE TO SKIN. QUICKLY ABSORBS INTO SKIN. TINY, TINY, BOTTLE, SO DOESN&#x27;T GO VERY FAR AS YOU NEED TO USE AT LEAST 2 X&#x27;S PER DAY. SHOULD BE LARGER SIZE. LONG TERM AFFECTS NOT KNOWN. APPEARS TO BE TEMPORARY RESULTS ONLY. TIME MAY TELL.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product after only a few days. I will definitely be reordering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 star for right now only because I&#x27;m still testing the product out. I feel although it will end out a 5 star product. Its also a fair price, and I do take the vitamin form of hyaluronic acid for joint and skin health. I&#x27;ve heard and read nothing but good about hyaluronic acid, and the public must also know about its benefits because the prices have doubled in just a few years!</li>
            <li> Its nice but not a miracle, also use with other products.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well at the more expensive product I was using.</li>
            <li> 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluric Serum + Oxygen Review is a great serum for damaged skin. My skin personally is a bit on the dry side so I was excited to get a chance to try this product. The first day I used it once in the morning and once at night. I try to get the fullest effects and replaced my old serum with this one. After a few days I could already tell a difference my skin was not so dry anymore which is a huge plus. My skin just looks more alive and healthy since using this product. I plan on continuing to use it and purchasing more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to disclose I did receive this product for exchange for my honest review. I am always honest about my opinions on products!</li>
            <li> 180 Cosmetics sent me their Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Oxygen to review for my blog GlamRiver.  I am already a fan of Hyaluronic Acid because of it&#x27;s fantastic hydrating qualities,so I was really interested in trying this serum with Oxygen and I love the results!  My skin feels super nourished, hydrated and even feels smoother.  Great product, and I also love the packaging!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product long enough to see any results. Seems to absorb well and is mild to skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice serum. The packaging is lovely and it works well. After using this my skin feels soft, smooth and supple. Itâ€™s supposed to help with wrinkles but I donâ€™t have any so I canâ€™t tell you how it works on them. This fully absorbs into the skin so thereâ€™s no icky residue left on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  In just the short time I&#x27;ve used it, my skin seems to glow and my makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old Filipino and since I started using last year 2014 the product made my skin smoother and wrinkle free. People always think I&#x27;m 10-15 years younger. I heard about this product from dr Oz and it made me a true believer!</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Another great new product.  I hope to continue to order if the price stays affordable.  Feels so good on my skin.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a noticeable difference.  Time will tell!</li>
            <li> very good covering those little lines..will purchase again</li>
            <li> It really is an OK kind of facial serum. I mixed it with my SPF moisturizer under my primer and makeup as I have an oily skin and can&#x27;t handle adding a daily moisturizer in my routine while wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome..i have started using this product for the past one month and i started noticing my face is getting smoother and less wrinkles...i wil definitely recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it helped.</li>
            <li> have only used for 2weeks, but I like the product so far&lt;br /&gt;really need some help with eyes- puffy, bags and crepey skin</li>
            <li> Is not what I expected, maybe If I use it more timeðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no difference after a month, but I am 58 -- perhaps too old to gain benefit.  I gave it 2 stars because it did make my skin feel very good.</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied with product. Wrinkles seem more pronounced after use.  Would like a refund of money spent. Have used twice a day for the last 5 days or more. Sadly disappointed</li>
            <li> Really great product at a great price, I use on myself and my customers.</li>
            <li> Left prior review stating that this &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; version did not leave my skin silky soft like the original version. Since the item indicates that it has the same ingredients ... just a new look ... I decided to give it another try - still not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed because I was willing to pay the pricey charge (the bottle only holds a limited number of &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34;), but regardless to what they say, something &amp;#34;is different&amp;#34;... the silky soft results are simply no longer there.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference  in my skin after just one week. By using a couple drops of this product under my moisturizer twice a day I noticed my skin had become more dense and lifted. It also has more of a natural glow. I think fine lines will take a little longer to smooth out. This product works best when layered with other products. It works best as a serum. Remember thinner products go on first. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
