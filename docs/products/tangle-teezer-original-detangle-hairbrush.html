            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great product and works very well.</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>The hair brush is more than my expectationI.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Using it so easy.</li>
            <li>Plastic feeling too strong</li>
            <li>A good brush, hair is very smooth and fluffy, my wife and my sister liked it</li>
            <li>It is a comfortable hair brush.</li>
            <li>it came on time and it&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair</li>
            <li>Gets knots out easily and gently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on their gentle scalps, but does an amazing job getting through tangles without pulling on their hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and this one was actually cheaper than the knock off I bought at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Combs right through your hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li>I never expected it to be able to go through my curly, sometime frizzy, mane without pulling</li>
            <li>The brush does make a very loud abrasive sound but it&#x27;s not damaging at all, it&#x27;s rather very gentle.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps with the tangled hair but would be better with a handle.</li>
            <li>Love this brush - this is the second one I purchased.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it put the knock off one to shame.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work miracles in regards to tangles, but I didn&#x27;t mind it as just a regular brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful with my hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really untangle my hair, might be because I got so much hair</li>
            <li>I very curly hair and this gently removes  tangles without ripping out my hair.</li>
            <li>But I decided I wanted the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>second one, I gifted to my 5 year old niece who refused to let anyone de-tangle her hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is so easy for curly long hair.</li>
            <li>I have really long, really fine, wavy, tangle-prone hair and the tangle teezer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s delivered right before Chinese New Year.</li>
            <li>My third time purchase this product (I lost the first two).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dropped frequently because of its shape</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 3 year old daughters hair and she calls it the &amp;#34;magic hairbrush&amp;#34; because it does not hurt.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use on my hair in dry or wet condition.</li>
            <li>My first one was the victim of a teething puppy, which is the only reason I had to get another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might work for thin/straight hair, but for thick, curly hair it simply isn&#x27;t strong enough to get through the layers.</li>

            <li> We have several other brushes and they only want to use this one.</li>
            <li> I have long, dry hair that is easily tangled and difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> the bristles are short, easily broken, and very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It seems like it rips out my hair when I comb it when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> i agree that the design would work well to detangle hair, but it can barely get through one small layer of my hair and does not come close to getting down to the scalp.</li>
            <li> just runs right through it with almost no effort even when it quite badly tangled.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick at all, this is not the answer to your tangles.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this was a waste of money for me</li>

            <li> i love it.Using it so easy.</li>
            <li> Love this brush - this is the second one I purchased. I have one for myself and this one I had purchased for my twin girls. It&#x27;s soft on their gentle scalps, but does an amazing job getting through tangles without pulling on their hair. It&#x27;s the only brush I use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful with my hair.I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this! I never expected it to be able to go through my curly, sometime frizzy, mane without pulling but it does. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It takes only two weeks to ship to China. And it&#x27;s delivered right before Chinese New Year. Thank you so much for timely delivery. The brush is so easy for curly long hair. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this! I can brush my 8 and 3 year olds hair without complaints of hurting them.</li>
            <li> Excellent detangler. Gets knots out easily and gently. Definitely recommend this for everyone. Makes my hair shine!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really untangle my hair, might be because I got so much hair</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s a amazing brush!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully.  Even makes my hair softer</li>
            <li> I very curly hair and this gently removes  tangles without ripping out my hair. The brush does make a very loud abrasive sound but it&#x27;s not damaging at all, it&#x27;s rather very gentle. Do not use it to do a blowout, it is NOT heat resistant.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, satisfied!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and comfortable for my hair, like it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It makes my life so.much.easier! Best brush I have ever owned. I have really long, really fine, wavy, tangle-prone hair and the tangle teezer just runs right through it with almost no effort even when it quite badly tangled. Stop reading this and buy this immediately!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to use, packaging is very good.I like it .</li>
            <li> Bought for my girl friend after she heard about it on YouTube. She has no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for awhile, I heard about it from some beauty gurus on Youtube. I bought a knock off version at walmart made by Goody and it was ok. But I decided I wanted the real thing. The first time I used it it put the knock off one to shame. This is amazing. I have long, dry hair that is easily tangled and difficult to brush. It glides through it with ease. I also use it on my 3 year old daughters hair and she calls it the &amp;#34;magic hairbrush&amp;#34; because it does not hurt. Amazing product and this one was actually cheaper than the knock off I bought at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Great!!! I love the way it brushes my hair!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Works amazing</li>
            <li> It is a comfortable hair brush. It is easy to use on my hair in dry or wet condition. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product and works very well. The shape is great for holding it comfortably in your hand.</li>

            <li> I love this brush it came on time and it&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair</li>
            <li> This is my third one. My first one was the victim of a teething puppy, which is the only reason I had to get another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second one, I gifted to my 5 year old niece who refused to let anyone de-tangle her hair. Now she agrees to let her hair get brushed out, but only if it&#x27;s with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Combs right through your hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> My third time purchase this product (I lost the first two). Love it! Great product!</li>
            <li> The hair brush is more than my expectationI. The brus help me to easily go through my hair which is tangled and difficult to brush. And the price is very lovely, I will buy another compact one to carry on when I was out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have three girls. That is A LOT of hair to brush in the morning before school starts. We have several other brushes and they only want to use this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not acturaly like the advertisement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference between a pick and this thing.  It seems like it rips out my hair when I comb it when it&#x27;s wet (which is majority of the time).  I went back to using th pick.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Keep one everywhere</li>
            <li> A good brush, hair is very smooth and fluffy, my wife and my sister liked it</li>
            <li> Plastic feeling too strong</li>
            <li> My children fight over this brush. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my product</li>
