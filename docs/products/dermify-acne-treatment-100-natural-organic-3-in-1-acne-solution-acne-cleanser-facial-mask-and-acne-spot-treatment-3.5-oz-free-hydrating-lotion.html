            <li>Salicylic Acid is so much better!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say how much I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>just wish the company had better communication!</li>
            <li>:) Thank you Dermify!</li>
            <li>I love it and would reccommned it!  </li>
            <li>I would be happy if the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to go through the day without some cream or gel covering my face.</li>
            <li>While doing some more online research on good natural/organic skincare brands to try, I came across Dermify and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Dermify for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a week now, and very impressed by the results which  I have never seen from Cleen &amp; Clear or Clerasil, which sries the skin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my skin and keeps it cleansed and fresh.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy.</li>
            <li>So far it is great!</li>
            <li>It seems to me that the closer to the skin the acne is, the more effective this product is.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked and was SO EASY as Dermify!</li>
            <li>Putting it on as a mask, certainly works and feels great once you take it off.</li>
            <li>But the best part is, it actually works!</li>
            <li>Oh, and I REALLY love the hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li>It was pricey and just seemed to irritate my skin even more.</li>
            <li>Dermify was the product that made a permanent change in my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion that comes with the cleanser/mask/spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this product and cannot imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li>I love how well it is clearing my skin and my pores without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>when I am not working :)    </li>
            <li>, I HOPE IT DOES FOR YOU! :)</li>
            <li>I am trying to be more sparring.</li>
            <li>made my skin better then ever.</li>
            <li>in fact, better skin was seen in just four days from the start of treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Proactiv as well as many prescribed medications.  </li>
            <li>The thing that caught my attention the most was the fact the inventor had also suffered from cystic acne as I had.  </li>
            <li>I am very very happy, finally I do not need to use a concealer to cover my acne.</li>
            <li>I have waited 6 weeks to write my review just to make sure my skin had time to get used to the product.  </li>
            <li>Still blackheads but not as many.    </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more ASAP, and recommending to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>It has a specific smell, but I think if it brings great results, I can bear with it!</li>
            <li>Will be getting more.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very natural and leaves a very nice feeling.</li>
            <li>If you eat a healthy diet and swap out all your current acne medications with Dermify, you will be so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick with the one-step process, and my skin feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>She has noticed a huge improvement in her skin/ acne.  </li>
            <li>Dermify draws out the junk from your pores, kills the bacteria, and leaves your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>And it is so CHEAP.</li>
            <li>and I must say that my face is much clearer without drying out or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>Dermify being organic and being SLS free is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>also the free moisturizer it comes with is awesome, if you only use it (the moisturizer) at night then it lasts the whole month if not longer.</li>
            <li>An extra plus to the product is that it&#x27;s shipped quickly and the seller is great.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my brother, who has mild, teenage acne, and it worked great for him.</li>
            <li>It is very light and hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>And best of all, it actually calms my super sensitive skin without drying or irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, organic, gentle and totally effective!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural and effective way to conquer acne.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering this product on amazon over the payment plan of 1x per month on the original retailers website because it always lasts more then a month, in the end</li>
            <li>The most important is that it is natural!</li>
            <li>The best luck I&#x27;ve had was with benzoyl peroxide, which was drying, left a white residue on my face, and bleached my clothes.</li>
            <li>Therefore, for me at least, the greatest acne fighter is lack of powerful stress.  </li>
            <li>But I love it because it makes my skin look normal instead of greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After many years of using many different things I decided to try a more natural cure</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and these products just seemed to irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an easy application and doesn&#x27;t sting or redden her face like so many others.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would say you should get Dermify, because it is effective, and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth using for the results.</li>
            <li>I love that it has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I love it that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>but i thought trying this product was worth it.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from adult acne for too many years.  </li>
            <li>and it is shipped right to your door.    </li>
            <li>Ok...maybe that&#x27;s overly dramatic, but my skin was seriously great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier and faster to get ready and much more effective than other treatments too.</li>
            <li>I started using it last year and it worked within a few days and was the best product I had ever used.</li>
            <li>They shipped super fast</li>
            <li>I believe 2 business days, VERY FAST and just in time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>P.S. De La Cruz sulfur ointment works pretty well if anyone is looking for a replacement to Dermify.</li>
            <li>The price was bit on the higher side</li>
            <li>Definitely try Dermify! :)</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin feels really clean and my face is oil free for a long time.</li>
            <li>Obviously overall health and a good diet, along with proper hygiene, play a similarly important role, but stress is definitely a major player, when on the field.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works, easy to use and the product is very simple and easy to travel with yet has multiple complex functions all in one,  the spot treatment is great and the mask 30 minutes 3x a week is really dope.  </li>
            <li>Black heads, in my experience, it isn&#x27;t as effective with.  </li>
            <li>Weeks 5&amp;6: Very high stress time in my life (typically my face would break out) and happy to say I have survived with only 1 noticeable pimple on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to some information, salicylic acid used topically during pregnancy is fine.  </li>
            <li>It shipped fast too</li>
            <li>Dermify works very well on oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>enjoy putting aloe vera on afterwards especially at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much in the tube though so</li>
            <li>it really payed off in the end.</li>
            <li>But the bottom line is, it works and the price is reasonable, to boot.  </li>
            <li>And the product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Sulfacetamide worked very well for me</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very noticeable to my girlfriend, and she dislikes it.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne since my early middle school years and I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>I would love to go all natural, but the only way I can control my acne is via the dermatologist and prescriptions.</li>
            <li>When you rinse it off and pat your face dry, your skin feels very clean and fresh, like there&#x27;s no oil in it, but not dry, either.</li>
            <li>When I do get a little dry from time to time, the moisturizer works great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>so I had to go a few days without it (my own fault), and I broke out severely, so I&#x27;m positive the Dermify had been keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact it is 100% natural and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>In my first trimester of pregnancy I developed acne and didn&#x27;t want to use any chemicals to treat it.</li>
            <li>As for acne, mine really did start to go away, but it didn&#x27;t stop new ones from forming.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from cystic acne just mainly on my chin for a while.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from mild to moderate acne since 16</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to people not wanting to use harmful chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has acne and could not find a product that works.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cruelty-free acne solution that was strong enough to clear up my skin, while being natural and not harsh.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a new pimple since I used it 10 days ago.   </li>
            <li>but I can live with it.     </li>
            <li>So happy to finally have found a treatment that doesn&#x27;t make things worse....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely gone!</li>
            <li>acne product I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
            <li>I notice clear, normal looking skin after every use.</li>
            <li>Dermify delivered the product actually a day before it was due, but how about offering it on Prime, Amazon??  : )</li>
            <li>My face cleared up substantially within a few days and any new pimples come to a head very quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, you truly only need to use a VERY tiny bit for full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everytime I eat something fat or sweet, I have extreme problem with acne.</li>
            <li>The bp kept my skin relatively clear but created a lot of redness, irritation and premature wrinkles</li>
            <li>to stay clear.</li>
            <li>I have fairly clear skin nowadays, and this clearing occurred in-sync with my lowering stress.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my acne clearing up after about 2 weeks of using it, and after being on it a month my skin cleared almost completely.</li>
            <li>This product was mentioned in a forum on Acne.org about how it really helped several members.</li>
            <li>you would have a whole bunch of extra dermify laying around the house!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, from dermatologists, to &#x27;natural&#x27; cures, to ProActive, Murad, etc.</li>
            <li>I did not care for the moisturizer at all because it was far too greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been battling adult acne this year, out of nowhere...</li>
            <li>Most of the topical products dried out my skin and the antibiotics hurt my stomach.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, I rarely use it, outside of just zapping a white head here and there</li>
            <li>I am a male model and need to always have nice healthy skin and was sick of using harmful topicals like benzyl and duac etc.</li>
            <li>This is really rare as I usually have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>My sister who is a science major recognized all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and perhaps this product would work for some, but based on my experience (and the rather high cost of the product)</li>
            <li>, I just thought that I&#x27;d point out that my stress level has recently gone down significantly, and with it, so has my acne.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I will have small breakouts if I don&#x27;t eat right or am under stress, but the pimples stay small and don&#x27;t last more than a day or two now.</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t totally clear but it has improved so much and my skin feels soft and not dry, like other products have left it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical  about Dermify, to be honest</li>
            <li>There is no two week adjustment period like some medications which make your face worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li>(I got the package in just a few days), and my skin is looking better everyday.</li>
            <li>Now since Dermify left, I&#x27;ve spent the past few years using all the chemical products from the drugstore and prescription products trying to treat my acne and have amazing clear, ageless skin.</li>
            <li>Give it a few weeks to really work and it will!</li>
            <li>It really calms the skin down AND gets the gunk out.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from acne on and off in the past couple years, and have tried about EVERYTHING and nothing seemed to do the job right.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> also the free moisturizer it comes with is awesome, if you only use it (the moisturizer) at night then it lasts the whole month if not longer.</li>
            <li> An extra plus to the product is that it&#x27;s shipped quickly and the seller is great.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my brother, who has mild, teenage acne, and it worked great for him.</li>
            <li> It is very light and hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> And best of all, it actually calms my super sensitive skin without drying or irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, organic, gentle and totally effective!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural and effective way to conquer acne.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering this product on amazon over the payment plan of 1x per month on the original retailers website because it always lasts more then a month, in the end</li>
            <li> The most important is that it is natural!</li>
            <li> The best luck I&#x27;ve had was with benzoyl peroxide, which was drying, left a white residue on my face, and bleached my clothes.</li>
            <li> Therefore, for me at least, the greatest acne fighter is lack of powerful stress.  </li>
            <li> But I love it because it makes my skin look normal instead of greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After many years of using many different things I decided to try a more natural cure</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these products just seemed to irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an easy application and doesn&#x27;t sting or redden her face like so many others.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would say you should get Dermify, because it is effective, and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth using for the results.</li>
            <li> I love that it has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I love it that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> but i thought trying this product was worth it.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne for too many years.  </li>
            <li> and it is shipped right to your door.    </li>
            <li> Ok...maybe that&#x27;s overly dramatic, but my skin was seriously great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier and faster to get ready and much more effective than other treatments too.</li>
            <li> I started using it last year and it worked within a few days and was the best product I had ever used.</li>
            <li> They shipped super fast</li>
            <li> I believe 2 business days, VERY FAST and just in time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> P.S. De La Cruz sulfur ointment works pretty well if anyone is looking for a replacement to Dermify.</li>
            <li> The price was bit on the higher side</li>
            <li> Definitely try Dermify! :)</li>
            <li> After using it, my skin feels really clean and my face is oil free for a long time.</li>
            <li> Obviously overall health and a good diet, along with proper hygiene, play a similarly important role, but stress is definitely a major player, when on the field.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works, easy to use and the product is very simple and easy to travel with yet has multiple complex functions all in one,  the spot treatment is great and the mask 30 minutes 3x a week is really dope.  </li>
            <li> Black heads, in my experience, it isn&#x27;t as effective with.  </li>
            <li> Weeks 5&amp;6: Very high stress time in my life (typically my face would break out) and happy to say I have survived with only 1 noticeable pimple on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to some information, salicylic acid used topically during pregnancy is fine.  </li>
            <li> It shipped fast too</li>
            <li> Dermify works very well on oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> enjoy putting aloe vera on afterwards especially at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much in the tube though so</li>
            <li> it really payed off in the end.</li>
            <li> But the bottom line is, it works and the price is reasonable, to boot.  </li>
            <li> And the product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Sulfacetamide worked very well for me</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very noticeable to my girlfriend, and she dislikes it.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since my early middle school years and I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> I would love to go all natural, but the only way I can control my acne is via the dermatologist and prescriptions.</li>
            <li> When you rinse it off and pat your face dry, your skin feels very clean and fresh, like there&#x27;s no oil in it, but not dry, either.</li>
            <li> When I do get a little dry from time to time, the moisturizer works great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> so I had to go a few days without it (my own fault), and I broke out severely, so I&#x27;m positive the Dermify had been keeping my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact it is 100% natural and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> In my first trimester of pregnancy I developed acne and didn&#x27;t want to use any chemicals to treat it.</li>
            <li> As for acne, mine really did start to go away, but it didn&#x27;t stop new ones from forming.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from cystic acne just mainly on my chin for a while.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from mild to moderate acne since 16</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to people not wanting to use harmful chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has acne and could not find a product that works.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cruelty-free acne solution that was strong enough to clear up my skin, while being natural and not harsh.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new pimple since I used it 10 days ago.   </li>
            <li> but I can live with it.     </li>
            <li> So happy to finally have found a treatment that doesn&#x27;t make things worse....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely gone!</li>
            <li> acne product I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
            <li> I notice clear, normal looking skin after every use.</li>
            <li> Dermify delivered the product actually a day before it was due, but how about offering it on Prime, Amazon??  : )</li>
            <li> My face cleared up substantially within a few days and any new pimples come to a head very quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, you truly only need to use a VERY tiny bit for full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everytime I eat something fat or sweet, I have extreme problem with acne.</li>
            <li> The bp kept my skin relatively clear but created a lot of redness, irritation and premature wrinkles</li>
            <li> to stay clear.</li>
            <li> I have fairly clear skin nowadays, and this clearing occurred in-sync with my lowering stress.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my acne clearing up after about 2 weeks of using it, and after being on it a month my skin cleared almost completely.</li>
            <li> This product was mentioned in a forum on Acne.org about how it really helped several members.</li>
            <li> you would have a whole bunch of extra dermify laying around the house!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, from dermatologists, to &#x27;natural&#x27; cures, to ProActive, Murad, etc.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the moisturizer at all because it was far too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been battling adult acne this year, out of nowhere...</li>
            <li> Most of the topical products dried out my skin and the antibiotics hurt my stomach.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, I rarely use it, outside of just zapping a white head here and there</li>
            <li> I am a male model and need to always have nice healthy skin and was sick of using harmful topicals like benzyl and duac etc.</li>
            <li> This is really rare as I usually have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> My sister who is a science major recognized all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and perhaps this product would work for some, but based on my experience (and the rather high cost of the product)</li>
            <li> , I just thought that I&#x27;d point out that my stress level has recently gone down significantly, and with it, so has my acne.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I will have small breakouts if I don&#x27;t eat right or am under stress, but the pimples stay small and don&#x27;t last more than a day or two now.</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t totally clear but it has improved so much and my skin feels soft and not dry, like other products have left it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical  about Dermify, to be honest</li>
            <li> There is no two week adjustment period like some medications which make your face worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> (I got the package in just a few days), and my skin is looking better everyday.</li>
            <li> Now since Dermify left, I&#x27;ve spent the past few years using all the chemical products from the drugstore and prescription products trying to treat my acne and have amazing clear, ageless skin.</li>
            <li> Give it a few weeks to really work and it will!</li>
            <li> It really calms the skin down AND gets the gunk out.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne on and off in the past couple years, and have tried about EVERYTHING and nothing seemed to do the job right.</li>
            <li> Due to its organic and natural formula, this wash was really gentle on my skin and didn&#x27;t make it dry, red, or irritated like all the other products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, as I am always, but this product really worked for me.</li>
            <li> less oily and kept me clear.</li>
            <li> It did seem to improve my skin at first by making redness and old scars somewhat less noticeable, but after that initial phase all it did was make my skin very dull, dry, and flaky (and just as prone to breakouts as ever!)</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is quite pungent and definitely takes some getting used to, especially if you&#x27;re not familiar with organic/natural products that use essential oils, etc.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t strip your face and make it dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the bp did, but I still use a moisturizer about 3 times a week at night to keep my skin extra-soft.</li>
            <li> The amount of moisture in my skin leveled out and did not feel extremely dry after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> There are no new ones on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to a dermatologist and tried every prescription pill and topical acne treatment on the market, it seems, with not much success.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately it did almost nothing to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> When you go to the dermatologist, they recommend using a new skin care regime for at least 30 days before saying it does not work.  </li>
            <li> She had a lot of dry patches with the acne that has seemed to resolve after 5 days!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic, but it does beat the hell out of white heads, especially if you apply it a couple times a day.  </li>
            <li> And really gets into your pores deep, even to where it can be difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s and am no longer embarrassed by my stubborn adult acne.</li>
            <li> After a few months of Dermify, I decided to change products because of cost reasons but now I am back again.</li>
            <li> I started trying some natural/organic skincare brands and those actually seemed to help my acne without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way because you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> (the active ingredient is sulfur).  </li>
            <li> So, what they mean by \\&quot;3 in 1\\&quot; is that you can use it as a cleanser, facial mask, and acne spot treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin was less oily during the day.  </li>
            <li> but they are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Just a slightly tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Super bad smell and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product can be slightly drying, but it doesn&#x27;t create flakiness the way harsh foaming products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this stuff to anyone dealing with adult acne, especially people who want off nasty benzoyl peroxide products and want to save lots of time on their acne care regiment every morning and night.</li>
            <li> A little works a looooong way though.</li>
            <li> I would definitely rate this product to anyone, especially those that are feeling desperate about their skin.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to apply creams and waste time with a 3 or 4 step process every morning and night.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a difference within a few days...</li>
            <li> Still have a few blackheads</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks of using it, I can see a dramatic improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li> This product stinks and is too high maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a solid product, but my acne is too bad to be controlled by a product like this.</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount on a Q-tip and apply a dab to any pimples and they&#x27;ll be almost gone by the morning.</li>
            <li> I tried oral antibiotics and Sprironolactone, which worked better but the side effects were horrible.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so unfortunately you have to spend money and try products to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> Very few if any pimples.  </li>
            <li> It works, organic, no soduim lauryl sulfate (SLS has been shown to penetrate the aqueous pores of the skin and is not very good for the environment), contains sulfer (a known acne fighter)    Cons:</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s at least what I would recommend).</li>
            <li> duh</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, as I don&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li> What a waste because I just made my skin way worse.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a chance for a few months, but after my breakouts got worse, I decided to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> it really is not that bad when you break it down...</li>
            <li> The constant, painful cystic acne that always popped up along my jawline and on my chest is now gone.</li>
            <li> Proactiv made my skin worse, clearasil was not really effective, and so on.</li>
            <li> it was a tough choice to possibly break out and have a bad month of work</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re desperate and tired of harsh junky products and complicated routines, give this a try.</li>
            <li> It was extremely frustrating, not to mention expensive.</li>
            <li> After 1 week, my skin looked completely clear of nasty whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I tried everything in the market and this was just another disappointment .</li>
            <li> which has been very frustrating :(  </li>
            <li> I was so sick of using OTC products.</li>
            <li> Is it gone forever? :(</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t terrible, but it doesn&#x27;t offer mindblowing results either.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> In my first trimester of pregnancy I developed acne and didn&#x27;t want to use any chemicals to treat it. I was skeptical  about Dermify, to be honest but once I started using it I noticed a difference quite soon. My face isn&#x27;t totally clear but it has improved so much and my skin feels soft and not dry, like other products have left it. I highly recommend this to people not wanting to use harmful chemicals on their skin. Give it a few weeks to really work and it will!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different products and nothing has helped my acne. The best luck I&#x27;ve had was with benzoyl peroxide, which was drying, left a white residue on my face, and bleached my clothes. I read great things about Dermify and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I like how it is natural/organic and you don&#x27;t have to apply creams and waste time with a 3 or 4 step process every morning and night. Just wash and you&#x27;re set for the day. But the best part is, it actually works! My face cleared up substantially within a few days and any new pimples come to a head very quickly. There is no two week adjustment period like some medications which make your face worse before it gets better. It&#x27;s so nice to go through the day without some cream or gel covering my face. My pores can breathe. If you eat a healthy diet and swap out all your current acne medications with Dermify, you will be so happy with the results. Dermify draws out the junk from your pores, kills the bacteria, and leaves your face feeling smooth. And it doesn&#x27;t strip your face and make it dry. It&#x27;s also a great mask and spot treatment. Just put a small amount on a Q-tip and apply a dab to any pimples and they&#x27;ll be almost gone by the morning. It&#x27;s so much easier and faster to get ready and much more effective than other treatments too. I highly recommend this product. 1 tube does it all. It shipped fast too so I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> So, what they mean by \\&quot;3 in 1\\&quot; is that you can use it as a cleanser, facial mask, and acne spot treatment. I only use it as a mask, because I can leave it on overnight. If you put some on, wait a minute, and rinse it off, it&#x27;s just wasting it. Anyways, it dries very quickly. And really gets into your pores deep, even to where it can be difficult to wash out. When you rinse it off and pat your face dry, your skin feels very clean and fresh, like there&#x27;s no oil in it, but not dry, either. As for acne, mine really did start to go away, but it didn&#x27;t stop new ones from forming. I have tried ALOT of products for acne, and this is a good one. If you get it, you still need to have another cream cleanser with it (That&#x27;s at least what I would recommend). Oh, and I REALLY love the hydrating lotion. Overall, I would say you should get Dermify, because it is effective, and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid is so much better!  This product stinks and is too high maintenance.  Contrary to some information, salicylic acid used topically during pregnancy is fine.  I would never use this product again and will trash it if I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> I have battled acne for over 10 years, and it seems like I&#x27;ve tried everything. I&#x27;ve gone to a dermatologist and tried every prescription pill and topical acne treatment on the market, it seems, with not much success. I have very sensitive skin and these products just seemed to irritate my skin more. I tried oral antibiotics and Sprironolactone, which worked better but the side effects were horrible. I also wondered what these antibiotics and hormonal treatments were doing to my body in terms of side effects- my skin was clearing up somewhat, but at what price? It was extremely frustrating, not to mention expensive. I eventually went off all prescription acne medication and decided to start researching alternative treatments. Friends recommended Proactiv to me, which I tried for several months. It was pricey and just seemed to irritate my skin even more. I started trying some natural/organic skincare brands and those actually seemed to help my acne without irritating my sensitive skin. While doing some more online research on good natural/organic skincare brands to try, I came across Dermify and decided to give it a shot. What a difference it&#x27;s made in my skin in just over a month! The constant, painful cystic acne that always popped up along my jawline and on my chest is now gone. I started noticing a difference within a few days... my acne wasn&#x27;t gone overnight but Dermify took care of my existing acne within a couple weeks and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts at all. And best of all, it actually calms my super sensitive skin without drying or irritation. When I do get a little dry from time to time, the moisturizer works great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I am in my late 20s and am no longer embarrassed by my stubborn adult acne. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time going back to Dermify. I have suffered from acne since my early middle school years and I have tried so many products. Dermify was the product that made a permanent change in my skin for the better. I started using it last year and it worked within a few days and was the best product I had ever used. After a few months of Dermify, I decided to change products because of cost reasons but now I am back again. The cleanser is very natural and leaves a very nice feeling. An extra plus to the product is that it&#x27;s shipped quickly and the seller is great. I would definitely rate this product to anyone, especially those that are feeling desperate about their skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a solid product, but my acne is too bad to be controlled by a product like this. I gave it to my brother, who has mild, teenage acne, and it worked great for him. I do use it as a mask every week because I like the way my skin feels afterwards. I love the lotion that comes with the cleanser/mask/spot treatment. It is very light and hydrates my skin very well. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so unfortunately you have to spend money and try products to find what works for you. I would love to go all natural, but the only way I can control my acne is via the dermatologist and prescriptions. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne on and off in the past couple years, and have tried about EVERYTHING and nothing seemed to do the job right. Proactiv made my skin worse, clearasil was not really effective, and so on. I decided to give Dermify a shot and was really impressed by the all-natural ingredients. Due to its organic and natural formula, this wash was really gentle on my skin and didn&#x27;t make it dry, red, or irritated like all the other products. I was skeptical at first, as I am always, but this product really worked for me. I use it as a spot treatment almost every night, and I wake up to a vastly diminished pimple and then over a couple days- it&#x27;s completely gone! Absolutely in love with this product and cannot imagine using anything else. If you suffer from acne or just the occasional zits or pimples, I would definitely recommend Dermify. It&#x27;s natural, organic, gentle and totally effective!</li>
            <li> Dermify works very well on oily, acne prone skin.  I love how well it is clearing my skin and my pores without any irritation.  The cleanser smells like sulfur and oregano but it&#x27;s worth using for the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermify for 3 months now, after switching over from a benzoyl peroxide regimen. The bp kept my skin relatively clear but created a lot of redness, irritation and premature wrinkles (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s). After many failed attempts to get off the bp and still keep an acne-free face, I discovered Dermify. I can&#x27;t even say how much I LOVE THIS STUFF! It&#x27;s so quick with the one-step process, and my skin feels better than it has in years. I love that it has all natural ingredients and I don&#x27;t have to use any soap on my face. I noticed my acne clearing up after about 2 weeks of using it, and after being on it a month my skin cleared almost completely. Sometimes I will have small breakouts if I don&#x27;t eat right or am under stress, but the pimples stay small and don&#x27;t last more than a day or two now. Between the 2nd and 3rd month I ran out and forgot to order another bottle in time so I had to go a few days without it (my own fault), and I broke out severely, so I&#x27;m positive the Dermify had been keeping my skin clear. I use it as a mask 3 times a week, and also as a spot treatment. The spot treatment dries up inflamed pimples overnight. It&#x27;s amazing! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the bp did, but I still use a moisturizer about 3 times a week at night to keep my skin extra-soft. I&#x27;d highly recommend this stuff to anyone dealing with adult acne, especially people who want off nasty benzoyl peroxide products and want to save lots of time on their acne care regiment every morning and night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I am very, very happy with the results. It&#x27;s great for my skin and keeps it cleansed and fresh. During my \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot; it keeps my skin under control. Putting it on as a mask, certainly works and feels great once you take it off. It makes you face feel so good, I have no problem NOT wearing makeup, when I am not working :)    IT WORKS FOR ME, I HOPE IT DOES FOR YOU! :)</li>
            <li> ~~~UPDATE (2016) Will this product ever be in stock again? Is it gone forever? :( When this stuff went out of stock, it ruined my life. Ok...maybe that&#x27;s overly dramatic, but my skin was seriously great! Now since Dermify left, I&#x27;ve spent the past few years using all the chemical products from the drugstore and prescription products trying to treat my acne and have amazing clear, ageless skin. What a waste because I just made my skin way worse. Nothing worked and was SO EASY as Dermify! P.S. De La Cruz sulfur ointment works pretty well if anyone is looking for a replacement to Dermify. And it is so CHEAP. :D Should&#x27;ve stuck with that instead of going to the derm.~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST acne product I&#x27;ve ever used by far! After 1 week, my skin looked completely clear of nasty whiteheads. And I struggle with constant whiteheads. It really calms the skin down AND gets the gunk out. I notice clear, normal looking skin after every use. A little goes a long way because you only need a small amount. It should look transparent on the skin while you wash. Leave on for a couple minutes for best results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy putting aloe vera on afterwards especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product can be slightly drying, but it doesn&#x27;t create flakiness the way harsh foaming products do. Just a slightly tight feeling. But I love it because it makes my skin look normal instead of greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re desperate and tired of harsh junky products and complicated routines, give this a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the company had better communication!</li>
            <li> This product was mentioned in a forum on Acne.org about how it really helped several members. I have been suffering from cystic acne just mainly on my chin for a while. I was so sick of using OTC products. This product was about the same price as one of my prescribed medication, Epiduo. I have been using Dermify for over 1 week now, and I am really happy with the results. After using it, my skin feels really clean and my face is oil free for a long time. This is really rare as I usually have really oily skin. I love it that it&#x27;s natural. My sister who is a science major recognized all the natural ingredients. So far, I am very happy. There isn&#x27;t much in the tube though so I am trying to be more sparring. A little works a looooong way though. I hope this product is working for everyone else too. I haven&#x27;t had a new pimple since I used it 10 days ago.   I would also recommend that everyone else take supplements while using this product too. I bought the recommended Probiotics and Fiber with this product. Good luck!</li>
            <li> this stuff really works, easy to use and the product is very simple and easy to travel with yet has multiple complex functions all in one,  the spot treatment is great and the mask 30 minutes 3x a week is really dope.  yet it is all in one simple bottle. also the free moisturizer it comes with is awesome, if you only use it (the moisturizer) at night then it lasts the whole month if not longer. even using this product generously it always lasts me over 30 days. I am a male model and need to always have nice healthy skin and was sick of using harmful topicals like benzyl and duac etc. to stay clear. it was a tough choice to possibly break out and have a bad month of work but i thought trying this product was worth it. it really payed off in the end. made my skin better then ever. less oily and kept me clear. worth every penny. this i think is the 3rd time I have ordered dermify now and I payed for only the standard shipping but it came in I believe 2 business days, VERY FAST and just in time. I highly recommend ordering this product on amazon over the payment plan of 1x per month on the original retailers website because it always lasts more then a month, in the end you would have a whole bunch of extra dermify laying around the house! this way you get to save money, great shipping and a free moisturizer!</li>
            <li> So happy to finally have found a treatment that doesn&#x27;t make things worse....in fact, better skin was seen in just four days from the start of treatment.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, from dermatologists, to &#x27;natural&#x27; cures, to ProActive, Murad, etc. to help my daughter with her recurrent breakouts.  It&#x27;s such an easy application and doesn&#x27;t sting or redden her face like so many others.  But the bottom line is, it works and the price is reasonable, to boot.  Dermify delivered the product actually a day before it was due, but how about offering it on Prime, Amazon??  : )</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this product for five days.  She has noticed a huge improvement in her skin/ acne.  She had a lot of dry patches with the acne that has seemed to resolve after 5 days!  Her face does not appear to have the redness it did prior to using it.  So far it is great!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately it did almost nothing to clear up my skin. It did seem to improve my skin at first by making redness and old scars somewhat less noticeable, but after that initial phase all it did was make my skin very dull, dry, and flaky (and just as prone to breakouts as ever!) I did not care for the moisturizer at all because it was far too greasy. The smell of the product is quite pungent and definitely takes some getting used to, especially if you&#x27;re not familiar with organic/natural products that use essential oils, etc. I gave the product a chance for a few months, but after my breakouts got worse, I decided to discontinue use. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and perhaps this product would work for some, but based on my experience (and the rather high cost of the product) I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne for too many years.  I have tried Proactiv as well as many prescribed medications.  I had even been on Accutane at one point.  After many years of using many different things I decided to try a more natural cure and that is when I decided to try Dermify.  The thing that caught my attention the most was the fact the inventor had also suffered from cystic acne as I had.  I have been using Dermify for just over a month and I must say that my face is much clearer without drying out or irritation of any kind. I especially like the fact it is 100% natural and so easy to use.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural and effective way to conquer acne.  I will be using Dermify from now on!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne for the past 15 years. I have used almost all the products on the market trying to find something that will help get rid of my acne. None of the over the counter medications helped me. Salicylic acid products did not help, benzoyl peroxide products were too drying for my face and also caused redness.When I was searching Amazon for another product, Dermify caught my eye and thought let me try this one now. The price was bit on the higher side but I wanted to give it a try after reading the reviews by customers who had similar problems.  I have been using Dermify for the last 3 weeks and it has been a blessing. I have been waiting for such a product all my life. This product does not dry my skin at all. I use it twice daily to cleanse my skin and use it overnight as a spot treatment and also once a week as a mask. I want to thank the folks at Dermify for creating this product. There has been a 95% improvement in my acne healing. There are no new ones on my face. I am very very happy, finally I do not need to use a concealer to cover my acne. I have used prescriptions as well but none of them worked.  Please keep this product in stock. Thanks Amazon and Dermify for this wonderful product. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has acne and could not find a product that works. I would be happy if the shipping was free. And the product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from mild to moderate acne since 16 and I am 28 now.  Over the course of time, I have used just about everything (salicylic acid, benzyl peroxide, Tazorac cream, Sulfacetamide (Klaron), and antibiotics).  Most of the topical products dried out my skin and the antibiotics hurt my stomach.  Sulfacetamide worked very well for me but I need a prescription and I would have to visit the dermatologist ($$$).  I searched for an acne treatment solution that contains sulfer and found Dermify.  Dermify being organic and being SLS free is an added bonus.  I have waited 6 weeks to write my review just to make sure my skin had time to get used to the product.  When you go to the dermatologist, they recommend using a new skin care regime for at least 30 days before saying it does not work.  Over the 6 weeks, this is what I have found.      Week 1: The amount of moisture in my skin leveled out and did not feel extremely dry after washing my face.  I did not need to lotion my face after every wash.  When putting Dermify on as a topical acne cream, the pimples were smaller the next morning.  Some pimples were still coming to the surface of my skin.  Blackheads were still around but there were fewer of them.      Week 2: Any deep cystic pimples I had were no longer irritated and went away (I have not had one since).  My skin was less oily during the day.  Still blackheads but not as many.    Weeks 3&amp;4: Very few if any pimples.  Still have blackheads.    Weeks 5&amp;6: Very high stress time in my life (typically my face would break out) and happy to say I have survived with only 1 noticeable pimple on my chin.  Still have a few blackheads but they are much less noticeable.  All that is really left of my acne is the scars and those will fade with time.      In summary...    Pros: It works, organic, no soduim lauryl sulfate (SLS has been shown to penetrate the aqueous pores of the skin and is not very good for the environment), contains sulfer (a known acne fighter)    Cons:The smell is not the greatest because of the sulfer but I can live with it.     The price... it really is not that bad when you break it down... Cost of face soap $7-10 per month + cost of benzyl peroxide acne cream $5 per month + cost of lotion $10-15 per month &#x3D; total cost $22-30 per month.  Not included in the cost is all the make up you purchase to cover the acne.  Price of Dermify if you are a member $32 per month and it is shipped right to your door.    :) Thank you Dermify!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product! I have been battling adult acne this year, out of nowhere... which has been very frustrating :(  I was looking for a cruelty-free acne solution that was strong enough to clear up my skin, while being natural and not harsh. Dermify was the perfect find!  They shipped super fast (I got the package in just a few days), and my skin is looking better everyday. After only 2 weeks of using it, I can see a dramatic improvement in my complexion. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a month!  I will be ordering more ASAP, and recommending to my friends and family. Definitely try Dermify! :)</li>
            <li> I have a problem skin. Everytime I eat something fat or sweet, I have extreme problem with acne. I have used this product for about a week now, and very impressed by the results which  I have never seen from Cleen &amp; Clear or Clerasil, which sries the skin!  I love it and would reccommned it!  It has a specific smell, but I think if it brings great results, I can bear with it! The most important is that it is natural!</li>
            <li> Had to return it I&#x27;m still waiting fort money back. Super bad smell and didn&#x27;t work at all. I tried everything in the market and this was just another disappointment .</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t terrible, but it doesn&#x27;t offer mindblowing results either. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after using the product for a month.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders especially when used overnight. Will be getting more.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  I wanted an all-natural acne treatment, and this was the seemingly best one I could find.  I&#x27;ve had mild-moderate acne (male) on my face, and this stuff works relatively well.  It&#x27;s not magic, but it does beat the hell out of white heads, especially if you apply it a couple times a day.  Black heads, in my experience, it isn&#x27;t as effective with.  It seems to me that the closer to the skin the acne is, the more effective this product is.  Also, you truly only need to use a VERY tiny bit for full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the one downfall of this product is the smell.  It smells like sulfur....duh (the active ingredient is sulfur).  This doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, as I don&#x27;t notice it.  However, it&#x27;s very noticeable to my girlfriend, and she dislikes it.  Because of this, I rarely use it, outside of just zapping a white head here and there (it really does destroy white heads nicely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I just thought that I&#x27;d point out that my stress level has recently gone down significantly, and with it, so has my acne.  I have fairly clear skin nowadays, and this clearing occurred in-sync with my lowering stress.  Therefore, for me at least, the greatest acne fighter is lack of powerful stress.  Obviously overall health and a good diet, along with proper hygiene, play a similarly important role, but stress is definitely a major player, when on the field.  So yeah, just thought I&#x27;d throw that out there.</li>
