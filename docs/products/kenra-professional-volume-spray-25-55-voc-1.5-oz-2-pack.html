            <li>Smells great, not overpowering and love it so much I can&#x27;t do with out on a trip</li>
            <li>I love the size of these hair sprays</li>
            <li>So these trial sizes are great because after using this product, I don&#x27;t want to use any other kind when I&#x27;m on vacation.</li>
            <li>Excellent hold without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this gives it volume and lift and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Great hold and use only once and holds for days.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best firm hair sprays that you will ever use.  </li>
            <li>They are smaller than I was thinking - more of a purse size - but the product is  good</li>
            <li>Great hold without the stiffness or heaviness of most other sprays</li>
            <li>love the travel size because I can leave one in my car, my purse, luggage; and it&#x27;s legal for air travel!</li>
            <li>One canister worked beautifully, the other spit a bit but was usable.</li>

            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought two large cans and two small because I was so impressed with the reviews.</li>
            <li>The perfect amount of hold for short or long styles</li>
            <li>have fine hair and it gives a good hold without a stiff look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing hold and smell is terrific for a hairspray.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray will still hold many styles even after you brush, and the hair feels natural.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for travel.</li>
            <li>One mini canister lasts me about two weeks or more on vacation - one use/day - and using only a quick spritz.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling..can even just throw in your carry on, although I usually put it in my checked baggage.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>

            <li>I have been using this hairspray for a long time and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I use this spray - large size - at home.  </li>
            <li>I used it all, but the price is very high.</li>
            <li>These travel size are very convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have enough money to get a full size can of this</li>
            <li>Tends to under-produce in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li>Or if I need more control, I don&#x27;t brush and I spray my hair stiff, but</li>
            <li>While it may be a hairspray , it has a gentle soft look; not stiff.</li>
            <li>It holds all day without leaving a hard, sticky feeling like most hair sprays that i have used.</li>
            <li>The spray holds but makes your hair look and feel natural.  </li>
            <li>Definite beauty item to keep in stock on the get ready shelf.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural look on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those sprays where you can choose your control: for a relaxed style; I  spray, and brush and hair looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>yet it always looks natural and I can still run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>then fluff with blow dryer you do not have to wash it when you are abroad as much.</li>
            <li>Say mmmmmmmm, because you or others will not choke on the smell and the hold is enough to withstand high winds and high heat (have only tried in dry fall/winter weather in LA, so it may be wet mess for high humidity areas.</li>

            <li> I am officially Kenra addicted.  My mom uses Kenra and while visiting I used her products and immediately went to Amazon to find every product I could.  I use the shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, smoother....etc., etc., etc.  The spray holds but makes your hair look and feel natural.  I have recommended to all of my friends.  Definite beauty item to keep in stock on the get ready shelf.</li>
            <li> Great for travel! Love this hairspray! If you use this product then lightly wet your hair then fluff with blow dryer you do not have to wash it when you are abroad as much.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling..can even just throw in your carry on, although I usually put it in my checked baggage.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Great hold, convenient travel size.</li>
            <li> I use this spray - large size - at home.  The mini size is perfect for traveling.  One mini canister lasts me about two weeks or more on vacation - one use/day - and using only a quick spritz.  This spray is the best hairspray I have ever used - and I am 61.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky, nor leave smelling residue on your pillows!  Plus it works really well!</li>
            <li> Great hold and use only once and holds for days.  No need to keep re-spraying.  These travel size are very convenient.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray on earth.  I love being able to order both items online!  Both came very quickly!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve been able to find. Excellent hold without weighing the hair down. And it smells nice too. I keep a small one in my purse. It last surprisinly long for its size.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product.  Tends to under-produce in high humidity.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> I used it all, but the price is very high.</li>
            <li> I just picked it up for trying.But it&#x27;s very strong and volumed&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin , fine hair.  I like it very much</li>
            <li> These are just the perfect travel companion. Either for your purse, in the car, or the allowable size for airline travel, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice, very nice :)&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and this what you would want to take with you if you&lt;br /&gt;use hair spray. It&#x27;s also has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for travel. One canister worked beautifully, the other spit a bit but was usable. Of course I will order again when the time comes.</li>

            <li> I have used this hairspray for years. It is the best product ever. I have fine hair and this gives it volume and lift and stays all day. This is the best hairspray I have ever used. Nothing else compares to this.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best firm hair sprays that you will ever use.  These minis are great for travel.</li>
            <li> This order came as promised, and in a timely manner.  This Kenra product is the best spray out there for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this size is perfect for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIDottie</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed in the size. Probably my fault</li>
            <li> trial sized cans are perfect for travel, or purse.  Great hold without the stiffness or heaviness of most other sprays</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for a long time and absolutely love it. I travel alot but hate having to bring along my large bottle. the travel size bottles help with space and work just as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a drug store travel sized hairspray that I like. My favorite salon hairspray is Aquage Freezing Spray, but they don&#x27;t make a travel size. Kenra 25 is the next best thing. It holds up well in Houston&#x27;s humidity.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kenra hairspray for several years now. What I like about this is it&#x27;s natural look on my hair. While it may be a hairspray , it has a gentle soft look; not stiff.</li>
            <li> Out of all Kenra&#x27;s Fabulous products, their hairspray is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s one of those sprays where you can choose your control: for a relaxed style; I  spray, and brush and hair looks and feels natural. This hairspray will still hold many styles even after you brush, and the hair feels natural. Or if I need more control, I don&#x27;t brush and I spray my hair stiff, but yet it always looks natural and I can still run my fingers through it. So these trial sizes are great because after using this product, I don&#x27;t want to use any other kind when I&#x27;m on vacation.So I buy the trial size and it conveniently fits into the quart bag required by airlines.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me this hairspray as a gift in 2007 and I never bought another brand again. This is the best hairspray I have ever used. It holds without looking sticky.</li>
            <li> Best holding hairspray without buildup I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really like how well it holds my hair in place without making it stiff and unnatural looking.  smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is a good size for travel.  It smells clean and fresh not overpowering.  It holds the style all day.  I recommend this hair spary.</li>
            <li> Perfect mini size to keep in handbag or makeup kit.  Amazing hold and smell is terrific for a hairspray.  FAVORITE HAIRSPRAY I HAVE TRIED IN ALL MY YEARS!!!! Industry top rated favorite for a reason.  Say mmmmmmmm, because you or others will not choke on the smell and the hold is enough to withstand high winds and high heat (have only tried in dry fall/winter weather in LA, so it may be wet mess for high humidity areas. I just cannot say).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you spray this finishing spray, let it dry and do not touch with a brush.  It truly locks in your hairdo for an entire day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from Amazon&#x27;s Ultra Cosmetics Store vendor. Super fast shipping. Arrived in 2-3 days well packed in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is the only hair spray that I use. It doesnt leave your hair weighted down. It holds all day without leaving a hard, sticky feeling like most hair sprays that i have used.</li>
            <li> Kenra is the best hairspray! Having travel sizes is even better! Highly recommend this product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li> Really great size for traveling.  Now I don&#x27;t have to lug the big one with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who travels.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra hairsrapy.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and it gives a good hold without a stiff look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and just when I needed it for travel!</li>
            <li> I like this brand and it holds up well.  They are smaller than I was thinking - more of a purse size - but the product is  good and I am not allergic to it which is a nice thing.</li>
            <li> Love this spray. Smells great, not overpowering and love it so much I can&#x27;t do with out on a trip</li>
            <li> I love the size of these hair sprays and I&#x27;m actually glad they came in &amp;#34;two&#x27;s&amp;#34; as my daughter took one of mine!  Works great in humid conditions, smells good too!</li>
            <li> Small and portable, expensive but portable.</li>
            <li> These are perfect travel sizes.</li>
            <li> Product came in pink rather than the silver as illustrated in promotion,</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in grat shape. I love the whole Kenra line, but especially the hair spray. It holds great and brushes out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to buy this in bulk, so I&#x27;ll always have it where I need it.  The hold is first-rate and keeps my bangs off my face!</li>
            <li> Received as promised.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold without the stickyness.</li>
            <li> This recieved good reviews but the smell is horrible.  I bought two large cans and two small because I was so impressed with the reviews. Be warned that you will get a headache from this smell and so will anyone around you.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray and great travel size.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray EVER, and I&#x27;ve tried most!  The perfect amount of hold for short or long styles and it lasts all day! Never gunky.  The travel size is perfect for throwing in a purse or bag-- so much better than having to lug around the large can.  AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great seller!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have enough money to get a full size can of this but I found this on Amazon and it got me through a couple of interviews!</li>
            <li> The best flexible hold hairspray! !</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Product was as described.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray!  I have baby-fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but holds my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the travel size because I can leave one in my car, my purse, luggage; and it&#x27;s legal for air travel!</li>
