            <li> This was a gift for my mother and she loved the product. She had used it some years ago but could not find it anymore until I found it on Amazon. She is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I never fail to get compliments on how nice I smell when I wear Enigma. There&#x27;s something about this perfume... haunting and mysterious!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for several decades now and still love it - and still receive compliments.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance. An elegant scent, musky, but not overpowering and not overly sweet. I frequently get compliments when I am wearing it and numerous people have asked me for the name.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a bottle of Enigma, it must have been about 30 years ago, and I loved it and my husband has always loved the scent on me.  Since then that is the only perfume I have used.  That is how much I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragrance, and I never fail to receive excellent compliments on it.  Your price was also excellent, so thank you as always for your covering all the products I need.</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas. It has a nice spicy scent. It is not overpowering. Best used as the package suggests...\\&quot;as a veil\\&quot;, meaning to mist it on your body rather than saturating one spot. If you like a lightly floral scent hinting more toward spicy, I would recommend trying this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Hard to fine but is the same as original.</li>
            <li> There are other perfumes I prefer to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Enigma for over 25 yrs and am sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued.  When the stock runs out I&#x27;ll be really sad.  It&#x27;s a very fresh fragrance, light, not too sweet, and not too spicey.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance my mother has been wearing for the last 25 yrs!! The price is wonderful, it is the true fragrance, not imitation so I will continue on buying Enigma from Amazon along with my perfume which is Creed. We are two very Happy Women!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find this fragrance again!  I wore it in the 70s and 80s and absolutely loved it!  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it!  I get compliments all the time.  And it is NOT overbearing at all!  Brings back tons of memories as well!!!</li>
            <li> I have worn Enigma an loved it but difficult to find. Love Amazon can find amazing prices an the best!! Enigma is a fragrance that stays with you and I always have compliments with people wanting to know where to get this.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product for several years.  Believe any mature woman will do the same.  A very soothing, exciting and calming effect.  I feel special when I have it on.</li>
            <li> Was not sure this product was the authentic Enigma.Packaging, bottle and liquid were not like my original Enigma. I have used Enigma for many years.</li>
            <li> Enigma is the most wonderful thing on earth.  I could just drink it. I get many complements every time I wear it.  Especially from the guys.  Everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> Enigma is the one of those fragrances you smell once and never forget. You won&#x27;t be disappointed by buying it.</li>
