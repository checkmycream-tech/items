            <li>love this lamp!</li>
            <li>will order more from this seller!</li>
            <li>Have now become my own manicurist.</li>
            <li>I do my own \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; manicures at home using the Gelish products.</li>
            <li>Nice machine.  </li>
            <li>This is kind of neat if you&#x27;re doing your feet on the floor</li>
            <li>I had to figure out much of it on my own.</li>
            <li>Nice and roomy, no need to cure the thumb separately.</li>
            <li>but would have loved to have been able to put both hands in at one time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use very nice enjoy!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in great condition and is a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Gelaze is by far the BEST gel polish.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if there was more colors to choose form.</li>
            <li>Works 100 times better than UV lamp I own.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Great value and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I started doing my own gelcolor manicures at home and wanted a good light, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $350 for the OPI light.</li>
            <li>your light is working!</li>
            <li>This nail lamp is just OK.  </li>
            <li>What I love about it is that you can set it on an automatic mode.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to place all of my fingers inside with no issues.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>a friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>Better than expcted.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and need more practice.</li>
            <li>Most LED gel polishes cure at 385 or 400.  </li>
            <li>No lights on top or inside the machine would turn on.</li>
            <li>Love this light!</li>
            <li>I love this lamp.</li>
            <li>Why pay more.</li>
            <li>Love this light!  </li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li>I just love this lamp.</li>
            <li>One cannot ask for more than that!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>The shape makes sure all nails get processed correctly instead of the four fingers and then thumb separately.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>I like it much more than the 12 Watt version I used to have.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>With the top coat I used 60 seconds just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I want it to be in perfect condition regardless if it&#x27;s just the box outside.</li>
            <li>so it cures better.  </li>
            <li>The label on top &amp;#34;LED/UV&amp;#34; is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li>No instructions were enclosed, but was able to figure how to operate the lamp.  </li>
            <li>I love this LED lamp, it&#x27;s gives you the option to automatically come on when you place your hand inside.</li>
            <li>This is such a great buy for me!!</li>
            <li>While the lamp worked and I got okay end results, I was hoping to shorten this time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super glad I did.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret this purchase :)</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use with more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>So far so good working with all kind of brand name gel products.</li>
            <li>Exceptional fast service!</li>
            <li>This LED lamp is so much better than the UV light I was using before.  </li>
            <li>But most important is #2.</li>
            <li>I love having timer settings or the option to keep the light on.</li>
            <li>What I love about the light is that it is sort of automatic.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to stay with UV because it will cure EVERY gel type polish, but I also loved the lower curing time of LED.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good one but, didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>This nail light works great and is super fast!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate.</li>
            <li>The curved design makes it compact and easy to transport.</li>
            <li>No other complaints, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have just switched to gel polish and have to admit that it is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>For the money, it works fine</li>
            <li>I plugged the lamp in and it seemed to be working fine (for about 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>The instructions are a bit odd, seemed to be giving instructions for a UV lamp not an LED, nonetheless, I am so very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They were quick, responsive and had a personality!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with the light CND shellac polishes yet.</li>
            <li>I had been throwing away a bunch of boxes and thought that since it was so light, I must have thrown the darn thing away.  </li>
            <li>I kicked myself for a bit and then ordered this light.  </li>
            <li>I can spread my fingers out in this light.</li>
            <li>A great value for the final product.</li>
            <li>Also, it feels extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a big nail machine and this is great.</li>
            <li>The light turns on automatically and the timer is set for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>--this lamp will NOT work with products that require a UV light.  </li>
            <li>This will easily fit both hands in it.  </li>
            <li>The price has varied in the few times I&#x27;ve checked this product since buying it, but as of today, it&#x27;s still a great deal!</li>
            <li>The price has varied in the few times I&#x27;ve checked this product since buying it, but as of today, it&#x27;s still a great deal!</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Btw, both LED and UV lamps emit UV-A, not the harmful UV-B, light.  </li>
            <li>I painted one hand and went to put my hand under the light</li>
            <li>This light works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also about 50% lighter than the UV light I had.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a UV curing light which did the job</li>
            <li>Important to me...</li>
            <li>I heard of this light off a nail blogger website.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel like you have to bend your thumb backwards to get into the light.  </li>
            <li>All five fingers fit inside at one time.</li>
            <li>The price of the lamp is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I Decided to upgrade from a UV light to use with my gelish polish.</li>
            <li>, 30 being default, you just put your hand/foot in and the light turns on automatically and the countdown begins.</li>
            <li>The light turns off automatically.</li>
            <li>It cured my cheap off brand LED based &amp;#34;Smart Gel&amp;#34; and some of my cheap UV gels from eBay that DID NOT say that it&#x27;s LED curable.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>last observation:  This thing is HUGE!!!</li>
            <li>like there is a new vendor for this product, resulting in better description here on Amazon, and sounds like better instructions with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>like there is a new vendor for this product, resulting in better description here on Amazon, and sounds like better instructions with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I especially like how the light turns on and the 30 second timer starts just by inserting my hand under the light - great for when you&#x27;re doing your own nails.</li>
            <li>(just get cheap nail practice wheels, which are also good for trying custom mixed colors &amp; glitter effects etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very large unit, but I can fit my entire foot in to do my own pedicures too!  </li>
            <li>I started doing my own gel/shellac mani&#x27;s using the Thermal Spa double hand 36W UV lamp, which is a great lamp which I finally gave away along with my CND Shellac polishes.  </li>
            <li>Also love that my whole hand fits under the lights without having to contort my fingers into a pretzel shape (i.e. no need to do thumbs separately - &amp;#34;aint</li>
            <li>LED/UV Gel polish your nails and paint reg polish over the top and it really lasts.</li>
            <li>This light is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lamp.</li>
            <li>Not big enough for both hands/feet which is fine since if you&#x27;re doing your own nails you can only do one hand/foot at a time anyway for best results.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Cures nails quickly.</li>
            <li>The next best thing next to going to the salon!</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no reason to purchase a higher priced lamp, this one does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>Because it dries the gel polish so quickly</li>
            <li>lucky that my nail dryer broke within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Works really well,  toes foot easily and you can spread your fingers out.  </li>
            <li>gel paint fast and easily.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I switched from UV and this light works really well.</li>
            <li>This light works very well.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m going to tell a story on myself that all you 20 or 30 somethings will laugh or roll your eyes over.  </li>
            <li>but it is not as good as I expected based off of the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>For the price of this one, to me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Love this so far.</li>
            <li>Love my nail lamp so far.</li>
            <li>So far my 14yr daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on so many levels with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Although the manual is poorly written, and the timer function is a bit wacky, this unit works great.  </li>
            <li>If you need more curing time just press the light button and it starts, or you can pull your hand/foot out and put it back in.</li>
            <li>I hope this machine don&#x27;t die on me after 2-3 months, since I&#x27;m only using it for fun because I just like to do my own nail.</li>
            <li>So, as a nail tech, I am now using a UV light for Shellac, so I can be sure I&#x27;m giving my clients a proper cure.</li>
            <li>So far, the lamp has more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the 30 seconds over the 3 minutes my other light took!</li>
            <li>This baby is FAST, REAL REAL FAST!</li>
            <li>So my hunch was right</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Received this Led lamp and used it right away for a gel nail mani.</li>
            <li>I eventually chose this light based on the great reviews, the size is large enough for my entire hand or foot and</li>
            <li>The crescent shape makes it easy to fit all 5 fingers in at once with extra room.  </li>
            <li>Large size can fit whole hand.  </li>
            <li>The fact that its actually a cute little machine is the cherry on top.</li>
            <li>You may want to use a few more seconds than the instructions state, about 15 more seconds.</li>
            <li>The delivery was super, duper fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>The price was also very reasonable for an 18watt LED lamp</li>
            <li>I originally bought a much smaller LED light that I couldn&#x27;t get all my fingers in.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will pay more for a quality lamp.</li>
            <li>I use LED gel polishes and cure 30 seconds between coats and 60 seconds on final coat to be sure it is fully cured.</li>
            <li>The cure time is so much shorter!  </li>
            <li>wide, which is actually nice because you can spread your fingers out while drying.  </li>
            <li>funny how the product stopped working at 30 days</li>
            <li>nobody got time for that&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>There is more than enough room to put one hand in at a time.</li>
            <li>and I am able the cure the thumb along with the rest of the fingers at the same time.</li>
            <li>but, this product did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>do recommend the instructions to be edited for English users - they make no sense at all in most places.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for only $40 and free shipping!</li>
            <li>Since I can do my whole hand at once, I finished a color change in around 10 minutes - including the time it took to paint my nails!</li>
            <li>Love that it has multiple settings - on, off and auto.</li>
            <li>So good that I had to show them off to my teenager and husband (who could really care less).  </li>
            <li>This means that once my nails are clean, prepped and ready to go, I can do a complete gel manicure in about five minutes!</li>
            <li>This my first LED GEL nail lamp with economic cost.</li>
            <li>It is pretty basic 30-60-90 timer and sensor light</li>
            <li>Also, I have fairly large hands</li>
            <li>My clients like the large size of it</li>
            <li>This lamp easily fits your whole hand or foot with plenty of extra room.</li>
            <li>It also has a large opening so plenty of space for your whole hand.</li>
            <li>Also important, large enough for whole hand incl thumbs.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a reasonably priced LED lamp that would cure ALL 5 FINGERS AT ONCE.  </li>
            <li>This will turn the unit  on and the time light will be red.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product cures the gel very well.</li>
            <li>Cures fast.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re ready to cure your nails, you just put your hand in.</li>
            <li>MUCH faster than the UV</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>Fits whole hand with room to spare.</li>
            <li>I used to do two minutes per coat of gel polish, so it basically took me 24 minutes of sitting under the UV light compared to 3 minutes total for the LED.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with bio weed nail polish.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A FAST LED CURING LAMP</li>
            <li>I really like the shape of this, too.  </li>
            <li>Intermixing fingers, you can fit both hands in it at the same time (snugly).  </li>
            <li>I had a regular uv light</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t a problem really, just my opinion though.</li>
            <li>Much easier to handle and as for storage it does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li>You can do one whole hand at a time and it cures the gels in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It works fast and cures very well.</li>
            <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for CND Shellac polish, because per their website, their polish only cures under a UV light, so this one looks like it works to cure their polish,but they say otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Works well, dries so much faster than UV.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lamp with sensationail products and it cured the polish so fast</li>
            <li>When I started researching LED lamps, I had difficulty finding out what the differences were, and what was ultimately needed to cure my gel polishes completely and safely.  </li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know, your Gelish polish will have a &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; layer after each cure, it&#x27;s normal!</li>
            <li>No more remembering how many times you pushed the 30 second light timer!</li>
            <li>This light is excellent and significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li>It is a rather large unit and I&#x27;ve had a pretty hard time finding a travel case is suitable for my polishes, accessories AND this lamp...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is plenty big enough for your whole hand and the curvature is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I used to have a UV nail light and it would take me about an hour to do my nails because I had to put my hand in for so long each layer.</li>
            <li>Instructions could be a little more explanation, but customer user reviews were very helpful in that area.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy, coming in at about $20 less than any other vendor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to this from a UV light and cut my time to 1/4 of what it was taking to dry my nails.  </li>
            <li>I have a better quality LED Lamp than my local nail salons, who can only do 4 fingers at once!  </li>
            <li>also love the fact that it works with European voltages with only an adapter-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super big</li>
            <li>Decent price too.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This works like the high priced high end lights without the additional cost.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be way better than the little one.  </li>
            <li>I did a gel manicure today and the light performed as expected.</li>
            <li>Its big enough for your whole hand or toes to fit in, turns on as soon as you put your hand in it.</li>
            <li>always worth a try on a sample nail wheel if you&#x27;re switching from UV lamps to LED as I am, because some are dual without being labelled as such.</li>
            <li>The wave of the future.&lt;br /&gt;One problem though,  even after recommended 60 to 120 seconds it still is not hard on the surface.</li>
            <li>The new Amazon description appears to have eliminated any references to UV lights.  </li>
            <li>The new Amazon description appears to have eliminated any references to UV lights.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from this seller again because when I purchase new things.</li>
            <li>Just remove with acetone free remover if you like to change the color until you&#x27;re ready to soak off the gel nails in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>(I have pretty big hands.)  </li>
            <li>It cures all 5 fingers at once -- which is much better than the small units that require separate curing for thumbs.</li>
            <li>My nails now look professionally done all the time at a fraction of the cost!  </li>
            <li>I bought some bioseaweed gel polish (highly recommend) and this little light did the trick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on the LED gels that were intended for this lamp, and holy smokes, these things dry FAST!!  </li>
            <li>Actually, more like the size of half a 9\\&quot; layer cake!!  </li>
            <li>I paid more than this locally for a very small, basic light.</li>
            <li>Normal UV lamps are 320-400 nm, broad spectrum.  </li>
            <li>It is wide to fit entire hand.</li>
            <li>Nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li>It is a professional gel manicure style lamp.</li>
            <li>This has longer times then the professional grade ones.</li>
            <li>I know others who also have used this one and have had complete satisfaction as well.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s described to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy bulky lamp like my 54 watt UV lamp, and it&#x27;s not as bulky either.</li>
            <li>My nails don&#x27;t last a week before peeling off, I don&#x27;t think the lights are powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>It works as good as the expensive ones at the salon.</li>
            <li>Enough LEDs and right power/wave length light to 30 sec cure any polish, top or base coats rated as LED or dual LED/UV (did not cure my UV only top coat, which I expected but worth a try).</li>
            <li>This one is solid and of high quality.  </li>
            <li>LED lamps use UV light, just in a specific range, concentrating the energy just to the wavelength actively curing the product, reducing exposure time and overall wavelengths.  </li>
            <li>You can do whole hand if you are careful.</li>
            <li>Dry fast and quiet.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased one from my local beauty supply store and it was so small.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this lamp is that it has a sensor and turns on automatically when the person puts their hand in which is great, but sometimes it turns on again after it cures, and their hand is just sitting there, so I have to turn it off manually because I don&#x27;t want it to cure twice because it&#x27;s bad for the polish.</li>
            <li>I have used this a few times and it seems to be working very well!</li>
            <li>Very lightweight even with the overall size being larger than some other lamps.  </li>
            <li>I was anxious to use this item, so when it came in I opened it right away.</li>
            <li>this one is weak, it doesn&#x27;t cure well, the color chip faster than a stronger uv light that i am using now.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> love this lamp!</li>
            <li> will order more from this seller!</li>
            <li> Have now become my own manicurist.</li>
            <li> I do my own \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; manicures at home using the Gelish products.</li>
            <li> Nice machine.  </li>
            <li> This is kind of neat if you&#x27;re doing your feet on the floor</li>
            <li> I had to figure out much of it on my own.</li>
            <li> Nice and roomy, no need to cure the thumb separately.</li>
            <li> but would have loved to have been able to put both hands in at one time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use very nice enjoy!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in great condition and is a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Gelaze is by far the BEST gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if there was more colors to choose form.</li>
            <li> Works 100 times better than UV lamp I own.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Great value and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I started doing my own gelcolor manicures at home and wanted a good light, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $350 for the OPI light.</li>
            <li> your light is working!</li>
            <li> This nail lamp is just OK.  </li>
            <li> What I love about it is that you can set it on an automatic mode.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to place all of my fingers inside with no issues.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li> Better than expcted.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and need more practice.</li>
            <li> Most LED gel polishes cure at 385 or 400.  </li>
            <li> No lights on top or inside the machine would turn on.</li>
            <li> Love this light!</li>
            <li> I love this lamp.</li>
            <li> Why pay more.</li>
            <li> Love this light!  </li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li> I just love this lamp.</li>
            <li> One cannot ask for more than that!&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> The shape makes sure all nails get processed correctly instead of the four fingers and then thumb separately.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> I like it much more than the 12 Watt version I used to have.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> With the top coat I used 60 seconds just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I want it to be in perfect condition regardless if it&#x27;s just the box outside.</li>
            <li> so it cures better.  </li>
            <li> The label on top &amp;#34;LED/UV&amp;#34; is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> No instructions were enclosed, but was able to figure how to operate the lamp.  </li>
            <li> I love this LED lamp, it&#x27;s gives you the option to automatically come on when you place your hand inside.</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy for me!!</li>
            <li> While the lamp worked and I got okay end results, I was hoping to shorten this time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super glad I did.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret this purchase :)</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use with more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> So far so good working with all kind of brand name gel products.</li>
            <li> Exceptional fast service!</li>
            <li> This LED lamp is so much better than the UV light I was using before.  </li>
            <li> But most important is #2.</li>
            <li> I love having timer settings or the option to keep the light on.</li>
            <li> What I love about the light is that it is sort of automatic.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to stay with UV because it will cure EVERY gel type polish, but I also loved the lower curing time of LED.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good one but, didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> This nail light works great and is super fast!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The curved design makes it compact and easy to transport.</li>
            <li> No other complaints, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have just switched to gel polish and have to admit that it is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> For the money, it works fine</li>
            <li> I plugged the lamp in and it seemed to be working fine (for about 30 seconds).</li>
            <li> The instructions are a bit odd, seemed to be giving instructions for a UV lamp not an LED, nonetheless, I am so very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They were quick, responsive and had a personality!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with the light CND shellac polishes yet.</li>
            <li> I had been throwing away a bunch of boxes and thought that since it was so light, I must have thrown the darn thing away.  </li>
            <li> I kicked myself for a bit and then ordered this light.  </li>
            <li> I can spread my fingers out in this light.</li>
            <li> A great value for the final product.</li>
            <li> Also, it feels extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a big nail machine and this is great.</li>
            <li> The light turns on automatically and the timer is set for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> --this lamp will NOT work with products that require a UV light.  </li>
            <li> This will easily fit both hands in it.  </li>
            <li> The price has varied in the few times I&#x27;ve checked this product since buying it, but as of today, it&#x27;s still a great deal!</li>
            <li> The price has varied in the few times I&#x27;ve checked this product since buying it, but as of today, it&#x27;s still a great deal!</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Btw, both LED and UV lamps emit UV-A, not the harmful UV-B, light.  </li>
            <li> I painted one hand and went to put my hand under the light</li>
            <li> This light works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also about 50% lighter than the UV light I had.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a UV curing light which did the job</li>
            <li> Important to me...</li>
            <li> I heard of this light off a nail blogger website.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel like you have to bend your thumb backwards to get into the light.  </li>
            <li> All five fingers fit inside at one time.</li>
            <li> The price of the lamp is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I Decided to upgrade from a UV light to use with my gelish polish.</li>
            <li> , 30 being default, you just put your hand/foot in and the light turns on automatically and the countdown begins.</li>
            <li> The light turns off automatically.</li>
            <li> It cured my cheap off brand LED based &amp;#34;Smart Gel&amp;#34; and some of my cheap UV gels from eBay that DID NOT say that it&#x27;s LED curable.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> last observation:  This thing is HUGE!!!</li>
            <li> like there is a new vendor for this product, resulting in better description here on Amazon, and sounds like better instructions with the packaging.  </li>

            <li> I especially like how the light turns on and the 30 second timer starts just by inserting my hand under the light - great for when you&#x27;re doing your own nails.</li>
            <li> (just get cheap nail practice wheels, which are also good for trying custom mixed colors &amp; glitter effects etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very large unit, but I can fit my entire foot in to do my own pedicures too!  </li>
            <li> I started doing my own gel/shellac mani&#x27;s using the Thermal Spa double hand 36W UV lamp, which is a great lamp which I finally gave away along with my CND Shellac polishes.  </li>
            <li> Also love that my whole hand fits under the lights without having to contort my fingers into a pretzel shape (i.e. no need to do thumbs separately - &amp;#34;aint</li>
            <li> LED/UV Gel polish your nails and paint reg polish over the top and it really lasts.</li>
            <li> This light is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lamp.</li>
            <li> Not big enough for both hands/feet which is fine since if you&#x27;re doing your own nails you can only do one hand/foot at a time anyway for best results.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Cures nails quickly.</li>
            <li> The next best thing next to going to the salon!</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no reason to purchase a higher priced lamp, this one does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> Because it dries the gel polish so quickly</li>
            <li> lucky that my nail dryer broke within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works really well,  toes foot easily and you can spread your fingers out.  </li>
            <li> gel paint fast and easily.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I switched from UV and this light works really well.</li>
            <li> This light works very well.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to tell a story on myself that all you 20 or 30 somethings will laugh or roll your eyes over.  </li>
            <li> but it is not as good as I expected based off of the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> For the price of this one, to me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this so far.</li>
            <li> Love my nail lamp so far.</li>
            <li> So far my 14yr daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on so many levels with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Although the manual is poorly written, and the timer function is a bit wacky, this unit works great.  </li>
            <li> If you need more curing time just press the light button and it starts, or you can pull your hand/foot out and put it back in.</li>
            <li> I hope this machine don&#x27;t die on me after 2-3 months, since I&#x27;m only using it for fun because I just like to do my own nail.</li>
            <li> So, as a nail tech, I am now using a UV light for Shellac, so I can be sure I&#x27;m giving my clients a proper cure.</li>
            <li> So far, the lamp has more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the 30 seconds over the 3 minutes my other light took!</li>
            <li> This baby is FAST, REAL REAL FAST!</li>
            <li> So my hunch was right</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Received this Led lamp and used it right away for a gel nail mani.</li>
            <li> I eventually chose this light based on the great reviews, the size is large enough for my entire hand or foot and</li>
            <li> The crescent shape makes it easy to fit all 5 fingers in at once with extra room.  </li>
            <li> Large size can fit whole hand.  </li>
            <li> The fact that its actually a cute little machine is the cherry on top.</li>
            <li> You may want to use a few more seconds than the instructions state, about 15 more seconds.</li>
            <li> The delivery was super, duper fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast.</li>
            <li> The price was also very reasonable for an 18watt LED lamp</li>
            <li> I originally bought a much smaller LED light that I couldn&#x27;t get all my fingers in.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will pay more for a quality lamp.</li>
            <li> I use LED gel polishes and cure 30 seconds between coats and 60 seconds on final coat to be sure it is fully cured.</li>
            <li> The cure time is so much shorter!  </li>
            <li> wide, which is actually nice because you can spread your fingers out while drying.  </li>
            <li> funny how the product stopped working at 30 days</li>
            <li> nobody got time for that&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> There is more than enough room to put one hand in at a time.</li>
            <li> and I am able the cure the thumb along with the rest of the fingers at the same time.</li>
            <li> but, this product did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> do recommend the instructions to be edited for English users - they make no sense at all in most places.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for only $40 and free shipping!</li>
            <li> Since I can do my whole hand at once, I finished a color change in around 10 minutes - including the time it took to paint my nails!</li>
            <li> Love that it has multiple settings - on, off and auto.</li>
            <li> So good that I had to show them off to my teenager and husband (who could really care less).  </li>
            <li> This means that once my nails are clean, prepped and ready to go, I can do a complete gel manicure in about five minutes!</li>
            <li> This my first LED GEL nail lamp with economic cost.</li>
            <li> It is pretty basic 30-60-90 timer and sensor light</li>
            <li> Also, I have fairly large hands</li>
            <li> My clients like the large size of it</li>
            <li> This lamp easily fits your whole hand or foot with plenty of extra room.</li>
            <li> It also has a large opening so plenty of space for your whole hand.</li>
            <li> Also important, large enough for whole hand incl thumbs.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced LED lamp that would cure ALL 5 FINGERS AT ONCE.  </li>
            <li> This will turn the unit  on and the time light will be red.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product cures the gel very well.</li>
            <li> Cures fast.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re ready to cure your nails, you just put your hand in.</li>
            <li> MUCH faster than the UV</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> Fits whole hand with room to spare.</li>
            <li> I used to do two minutes per coat of gel polish, so it basically took me 24 minutes of sitting under the UV light compared to 3 minutes total for the LED.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with bio weed nail polish.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A FAST LED CURING LAMP</li>
            <li> I really like the shape of this, too.  </li>
            <li> Intermixing fingers, you can fit both hands in it at the same time (snugly).  </li>
            <li> I had a regular uv light</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a problem really, just my opinion though.</li>
            <li> Much easier to handle and as for storage it does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> You can do one whole hand at a time and it cures the gels in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It works fast and cures very well.</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for CND Shellac polish, because per their website, their polish only cures under a UV light, so this one looks like it works to cure their polish,but they say otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Works well, dries so much faster than UV.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lamp with sensationail products and it cured the polish so fast</li>
            <li> When I started researching LED lamps, I had difficulty finding out what the differences were, and what was ultimately needed to cure my gel polishes completely and safely.  </li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know, your Gelish polish will have a &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; layer after each cure, it&#x27;s normal!</li>
            <li> No more remembering how many times you pushed the 30 second light timer!</li>
            <li> This light is excellent and significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a rather large unit and I&#x27;ve had a pretty hard time finding a travel case is suitable for my polishes, accessories AND this lamp...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is plenty big enough for your whole hand and the curvature is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I used to have a UV nail light and it would take me about an hour to do my nails because I had to put my hand in for so long each layer.</li>
            <li> Instructions could be a little more explanation, but customer user reviews were very helpful in that area.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy, coming in at about $20 less than any other vendor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to this from a UV light and cut my time to 1/4 of what it was taking to dry my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have a better quality LED Lamp than my local nail salons, who can only do 4 fingers at once!  </li>
            <li> also love the fact that it works with European voltages with only an adapter-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super big</li>
            <li> Decent price too.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This works like the high priced high end lights without the additional cost.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be way better than the little one.  </li>
            <li> I did a gel manicure today and the light performed as expected.</li>
            <li> Its big enough for your whole hand or toes to fit in, turns on as soon as you put your hand in it.</li>
            <li> always worth a try on a sample nail wheel if you&#x27;re switching from UV lamps to LED as I am, because some are dual without being labelled as such.</li>
            <li> The wave of the future.&lt;br /&gt;One problem though,  even after recommended 60 to 120 seconds it still is not hard on the surface.</li>
            <li> The new Amazon description appears to have eliminated any references to UV lights.  </li>
            <li> The new Amazon description appears to have eliminated any references to UV lights.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from this seller again because when I purchase new things.</li>
            <li> Just remove with acetone free remover if you like to change the color until you&#x27;re ready to soak off the gel nails in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> (I have pretty big hands.)  </li>
            <li> It cures all 5 fingers at once -- which is much better than the small units that require separate curing for thumbs.</li>
            <li> My nails now look professionally done all the time at a fraction of the cost!  </li>
            <li> I bought some bioseaweed gel polish (highly recommend) and this little light did the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on the LED gels that were intended for this lamp, and holy smokes, these things dry FAST!!  </li>
            <li> Actually, more like the size of half a 9\\&quot; layer cake!!  </li>
            <li> I paid more than this locally for a very small, basic light.</li>
            <li> Normal UV lamps are 320-400 nm, broad spectrum.  </li>
            <li> It is wide to fit entire hand.</li>
            <li> Nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> It is a professional gel manicure style lamp.</li>
            <li> This has longer times then the professional grade ones.</li>
            <li> I know others who also have used this one and have had complete satisfaction as well.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s described to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy bulky lamp like my 54 watt UV lamp, and it&#x27;s not as bulky either.</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t last a week before peeling off, I don&#x27;t think the lights are powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> It works as good as the expensive ones at the salon.</li>
            <li> Enough LEDs and right power/wave length light to 30 sec cure any polish, top or base coats rated as LED or dual LED/UV (did not cure my UV only top coat, which I expected but worth a try).</li>
            <li> This one is solid and of high quality.  </li>
            <li> LED lamps use UV light, just in a specific range, concentrating the energy just to the wavelength actively curing the product, reducing exposure time and overall wavelengths.  </li>
            <li> You can do whole hand if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Dry fast and quiet.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased one from my local beauty supply store and it was so small.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this lamp is that it has a sensor and turns on automatically when the person puts their hand in which is great, but sometimes it turns on again after it cures, and their hand is just sitting there, so I have to turn it off manually because I don&#x27;t want it to cure twice because it&#x27;s bad for the polish.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it seems to be working very well!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight even with the overall size being larger than some other lamps.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to use this item, so when it came in I opened it right away.</li>
            <li> this one is weak, it doesn&#x27;t cure well, the color chip faster than a stronger uv light that i am using now.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the description touts all the benefits of NOT having any UV lights (long lasting bulbs, safer for the skin, quicker curing times...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these lamps last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy because I really did love this lamp.  </li>
            <li> but I do know LED lights last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The nails came out very shiny and hard.</li>
            <li> and I can set different timer settings in 30 sec increments.  </li>
            <li> It is about a foot long and 6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had a minor problem with my lamp.</li>
            <li> I spent countless hours researching LED lights.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal or what I need to do to have it turn on automatically all the time.  </li>
            <li> It had no problem curing my nails and took little time to dry completely.</li>
            <li> For one, because the other lamps on Amazon that look JUST like this one were LED only.  </li>
            <li> Some polishes don&#x27;t state if they are LED/UV dual ... or only one or the other, but</li>
            <li> ; switches... one constant and other on timer.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that sometimes when I insert my hand the lamp turns on automatically and at other times I have to hit the timer button.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a regular UV lamp with the long bulb that I purchased on EBay.</li>
            <li> only the little LED dot lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> No fumbling around with buttons when you have wet nails.</li>
            <li> Wide opening.</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> I used this with Gelish nail polish and everything from base coat, polish, &amp; top coat dried completely in 30 seconds (each coat) as recommended.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for shipping from seller because it came faster then the expected deliver date.</li>
            <li> I like darker colors (red) and use 30 sec for the base, 60 for each color coat (2) and 30 for the top coat.</li>
            <li> It lit up but not sure if it would even work properly since part if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> after uv curing to get hard enough to work with w/o smudging surface.  </li>
            <li> This gets the job done, just not sure of how long nails should cure.</li>
            <li> For my profession I can&#x27;t really wear polish or fake finger nails</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> So for an average polish, that would be 4 layers (base coat, 2 color coats and a top coat) done in 4 areas (fingers of each hand and thumbs separately).</li>
            <li> When you plug it in it lights up with &amp;#34;30 seconds&amp;#34;, you just place your fingers in and it counts down to 0.  </li>
            <li> It cut down on the time to set my nails.</li>
            <li> With setting I, when you put your hand inside, it turns on and the timer counts down and turns off so you don&#x27;t need to think about anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading EVERY review post on both UV and LED I narrowed my search down to two Vogue brand lights.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to reach or bend down.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried since this one is quite a bit cheaper than other LED&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> In other words, they were written in REALLY bad English by the Chinese manufacturer, and offered no clues as to whether this product worked with UV reactive products, such as IBD.  </li>
            <li> I decided all those benefits of LED made sense, and I didn&#x27;t want to constantly subject my hands to UV</li>
            <li> Cures My Gel Polish in 30 seconds or less.  </li>
            <li> Takes a lot less time to do nails now.  </li>
            <li> Although I had to cure each hand separately the curing time was still less than when I used my UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Even my dark &amp;#34;Plum and Done&amp;#34; color dried to perfection.  </li>
            <li> I had hard time to dry my naiks</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago, and I have used it about 12-15 times.</li>
            <li> im not going to waste my money in packaging and returning it.</li>
            <li> In fact, the polish peels off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> That just seemed excessive to me.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a small unit.  </li>
            <li> It worked alright, but was small (had to do thumbs separately) and took 2 minutes per layer to cure.</li>
            <li> I use it for hard gels as well as shellac manicures.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused because it does say LED on-line</li>
            <li> I thought I would still use them, but 2 minutes to cure each coat is so SLOW compared to the LED that I loathe using UV.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Plus I am not getting all that unhealthy UV damage.  </li>
            <li> I found the little one!!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested my IBD products that ARE UV reactive on a fake nail, and it did NOT set.  </li>
            <li> I think I am just doing something wrong</li>
            <li> I use this Vogue LED lamp to cure my OPI GelColor, Harmony Gelish polish and Structure, IBD Just Gel, TruGel EZ Flow polishes as well as a couple random LuckyStar, Ms Kieko and Mabel&#x27;s Gels polishes.  </li>
            <li> so your hand isn&#x27;t all squished up inside in some weird way</li>
            <li> I am not easily impressed</li>
            <li> With just a 3 months warranty, its almost as if the manufacturer expects it to fail.</li>
            <li> I have tested out and it worked but unable to tell if all the lights work because I don&#x27;t want to go blind looking into the lights when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the quality and performance.</li>
            <li> all products companies cover their ass to avoid stupid frivolous lawsuits like in houston;&lt;br /&gt;see motion this week.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a base coat and it lasts the longest.  </li>
            <li> No doing thumbs separately .. hate that.</li>
            <li> it - you will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced LED lamp that would cure ALL 5 FINGERS AT ONCE.  It wasn&#x27;t easy to find.  This one is solid and of high quality.  When you plug it in it lights up with &amp;#34;30 seconds&amp;#34;, you just place your fingers in and it counts down to 0.  You remove your fingers, apply another coat, place your fingers inside and it senses your fingers are there and it begins the countdown again.  It&#x27;s a very large unit, but I can fit my entire foot in to do my own pedicures too!  Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  I have a better quality LED Lamp than my local nail salons, who can only do 4 fingers at once!  You only need 30 seconds per coat.  Note:  Gelaze is by far the BEST gel polish.  You don&#x27;t need a base coat and it lasts the longest.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Also has the best color intensity.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if there was more colors to choose form.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I have used it twice.  It does cure OPI and Sensational polishes in 30 secs.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with the light CND shellac polishes yet.</li>
            <li> I have just switched to gel polish and have to admit that it is pretty amazing.  I originally bought a much smaller LED light that I couldn&#x27;t get all my fingers in.  I found that I would bump my thumb or pinky and have to do that finger all over. (I have pretty big hands.)  Now I&#x27;m going to tell a story on myself that all you 20 or 30 somethings will laugh or roll your eyes over.  After using that first small lamp for one manicure, I couldn&#x27;t find it.  I had been throwing away a bunch of boxes and thought that since it was so light, I must have thrown the darn thing away.  I kicked myself for a bit and then ordered this light.  It turned out to be way better than the little one.  Then, well...you guessed it--I found the little one!!!!  So I am now the proud owner of two LED lights.  Oh well, I guess I have a backup!!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the greatest thing since sliced bread</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s agreat product!  Works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly once you understand the on/off switch.  There are three horizontal marks on the switch: I,0,II.&lt;br /&gt;Press the on-off switch so I shows.  This will turn the unit  on and the time light will be red. Now you can select which timer you want.  I have not tried II yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the directions there is a a check above RoHS. Does anyone know what this means?</li>
            <li> I can spread my fingers out in this light. I also like the timer.</li>
            <li> Exceptional fast service! Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves it!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Nails look professionally done. They do last up to 2 weeks. Highly Recommend.  I used 60 min on the timer, however did not try at 30.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! This lamp is perfect! It cures my Gelish in 30 seconds. I have absolutely no complaints about it. I can&#x27;t praise it enough! It is a rather large unit and I&#x27;ve had a pretty hard time finding a travel case is suitable for my polishes, accessories AND this lamp...I think I finally found one! It&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way so I will update upon delivery! The lamp is awesome! Great professional lamp for an awesome price! You will not regret this purchase!  JUST DO IT!!!</li>
            <li> This product cures the gel very well. It is a professional gel manicure style lamp. A great value for the final product. Use with OPI and Gelish nail polish: [[ASIN:B00468KRH8 Harmony Gelish Gel Cleanser - 120ml - 01250]]. It is a great way to save money as opposed to spending it on the salon. You may want to use a few more seconds than the instructions state, about 15 more seconds. No other complaints, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great! I did a gel manicure today and the light performed as expected. For those who don&#x27;t know, your Gelish polish will have a &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; layer after each cure, it&#x27;s normal! the only time you wipe it off is after the &amp;#34;Top it Off&amp;#34; top coat! your light is working! Great value and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This LED Lamp works great! I received it as a Christmas gift and have used it several times with Gelish Nail Polish.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> This nail lamp is just OK.  For the money, it works fine but it is not as good as I expected based off of the reviews on here.  My nails don&#x27;t last a week before peeling off, I don&#x27;t think the lights are powerful enough.  Also, it feels extremely cheap.  Next time I will pay more for a quality lamp.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Opi and gelish, but it nener work. Have tried 3 times, each time 5+ minutes for each layer, but my nails peel off when I work on my computer after almost 3 hours the final layer cured. It just does not work！</li>
            <li> This my first LED GEL nail lamp with economic cost. This work like a charm. Dry fast and quiet. So far so good working with all kind of brand name gel products. Recommend.</li>
            <li> This lamp works perfectly!!  Very lightweight even with the overall size being larger than some other lamps.  The crescent shape makes it easy to fit all 5 fingers in at once with extra room.  I LOVE the automatic sensor that starts the lamp and timer!!  Very happy with this purchase and hope that it continues to work this well.  I use LED gel polishes and cure 30 seconds between coats and 60 seconds on final coat to be sure it is fully cured.</li>
            <li> Perfect! So happy with this!!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for doing gel nails. I wanted a big nail machine and this is great. You can do whole hand if you are careful. Works great for what I wanted it for. Came is great time. Easy to use very nice enjoy!</li>
            <li> Works great. Cures fast. It is wide to fit entire hand. Highly recommend. Great price.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own gelcolor manicures at home and wanted a good light, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $350 for the OPI light. That just seemed excessive to me. This light is excellent and significantly less expensive. What I love about it is that you can set it on an automatic mode. When you&#x27;re ready to cure your nails, you just put your hand in. The light turns on automatically and the timer is set for 30 seconds. No fumbling around with buttons when you have wet nails. Also, I have fairly large hands and I&#x27;m able to place all of my fingers inside with no issues. The LEDs are nice and bright and cure all of my nails perfectly. Now I can change my polish whenever I want which saves me a fortune on manicures.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done, just not sure of how long nails should cure. This has longer times then the professional grade ones. It will do for now!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy, coming in at about $20 less than any other vendor on Amazon.  When considering this product, I wondered about the product description saying it was an 18w \\&quot;LED UV\\&quot; Nail drier.  There ARE lamps out there with both LED *and* UV lights in it, designed to work with ALL the products out there that require curing--UV, LED, and Shellac--but I suspected when I ordered this that it was solely an LED lamp.  Why?  For one, because the other lamps on Amazon that look JUST like this one were LED only.  Secondly, the description touts all the benefits of NOT having any UV lights (long lasting bulbs, safer for the skin, quicker curing times...etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the chance and ordered, as I *was* looking for a lamp that was solely LED.  I decided all those benefits of LED made sense, and I didn&#x27;t want to constantly subject my hands to UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that came with this lamp definitely belong on Engrish.com.  In other words, they were written in REALLY bad English by the Chinese manufacturer, and offered no clues as to whether this product worked with UV reactive products, such as IBD.  Upon inspection, I noted that there are NO UV tube lights in the unit...only the little LED dot lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested my IBD products that ARE UV reactive on a fake nail, and it did NOT set.  So my hunch was right--this lamp will NOT work with products that require a UV light.  This product works only with LED gel products...and according to the instructions, it also works with Shellac products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on the LED gels that were intended for this lamp, and holy smokes, these things dry FAST!!  MUCH faster than the UV lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last observation:  This thing is HUGE!!! It&#x27;s about the length and width of a laptop.  Actually, more like the size of half a 9\\&quot; layer cake!!  This will easily fit both hands in it.  That&#x27;s good for me, but you ought to know that to decide whether it&#x27;s good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  2/6/14--Looks like there is a new vendor for this product, resulting in better description here on Amazon, and sounds like better instructions with the packaging.  The new Amazon description appears to have eliminated any references to UV lights.  The price has varied in the few times I&#x27;ve checked this product since buying it, but as of today, it&#x27;s still a great deal! Still recommended!leased with my purchase.

            <li> Works really well,  toes foot easily and you can spread your fingers out.  Good price.</li>
            <li> This works really well and I like that it&#x27;s UV and I can set different timer settings in 30 sec increments.  The best part is I can get my whole thumb in!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Have now become my own manicurist.</li>
            <li> Love this nail lamp! Cures My Gel Polish in 30 seconds or less.  Automatically turns on when you put your hand in. Fits whole hand with room to spare. No harmful uv rays. I am so glad I chose this one. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago, and I have used it about 12-15 times. It works great! I do my own \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; manicures at home using the Gelish products. I previously used a regular UV lamp with the long bulb that I purchased on EBay. I wanted to upgrade because the cure time with that was over 2-3 mins per coat on the darker colors. The cure time with this is only 30 seconds per coat. It has different pre set times and automatically comes on when you put your hand in. It works as good as the expensive ones at the salon. I would recommend it for the price!!</li>
            <li> this one is weak, it doesn&#x27;t cure well, the color chip faster than a stronger uv light that i am using now.</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m glad she did. It cut down on the time to set my nails. It helped the nail polish last longer too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought this, that it comes on automatically, when you put your hand in it!! Great lamp all the way around. cures everything perfectly.</li>
            <li> This LED lamp is so much better than the UV light I was using before.  The cure time is so much shorter!  I used to do two minutes per coat of gel polish, so it basically took me 24 minutes of sitting under the UV light compared to 3 minutes total for the LED.  Plus I am not getting all that unhealthy UV damage.  I really recommend this product.  Update August, 2016.  It just died.  I&#x27;m very unhappy because I really did love this lamp.  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Better than expcted. Gel nail polish dries in 30 seconds. Easy to operate. Quick delivery. It will pay for itself after three manicures.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic. Works very well with bio weed nail polish. Wide opening. My foot fits in it with no problem.</li>
            <li> I am male, nonfagcrossdresseretc, and I break nails lots of times schlepping luggage into London and Munich and around.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted uv cured epoxy ever since I saw my dentest use it 15 years ago. The wave of the future.&lt;br /&gt;One problem though,  even after recommended 60 to 120 seconds it still is not hard on the surface. It takes much&lt;br /&gt;longer after uv curing to get hard enough to work with w/o smudging surface.  I think I am just doing something wrong&lt;br /&gt;and need more practice. Mayby they just tell you in the instructions to not go over 1 or 2 minutes so as to keep some&lt;br /&gt;from getting sun burn on the fingers... all products companies cover their ass to avoid stupid frivolous lawsuits like in houston;&lt;br /&gt;see motion this week.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with Gelish polishes! 30 second cure time.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the automatic aspect. With setting I, when you put your hand inside, it turns on and the timer counts down and turns off so you don&#x27;t need to think about anything.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it works with European voltages with only an adapter- no converter necessary.&lt;br /&gt;It is plenty big enough for your whole hand and the curvature is very comfortable. Highly recommended product</li>
            <li> When I started researching LED lamps, I had difficulty finding out what the differences were, and what was ultimately needed to cure my gel polishes completely and safely.  The Vogue LED lamp comes with paperwork stating LED wavelength is 385-405 nm.  This is key.  Normal UV lamps are 320-400 nm, broad spectrum.  Most LED gel polishes cure at 385 or 400.  There&#x27;s lots of confusion regarding LED vs UV nail lamps.  LED lamps use UV light, just in a specific range, concentrating the energy just to the wavelength actively curing the product, reducing exposure time and overall wavelengths.  Btw, both LED and UV lamps emit UV-A, not the harmful UV-B, light.  The LED lamp has one &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and two &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; settings.  Clicked &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; it stays on continuously.  In the &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; setting the lamp comes on automatically with my hand going in and turns off after the 30s.  If you hit the timer setting button it runs 60s with one push, 90s with two, and back to 30s with three.  I started doing my own gel/shellac mani&#x27;s using the Thermal Spa double hand 36W UV lamp, which is a great lamp which I finally gave away along with my CND Shellac polishes.  I thought I would still use them, but 2 minutes to cure each coat is so SLOW compared to the LED that I loathe using UV.  I use this Vogue LED lamp to cure my OPI GelColor, Harmony Gelish polish and Structure, IBD Just Gel, TruGel EZ Flow polishes as well as a couple random LuckyStar, Ms Kieko and Mabel&#x27;s Gels polishes.  For all my polishes I use the OPI base/top coats.  They all cure beautifully and so QUICK!!!  Hope this helps you in your purchase of an LED lamp, saving you lots of $$$.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to use this item, so when it came in I opened it right away. I plugged the lamp in and it seemed to be working fine (for about 30 seconds). I painted one hand and went to put my hand under the light and it would not turn on at all. It was plugged in, turned on and I pushed every button on the machine to get it to turn on. Nothing happened. No lights on top or inside the machine would turn on. I guess I got a defected lamp. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  This isn&#x27;t a small unit.  It is about a foot long and 6&amp;#34; wide, which is actually nice because you can spread your fingers out while drying.  Cures nails quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this light! I switched from UV and this light works really well. I do my nails with Gelish and it works great every time!!</li>
            <li> This nail light works great and is super fast! I used to have a UV nail light and it would take me about an hour to do my nails because I had to put my hand in for so long each layer. Now it takes me under 10 minutes! Plus there is room for all fingers! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works 100 times better than UV lamp I own.  Takes a lot less time to do nails now.  Thank you.  Instructions could be a little more explanation, but customer user reviews were very helpful in that area. Would highly recommend. Quality product at good price.</li>
            <li> I love this lamp. It is so easy to use with more bang for your buck. It had no problem curing my nails and took little time to dry completely. UV only lamps take 2 to 3 minutes to cure nails compared to 30 seconds with this LED lamp. With my UV lamp you have to change the 9 watt lights when they age. You will find that the UV lights will begin to take longer than 2 minutes to cure. IT&#x27;s then you know replacements are necessary. You never replace LED lights. Go ahead and buy this one. Why pay more. I know others who also have used this one and have had complete satisfaction as well. There is one issue that I might have later. I don&#x27;t know how long these lamps last but I do know LED lights last a very long time. For the price of this one, to me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This light works like a charm.  I set the timer for 30 seconds and it automatically turns on when of place your hand inside.  I upgraded to this from a UV light and cut my time to 1/4 of what it was taking to dry my nails.  Love this light!  It also has a large opening so plenty of space for your whole hand. The curved design makes it compact and easy to transport. It&#x27;s also about 50% lighter than the UV light I had.  Glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li> if anyone reads the description or headline of the product, notice it states LED. when i opened the box it states &#x27;LED/UV&#x27;... wth... how can it be both??? i try to stay away from UV and use LED only, hence the reason i bought this product..... what made me give it 1 star is the fact that it came with a 30 money back guarantee. funny how the product stopped working at 30 days -_-. im not going to waste my money in packaging and returning it. i just tossed it in the trash. wont be purchasing from this seller..... ever.... again.</li>
            <li> I had a minor problem with my lamp. I contacted customer service and had an immediate response. I would buy again from this company in a minute. They were quick, responsive and had a personality! I give them 5 stars because, #1. I just love this lamp. If you are heading into gel world it is the perfect lamp - size and ease wise. But most important is #2. They back up their products. One cannot ask for more than that!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it - you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this so far. I especially like how the light turns on and the 30 second timer starts just by inserting my hand under the light - great for when you&#x27;re doing your own nails. Also love that my whole hand fits under the lights without having to contort my fingers into a pretzel shape (i.e. no need to do thumbs separately - &amp;#34;aint nobody got time for that&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I had hard time to dry my naiks so I returned.</li>
            <li> The next best thing next to going to the salon! I leave each coat in for 60 seconds. Each manicure lasts for 10-14 days. Has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> Wowza.... This baby is FAST, REAL REAL FAST! I have been using a UV curing light which did the job but I noticed that it was taking longer to cure each coat. I knew this was an indication that the bulbs needed to be replaced. I really wanted to stay with UV because it will cure EVERY gel type polish, but I also loved the lower curing time of LED. After reading EVERY review post on both UV and LED I narrowed my search down to two Vogue brand lights. I eventually chose this light based on the great reviews, the size is large enough for my entire hand or foot and drumroll please...........it automatically turns on once you place your hand inside and automatically shuts off after the correct amount of time chosen. IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A FAST LED CURING LAMP THIS IS THE ONE! There is absolutely no reason to purchase a higher priced lamp, this one does the job beautifully. The instructions are a bit odd, seemed to be giving instructions for a UV lamp not an LED, nonetheless, I am so very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Important to me... Turns on automatically as soon as you insert your hand. Also important, large enough for whole hand incl thumbs. No doing thumbs separately .. hate that. Enough LEDs and right power/wave length light to 30 sec cure any polish, top or base coats rated as LED or dual LED/UV (did not cure my UV only top coat, which I expected but worth a try). Some polishes don&#x27;t state if they are LED/UV dual ... or only one or the other, but always worth a try on a sample nail wheel if you&#x27;re switching from UV lamps to LED as I am, because some are dual without being labelled as such. So if you&#x27;re switching don&#x27;t toss any polish until you try it (just get cheap nail practice wheels, which are also good for trying custom mixed colors &amp; glitter effects etc. Necessary until this industry catches up in color diversity that reg polishes offer, but you can neutral LED/UV Gel polish your nails and paint reg polish over the top and it really lasts. Just remove with acetone free remover if you like to change the color until you&#x27;re ready to soak off the gel nails in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great for all the gel brands I use in my shop! The shape makes sure all nails get processed correctly instead of the four fingers and then thumb separately.</li>
            <li> Bought this and when I tried to use it the START button and the TIMER button didn&#x27;t work. It lit up but not sure if it would even work properly since part if it didn&#x27;t work. No LED timer working.</li>
            <li> Love my nail lamp so far. I was a little confused because it does say LED on-line and it does state LED on the paperwork received for the model number I got, but on the item itself it shows LED/UV. However, I know it&#x27;s LED because of the lights inside; my mom had purchased a UV one and you can see the difference, not to mention the difference it takes to cure the nail polish. So far my 14yr daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I bought some bioseaweed gel polish (highly recommend) and this little light did the trick. It is pretty basic 30-60-90 timer and sensor light but that is all you need to do gel nails at home. There is more than enough room to put one hand in at a time. I heard of this light off a nail blogger website. She described it well...affordable and functional. For my profession I can&#x27;t really wear polish or fake finger nails but we are allowed gel polish. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and, as always, amazon prime shipping is superb!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m a professional and have been using this light for a few weeks without any negative results. I use it for hard gels as well as shellac manicures. My clients like the large size of it and I am able the cure the thumb along with the rest of the fingers at the same time.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this one before my UV lights.  This dries all my Gelish in 30 seconds.  It may be even quicker than that, but I&#x27;ve only tried 30 seconds.  Even my dark &amp;#34;Plum and Done&amp;#34; color dried to perfection.  I wanted the LED system so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about changing bulbs.  I really like the shape of this, too.  You don&#x27;t feel like you have to bend your thumb backwards to get into the light.  I was a little worried since this one is quite a bit cheaper than other LED&#x27;s.  It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.  I had originally purchased one from my local beauty supply store and it was so small.  And didn&#x27;t have a bottom in it!  Not worth it.  This one is great.  It&#x27;s super big so your hand isn&#x27;t all squished up inside in some weird way - you can stretch out all your fingers.  Heck, it&#x27;s so roomy I&#x27;ve even done my feet with the gel polish too!</li>
            <li> This light works very well.  I like it much more than the 12 Watt version I used to have.  It arrived quickly and in great condition and is a pleasure to use.  It cures all 5 fingers at once -- which is much better than the small units that require separate curing for thumbs.</li>
            <li> I spent countless hours researching LED lights. I wanted a good one but, didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. I admit, I was apprehensive purchasing this one because I have never heard of the brand before. I was pleasantly surprised on so many levels with this purchase. The delivery was super, duper fast. I ordered it Friday and it was shipped out on Saturday. Kudos to Bargain Sources for such a speedy delivery. Still though, the box was lighter then I expected so I was still unsure about the product. That was until I used it. Wow, I was impressed. It cured my OPI gel polish in 30 seconds. I am not easily impressed but, this product did exactly what it said it would. I am so pleased. The fact that its actually a cute little machine is the cherry on top. All five fingers fit inside at one time. My gel nails look awesome. So good that I had to show them off to my teenager and husband (who could really care less).  But, like a proud woman I couldn&#x27;t keep the excitement to myself. I still can&#x27;t believe I did them myself at home. The price of the lamp is fantastic. I am going to give this product 5 stars. If you are in the market for a LED lamp, look no further.</li>
            <li> This works really good.</li>
            <li> Nice machine.  I almost sent it back because I didn&#x27;t realize it has two &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switches... one constant and other on timer.</li>
            <li> I paid more than this locally for a very small, basic light. This works like the high priced high end lights without the additional cost. Great product!</li>
            <li> I just got this a couple of months ago. So far it&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s described to be. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Although the manual is poorly written, and the timer function is a bit wacky, this unit works great.  It is bigger than it looks from the photos.  Bought it for Mom as a present and it cures gel paint fast and easily.  Intermixing fingers, you can fit both hands in it at the same time (snugly).  Decent price too.</li>
            <li> I just love this item! I had a regular uv light but this is magical! Absolutely love the 30 seconds over the 3 minutes my other light took! I just love it!</li>
            <li> I Decided to upgrade from a UV light to use with my gelish polish. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This light is fast and easy to use. It fits one hand with plenty of room to spare. I love having timer settings or the option to keep the light on. It has definitely saved me time when I do my nails.</li>
            <li> I received the LED lamp on the estimated delivery date. Not big enough for both hands/feet which is fine since if you&#x27;re doing your own nails you can only do one hand/foot at a time anyway for best results. Because it dries the gel polish so quickly this isn&#x27;t a problem really, just my opinion though. I used this with Gelish nail polish and everything from base coat, polish, &amp; top coat dried completely in 30 seconds (each coat) as recommended. With the top coat I used 60 seconds just to be sure. What I love about the light is that it is sort of automatic. Once the switch at the back is turned on you set the timer (30 secs., 60 secs., 90 secs.), 30 being default, you just put your hand/foot in and the light turns on automatically and the countdown begins. The light turns off automatically. If you need more curing time just press the light button and it starts, or you can pull your hand/foot out and put it back in. This is kind of neat if you&#x27;re doing your feet on the floor you don&#x27;t have to reach or bend down. Just take your foot out then slip it back in for additional curing time. It&#x27;s not a heavy bulky lamp like my 54 watt UV lamp, and it&#x27;s not as bulky either. Much easier to handle and as for storage it does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> Great value- highest wattage for the price.  Large size can fit whole hand.  I especially love the timer flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the instructions to be edited for English users - they make no sense at all in most places.  I had to figure out much of it on my own.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! Works like a charm! You can do one whole hand at a time and it cures the gels in 30 seconds. This means that once my nails are clean, prepped and ready to go, I can do a complete gel manicure in about five minutes!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it seems to be working very well!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this unit. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the quality and performance. In my opinion, this is not a good product. It feels flimsy and doesn’t cure my nails well at all. In fact, the polish peels off after a few hours. I do not recommend this product and will be returning mine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky that my nail dryer broke within 2 weeks. With just a 3 months warranty, its almost as if the manufacturer expects it to fail. Lesson learned: you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Lamp is amazing ! Really happy with this product . Works with bluesky soak off uv led gel nail polishes . Soon as u put your hand in there it turns on automatically . I love it !</li>
            <li> 2 stars for shipping from seller because it came faster then the expected deliver date. The product itself is good, but the box that came with it was damaged at the corner. Looks like it was dropped and then put into a ups box for delivery, hence the ups box was not damage. I have tested out and it worked but unable to tell if all the lights work because I don&#x27;t want to go blind looking into the lights when it&#x27;s on. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from this seller again because when I purchase new things. I want it to be in perfect condition regardless if it&#x27;s just the box outside. I hope this machine don&#x27;t die on me after 2-3 months, since I&#x27;m only using it for fun because I just like to do my own nail.</li>
            <li> Did a great job on the gel nails. Very fast. The nails came out very shiny and hard. The best for the money.</li>
            <li> My nails now look professionally done all the time at a fraction of the cost!  I can definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> love this lamp! It works fast and cures very well. It speeds up my work, super great value! will order more from this seller!</li>
            <li> This lamp works great! Nice and roomy, no need to cure the thumb separately. Although sometimes I have to tell the person to hold the thumb differently so it cures better.  The only problem I have with this lamp is that it has a sensor and turns on automatically when the person puts their hand in which is great, but sometimes it turns on again after it cures, and their hand is just sitting there, so I have to turn it off manually because I don&#x27;t want it to cure twice because it&#x27;s bad for the polish. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lamp. Cures great and everything. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for CND Shellac polish, because per their website, their polish only cures under a UV light, so this one looks like it works to cure their polish,but they say otherwise.  So, as a nail tech, I am now using a UV light for Shellac, so I can be sure I&#x27;m giving my clients a proper cure.</li>
            <li> The lamp is so lightweight, simple to use and inexpensive. The label on top &amp;#34;LED/UV&amp;#34; is a bit misleading. This is an LED lamp; not UV. I use it for my Gelish and TruGel manis. My only big qualm is I wish it had a storage pouch or case to protect the inside. Works well, dries so much faster than UV.</li>
            <li> The article came on time and in good condition.  No instructions were enclosed, but was able to figure how to operate the lamp.  Only problem is that sometimes when I insert my hand the lamp turns on automatically and at other times I have to hit the timer button.  Not sure if this is normal or what I need to do to have it turn on automatically all the time.  Any tips?</li>
            <li> I bought this for only $40 and free shipping! I love this LED lamp, it&#x27;s gives you the option to automatically come on when you place your hand inside. It also have a 30s, 60s, and 90s timer. There is NO UV in this lamp what so ever! It cured my cheap off brand LED based &amp;#34;Smart Gel&amp;#34; and some of my cheap UV gels from eBay that DID NOT say that it&#x27;s LED curable. I will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy for me!! Works very well and easy to use. Its big enough for your whole hand or toes to fit in, turns on as soon as you put your hand in it. Has timer settings 30,60 and 90 seconds. Arrived right on time. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Before this, I had a 6W LED nail lamp. It worked alright, but was small (had to do thumbs separately) and took 2 minutes per layer to cure. So for an average polish, that would be 4 layers (base coat, 2 color coats and a top coat) done in 4 areas (fingers of each hand and thumbs separately). All said and done, it was taking me about 45 minutes to do a polish change.  While the lamp worked and I got okay end results, I was hoping to shorten this time so I shopped around and got this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super glad I did. This works superbly. I like darker colors (red) and use 30 sec for the base, 60 for each color coat (2) and 30 for the top coat. Since I can do my whole hand at once, I finished a color change in around 10 minutes - including the time it took to paint my nails! That&#x27;s amazing! So far, the lamp has more than met my expectations. Love that it has multiple settings - on, off and auto. Off and on are obvious. Auto turns the lamp on automatically when you put your hand in for the number of seconds chosen. You can cycle through 30, 60 and 90 with the touch of a button. No more remembering how many times you pushed the 30 second light timer!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife and she loves it.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase!  I&#x27;ve been using this lamp with sensationail products and it cured the polish so fast and the manicure last 2 weeks plus! I can do an amazing gel manicure in 10 minutes!  This lamp easily fits your whole hand or foot with plenty of extra room. This is really a good one. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase :)</li>
            <li> Received this Led lamp and used it right away for a gel nail mani. This lamp cured my Gelish nail polishes as stated in the instructions. The manicure looks awesome.  Very easy to use but would have loved to have been able to put both hands in at one time.  Although I had to cure each hand separately the curing time was still less than when I used my UV lamp. This lamp is a great addition to Judi&#x27;s home nail emporium. The price was also very reasonable for an 18watt LED lamp</li>
