            <li>Feels amazing.</li>
            <li>All soaps are made with lye and some kind of fat/oil.  </li>
            <li>Love it this soap is doing wonders for my skin</li>
            <li>Most retailers don&#x27;t carry lye soap.</li>
            <li>and I always stop at Amazon to get a better deal</li>
            <li>I have exema and more so seryicis</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>, my nephew also likes it told his mom she better get some.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best bath soap I&#x27;ve ever used since the original Lifebouy was available.</li>
            <li>Rinses easy.  </li>
            <li>Not anymore; Grandma&#x27;s made a difference from the very first bar!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Grandma&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy Grandma&#x27;s Lye Soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the purest soap available at a reasonble price and it cleans well.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li>But yes it gets you clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and cleans my face almost to gently--I kind of thought it being made with lye</li>
            <li>How wonderful it has been the past two years after trying Grandma&#x27;s for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its a mild non scented soap.</li>
            <li>Normally I get the original, but it wasn&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>Scientists don&#x27;t know why it works except that they think the lye somehow is absorbed into the skin?  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now this particular lye soap is still effective in helping to clear any skin rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to smell pretty, and lasts longer, also use baby shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything as gentle and non-drying to my elderly skin.</li>
            <li>I like natural and If i&#x27;m right soap was made of lye and helps with poison ivy why not I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>Its okay, I didnt see any benefits like other reviewers did, clearning up acne etc.</li>
            <li>Will not spend $$$ on products when I can get this for much much less and still love the way my face and body feel.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair soft</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for it&#x27;s normal purpose.  </li>
            <li>it would be a very powerful deep drying cleaner-it&#x27;s the opposite really.</li>
            <li>This soap works just like the old lye soaps of the past, but is more gentle to your skin.</li>
            <li>Even with free shipping I will go back to my local Farm King and save over a dollar a 6oz bar on this soap.</li>
            <li>It not only removed every trace of makeup but left my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so be forewarned if you don&#x27;t want soft hair.</li>
            <li>It is old school flavor</li>
            <li>My skin is to sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>How surprised was I...</li>
            <li>Really helps dry skin</li>
            <li>I purchase for my husband who has very sensitive skin &amp; back acne..</li>
            <li>I ran across an old time use of putting a bar of lye soap between the bed sheets next to your feet to stop leg cramping at night.</li>

            <li> How wonderful it has been the past two years after trying Grandma&#x27;s for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;I have had seborrhea on my face, scalp and hairline that had been nasty for at least 65 years.  The family always called it cradle cap.  At times it got so bad it bled!  Not anymore; Grandma&#x27;s made a difference from the very first bar!  I have 2 1/2 bars on the shelf and wouldn&#x27;t think to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, &#x27;Grandma&#x27;!!!</li>
            <li> Love it this soap is doing wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> This soap works just like the old lye soaps of the past, but is more gentle to your skin. The price is great and it is so convenient to order it online.  Most retailers don&#x27;t carry lye soap.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks I&#x27;m crazy using lye soap; the name alone conjures up images of of a hag in a black pointy hat stirring a cauldron. But I&#x27;m telling you I&#x27;ve never used anything as gentle and non-drying to my elderly skin. I&#x27;ve been using Grandmas brand for a couple of years now. A bar lasts me close to two months of daily showering.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Grandma&#x27;s Lye Soap Bar.Sunrise to Sunset Great results. Happy I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sunrise to Sunset</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for it&#x27;s normal purpose.  I purchased it because a friend was having leg cramps at night disturbing his sleep so as I was doing some research on remedies for leg cramps I ran across an old time use of putting a bar of lye soap between the bed sheets next to your feet to stop leg cramping at night. Scientists don&#x27;t know why it works except that they think the lye somehow is absorbed into the skin?  He claims that it seems to work and he&#x27;s sleeping better without the painful cramping.  I sliced the bar in half and used my half to wash my face. It leaves my skin very soft and cleans my face almost to gently--I kind of thought it being made with lye it would be a very powerful deep drying cleaner-it&#x27;s the opposite really.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. Great for your skin and as a shampoo.  It really makes your hair soft so be forewarned if you don&#x27;t want soft hair. I may have start making this myself. Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;Lye&amp;#34; scare you off, there is none left in the soap, it just turns fat into soap.  All soaps are made with lye and some kind of fat/oil.  (don&#x27;t confuse soap with detergent).</li>
            <li> One of my friends wanted me to try it, so I did. It is old school flavor but I like it.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Really helps dry skin</li>
            <li> I broke out real bad. My skin is to sensitive.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best bath soap I&#x27;ve ever used since the original Lifebouy was available.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Grandma&#x27;s Lye Soap.  I have used it for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for a while and it works great. It helped to reduce my skins sensitivity.</li>
            <li> My niece bought this product for me when I was suffering from hives caused by an allergy to elastic.    This soap is a God-send.  It has cleared my skin and taken away all the pain.    I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you for a great product.    Mary Grim, Sharpsburg, MD</li>
            <li> The person for which I bought this soap told me it definitely helped his serious eczema. It&#x27;s not a miracle soap but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Actually purchased it for fire ant control, but used it to spray avocado tree to get rid of aphids! !</li>
            <li> I rate this soap for product only, not for Amazons price. I have shopped all over the net and I always stop at Amazon to get a better deal and this is one of the times I can&#x27;t. Even with free shipping I will go back to my local Farm King and save over a dollar a 6oz bar on this soap. I have exema and more so seryicis and if you use this lye soap you will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;Eddie</li>
            <li> I remember as a kid my grandmother would make lye soap....real lye soap from hogs and it cleared up any rash that I would get from playing outdoors.  Although it&#x27;s not exactly like my grandmother&#x27;s lye soap it&#x27;s still good.  Now this particular lye soap is still effective in helping to clear any skin rash.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It makes my face feel so soft.  I&#x27;ll be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> I like natural and If i&#x27;m right soap was made of lye and helps with poison ivy why not I&#x27;m a guy don&#x27;t need to smell pretty, and lasts longer, also use baby shampoo, my nephew also likes it told his mom she better get some.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. It&#x27;s the purest soap available at a reasonble price and it cleans well. I regularly rerorder this product.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing. Will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Grandma&#x27;s soap.  Normally I get the original, but it wasn&#x27;t available.  So I tried this one with the goat&#x27;s milk.  Yep.........I like this one too!  Leaves your skin feeling so clean.  Rinses easy.  I recommend all of their products.</li>
            <li> Its okay, I didnt see any benefits like other reviewers did, clearning up acne etc. Its a mild non scented soap. But yes it gets you clean.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I purchase for my husband who has very sensitive skin &amp; back acne.. he loves it.</li>
            <li> For years I have used pricey products to wash my face.....not anymore.  after using this soap for bath I decided to try it on my face.  How surprised was I...dumfounded is the word.  It not only removed every trace of makeup but left my face soft and smooth.  I even got my husband to try it and he loves it too.  Will not spend $$$ on products when I can get this for much much less and still love the way my face and body feel.</li>
