    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great item to have!</li>
            <li>This bonnet is great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I bought this with the intentions of doing hair mask and treatments and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use with the Sebastian Cellophane Laminates.</li>
            <li>This item is great!  </li>
            <li>Great value for the price!</li>
            <li>Fits my Remington pearl ceramic perfectly.</li>
            <li>it fits my blow dryer perfectly</li>
            <li>Great price as well!</li>
            <li>Good buy for me!</li>
            <li>I think the hair bonnet is well made and a great price.</li>
            <li>One thing I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with, is it seems like you get the best air flow and heat</li>
            <li>I have used this for conditioning treatments and it works great.</li>
            <li>I pop it on, hook it to my blow dryer and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>Fits over the rollers perfectly, snugs up nice with the drawstring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I guess this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is as good as your blowdryer is.</li>
            <li>but I could see that being a possibility if you do not have a good blowdryer to attach this item to.</li>
            <li>I suppose the elastic that goes around the dryer nozzle could wear out, but it seems surprisingly well-made for this</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I used it the first time today and found it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite amazing</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the hose were longer.  </li>
            <li>I liked it while it worked but instead of having to replace it every year I think I&#x27;m going to invest in a more durable conditioning cap/hair steamer.</li>
            <li>I love it, easy to use to assemble, portable, recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up fairly evenly, my curlers get nice and hot, and I can even put my makeup on while I&#x27;m waiting for the set.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a better quality one.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s affordable and would repurchase again.  </li>
            <li>It is a time saver and you will love if you like to multi task.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said it would be better to heat hair while hair was processing color.  </li>
            <li>Okay so the purpose of me getting this was to blow out my hair evenly.</li>
            <li>There are holes on top of course</li>
            <li>My hair dryer melted at the part u on the top of your blow part.  </li>
            <li>There are too many holes at the top and the elastic band for the blow dryer broke from the hose.</li>
            <li>I love using velcro rollers, and this made the process a lot quicker.  </li>
            <li>I love how the hood is adjustable so that if I wanted to attempt a roller set I could.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>you want a perfect hair dryer, you have to spring for the more professional hands free style.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>Curl formers makes one for five dollars more which won&#x27;t burn your scalp and ears.</li>
            <li>just wish that part was longer for more flexibility.  </li>
            <li>, I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>However I was able to reach up and pull it away from my scalp to avoid the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I think you should be able to easily find something to prop it up nearby.</li>
            <li>It is great if you want to give your hair a break from direct heat like I do.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit it around my hair dryer with some finagling, but then I realized I had to hold my arm up in the air for the bonnet to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I solved the problem (as best I could) by using a hair clip to clip some of the holes closed</li>
            <li>The end that attaches to blow dryer has elastic so it should easily fit over most blow dryers as per instructions</li>
            <li>Makes life more easy, watch out, might burn scalp if YOUR dryer is too high!!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use every time you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s been working fine.</li>
            <li>This product works fine.</li>
            <li>The air flow IS very hot as mentioned by another review!  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, because I clipped my hair in a bun at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li>But for a deep conditioning or for the purpose for which I use it, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This portable dryer works great for the purpose I bought it for which is to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li>Attaches securely to the dryer and remain on.</li>
            <li>It fit over my hand dryer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously a cheap item but after about a year you&#x27;ll have to replace it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even try it because there was no way to attach it securely to the dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this item once as, but for the cost was a great buy.</li>
            <li>and I have free hands.  </li>
            <li>believe that it does a great job, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t even fit on to it.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good but really heats up the hair closet to the dryer</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t like how the bonnet has holes in the top...</li>
            <li>I have described my purchase satisfaction in my first sentence why must I write more?</li>
            <li>Have fun holding your blow dryer for what seems like forever!</li>
            <li>, im excited to use it.</li>
            <li>and I have to spend more time because the hot dont arrive well to my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A solid 3-star product that giving 4 stars to for: price, free shipping and good customer service.</li>
            <li>It takes about 15 min to dry my shoulder-length curly hair (during which I put on my makeup &amp; jewelry), and the texture comes out very nice.  </li>
            <li>A hard top dryer is certainly better, but this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>I brought this product in lieu of the traditional hard-topped hair dryer because: it was cheaper, it appeared more comfortable, and it seemed that I would have more range of motion.</li>
            <li>I use this with a full roller set</li>
            <li>The dryer bonnet is good for simple purposes.</li>
            <li>i just adjust the setting on the dryer to cool to give me a break.</li>
            <li>If your dryer doesn&#x27;t have a cool setting, you won&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li>Invest in a hand held dryer with a cool setting.</li>
            <li>Overall good value for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out nicely dried with incredible shine, curl and body.  </li>
            <li>the material is not bad at all for the prize.</li>
            <li>I think when I am able to purchase a nice new ion blow dryer that is not anywhere near as hot I will have better luck with this.</li>
            <li>To have more smaller holes would be better.</li>
            <li>Dryer was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>think the expectation of being able to keep it on high</li>
            <li>: DO NOT put the temperature on high!!!</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t get to unbearably hot other than that it does the job great</li>
            <li>But I thought it was worth mentioning.    </li>
            <li>I use this with a blow dryer on a Warm heat setting and the heat has burned a hole through the entire shaft of the bonnet.</li>
            <li>For the price it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>In order to get airflow that doesn&#x27;t burn the ever-loving hell out of your head, you will have to first get your arms stretched on a rack by an experienced torturer and then hold your hair dryer straight out  to the side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a reasonably good alternative to a hard-top dryer if you don&#x27;t intend to use it very often or if you don&#x27;t have space to store a larger unit.</li>
            <li>I looked at the reviews for the soft bonnet dryers and most of the ones under $40 seemed to be junk; this one does what it is supposed to do and doesn&#x27;t have any moving parts to break.</li>
            <li>At first it would get so very hot at one spot on my head</li>
            <li>right where the air connects to the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>This is very large does not stay on my head and gets hoter in some places than others</li>
            <li>You attach the end to whatever hair blower you have handy and presto, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Good little dryer for portable n travel use.</li>
            <li>Word of caution though it gets really hot even on lowest setting.</li>
            <li>or otherwise it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to do two things at once!  </li>
            <li>I had no problems fitting the elastic over my hairdryer (and I have a regular sized Platform, ionic dryer).  </li>
            <li>Has a drawstring and no danger of blowing off (there are vents in the top), even if my head/hair weren&#x27;t so big ha.  </li>
            <li>Yes it gets hot</li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses you will know exactly what setting to put your hair dryer on.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done but is really hot in some places.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t glossy or gets sticky while hot, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>If you let this contraption kink the way it is displayed in the picture you will get hot spots that burn your shoulder and your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>o then it doesnt get too hot.</li>
            <li>But again for the price, it absolutely did the job!</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of not testing the bonnet at home and decided to try it for the first time while on vacation.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair, set it and put on the bonnet only to find out there are air holes at the top (not mentioned in the description) of the bonnet that let all the hot air out.  </li>
            <li>Love this use it for deep treatments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier than holding up my dryer with a diffuser for 45 minutes, and it dries pretty evenly if I put my hair in pin curls.</li>
            <li>Too hot for my liking.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot where I have to put a face towel around the rim of my head where the string is in order for it not to burn my skin.  </li>
            <li>A lot of others commented that they did not like that it got to hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can get hot around the neck area, but just place a towel in that area...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say, though, the first time I used it I got a really noxious burning-plastic odor for the first couple of minutes, I would recommend running hot hair through the bonnet for 5 - 10 minutes before you put it on your head, unless you like worrying that your hair is smoldering.</li>
            <li>Nice but be very careful.  </li>
            <li>Hot air is very concentrated so it gets too hot on my scalp at times.</li>
            <li>I think it is because the holes that the hot air comes through are just too large.</li>
            <li>I really like it and also the seller shipped it very fast to me.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Fit: very generous.</li>
            <li>The same for this dryer bonnet, because it is stationary, and you cant move it around, you will not be able to keep it on a high setting for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes my process of deep conditioning so easy now.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the top of my head never got dry.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use my hard top dryer, but I needed a solution for vacations and business travel, and this more than fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I think its lifespan was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Item arrive quickly, I tried it, it just gets too hot.. and the hot air doesn&#x27;t seem to reach the middle of your head just the sides.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot right at the place where the hose connects even with the dryer set to low.</li>
            <li>the plastic heats up too much, it burns my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The hose of this product fit over the nozzle of my handheld (a basic Conair handheld) with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I have found it really convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair faster and is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t feel like I got as much heat towards the front of my head.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>This really works ... was worried it wouldn&#x27;t hold the heat, but it does keep the heat in the bonnet.</li>
            <li>Works really well in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it 5 star because it fits on one of my dryer Attachment, well I really like it now and will be using it all the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much hotter at the point where the tube attaches to the bonnet...</li>
            <li>My hair was very damp.</li>
            <li>You do have a drawstring to adjust to size so it may not be too much of a problem.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just really thankful</li>
            <li>It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Because the actual dryer was still going strong, a new bonnet was all that was needed.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>put on a generic version of Curlformers and this did not dry the top of my head at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want a clunky, space-hogging hard-cap dryer, and I wanted something that I could attach to my current blow dryer (which has a cool setting).  </li>
            <li>My hair dryer only has 1 heat setting and 2 speeds and a cool off</li>
            <li>If I choose to use curlers, I&#x27;ll have to go for the small kind rather than the velcro ones I attempted to use.</li>
            <li>I really like my new hair dryer bonnet.</li>
            <li>This one received decent reviews so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I have two types of hair dryers: 1 is the traditional dryer with the small/medium nozzle and it fit that fine, I also have a travel dryer with an oval nozzle and the bonnet opening stretched to fit it with a little tugging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get VERY, VERY HOT in a very short amount of time, even on the lowest heat setting, but that is probably a function of having a high-powered hair dryer (1875 watts).</li>
            <li>I too used low settings because to my surprise it can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have to keep moving it around my head as the point where the tube is gets far too hot far too fast and burns the dickens out of my head.</li>
            <li>and they could keep it on the high</li>
            <li>As with a regular hand held dryer...if you use it on high heat and keep it in one spot, and do not move it around, it will get too hot as well!  </li>
            <li>the only downfall is that you must hold the blowdryer the whole time and your head gets way too hot.</li>
            <li>She has to stay under it for an hour, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>So if the open end piece is at the back of your hair then the front of your hair really doesnt get the full effects of drying.</li>
            <li>I will just buy a new bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li>I like my new bonnet.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, hot rollers just don&#x27;t turn out the same!).</li>
            <li>It does actually get really hot, even with the heat on low, so be ready for that!</li>
            <li>Also watch your ears because the bonnet gets hot especially on the perimeter and if it&#x27;s close to your ears you&#x27;ll get burned which is what happened to me.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s my hair dryer, but it blows too hot, even on my low heat setting.  </li>
            <li>The first an only time I got to use it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for about 45 mins on low heat, it got hot but was tolerable.</li>
            <li>If you want big ol&#x27; Texas Miss America hair, this really does the trick!</li>
            <li>unless you have a blow dryer with a low heat setting, do not make this purchase, because your head gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>I use it on low heat and have had no problem with hot spots.</li>
            <li>I was impressed because with my old hard-top bonnet it took way longer due to being unable to control the air flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only heat setting I use is my blow dryer&#x27;s cool setting; any other setting makes the cap too hot.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use unlike other more expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This is a very convenient product definitely should buy.</li>
            <li>So I decided to look into soft bonnet attachments for handheld dryers.  </li>
            <li>This bonnet worked well with the hose on the old dryer, so now I can use the dryer again.</li>
            <li>the air only really effects the tubing end...</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and thought this would work faster than a diffuser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started my transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  </li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s extremely intolerably hot!</li>
            <li>I used this for a deep conditioner, and I had higher hopes than what I actually got.</li>
            <li>The ONLY SMALL criticism I have is that I wish the...not sure what to call it...</li>
            <li>Oh... I will not this is a nice little bonnet for little kids because it can be adjusted not for people with lots of hair.</li>
            <li>I would enjoy this a lot more if I had one of those lazy fat American blow dryer stands, or at least a vanity to sit at</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the the little drawstring part with the plastic adjuster gets very hot and you have to make sure it&#x27;s not laying on your skin</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>The bonnet fits your entire crown completely, but may fit a little snug if you have rollers on but that all depends on how big your rollers are.</li>
            <li>(Not so much if I leave my hair loose.)</li>
            <li>I traveled recently, and I love that this folds up very small.  </li>
            <li>This interesting device which actually looks a bit ridiculous</li>
            <li>Not big enough if you use large curlers so I use it occasionally if I condition hair overnight and don&#x27;t want to soil my pillow case.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was looking to purchase a soft bonnet hair dryer, but all of the reviews of these types of dryers were generally unfavorable.  </li>
            <li>It barely did the job.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far, and it did what I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>I have natural African-American hair and use this for my deep conditioning treatments once a week.</li>
            <li>I put the temperature on low at the air circulates very well.&lt;br /&gt;Timing: I have shoulder-length hair and it takes around an hour for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li>My blow dryer actually gets overheated and stops, so I still can&#x27;t dry my hair as fast.</li>
            <li>I had to keep adjusting it around my head, because otherwise it was only making one area REALLY hot, and not drying the other parts at all.</li>
            <li>I use it to deep condition and the hair feels extra soft thereafter.</li>
            <li>My hair was still not completely dry and needed longer time under the hood.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, just spend a little more and get an actual  portable hair dryer</li>
            <li>but you do need to rotate it a few times to make sure your hair is dried properly.</li>
            <li>Now that I live in a cooler climate, I needed some type of hair dryer so that I would not leave the house with a wet or damp head during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>When I lived in Los Angeles, I could let my curly hair dry naturally regardless of the time of year.  </li>

            <li> This bonnet is great!  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intentions of doing hair mask and treatments and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use with the Sebastian Cellophane Laminates.</li>
            <li> This item is great!  </li>
            <li> Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Fits my Remington pearl ceramic perfectly.</li>
            <li> it fits my blow dryer perfectly</li>
            <li> Great price as well!</li>
            <li> Good buy for me!</li>
            <li> I think the hair bonnet is well made and a great price.</li>
            <li> One thing I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with, is it seems like you get the best air flow and heat</li>
            <li> I have used this for conditioning treatments and it works great.</li>
            <li> I pop it on, hook it to my blow dryer and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Fits over the rollers perfectly, snugs up nice with the drawstring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I guess this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is as good as your blowdryer is.</li>
            <li> but I could see that being a possibility if you do not have a good blowdryer to attach this item to.</li>
            <li> I suppose the elastic that goes around the dryer nozzle could wear out, but it seems surprisingly well-made for this</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I used it the first time today and found it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite amazing</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the hose were longer.  </li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked but instead of having to replace it every year I think I&#x27;m going to invest in a more durable conditioning cap/hair steamer.</li>
            <li> I love it, easy to use to assemble, portable, recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up fairly evenly, my curlers get nice and hot, and I can even put my makeup on while I&#x27;m waiting for the set.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a better quality one.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s affordable and would repurchase again.  </li>
            <li> It is a time saver and you will love if you like to multi task.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser said it would be better to heat hair while hair was processing color.  </li>
            <li> Okay so the purpose of me getting this was to blow out my hair evenly.</li>
            <li> There are holes on top of course</li>
            <li> My hair dryer melted at the part u on the top of your blow part.  </li>
            <li> There are too many holes at the top and the elastic band for the blow dryer broke from the hose.</li>
            <li> I love using velcro rollers, and this made the process a lot quicker.  </li>
            <li> I love how the hood is adjustable so that if I wanted to attempt a roller set I could.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> you want a perfect hair dryer, you have to spring for the more professional hands free style.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> Curl formers makes one for five dollars more which won&#x27;t burn your scalp and ears.</li>
            <li> just wish that part was longer for more flexibility.  </li>
            <li> , I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> However I was able to reach up and pull it away from my scalp to avoid the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I think you should be able to easily find something to prop it up nearby.</li>
            <li> It is great if you want to give your hair a break from direct heat like I do.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit it around my hair dryer with some finagling, but then I realized I had to hold my arm up in the air for the bonnet to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I solved the problem (as best I could) by using a hair clip to clip some of the holes closed</li>
            <li> The end that attaches to blow dryer has elastic so it should easily fit over most blow dryers as per instructions</li>
            <li> Makes life more easy, watch out, might burn scalp if YOUR dryer is too high!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use every time you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s been working fine.</li>
            <li> This product works fine.</li>
            <li> The air flow IS very hot as mentioned by another review!  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, because I clipped my hair in a bun at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li> But for a deep conditioning or for the purpose for which I use it, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> This portable dryer works great for the purpose I bought it for which is to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Attaches securely to the dryer and remain on.</li>
            <li> It fit over my hand dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously a cheap item but after about a year you&#x27;ll have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even try it because there was no way to attach it securely to the dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item once as, but for the cost was a great buy.</li>
            <li> and I have free hands.  </li>
            <li> believe that it does a great job, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t even fit on to it.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but really heats up the hair closet to the dryer</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t like how the bonnet has holes in the top...</li>
            <li> I have described my purchase satisfaction in my first sentence why must I write more?</li>
            <li> Have fun holding your blow dryer for what seems like forever!</li>
            <li> , im excited to use it.</li>
            <li> and I have to spend more time because the hot dont arrive well to my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A solid 3-star product that giving 4 stars to for: price, free shipping and good customer service.</li>
            <li> It takes about 15 min to dry my shoulder-length curly hair (during which I put on my makeup &amp; jewelry), and the texture comes out very nice.  </li>
            <li> A hard top dryer is certainly better, but this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I brought this product in lieu of the traditional hard-topped hair dryer because: it was cheaper, it appeared more comfortable, and it seemed that I would have more range of motion.</li>
            <li> I use this with a full roller set</li>
            <li> The dryer bonnet is good for simple purposes.</li>
            <li> i just adjust the setting on the dryer to cool to give me a break.</li>
            <li> If your dryer doesn&#x27;t have a cool setting, you won&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li> Invest in a hand held dryer with a cool setting.</li>
            <li> Overall good value for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out nicely dried with incredible shine, curl and body.  </li>
            <li> the material is not bad at all for the prize.</li>
            <li> I think when I am able to purchase a nice new ion blow dryer that is not anywhere near as hot I will have better luck with this.</li>
            <li> To have more smaller holes would be better.</li>
            <li> Dryer was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> think the expectation of being able to keep it on high</li>
            <li> : DO NOT put the temperature on high!!!</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t get to unbearably hot other than that it does the job great</li>
            <li> But I thought it was worth mentioning.    </li>
            <li> I use this with a blow dryer on a Warm heat setting and the heat has burned a hole through the entire shaft of the bonnet.</li>
            <li> For the price it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> In order to get airflow that doesn&#x27;t burn the ever-loving hell out of your head, you will have to first get your arms stretched on a rack by an experienced torturer and then hold your hair dryer straight out  to the side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a reasonably good alternative to a hard-top dryer if you don&#x27;t intend to use it very often or if you don&#x27;t have space to store a larger unit.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews for the soft bonnet dryers and most of the ones under $40 seemed to be junk; this one does what it is supposed to do and doesn&#x27;t have any moving parts to break.</li>
            <li> At first it would get so very hot at one spot on my head</li>
            <li> right where the air connects to the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> This is very large does not stay on my head and gets hoter in some places than others</li>
            <li> You attach the end to whatever hair blower you have handy and presto, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Good little dryer for portable n travel use.</li>
            <li> Word of caution though it gets really hot even on lowest setting.</li>
            <li> or otherwise it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to do two things at once!  </li>
            <li> I had no problems fitting the elastic over my hairdryer (and I have a regular sized Platform, ionic dryer).  </li>
            <li> Has a drawstring and no danger of blowing off (there are vents in the top), even if my head/hair weren&#x27;t so big ha.  </li>
            <li> Yes it gets hot</li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses you will know exactly what setting to put your hair dryer on.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but is really hot in some places.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t glossy or gets sticky while hot, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> If you let this contraption kink the way it is displayed in the picture you will get hot spots that burn your shoulder and your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> o then it doesnt get too hot.</li>
            <li> But again for the price, it absolutely did the job!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not testing the bonnet at home and decided to try it for the first time while on vacation.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, set it and put on the bonnet only to find out there are air holes at the top (not mentioned in the description) of the bonnet that let all the hot air out.  </li>
            <li> Love this use it for deep treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier than holding up my dryer with a diffuser for 45 minutes, and it dries pretty evenly if I put my hair in pin curls.</li>
            <li> Too hot for my liking.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot where I have to put a face towel around the rim of my head where the string is in order for it not to burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> A lot of others commented that they did not like that it got to hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can get hot around the neck area, but just place a towel in that area...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say, though, the first time I used it I got a really noxious burning-plastic odor for the first couple of minutes, I would recommend running hot hair through the bonnet for 5 - 10 minutes before you put it on your head, unless you like worrying that your hair is smoldering.</li>
            <li> Nice but be very careful.  </li>
            <li> Hot air is very concentrated so it gets too hot on my scalp at times.</li>
            <li> I think it is because the holes that the hot air comes through are just too large.</li>
            <li> I really like it and also the seller shipped it very fast to me.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Fit: very generous.</li>
            <li> The same for this dryer bonnet, because it is stationary, and you cant move it around, you will not be able to keep it on a high setting for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes my process of deep conditioning so easy now.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the top of my head never got dry.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use my hard top dryer, but I needed a solution for vacations and business travel, and this more than fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I think its lifespan was pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Item arrive quickly, I tried it, it just gets too hot.. and the hot air doesn&#x27;t seem to reach the middle of your head just the sides.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot right at the place where the hose connects even with the dryer set to low.</li>
            <li> the plastic heats up too much, it burns my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The hose of this product fit over the nozzle of my handheld (a basic Conair handheld) with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I have found it really convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster and is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t feel like I got as much heat towards the front of my head.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> This really works ... was worried it wouldn&#x27;t hold the heat, but it does keep the heat in the bonnet.</li>
            <li> Works really well in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it 5 star because it fits on one of my dryer Attachment, well I really like it now and will be using it all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much hotter at the point where the tube attaches to the bonnet...</li>
            <li> My hair was very damp.</li>
            <li> You do have a drawstring to adjust to size so it may not be too much of a problem.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just really thankful</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Because the actual dryer was still going strong, a new bonnet was all that was needed.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> put on a generic version of Curlformers and this did not dry the top of my head at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a clunky, space-hogging hard-cap dryer, and I wanted something that I could attach to my current blow dryer (which has a cool setting).  </li>
            <li> My hair dryer only has 1 heat setting and 2 speeds and a cool off</li>
            <li> If I choose to use curlers, I&#x27;ll have to go for the small kind rather than the velcro ones I attempted to use.</li>
            <li> I really like my new hair dryer bonnet.</li>
            <li> This one received decent reviews so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I have two types of hair dryers: 1 is the traditional dryer with the small/medium nozzle and it fit that fine, I also have a travel dryer with an oval nozzle and the bonnet opening stretched to fit it with a little tugging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get VERY, VERY HOT in a very short amount of time, even on the lowest heat setting, but that is probably a function of having a high-powered hair dryer (1875 watts).</li>
            <li> I too used low settings because to my surprise it can get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have to keep moving it around my head as the point where the tube is gets far too hot far too fast and burns the dickens out of my head.</li>
            <li> and they could keep it on the high</li>
            <li> As with a regular hand held dryer...if you use it on high heat and keep it in one spot, and do not move it around, it will get too hot as well!  </li>
            <li> the only downfall is that you must hold the blowdryer the whole time and your head gets way too hot.</li>
            <li> She has to stay under it for an hour, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> So if the open end piece is at the back of your hair then the front of your hair really doesnt get the full effects of drying.</li>
            <li> I will just buy a new bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> I like my new bonnet.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, hot rollers just don&#x27;t turn out the same!).</li>
            <li> It does actually get really hot, even with the heat on low, so be ready for that!</li>
            <li> Also watch your ears because the bonnet gets hot especially on the perimeter and if it&#x27;s close to your ears you&#x27;ll get burned which is what happened to me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my hair dryer, but it blows too hot, even on my low heat setting.  </li>
            <li> The first an only time I got to use it.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 45 mins on low heat, it got hot but was tolerable.</li>
            <li> If you want big ol&#x27; Texas Miss America hair, this really does the trick!</li>
            <li> unless you have a blow dryer with a low heat setting, do not make this purchase, because your head gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> I use it on low heat and have had no problem with hot spots.</li>
            <li> I was impressed because with my old hard-top bonnet it took way longer due to being unable to control the air flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only heat setting I use is my blow dryer&#x27;s cool setting; any other setting makes the cap too hot.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use unlike other more expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient product definitely should buy.</li>
            <li> So I decided to look into soft bonnet attachments for handheld dryers.  </li>
            <li> This bonnet worked well with the hose on the old dryer, so now I can use the dryer again.</li>
            <li> the air only really effects the tubing end...</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and thought this would work faster than a diffuser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started my transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  </li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s extremely intolerably hot!</li>
            <li> I used this for a deep conditioner, and I had higher hopes than what I actually got.</li>
            <li> The ONLY SMALL criticism I have is that I wish the...not sure what to call it...</li>
            <li> Oh... I will not this is a nice little bonnet for little kids because it can be adjusted not for people with lots of hair.</li>
            <li> I would enjoy this a lot more if I had one of those lazy fat American blow dryer stands, or at least a vanity to sit at</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the the little drawstring part with the plastic adjuster gets very hot and you have to make sure it&#x27;s not laying on your skin</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> The bonnet fits your entire crown completely, but may fit a little snug if you have rollers on but that all depends on how big your rollers are.</li>
            <li> (Not so much if I leave my hair loose.)</li>
            <li> I traveled recently, and I love that this folds up very small.  </li>
            <li> This interesting device which actually looks a bit ridiculous</li>
            <li> Not big enough if you use large curlers so I use it occasionally if I condition hair overnight and don&#x27;t want to soil my pillow case.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was looking to purchase a soft bonnet hair dryer, but all of the reviews of these types of dryers were generally unfavorable.  </li>
            <li> It barely did the job.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, and it did what I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> I have natural African-American hair and use this for my deep conditioning treatments once a week.</li>
            <li> I put the temperature on low at the air circulates very well.&lt;br /&gt;Timing: I have shoulder-length hair and it takes around an hour for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> My blow dryer actually gets overheated and stops, so I still can&#x27;t dry my hair as fast.</li>
            <li> I had to keep adjusting it around my head, because otherwise it was only making one area REALLY hot, and not drying the other parts at all.</li>
            <li> I use it to deep condition and the hair feels extra soft thereafter.</li>
            <li> My hair was still not completely dry and needed longer time under the hood.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, just spend a little more and get an actual  portable hair dryer</li>
            <li> but you do need to rotate it a few times to make sure your hair is dried properly.</li>
            <li> Now that I live in a cooler climate, I needed some type of hair dryer so that I would not leave the house with a wet or damp head during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> When I lived in Los Angeles, I could let my curly hair dry naturally regardless of the time of year.  </li>
            <li> but it does not dry long hair</li>
            <li> This dryer bonnet folds down to a very small package that will easily slip into a make-up case.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is it gets really hot in some areas</li>
            <li> I can now put my makeup on, and dry my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> Does what it says does get a little hot around the edges but not to badly well build like the ventilation holes at the top and the draw string</li>
            <li> It heats up my entire head unlike the other reviews where they say it only heats up part of their heads.</li>
            <li> You can use it for a roller set (and don&#x27;t be fooled roller sets are not just for little old lady&#x27;s anymore) or to activate a conditioning or protein treatment.</li>
            <li> This is not a product for long hair.</li>
            <li> the long part in between, that connects the dryer to the bonnet,,,I</li>
            <li> Now, not only does my hair take less time, but I can escape my bathroom and actually do something constructive like eat breakfast, read my emails, or do my bookkeeping.  </li>
            <li> it would probably take to long to dry.</li>
            <li> Saved me from many expensive conditioning salon treatments!</li>
            <li> The heat is even and I can&#x27;t imagine needing any other product, will try it to dry my hair next!</li>
            <li> and I had to adjust it a few times to get the bonnet to come down far enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could dry my hair while applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just let it air dry in rollers than ever use this again.</li>
            <li> so then I can find the hair bonnet dryer that would completely dry the hair evenly.</li>
            <li> I have to dry hair  for it.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it to dry my hair yet, but I suspect it will do the job.</li>
            <li> I have to look for another way to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this to dry my girlfriends hair after I re twist her dreads.</li>
            <li> Overall, it dried my entire head in about 30 mins.</li>
            <li> Which sucked because the curls looked amazing on the left side but really bad on the other side due to the heat being un-balanced.</li>
            <li> When she comes from under this dryer her hair is a little wet in some areas, but nothing too major.</li>
            <li> When I took this bonnet out of the package, half the seams on it were open</li>
            <li> By way of background, I am a black woman with short curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t feel tight at all, and I could still hear the television relatively well.</li>
            <li> A simple solution for drying hair and little needed storage space.  </li>
            <li> I suppose someone could take a needle and thread and with just a couple of stitches make the holes that are causing a problem just a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I set the dryer on low but turn it off every few minutes</li>
            <li> The elastic kept slipping off my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The only part that was dried is the circumference of my head.</li>
            <li> I picked up one of these to dry my long, wavy/curly hair and also to add heat when I color my hair with raw dyes (e.g. Manic Panic).</li>
            <li> Never had any other problems with the hairdryer I&#x27;ve had for years, so I&#x27;m blaming the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I use a small Conair Minipro dryer on low heat with it.</li>
            <li> :  think for other types of hair it would be beaut yfu to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> You need a small hairdryer with a nozzle that is small in diameter (like the old hairdryers used to have).  </li>
            <li> I had to sit in such an awkward position to use it properly, the sleeve gets twisted easily</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Silly product that didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t use this product to dry a roller set, I am not sure how efficient it would be for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Too small to use non-heated rollers and dry with them covered to avoid frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> Use this to set my long, thick hair in velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> I wrapped a rubber band around my dryer that I use to hold down the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button for a few minutes at a time so that I can keep the air circulating without it getting too</li>
            <li> I used to dread washing my hair because it would take at least 45 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> This little gadget is cleaver, versatile and beats the alternative which would cost you hundreds.</li>
            <li> I wanted my hair to dry faster when twisted for curls than regular air drying.</li>
            <li> : it feels like a heavy wind-breaker type material.</li>
            <li> Just attach it to your dryer and give it a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but the drawstring ends up burning you after a few</li>
            <li> I was going to leave a 3 or 4 star rating because this dryer bonnet did not fit my dryer.</li>
            <li> product is a waste.</li>
            <li> If you do not have a small hairdryer, do not buy it.</li>
            <li> so anything we buy has to have a small footprint.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to do it by yourself</li>
            <li> That adds up to at least 3 hours a week just for my hair</li>
            <li> its so slow</li>
            <li> Needless to say my hair was a mess</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I know this review is a little long, but I try to be thorough in my reviews because I know that people like myself base purchases off of consumer results and opinions.</li>
            <li> Not a good start.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not fit over all hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if the cord didn&#x27;t get a little twisted once your hand got too tired from holding the dryer up.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find a blow dryer that fits</li>
            <li> Also, it may look a little awkward in the photo how she&#x27;s holding it</li>
            <li> and I was not a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> so I rate it as low as the screen doors for submarines, led balloons, tuna flavored shark repellent and square wheels (I could add government running a program to save money).</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful when purchasing this product but it has exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> have no clue what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> Nothing too expensive that would do the job</li>
            <li> At $13 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> it is unrealistic.  </li>
            <li> and I had to actually crazy glue it together.  </li>
            <li> Went to use today and the elastic around the bottom that attaches to the dryer is ripping off:(</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very convenient product definitely should buy. Word of caution though it gets really hot even on lowest setting. I personally use and recommend using a rag or a towel on your neck and on hair so it won&#x27;t get to unbearably hot other than that it does the job great</li>
            <li> I have short hair so this dryer hood gets hotter than I would want it. Overall, it dried my entire head in about 30 mins. I have to cut the dryer off every so often becuase it gets hotter than I can handle but I like it. I have already recommeneded it to people who doesn&#x27;t want to spedn all that money on an actual hooded dryer like I didn&#x27;t. Great item to have!</li>
            <li> The tubing can&#x27;t take the heat so I rate it as low as the screen doors for submarines, led balloons, tuna flavored shark repellent and square wheels (I could add government running a program to save money).</li>
            <li> I brought this product in lieu of the traditional hard-topped hair dryer because: it was cheaper, it appeared more comfortable, and it seemed that I would have more range of motion. Because of the price, I ordered one for home and one for travel. I know this review is a little long, but I try to be thorough in my reviews because I know that people like myself base purchases off of consumer results and opinions. I&#x27;ve used the bonnet 3 times since I&#x27;ve gotten it and here is what I think:&lt;br /&gt;Material: it feels like a heavy wind-breaker type material. It seems pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Fit: very generous. I use this with a full roller set and I had to adjust it a few times to get the bonnet to come down far enough. I doesn&#x27;t feel tight at all, and I could still hear the television relatively well. I have two types of hair dryers: 1 is the traditional dryer with the small/medium nozzle and it fit that fine, I also have a travel dryer with an oval nozzle and the bonnet opening stretched to fit it with a little tugging.&lt;br /&gt;Use: DO NOT put the temperature on high!!! I did initially because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work well- and I was wrong. I put the temperature on low at the air circulates very well.&lt;br /&gt;Timing: I have shoulder-length hair and it takes around an hour for my hair to dry. I was impressed because with my old hard-top bonnet it took way longer due to being unable to control the air flow.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I like this product. It is great if you want to give your hair a break from direct heat like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because the bonnet on my hair dryer finally fell apart.  Because the actual dryer was still going strong, a new bonnet was all that was needed.  When I took this bonnet out of the package, half the seams on it were open and I had to actually crazy glue it together.  Not a good start.  It barely did the job.  I will just buy a new bonnet dryer.</li>
            <li> It is hard to do it by yourself</li>
            <li> the plastic heats up too much, it burns my skin. I would recommend a better quality one.</li>
            <li> This is very large does not stay on my head and gets hoter in some places than others</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by my hair stylist. I have postmenopausal wavy hair it is not quite curly. I either have to straighten that which causes further dryness or work with the curl.. This interesting device which actually looks a bit ridiculous it&#x27;s quite amazing In bringing out curl and waves witho huh t frizz. Just attach it to your dryer and give it a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was looking to purchase a soft bonnet hair dryer, but all of the reviews of these types of dryers were generally unfavorable.  So I decided to look into soft bonnet attachments for handheld dryers.  This one received decent reviews so I ordered it.  I really like it.  By way of background, I am a black woman with short curly hair.  I wash my hair every morning and use a curl defining cream that is white in color and shows as such when applied to my hair.  Sitting under a hooded dryer for 15 mins helps the product absorb into my hair.  Normally, I use my hard top dryer, but I needed a solution for vacations and business travel, and this more than fits the bill.  The hose of this product fit over the nozzle of my handheld (a basic Conair handheld) with no problems.  The bonnet has an adjustable elastic band, so it fits snuggly around your head.  Yes, you have to use the dryer on low or otherwise it gets really hot.  Because I don&#x27;t use this product to dry a roller set, I am not sure how efficient it would be for that purpose.  But for a deep conditioning or for the purpose for which I use it, it&#x27;s great.  A hard top dryer is certainly better, but this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Used it maybe 5 times worked well for deep conditioning treatment.  Went to use today and the elastic around the bottom that attaches to the dryer is ripping off:(. .  Disappointed</li>
            <li> This does what it says. I have found it really convenient for travel. I use it with rollers in my hair (I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, hot rollers just don&#x27;t turn out the same!). It does actually get really hot, even with the heat on low, so be ready for that!</li>
            <li> When I lived in Los Angeles, I could let my curly hair dry naturally regardless of the time of year.  Now that I live in a cooler climate, I needed some type of hair dryer so that I would not leave the house with a wet or damp head during the winter months.  I didn&#x27;t want a clunky, space-hogging hard-cap dryer, and I wanted something that I could attach to my current blow dryer (which has a cool setting).  This bonnet is great!  It takes about 15 min to dry my shoulder-length curly hair (during which I put on my makeup &amp; jewelry), and the texture comes out very nice.  The only heat setting I use is my blow dryer&#x27;s cool setting; any other setting makes the cap too hot.  I traveled recently, and I love that this folds up very small.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer, even at the hair salon the hair dryers burns your neck. Just position the dryer so it doesn&#x27;t burn your neck.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job but the drawstring ends up burning you after a few so it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could dry my hair while applying my makeup. I use rollers, so just before putting on my makeup, I roll my hair, attach the dryer to my hand dryer and I&#x27;m ready to do two things at once!  I actually hang my dryer on the medicine cabinet so the hair bonnet is level with my head.    I think the hair bonnet is well made and a great price.</li>
            <li> I guess this product is good for the price. I had to keep adjusting it around my head, because otherwise it was only making one area REALLY hot, and not drying the other parts at all. I used this for a deep conditioner, and I had higher hopes than what I actually got. I was able to fit it around my hair dryer with some finagling, but then I realized I had to hold my arm up in the air for the bonnet to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I should have just invested in one of the hard-top bonnet dryers.</li>
            <li> I really like my new hair dryer bonnet. It is very easy to use unlike other more expensive ones I have purchased. It dries my hair faster and is very lightweight.  If it every wears out I will want to purchase another just like it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, and it did what I wanted it to.  I&#x27;m not using this as a hairdryer, but as a means to add heat to conditioning treatments.  I had no problems fitting the elastic over my hairdryer (and I have a regular sized Platform, ionic dryer).  The air flow IS very hot as mentioned by another review!  I had to turn my dryer on the lowest setting for both heat and air flow, otherwise my head was cooking.  One thing I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with, is it seems like you get the best air flow and heat right where the air connects to the bonnet.  (Which I suppose is a no brainer.)  But, I don&#x27;t feel like I got as much heat towards the front of my head.  This wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, because I clipped my hair in a bun at the nape of my neck.  But I thought it was worth mentioning.    All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  I love that it&#x27;s affordable and would repurchase again.  A solid 3-star product that giving 4 stars to for: price, free shipping and good customer service.</li>
            <li> I have used this for conditioning treatments and it works great. Has a drawstring and no danger of blowing off (there are vents in the top), even if my head/hair weren&#x27;t so big ha.  Yes it gets hot but what do you expect? Just don&#x27;t let the bonnet lay on your neck. The heat is even and I can&#x27;t imagine needing any other product, will try it to dry my hair next!</li>
            <li> Very convenient. The only complaint is it gets really hot in some areas so I have to keep moving it around.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is cleaver, versatile and beats the alternative which would cost you hundreds. You can use it for a roller set (and don&#x27;t be fooled roller sets are not just for little old lady&#x27;s anymore) or to activate a conditioning or protein treatment. It sits well on the head and has a cord to tighten accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t beat it, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like my new bonnet. I wish I had order this before. It is a time saver and you will love if you like to multi task. I do my nails and hair at the same time. Good product.</li>
            <li> Not big enough if you use large curlers so I use it occasionally if I condition hair overnight and don&#x27;t want to soil my pillow case.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected! A lot of reviews talked about how it will burn you head/scalp but this totally depends on your hair dryer and how you use it. After the first couple of uses you will know exactly what setting to put your hair dryer on. Also, it may look a little awkward in the photo how she&#x27;s holding it but I think you should be able to easily find something to prop it up nearby. I bought this with the intentions of doing hair mask and treatments and it works perfectly. I haven&#x27;t tried using it for rollers yet but I definitely will!</li>
            <li> This portable dryer works great for the purpose I bought it for which is to deep condition my hair. I would not use this for hairstyling it would probably take to long to dry. Also watch your ears because the bonnet gets hot especially on the perimeter and if it&#x27;s close to your ears you&#x27;ll get burned which is what happened to me. The dryer bonnet is good for simple purposes.</li>
            <li> I use it to deep condition and the hair feels extra soft thereafter. Attaches securely to the dryer and remain on.</li>
            <li> And even after I cut off the elastic at the end, any kink in the tube caused the dryer to overload and cut out, even on low settings. Never had any other problems with the hairdryer I&#x27;ve had for years, so I&#x27;m blaming the bonnet. Got zero uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my hair dryer, but it blows too hot, even on my low heat setting.  Have to keep turing off and on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use with the Sebastian Cellophane Laminates. Don&#x27;t know if it will work out if you use rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but really heats up the hair closet to the dryer so I rotate the cap!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use when I travel.  Unfortunately it does not fit over all hairdryers.  You need a small hairdryer with a nozzle that is small in diameter (like the old hairdryers used to have).  If you do not have a small hairdryer, do not buy it.</li>
            <li> This makes my process of deep conditioning so easy now. I pop it on, hook it to my blow dryer and it works great. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair dryer with a hood.  I read several reviews about the portable bonnet.  The price was right.  It fit over my hand dryer and I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Should have believed the reviews.</li>
            <li> This product gets No stars.  The first an only time I got to use it.  It burnt a hole in the Bonnet an I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> This really works ... was worried it wouldn&#x27;t hold the heat, but it does keep the heat in the bonnet.</li>
            <li> A simple solution for drying hair and little needed storage space.  We are on the road 100% of the time so anything we buy has to have a small footprint.  This dryer bonnet folds down to a very small package that will easily slip into a make-up case.  You attach the end to whatever hair blower you have handy and presto, dry hair.  I was a little doubtful when purchasing this product but it has exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to purchase this product after reading the mixed revues. I&#x27;m happy I decided to try it anyway. I am using it with a hair gloss mask and to soak conditioner in for a deep treatment. It works just as it&#x27;s supposed to for both.</li>
            <li> I used it as soon as it came in. I wanted my hair to dry faster when twisted for curls than regular air drying. I used it for about 45 mins on low heat, it got hot but was tolerable. When I was done I pulled it off my hair dryer and found that it got so hot it melted some of the end of my dryer and left a small hole in the connector of the hood. My hair was still not completely dry and needed longer time under the hood. I will defiantly try it again to see if I can get it right.&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue what I did wrong. My hair dryer only has 1 heat setting and 2 speeds and a cool off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update.</li>
            <li> I have natural African-American hair and use this for my deep conditioning treatments once a week. First off, I don&#x27;t like how the bonnet has holes in the top... a lot of the heat escapes through. I solved the problem (as best I could) by using a hair clip to clip some of the holes closed and that&#x27;s been working fine. One thing to note is that heat will deteriorate this bonnet. It&#x27;s obviously a cheap item but after about a year you&#x27;ll have to replace it. I use this with a blow dryer on a Warm heat setting and the heat has burned a hole through the entire shaft of the bonnet. You get what you pay for and at under $15 I think its lifespan was pretty decent. I liked it while it worked but instead of having to replace it every year I think I&#x27;m going to invest in a more durable conditioning cap/hair steamer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and a half now. I only use it once a month for 20 minutes when I treat my hair and I need this style of dryer. I use a small Conair Minipro dryer on low heat with it. At first it would get so very hot at one spot on my head I would need to spin the cap a bit on my head about every minute so it wouldn&#x27;t burn my scalp. I think it is because the holes that the hot air comes through are just too large. To have more smaller holes would be better. But after about 8 months I no longer had the problem, and I don&#x27;t know why. I have the same dryer, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have lost any power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still get this again. For the price it was totally worth it. I suppose someone could take a needle and thread and with just a couple of stitches make the holes that are causing a problem just a little smaller.</li>
            <li> This item is great!  I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for several years and I never used heat.  My hair dresser said it would be better to heat hair while hair was processing color.  This bonnet is just what I wanted.  Nothing too expensive that would do the job</li>
            <li> I use for deep conditioning. It gets the job done but is really hot in some places. I set the dryer on low but turn it off every few minutes so I dont burn myself</li>
            <li> My blow dryer actually gets overheated and stops, so I still can&#x27;t dry my hair as fast. Too small to use non-heated rollers and dry with them covered to avoid frizz. Also, I have to keep moving it around my head as the point where the tube is gets far too hot far too fast and burns the dickens out of my head. I think when I am able to purchase a nice new ion blow dryer that is not anywhere near as hot I will have better luck with this. If I choose to use curlers, I&#x27;ll have to go for the small kind rather than the velcro ones I attempted to use.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it to set my daughter&#x27;s hair in curly she curls. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! Great for the price. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if the cord didn&#x27;t get a little twisted once your hand got too tired from holding the dryer up.</li>
            <li> The elastic kept slipping off my hairdryer. I couldn&#x27;t even try it because there was no way to attach it securely to the dryer. If your dryer tapers off towards the end, save your money and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Dryer was shipped quickly. I like the material, it isn&#x27;t glossy or gets sticky while hot, so that&#x27;s a plus. It does get a bit too hot where the adjustable string is, but i usually put a shower cap underneath when i&#x27;m doing deep condition steams, so i just put the string on the shower cap instead of my head. Works really well in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was going to leave a 3 or 4 star rating because this dryer bonnet did not fit my dryer. I really like it and also the seller shipped it very fast to me. I received it just in time. The reason why I gave it 5 star because it fits on one of my dryer Attachment, well I really like it now and will be using it all the time.</li>
            <li> I use a rubband for extra support to keep it attached to the nozele</li>
            <li> In order to get airflow that doesn&#x27;t burn the ever-loving hell out of your head, you will have to first get your arms stretched on a rack by an experienced torturer and then hold your hair dryer straight out  to the side. If you let this contraption kink the way it is displayed in the picture you will get hot spots that burn your shoulder and your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a waste. I&#x27;d rather just let it air dry in rollers than ever use this again.</li>
            <li> I have a hair dryer that I had in college over 40 years ago. It still works, but the plastic bonnet had fallen apart. This bonnet worked well with the hose on the old dryer, so now I can use the dryer again.</li>
            <li> Okay so the purpose of me getting this was to blow out my hair evenly. There are holes on top of course o then it doesnt get too hot. the air only really effects the tubing end... So if the open end piece is at the back of your hair then the front of your hair really doesnt get the full effects of drying. Which sucked because the curls looked amazing on the left side but really bad on the other side due to the heat being un-balanced. I will search again on here and read reviews thoroughly so then I can find the hair bonnet dryer that would completely dry the hair evenly. Oh... I will not this is a nice little bonnet for little kids because it can be adjusted not for people with lots of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item once as, but for the cost was a great buy. It was a struggle trying to keep the back of neck from burning. I had to sit in such an awkward position to use it properly, the sleeve gets twisted easily so I had hold my arm out in order to keep heat pockets from burning me. But again for the price, it absolutely did the job!</li>
            <li> Does not work, do not buy this at all this was a rip off</li>
            <li> Love it!! Wish I would have bought this sooner!</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s extremely intolerably hot! If someone figures out a way to keep it from burning your scalp please share it!</li>
            <li> My hair dryer melted at the part u on the top of your blow part.  Dosapointed.  So all the come out at the bottom and my hair under the cap doent try</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it frizzed my hair.  I have to dry hair  for it.  my hair is tocoarse for that.:  think for other types of hair it would be beaut yfu to use.</li>
            <li> Good little dryer for portable n travel use. I have described my purchase satisfaction in my first sentence why must I write more?</li>
            <li> Very useful. Hot air is very concentrated so it gets too hot on my scalp at times. i just adjust the setting on the dryer to cool to give me a break.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and purchased the portable bonnet dryer so I could set my hair while traveling. I made the mistake of not testing the bonnet at home and decided to try it for the first time while on vacation. I washed my hair, set it and put on the bonnet only to find out there are air holes at the top (not mentioned in the description) of the bonnet that let all the hot air out.  Therefore, the top of my head never got dry. Needless to say my hair was a mess and I was not a happy camper.  I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> There are too many holes at the top and the elastic band for the blow dryer broke from the hose. I have to roll it then put it over the dryer tube.</li>
            <li> If you want big ol&#x27; Texas Miss America hair, this really does the trick! I love using velcro rollers, and this made the process a lot quicker.  HOWEVER: 2 things.. 1. unless you have a blow dryer with a low heat setting, do not make this purchase, because your head gets extremely hot. 2. Have fun holding your blow dryer for what seems like forever! I would enjoy this a lot more if I had one of those lazy fat American blow dryer stands, or at least a vanity to sit at</li>
            <li> Does what it says does get a little hot around the edges but not to badly well build like the ventilation holes at the top and the draw string</li>
            <li> Nice but be very careful.  If your dryer doesn&#x27;t have a cool setting, you won&#x27;t like this.  Invest in a hand held dryer with a cool setting.</li>
            <li> Hair ware Portable Dryer Bonnet : Easy to use every time you need. Compact and facile to caring  with you! I love it!</li>
            <li> Saved me from many expensive conditioning salon treatments!</li>
            <li> This is not a product for long hair. I have naturally curly hair and thought this would work faster than a diffuser but it does not dry long hair it would probably take 4hrs. It would probably work for really short hair.</li>
            <li> Item arrive quickly, I tried it, it just gets too hot.. and the hot air doesn&#x27;t seem to reach the middle of your head just the sides. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, just spend a little more and get an actual  portable hair dryer</li>
            <li> Love this use it for deep treatments. Fits my Remington pearl ceramic perfectly. I love how the hood is adjustable so that if I wanted to attempt a roller set I could. The end that attaches to blow dryer has elastic so it should easily fit over most blow dryers as per instructions I use it on low heat and have had no problem with hot spots.</li>
            <li> I love it it fits my blow dryer perfectly</li>
            <li> Silly product that didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> This Dryer Bonnet is going to be so helpful especially when I cant afford to go to the salon, actually I don&#x27;t need salon anymore, im excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find a blow dryer that fits</li>
            <li> Use this to set my long, thick hair in velcro rollers. Fits over the rollers perfectly, snugs up nice with the drawstring.&lt;br /&gt;It is much hotter at the point where the tube attaches to the bonnet...but I think that just comes with the territory.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fairly evenly, my curlers get nice and hot, and I can even put my makeup on while I&#x27;m waiting for the set.</li>
            <li> This does what I need it to do, I use it to deep condition my hair with heat. I have not used it to dry my hair yet, but I suspect it will do the job. Good buy for me!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: July 5, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I put on a generic version of Curlformers and this did not dry the top of my head at all. My hair was very damp. The only part that was dried is the circumference of my head. I do not recommend this for a hair dryer. You can use it to deep condition and but not to set curls with curlers of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairware Portable Dryer Bonnet works well but you do need to rotate it a few times to make sure your hair is dried properly.The bonnet fits your entire crown completely, but may fit a little snug if you have rollers on but that all depends on how big your rollers are.You do have a drawstring to adjust to size so it may not be too much of a problem. The bonnet is as good as your blowdryer is. My blow dryer has several settings so I didn&#x27;t burn my scalp but I could see that being a possibility if you do not have a good blowdryer to attach this item to. I have yet to use it for a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this for conditioning treatments and gloss treatments. It&#x27;s easy to use and store. I may order a second one.</li>
            <li> This product works fine. I wanted something I could use to deep condition my hair with heat. My only complaint is the the little drawstring part with the plastic adjuster gets very hot and you have to make sure it&#x27;s not laying on your skin or you will burn yourself. I guess it you want a perfect hair dryer, you have to spring for the more professional hands free style. Overall good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I picked up one of these to dry my long, wavy/curly hair and also to add heat when I color my hair with raw dyes (e.g. Manic Panic). It&#x27;s easier than holding up my dryer with a diffuser for 45 minutes, and it dries pretty evenly if I put my hair in pin curls. (Not so much if I leave my hair loose.) It does get VERY, VERY HOT in a very short amount of time, even on the lowest heat setting, but that is probably a function of having a high-powered hair dryer (1875 watts). I wrapped a rubber band around my dryer that I use to hold down the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button for a few minutes at a time so that I can keep the air circulating without it getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonably good alternative to a hard-top dryer if you don&#x27;t intend to use it very often or if you don&#x27;t have space to store a larger unit. I looked at the reviews for the soft bonnet dryers and most of the ones under $40 seemed to be junk; this one does what it is supposed to do and doesn&#x27;t have any moving parts to break. I suppose the elastic that goes around the dryer nozzle could wear out, but it seems surprisingly well-made for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, though, the first time I used it I got a really noxious burning-plastic odor for the first couple of minutes, I would recommend running hot hair through the bonnet for 5 - 10 minutes before you put it on your head, unless you like worrying that your hair is smoldering.</li>
            <li> I hate blow drying my hair. I love this product.  I used to dread washing my hair because it would take at least 45 minutes to dry and it would still be frizzy - requiring a curling iron as well.  That adds up to at least 3 hours a week just for my hair (I have a lot of it).  With this, I get out of the shower and after towel drying my hair I put it up in Velcro rollers and put on the bonnet. All I need is a plug and some place to prop up the blow dryer and I have free hands.  Now, not only does my hair take less time, but I can escape my bathroom and actually do something constructive like eat breakfast, read my emails, or do my bookkeeping.  My hair comes out nicely dried with incredible shine, curl and body.  At $13 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love it, easy to use to assemble, portable, recommend this to everyone! This dryer does what it says. Great product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to take your deep conditioning up a level this is the&lt;br /&gt;product to use. I really love it I use it once a week and does the job. Gives me enough&lt;br /&gt;heat and does not overheat. the material is not bad at all for the prize.</li>
            <li> I can now put my makeup on, and dry my hair at the same time. Makes life more easy, watch out, might burn scalp if YOUR dryer is too high!!!!</li>
            <li> Too hot for my liking. It burns like fire. Not worth buying</li>
            <li> the only downfall is that you must hold the blowdryer the whole time and your head gets way too hot.</li>
            <li> This bonnet does not distribute the air well. It gets very hot right at the place where the hose connects even with the dryer set to low. It would be nice if the hose were longer.  Curl formers makes one for five dollars more which won&#x27;t burn your scalp and ears.</li>
            <li> I saw this hairware portable dryer bonet and I got it &#x27;cause I hoped it was faster drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But its so slow and I have to spend more time because the hot dont arrive well to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I have to look for another way to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It only heats the part of your hair closest to the tube that connects to the dryer.👎</li>
            <li> It gets really hot where I have to put a face towel around the rim of my head where the string is in order for it not to burn my skin.  It heats up my entire head unlike the other reviews where they say it only heats up part of their heads.</li>
            <li> This dryer bonnet definitely does the job and has met my expectations.  I was a little skeptical at first after reading the reviews.  A lot of others commented that they did not like that it got to hot and they could keep it on the high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the expectation of being able to keep it on high it is unrealistic.  As with a regular hand held dryer...if you use it on high heat and keep it in one spot, and do not move it around, it will get too hot as well!  The same for this dryer bonnet, because it is stationary, and you cant move it around, you will not be able to keep it on a high setting for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get hot around the neck area, but just place a towel in that area...simple fix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that it does a great job, especially for the price!  The ONLY SMALL criticism I have is that I wish the...not sure what to call it...the long part in between, that connects the dryer to the bonnet,,,I just wish that part was longer for more flexibility.  Other than that, I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started my transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  I purchased this product for deep conditioning.  I used it the first time today and found it worked wonderfully. I too used low settings because to my surprise it can get very hot.  I also used a towel around my ears and neck area. It got the job done!  Great price as well!</li>
            <li> I found that even on the low settings the heat became almost intolerable. However I was able to reach up and pull it away from my scalp to avoid the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it will do the job.</li>
            <li> It some how melted my $300 blowdryer (where the tube slips onto the blowdryer) so now it&#x27;s changed shapes and the diffuser won&#x27;t even fit on to it. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all and I&#x27;m just really thankful my hair didn&#x27;t get melted as well....</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected. I use this to dry my girlfriends hair after I re twist her dreads. She has to stay under it for an hour, but that&#x27;s normal. When she comes from under this dryer her hair is a little wet in some areas, but nothing too major.</li>
