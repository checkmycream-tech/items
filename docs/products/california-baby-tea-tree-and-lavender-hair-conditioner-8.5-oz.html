    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The product was incredibly runny.</li>
            <li>, isn&#x27;t great with tangles.    </li>
            <li>great product and one I will (and have) repurchased.</li>
            <li>Have successfully used the tea tree and lavender shampoo for years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind, but if you like a good foam this isn&#x27;t the product for you)</li>
            <li>great on my girls&#x27; hair, will order more</li>
            <li>We love the California Baby products and have had good luck with most of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother rinsing it out and her hair is nice and soft and smells SO good!!</li>
            <li>Pros: smells wonderful (which is rare for a tea tree oil product), gets the best rating possible according to Skin Deep Cosmetics rating database (excellent for someone with scalp issues not just kids) and leaves hair shiny.     </li>
            <li>Great product, no heavy feeling!!!!</li>
            <li>Has a more medicinal smell because of the tea tree.</li>
            <li>this worked better then any medicated treatment that made my son scream in pain</li>
            <li>I wanted an honest product that is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Like no fragrance conditioner better, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love California Baby products, just dislike the smell to this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Maybe that would provide better results.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Good natural product and like knowing no harmful chemicals are going on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>After shampooing I always let conditioner sit in my hair for at least 5 minutes and then comb my hair, and it didn&#x27;t do a very good job getting tangles out.</li>
            <li>I know California Baby products don&#x27;t get the best results on EWG&#x27;s site, but at least they get fairly decent scores and they convenient to find and</li>
            <li>But the smoothing powers for fine little kid hair more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li>The product leaves her hair clean and shiny, without residue or the heaviness/greasiness of adult shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all the consistency is like water - yes very runny.</li>
            <li>Leaves my baby&#x27;s hair super soft</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really doing nothing for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help untangle my daughters thin, growing hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>My main problem with this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>There is a slightly funky scent to this conditioner; it&#x27;s not bad, just unusual.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product and will get it again.</li>
            <li>My two year old still had cradle cap and was losing hair..</li>
            <li>We tried switching shampoos for my 6 year old, but nothing else worked as well for her hair.  </li>
            <li>I was completely surprised as the conditioner smells like chlorine and a swimming pool.</li>
            <li>But after rinsed out and hair towel dried her hair smells clean.</li>
            <li>Wanted a natural baby conditioner to use occasionally for my 9 month old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>only due it for her hair, using other products for body wash because it is so pricey, but worth it!</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just not sure this stuff really softens hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasting a long time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Wanted a natural baby conditioner to use occasionally for my 9 month old daughter&#x27;s hair. Bought this one for its 0 rating on ewg/skindeep website. It&#x27;s lasting a long time. I use it maybe once or twice a month on her. The smell is why I rated it a 4 star. Has a more medicinal smell because of the tea tree. But after rinsed out and hair towel dried her hair smells clean. Good natural product and like knowing no harmful chemicals are going on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Pros: smells wonderful (which is rare for a tea tree oil product), gets the best rating possible according to Skin Deep Cosmetics rating database (excellent for someone with scalp issues not just kids) and leaves hair shiny.     cons: expensive, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam well (this is a trade off for not having nasty chemicals in it - I don&#x27;t mind, but if you like a good foam this isn&#x27;t the product for you), isn&#x27;t great with tangles.    Overall I really like this product and will get it again.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed and rated this product as a 3.&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely changed my mind on this one.&lt;br /&gt;A great product and one I will (and have) repurchased.</li>
            <li> My two year old still had cradle cap and was losing hair.. this worked better then any medicated treatment that made my son scream in pain</li>
            <li> I brought this to travel to foreign rural area where children suffuer from lice. I heard tea tree prevent lice. I stayed there 10 days and intaract with children, but I didn&#x27;t get lice. I think it was working.</li>
            <li> Very runny and smells awful!  Smells like mold.after giving my girls baths my husband hugged them and asked what the mold smell was from.</li>
            <li> Tea tree and lavender are supposed to repel lice, which I did not realize when I bought this.  I just like this conditioner in my daughters hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> We tried switching shampoos for my 6 year old, but nothing else worked as well for her hair.  The product leaves her hair clean and shiny, without residue or the heaviness/greasiness of adult shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We only due it for her hair, using other products for body wash because it is so pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li> There is a slightly funky scent to this conditioner; it&#x27;s not bad, just unusual. But the smoothing powers for fine little kid hair more than makes up for it. I recommend using it as a leave in conditioner; it&#x27;s helped big time with my daughter&#x27;s tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand bc I wanted an honest product that is chemical free. I also wanted a hair product with tea tree oil, since tea tree oil repels lice... and there has been several outbreaks of lice at my childrens school and at our church. I will try anything to prevent lice! So far so good!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the California Baby reputation. I was completely surprised as the conditioner smells like chlorine and a swimming pool. $14 was expensive for one use!</li>
            <li> The product was incredibly runny. Not viscous like California Baby bought in Target.  I would caution anyone to double check sources.</li>
            <li> Have successfully used the tea tree and lavender shampoo for years. Bought this to help with tangles and for a couple of weeks couldn&#x27;t figure out what smelled so bad in the bathroom. I thought we had bad pipes. Nope. It was this conditioner. Made my daughter&#x27;s hair smell moldy too.</li>
            <li> Like no fragrance conditioner better, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> We love the California Baby products and have had good luck with most of them. I buy them mainly to stay away from dangerous chemicals. I purchased the tea tree and lavender because when I went to purchase, the other CA conditioners were not in stock. My main problem with this product is the smell. It smells like a musty basement and the odor lingers in my daughters hair. I am throwing it away because of this. Otherwise it is a satisfactory conditioner as long as you don&#x27;t have lots of tangles. I would recommend trying their other conditioners instead of this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this. I thought it would be like the shampoo but it has a weird smell to it. It never gets used unless I&#x27;m out of my other product. Love California Baby products, just dislike the smell to this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a product I can trust.  I know California Baby products don&#x27;t get the best results on EWG&#x27;s site, but at least they get fairly decent scores and they convenient to find and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not sure this stuff really softens hair.  I sort of feel like I&#x27;m just adding it last every night and it&#x27;s really doing nothing for my daughter&#x27;s hair. I haven&#x27;t tried leaving it in like it says you can do on the bottle.  Maybe that would provide better results.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner a lot!!!!  You can rinse it out or leave it in.  Great product, no heavy feeling!!!!</li>
            <li> First my hair type is thick, long, and wavy hair, not for all grownups. After using their shampoo (which I also gave it 1 star because it matted my hair) I used this conditioner. First of all the consistency is like water - yes very runny. After shampooing I always let conditioner sit in my hair for at least 5 minutes and then comb my hair, and it didn&#x27;t do a very good job getting tangles out. Also left my hair VERY DRY.</li>
            <li> great on my girls&#x27; hair, will order more</li>
            <li> Love it.. Leaves my baby&#x27;s hair super soft</li>
            <li> My son has seborrheic dermatitis and this helps me curl his hair while not having to worry about a break out. Love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help untangle my daughters thin, growing hair and it works great. It has also helped get rid of the remaining cradle cap.  I don&#x27;t bother rinsing it out and her hair is nice and soft and smells SO good!!</li>
