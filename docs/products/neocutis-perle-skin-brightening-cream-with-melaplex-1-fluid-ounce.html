            <li> This product has really lightened my lingering melasma from previous pregnancies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent large sums of money on over-the-counter products at Saks and Nordstroms for years with little result.</li>
            <li> But I cannot afford this over the long term.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have the same tight skin I had back then</li>
            <li> It is a fine product and less expensive overall than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> She said to use 2 times/day to fade brown aging spots on my face and purplish colored scars on my legs due to mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> It also lightened some spots from sun damage although not as much as my other areas of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Like this, Brightens the skin, does not remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had used Clinique Dark Spot reducer, I will continue with Clinique</li>
            <li> In addition to wearing sunscreen and exfoliating a few times a week.</li>
            <li> it helps out little and slow nothing dramatically like hydroquinone and tretinoin.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> It works at least as well as a prescription product I have used in the past without the harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> With all the products and confusing ads on the market, this one delivers what it markets.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, and it is too expensive compare to other brigthening cream.  </li>
            <li> I really think this is a bad jar of Perle by Neocutis!  </li>
            <li> but the one I ordered online seems weird &amp; has a bad smell to it.  </li>

            <li> I bought this product on recommendation by my dermatologist.  Her office cost for the product was $30 more expensive than what I paid on Amazon. She said to use 2 times/day to fade brown aging spots on my face and purplish colored scars on my legs due to mosquito bites. Well,the facial spots still seem to be noticeable to me. The scars on my legs are just about gone.  It worked like magic on my legs!</li>

I feel like someone filled a &amp;#34;fake jar&amp;#34; with some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; Perle lotion!!??  Has anyone else experienced this with ordering online?</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and makes her skin feel great too.</li>

            <li> I like this brightening cream.  It really does help in fading dark spots better than any other product I have tried.  I would definitely recommend.</li>

It does exactly what they told. it helps out little and slow nothing dramatically like hydroquinone and tretinoin. It is very nice moisturizer when I don&#x27;t have any major problem on my skin but it won&#x27;t do as much as hydroquinone and tretinoin. I&#x27;ll buy again if I were pregnant or breast feeding but if not I&#x27;ll stick to Obagi blender and tretinoin.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL! I&#x27;ve saw NO changes since I started using it! Cheap stuff at Wal-Mart works better than this</li>
            <li> This product has really lightened my lingering melasma from previous pregnancies.

            <li> Good product, very expensive .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now &amp; haven&#x27;t seen much difference. Hoping that this might change the longer I use it</li>
            <li> Received product as advertised. Its been a month, I am still using it but haven&#x27;t seen any result yet. Hopefully it will work.</li>
            <li> This skin brightening cream really helped me with Shamberg Disease...it lightened up my legs and some of my brown spots!</li>
            <li> Love it, my dematologist recommend this cream for my melasma. price point is A+. I recommend this product, seeing major improvement.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, and it is too expensive compare to other brigthening cream.  I would never recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> i have used this consistently since summer with no visible results. i hoped it would reduce the appearance of melasma on my face. no luck.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 1 month ago. Because of the price I was hoping for results that were visible right away. Throughout the month the dark spots have faded a bit but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much unless you want to go broke using is for a very long time.  It is a very good moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of brightening but as I said I only used the 1 fluid ounce.  But I cannot afford this over the long term.  Check out Cosmetic Solutions for really super duper products that truly perform and...... that are affordable!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a tremendous difference but my friends did. I think it works well for some people. You just have to try it for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using neocutis for two years now. My Doctor recommended it to me and I am very happy with it. Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> Dr. Told me to use it after lazer surgery?  It works well on red and news scars.  You should try it.</li>
            <li> Great deal, authentic product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Does lighten spots but it takes time, using it twice a day. In addition to wearing sunscreen and exfoliating a few times a week. I&#x27;ve went through 2 bottles already.</li>
