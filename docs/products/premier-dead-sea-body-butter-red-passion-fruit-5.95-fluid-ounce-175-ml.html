            <li>I still feel it&#x27;s worth the asking price so to find it cheaper is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I just ordered another one, because I am running out already.</li>
            <li>Feels like glass, fancy top, not plasticy at all.</li>
            <li>and I see her using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I love the Premier Ded Sea products</li>
            <li>Although, I do like the smell of &amp;#34;Milk &amp; Honey&amp;#34; better than the &amp;#34;Pasion Fruit&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love the feel, the texture, of this product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; Smooth Transaction!</li>
            <li>The best non-greasy deep moisturizer I have found.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd time I have bought it for her and everytime she is happy to get more.</li>
            <li>Product seems fine.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, Premier Dead Sea is the BEST Body Butter on the market.</li>
            <li>I ordered online because it&#x27;s such a great price for what it does for the skin...</li>
            <li>I have suffered from Eczema for over 5 years and have taken just about every prescription medication and over the counter cream available to no avail.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>I am easily put off by scented lotion and rarely use any with a scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have often experienced problems with breakouts or flare-ups with other moisturizers, but have had none since I started using this.</li>
            <li>super silky feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect in the winter for hands and other areas that you wash frequently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li>When I ran out I tried to find more of it at the local mall where I had originally purchased it and they had the premier products but not his hand and body cream.  </li>
            <li>Also this is the same quality as the stuff from the kiosks, it has this melting silk texture and it is very moisturizing with a nice smell, nothing over powering.</li>
            <li>and I just finished it and needed a new jar, it lasted me two years!!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love Premier products and use them daily.</li>
            <li>pretty beat up.</li>
            <li>This product goes for $50 at the mall and that is what I paid for my first bottle.</li>
            <li>No inside liner, certainly seemed to be a return.  </li>
            <li>The scent is gentle.  </li>
            <li>is a lightly fragranced body butter that I began using as a facial cream when I ran out of what I used before.  </li>
            <li>Or, as a friend of mine would say, it&#x27;s some &amp;#34;High-end hoe sh*t.&amp;#34; The container is nice and HEAVY.</li>
            <li>Really good product for dry, dry skin.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend lives this stuff so much, but the mall price tag on it only allowed me to buy it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>This was just what I expected it to be, came in a timely manner, and the seller was very quick to rectify a problem created by the USPS.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;</li>
            <li>Aborbs quickly, but lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li>this is the exact same stuff they sell at the mall kiosks for $30-$40 a piece.</li>
            <li>And the product itself is very velvety with a subtle sexy scent to it.</li>
            <li>but I find that it is rapidly absorbed in by my somewhat dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Then I found it at Amazon and on top of that the price was much less than I had paid for it last year.</li>
            <li>is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;</li>
            <li>And, my skin feels so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and the smell is so soft and calming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and last for a long time.</li>

            <li> just as expected thank you.......</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and will want more if you start using this product.</li>
            <li> The effects last at least 24 hours, if not longer.  </li>
            <li> I do like the Premier  Dead Sea Body Butter.</li>
            <li> Some have said that it is heavy or oily</li>
            <li> I use this with Dead Sea Salt  Scrub which is helping to control psoriasis.</li>
            <li> only way I would give a bad review</li>

            <li> I love this lotion, I just ordered another one, because I am running out already.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fancy. Or, as a friend of mine would say, it&#x27;s some &amp;#34;High-end hoe sh*t.&amp;#34; The container is nice and HEAVY. Feels like glass, fancy top, not plasticy at all. And the product itself is very velvety with a subtle sexy scent to it. Great moisturizer, leaves you all smooth and touchable.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for about a year now and just loves it. This is the 3rd time I have bought it for her and everytime she is happy to get more. Amazon had a great price on it and I see her using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I love the Premier Ded Sea products</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin is so dry that it qualifies for caps-lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this stuff helps.  It feels like it sinks in rather than just hanging out on my skin&#x27;s surface, waiting to be washed off the next time I wash my hands.  I notice fewer hangnails and my skin isn&#x27;t so tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I do like the Premier  Dead Sea Body Butter. It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Softens my skin and leaves it feeling oh-so smooth~&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order another jar before I use all of the cream in my current one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not greasy but leaves a very nice glow.</li>
            <li> The scent is gentle.  It doesn&#x27;t over power.  I am easily put off by scented lotion and rarely use any with a scent.  But, this one smells great!  And, my skin feels so soft after using it.  The effects last at least 24 hours, if not longer.  It&#x27;s my new favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Premier Dead Sea is the BEST Body Butter on the market. Although, I do like the smell of &amp;#34;Milk &amp; Honey&amp;#34; better than the &amp;#34;Pasion Fruit&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year it is woderful on the skin it is absorbed well no greasy residue and the fragrance is also beautiful that is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered online because it&#x27;s such a great price for what it does for the skin...I recommend it 100%. I have been using it for over a year now and once I started using it, I was impressed with how it helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Love Premier products and use them daily.</li>

            <li> This was just what I expected it to be, came in a timely manner, and the seller was very quick to rectify a problem created by the USPS.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lightly fragranced body butter that I began using as a facial cream when I ran out of what I used before.

            <li> I use this with Dead Sea Salt  Scrub which is helping to control psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Product seems fine.  2 star is for the condition of the jar.  Scratched,  pretty beat up. No inside liner, certainly seemed to be a return.  Do I want to use an open jar that was previously used?</li>
            <li> just as expected thank you.......</li>
            <li> great stuff, super silky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Eczema for over 5 years and have taken just about every prescription medication and over the counter cream available to no avail. I spotted this company at a kiosk at the mall and deciced to give this a try with the Sea Salt scrub.  In 3 days my eczema was gone.  I paid an arm and leg at the mall, it was great to see how resonable it was via Amazon.  If you suffer from eczema this is the best cure on the market!</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and in good condition. It is not greasy and glides on your skin lasting for hours. This product goes for $50 at the mall and that is what I paid for my first bottle. I still feel it&#x27;s worth the asking price so to find it cheaper is a great bargain.

            <li> I purchased this hand and body cream and Premier Sea Salt last Christmas for myself and as gifts.  The combination of using the sea salt and cream on my hands is remarkable.  This hand and and body cream is the best I have ever used.  When I ran out I tried to find more of it at the local mall where I had originally purchased it and they had the premier products but not his hand and body cream.  Then I found it at Amazon and on top of that the price was much less than I had paid for it last year.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC VALUE!!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast &amp; Smooth Transaction!</li>
            <li> this is the exact same stuff they sell at the mall kiosks for $30-$40 a piece. my girlfriend lives this stuff so much, but the mall price tag on it only allowed me to buy it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff! We were  in Key West and got pulled into this store trying to hock this stuff to us for $135! Found It here on Amazon for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For the wife&#x27;s birthday. I presume it is good since it has very good reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Keeps skin soft and last for a long time. I will purchase this item again in the future..</li>
            <li> my skin didn&#x27;t like this one,but I do use other premier with no trouble</li>

Also this is the same quality as the stuff from the kiosks, it has this melting silk texture and it is very moisturizing with a nice smell, nothing over powering.</li>
            <li> Really good product for dry, dry skin.</li>
