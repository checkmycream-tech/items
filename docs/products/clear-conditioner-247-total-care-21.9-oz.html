            <li> I love this product and Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve seen it available in these huge sizes. The drug stores only sell it in the smaller size and charge the same price for less. Why pay more for less? This just made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing. It is most similar to the original shine collection series that Herbal Essences came out with (which has been re-launched...awesome)&lt;br /&gt;But this product cleans better. My hair feels much softer and healthier. I have pretty thick, healthy hair anyway, but this just makes it feel almost as good as when I walk out of the Salon. (I think our hair feels so awesome after the salon mainly because we are still elated about the mini scalp massage we got with the shampooing &amp; conditioning)&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product is very nice. It&#x27;s not super heavy &amp; waxy like that pro-v stuff.</li>
            <li> Conditioner works great along with the shampoo, smells good and it&#x27;s gentle on your scalp. My hair is never tangled after I use this product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.  I can&#x27;t get it locally, so I order it from Amazon.  It makes my curly frizzy hair smooth and leaves it looking clean for several days.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I buy the shampoo and conditioner together its a little pricey but well worth it it has fixed my dry damaged hair after a week of using it, about 3 times in the week and when used with the shampoo it makes a big difference well worht the money</li>
            <li> See my review for under the shampoo. I have thick long curly coarse hair. This helps with strength, fullness, silky. A close second to It&#x27;s a 10. So for the money this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this line of shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s a staple in my shower and I like the option of having a larger bottle. The pump is also a plus.</li>
            <li> After running out of my first bottle, I went back to other shampoos and conditioners.  My hair immediately felt the brunt of this and had a difficult month or two because of the winter months and everything being so dry.  After going back to this shampoo and conditioner, I feel my hair has life again and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> used it 3 times a week, it helped my scalp and my hair.  Would buy it again.  I may try the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner after reading an internet article comparing low-cost conditions and shampoos that recommended this brand. I love it and have had several people comment on how nice my hair smells. You can buy this conditioner at Walmart, but the Amazon price is a little cheaper so I generally buy it here. I use this shampoo, too. My hair is long and this conditioner does a good job of allowing me to comb out the tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Wife is loving them all and seems to rinse out quickly, leaving hair more vibrant and easily to control. Great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Easy to use, the pump works great, so much easier than a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this brand of shampoo and conditioner for my oily hair. He explained that oily hair can be the result of your body producing too much oil in response to a dry scalp; thus, treating a dry scalp can often help with reducing the oiliness of your hair. I decided to give this conditioner (along with the shampoo) a try and was very pleased with the results. My hair is noticeably less oily than it was before! I would strongly recommend this conditioner to anyone struggling with oily hair or dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It made my hair soft n shiny.  I use both shampoo n conditioner with the deep conitioner too.  What a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past year and my hair has been falling out in strands, the front of my hair line is now so thin, I thought need to go see my doctor.  But then now I see all the reviews, I guess that solved the mystery.  I am definitely going to stop using it immediately, hopefully, my hair will start growing back!!!!  I can&#x27;t believe they put this on the market.</li>
            <li> I love that this product comes in a larger bottle with a pump.  Just wish that the shampoo and conditioner bottles were different colors, so it would be easier to distinguish them from one another.</li>
            <li> Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it has a fresh smell and leaves my hair feeling cleansed and soft.  I like that I can buy this on amazon in a larger size and save money!</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Aside from its AMAZINGLY FABOULOUS SCENT, this shampoo &amp; conditioner works very well for my hair. My hair feels so hydrated &amp; brand new after every use. And the scent lasts for dayssss!!! I absolutely love this brand.</li>
            <li> Its awesome👌👌👌💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😘😘😘😊😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised that my hair stays clean longer after using this brand shampoo + conditioner. I usually wash my hair every other day. When using this brand shampoo + conditioner, I can reduce washing my hair to every 2-3 days! :)</li>
            <li> Clear works really well.  Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I have had lots of people compliment on how great it looks.</li>
            <li> This bottle is filled will horrible chemicals and caused massive breakout. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this product like the plague...seriously!</li>
            <li> loved this with the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> I WILL BE TRAVELLING FOR 3 MONTHS SO I BOUGHT ALL MY TOILETRIES (SHAMPOO AND CONDOTIONER, LOTION, SOAP,FEMININE WASH)ONLINE.I WAS SO IMPRESSED ABOUT THE FAST DELIVERIES AND PACKAGING OF MY ORDERS..THEY ALL WRAP IT IN PLASTIC SO IT&#x27;S LEAKED PROOF!! THANKS AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner reminds me of the Herbal Essences conditioner that got discontinued a couple years ago...I think it really runs smoothly through my hair while conditioning it in the shower.  Love this product.  :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!!  I used Pantene before and when I made the switch I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my hair and scalp felt. My hair is soft and smells like heaven!</li>
            <li> Not best, but satisfactory</li>
