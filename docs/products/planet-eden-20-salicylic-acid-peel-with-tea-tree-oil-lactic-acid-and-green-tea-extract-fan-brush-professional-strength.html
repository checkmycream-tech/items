            <li>Also they customer service is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Instead of using it as a peel, I dilute mix 1 part Salicylic Acid with 5 parts witch hazel and 2 parts purified water in a spray bottle for an excellent acne control system.</li>
            <li>Excellent peel.</li>
            <li>For experienced peelers, this is an awesome in between/maintenance peel.  </li>

            <li>All in all, a really good purchase for anyone looking for help with oily skin and acne marks.</li>
            <li>But all in all the immediate results are good</li>
            <li>Good product though.</li>
            <li>and this works so good for me</li>
            <li>If I use it all over it is still to strong for me but works great those stubborn cyst that just don&#x27;t seem to go away and helps decrease the inflammation.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this product is very, very good at controlling oil, and give you a nice mild peel.</li>
            <li>Very important to use sunscreen and a good moisturizer too.</li>
            <li>my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I think this work best to use as a spot treatment for me on the cystic acne that really hurts.  </li>
            <li>The price is more than fair for the product.</li>
            <li>But it does peel effectively and faster than the glycolic peel.</li>
            <li>It is very strong</li>
            <li>I love this acid peel because of its many uses!</li>
            <li>more you use this, the more your pores seem to shrink too!</li>
            <li>I have tried many popular brands with out results.</li>
            <li>I was able to tolerate it for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Make sure you have your cotton pads and Neutralizing Solution</li>
            <li>Love Planet Eden products.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering this product again!! :)</li>
            <li>Any more..</li>
            <li>Clears up the skin nicely, leaving it more evenly toned and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the ingredients in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the results.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to follow the instructions that come with it.  </li>
            <li>After four treatments, this has not stopped the cysts from forming, but it has made them more manageable.</li>
            <li>I am in wholehearted love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>They cleared my acne up a bit, and evened out my complexion, also making my skin smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li>I will buy as many products from them that I can.</li>
            <li>Had to apply more.</li>
            <li>I love how this peel is alcohol based and not gel based.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure when I start using it more often and taking better care of my skin</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with Salicylic acid and because my neutralizing spray was not delivered on time, instead of using the Glycolic peel I had also purchased, I used this peel instead.</li>
            <li>Although many users will use this one their face, it is wonderful on ingrown hair on other areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT:  </li>
            <li>and I am cyst free.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my order and will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li>The day after, you should lightly exfoliate with a scrub.</li>
            <li>This peel is really a great one to use, especially for ingrown hairs and acne.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The peel is easy to use and will start working right after I put it on.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you are actually ready for 20%.</li>
            <li>It can take a while of use to get full results.</li>
            <li>Burns too much for fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product was great at reducing my black heads and clearing my acne.  </li>
            <li>I also love to use this peel on my legs too because it makes it super soft and more clear toned and  radiant than before using the acid peel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as strong and effective as other brands.</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth try.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Have fun with this one.</li>
            <li>Still worth it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, 30 seconds, or one minute at the most for the first time on new skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried this our the other day and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I splashed lukewarm water on my face for about 10 minutes gently massaging my skins with my hands and afterward my skin felt hot but smooth.</li>
            <li>i use it more frequently than the bottle says but its worked really really well for me.</li>
            <li>I used this mainly on my back and within a few treatments my acne was GREATLY reduced!!</li>
            <li>but then it heals super fast.</li>
            <li>In the morning the inflammation from my cystic acne was very much diminished.</li>
            <li>It will also dry faster and frost faster than the previous gel peel that I used by Perfect Skin Labs.</li>
            <li>Perfect Image one was a little thicker formula so it stayed exactly on my face where I put it and for as long as I wanted it there.  </li>
            <li>This was my fault though, since I should&#x27;ve started out with the 15% first salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to get it on the skin next to your nostrils!</li>
            <li>I am a licensed medical esthetician and have used many, many different types of peels.</li>
            <li>I have used TONS, ok TONS, of treatments for my back and nothing will work.</li>
            <li>It seems like every time I use more products my back just gets tougher so that it wont let anything work.</li>
            <li>It just makes your face feel really hot</li>
            <li>I felt my skin and its smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This would have been my beginners choice when I first started peels.  </li>
            <li>I think this is due to the layers of skin peeling off making the clogged pore more accessible.</li>
            <li>It really fades excess pigmentation and cleans the hell out of your pores!</li>
            <li>It is priced higher than this one.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>because when  you first use it, you may notice a bit of peeling...</li>
            <li>But I had to do it on a weekly basis to keep these results, and eventually my skin began to regress a bit, even though I stayed consistent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definently purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have had on and off breakouts for as long as I can remember and this has left my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Do the first peel for under a minute, and then dab your face gently with the solution.  </li>
            <li>Almost too strong starting out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this weekly for oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve cut back on sugar, which can only help more :-)  </li>
            <li>ready</li>
            <li>I really like the salicylic acid peel 20% from planet Eden</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well</li>
            <li>thanks again planet Eden</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolute junk.</li>
            <li>For example, last night, what would normally have become a full-blown cyst, I was able to squeeze out as a hard &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; before it was able to get really inflamed.</li>
            <li>but it is important to do the skin patch test especially for someone who has sensitive skin and never had a chemical peel before.</li>
            <li>I have tried Proactive, many different face washes, tea tree and lavender essential oils, but cysts have kept coming.</li>
            <li>I mainly got this product to shrink the pores on my legs</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this I recommend that you use a really good moisturizer ( not too oily or too thick, like c.booth 4 in 1 Multi Action Body Lotion)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne as I am too old for it now (45) but have oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>My face looks different from the first time of use.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be red for the first day or so, so moisturize and wait.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid 50&#x27;s male and have way too many sun spots especially on my forehead and some bug pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>No longer did it clear my acne, or control the oil.  </li>
            <li>all the flakey skin and irritation is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>if you have really sensitive skin, I would recommend using a lower percentage, but I intend to up my percentage as I go along using this.</li>
            <li>WOW what a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>(Professional Chemical Peel)&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is one of the few products that actually gets rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>After the first use my area is so much clearer and the bumps have drastically gone down and it seems to have cleared up 75% of the issue.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive to it if left on for too long.</li>
            <li>I like their 30% version better, this is just not nearly strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>I also like the other essential oils added to the peel to give it an overall better application experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past three weeks, twice a week at most, and although I do still breakout as per usual, the breakouts clear up much quicker than they normally would.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 45 seconds the first time and it really irritated a few areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I am giving this product five stars because it is the only thing that has cleared my hormonal acne (36 yrs old).  </li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne, and this is the only facial peel that has completely diminished the cysts that form on my face.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on myself and some other family members with oily during this humid, hot summer, and thus far breakouts have been controlled if not completely eliminated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 75% glycolic and 80% lactic acid peels that haven&#x27;t done half as much work for my skin than that of this 20% salicylic peel.</li>
            <li>The results after my first use were tighter, less oily skin, and marked improvement with post-acne marks, which NEVER occurred with the other peels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>advise that you wash your face gently before use, and put a little Vaseline around your nostrils, eyes, and mouth.</li>

            <li> My face looks different from the first time of use.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be red for the first day or so, so moisturize and wait.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid 50&#x27;s male and have way too many sun spots especially on my forehead and some bug pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> No longer did it clear my acne, or control the oil.  </li>
            <li> all the flakey skin and irritation is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> if you have really sensitive skin, I would recommend using a lower percentage, but I intend to up my percentage as I go along using this.</li>
            <li> WOW what a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> (Professional Chemical Peel)&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is one of the few products that actually gets rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> After the first use my area is so much clearer and the bumps have drastically gone down and it seems to have cleared up 75% of the issue.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive to it if left on for too long.</li>
            <li> I like their 30% version better, this is just not nearly strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> I also like the other essential oils added to the peel to give it an overall better application experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past three weeks, twice a week at most, and although I do still breakout as per usual, the breakouts clear up much quicker than they normally would.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 45 seconds the first time and it really irritated a few areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product five stars because it is the only thing that has cleared my hormonal acne (36 yrs old).  </li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, and this is the only facial peel that has completely diminished the cysts that form on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on myself and some other family members with oily during this humid, hot summer, and thus far breakouts have been controlled if not completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 75% glycolic and 80% lactic acid peels that haven&#x27;t done half as much work for my skin than that of this 20% salicylic peel.</li>
            <li> The results after my first use were tighter, less oily skin, and marked improvement with post-acne marks, which NEVER occurred with the other peels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> advise that you wash your face gently before use, and put a little Vaseline around your nostrils, eyes, and mouth.</li>
            <li> Plus it only burns for as long as you leave it on.</li>
            <li> I voted this &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars is because I found it to be a little too thin and runny.</li>
            <li> Although it really tingles &amp; burns, definitly hard to get used to, that &amp; it will make your skin a little worse before it gets better by bringing dirt &amp; oil to the surface.</li>
            <li> Put on a little Vaseline or cocoa butter after if your skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Got to use it a few times to really life these stubborn dark spots.</li>
            <li> just minor tingling no redness.</li>
            <li> The peel also does not burn as long as the gel peel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this too long</li>
            <li> : my oily skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but my skin has seemed a little bit less oily than usual.</li>
            <li> I have way less breakouts and far less blackheads now that I use this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very noticeable but it does tend to dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry because I don&#x27;t do so well at keeping moisturizer on it</li>
            <li> It may sting, and your face will turn a little red, but it works.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with this peel.</li>
            <li> AND it arrived waaaayyyy sooner than expected, by atleast a week.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this, no real results yet.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, because you will be RED for a few days.</li>
            <li> There was an initial purge that brought out a lot of &amp;#34;dormant&amp;#34; cysts, but they too have been shrinking little by little after each peel.</li>
            <li> (Antibiotics work for me, but they are just a temporary fix to a lifelong problem; it&#x27;s not healthy to take antibiotics for a long period of time.)</li>
            <li> It took at least two months, but I definitely see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Results in less than a week</li>
            <li> had previously purchased Salicylic Acid</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and clearer and slightly less oily.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to see how this helps my scarring a few weeks down the road.</li>
            <li> Face burned a little.</li>
            <li> Next time I am going to tough it out and leave it on a little longer.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look terrible the first time or two you use it, and you will need some high powered moisturizer (I use Nivea), but keep using it once a week and your skin will thank you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Almost too strong starting out. It&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li> I used it for my dermatitis on my chin, cheeks, and forehead on friday night and sunday morning all the flakey skin and irritation is almost completely gone. I was able to tolerate it for 5 minutes but I have had a couple of chemical peels with my dermatologist before this one. I will definitely continue using this. I highly recommend it but it is important to do the skin patch test especially for someone who has sensitive skin and never had a chemical peel before. Very important to use sunscreen and a good moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> Not as strong and effective as other brands.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this peel. I left it on for about 45 seconds the first time and it really irritated a few areas of my face. This was my fault though, since I should&#x27;ve started out with the 15% first salicylic acid peel. Make sure not to get it on the skin next to your nostrils! If you&#x27;re looking for a 20% peel, this one is great. Just make sure that you are actually ready for 20%.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed medical esthetician and have used many, many different types of peels. I have to say that this product is very, very good at controlling oil, and give you a nice mild peel. I have been using this on myself and some other family members with oily during this humid, hot summer, and thus far breakouts have been controlled if not completely eliminated. Give this product a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product five stars because it is the only thing that has cleared my hormonal acne (36 yrs old).  I used to be on OTC BC pill, but it stopped working for me all of a sudden after three years.  No longer did it clear my acne, or control the oil.  I&#x27;ve tried sulphur soap, tea tree oil, Phisoderm, Clearasil, limiting Omega 6, upping my water, using paper towels to dry my face (cutting back on bacteria from towels); you name it.  What finally worked in conjunction with the Peel was drinking 64 oz of water a day, using Phisoderm or olive oil soap to wash my face, using a clay mask twice a week, and using witch hazel for an astringent as needed.  Recently, I&#x27;ve cut back on sugar, which can only help more :-)  It took at least two months, but I definitely see an improvement. Less hard, under the surface, pimples, and less redness.&lt;br /&gt;I advise that you wash your face gently before use, and put a little Vaseline around your nostrils, eyes, and mouth. IMPORTANT:  Make sure you have your cotton pads and Neutralizing Solution ready (I use a cup of water w/2 spoonfuls of baking soda) before you start.  Use your fan brush and go SLOW.  Do the first peel for under a minute, and then dab your face gently with the solution.  It may sting, and your face will turn a little red, but it works.  Put on a little Vaseline or cocoa butter after if your skin is sensitive.  Use SPF also.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the performance of this peel. Works great for the price point!</li>
            <li> i use it more frequently than the bottle says but its worked really really well for me. going up to 30% next. Love Planet Eden products.</li>
            <li> Iam now 29 &amp; I have suffered from acne, acne scars &amp; just nasty clogged pores as long as I can remember &amp; Ive tried it all. This stuff is my miracle product. I have used it once a week for 4 weeks now &amp; their is a 90% improvement in my skin. My pores have cleared out, my acne scars are clearing up &amp; my complexion has evened out. Although it really tingles &amp; burns, definitly hard to get used to, that &amp; it will make your skin a little worse before it gets better by bringing dirt &amp; oil to the surface. If you suffer from acne with no resolve, try this. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I used this mainly on my back and within a few treatments my acne was GREATLY reduced!! I have used TONS, ok TONS, of treatments for my back and nothing will work. It seems like every time I use more products my back just gets tougher so that it wont let anything work. THIS WORKED. if you have really sensitive skin, I would recommend using a lower percentage, but I intend to up my percentage as I go along using this. AND it arrived waaaayyyy sooner than expected, by atleast a week. I was incredibly happy with that! Will be ordering this product again!! :)</li>
            <li> this product burned my skin and only had it on less than 2 minutes!!!! my face is still red all over a week after using it!!!! i do not recommend this to anyone!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, and this is the only facial peel that has completely diminished the cysts that form on my face. It burns like crazy but not any worse than a sunburn. Plus it only burns for as long as you leave it on. Results in less than a week and I am cyst free.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get use to this peel.  If you are a beginner start out slow and follow the directions.  I think this work best to use as a spot treatment for me on the cystic acne that really hurts.  If I use it all over it is still to strong for me but works great those stubborn cyst that just don&#x27;t seem to go away and helps decrease the inflammation.  It took a while to figure out how it works best for me but I think it is worth try.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order today,so i used it as soon as i opened it,WOW what a difference in my skin. Its soft,smooth,and not oily. Any more.. i wish i would of ordered this years ago....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 75% glycolic and 80% lactic acid peels that haven&#x27;t done half as much work for my skin than that of this 20% salicylic peel. The results after my first use were tighter, less oily skin, and marked improvement with post-acne marks, which NEVER occurred with the other peels I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past three weeks, twice a week at most, and although I do still breakout as per usual, the breakouts clear up much quicker than they normally would. There was an initial purge that brought out a lot of &amp;#34;dormant&amp;#34; cysts, but they too have been shrinking little by little after each peel. And if you know anything about cystic acne, you know just how incredibly difficult it is to get rid of it! The ONLY problem I have with this peel is the use of Tea Tree Oil in it. My skin is super sensitive to it if left on for too long. Fortunately, I only leave it on for 2-5 minutes and then neutralize the heck out of my skin afterwards, so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. The price is more than fair for the product. All in all, a really good purchase for anyone looking for help with oily skin and acne marks.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all! It just makes your face feel really hot that is all nothing eles it does I am very mad I had wasted my money on this!.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this, no real results yet.</li>
            <li> So I just purchased this and I used it as soon as it came. I did the patch test and im like theres no burning just minor tingling no redness. So I say to myself I can take this. So later on I applied the peel and I started tingling and burning but it is worth it. I felt my skin and its smooth and soft. And I also recommend SPF 100. I have acne very bad and the inflammation has subsided. I am impressed but however they say you can do maybe 10-15 peels we will see about that. But all in all the immediate results are good I will do an update later.</li>
            <li> Burns too much for fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Got to use it a few times to really life these stubborn dark spots. But it does peel effectively and faster than the glycolic peel.</li>
            <li> It delivers as promised.</li>
            <li> This item sucks. ...didn&#x27;t work for me. Returning trying another seller</li>
            <li> It works. My face looks different from the first time of use.</li>
            <li> I tried it. The acid frosted. I did it twice. And I saw no change whatsoever. It might work for some people but simply didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am very familiar with Salicylic acid and because my neutralizing spray was not delivered on time, instead of using the Glycolic peel I had also purchased, I used this peel instead. Oh boy did this stuff burn. I left on for only 2 minutes and as I was rinsing it off I felt like the burning would never stop but within 5 minutes, this subsided and started to feel a layer of gunk sluff off my face while I rinsed. I splashed lukewarm water on my face for about 10 minutes gently massaging my skins with my hands and afterward my skin felt hot but smooth. I put the retinol serum sold by Planet Eden on and within 20 minutes my skin felt amazing. In the morning the inflammation from my cystic acne was very much diminished. Next time I am going to tough it out and leave it on a little longer. Currently awaiting the Antioxidant Recovery Cream and neutralizer so I can try the glycolic acid. Cant wait to see how this helps my scarring a few weeks down the road.</li>
            <li> I like their 30% version better, this is just not nearly strong enough for me. Good product though.</li>
            <li> I tried this our the other day and loved it.  For experienced peelers, this is an awesome in between/maintenance peel.  This would be one of those peels I would use before my monthly breakout.  Clears up the skin nicely, leaving it more evenly toned and smooth.  This would have been my beginners choice when I first started peels.  I don&#x27;t know how I missed it here on Amazon.  I love all of the ingredients in this stuff.  So now, I will use it as a my maintenance peel, and let my teenager use some for clearer skin.  Though I do warn, it does have lactic acid so a neutralizer is necessary, hell neutralize with ANY peel, I mean c&#x27;mon what does baking soda cost now a days - 60 cents a box. Anyway, 30 seconds, or one minute at the most for the first time on new skin.  You&#x27;ll be red for the first day or so, so moisturize and wait.  You&#x27;ll love the results.  Don&#x27;t be inpatient with peels some of them you won&#x27;t see the results for two days depending on your skin type.  I was inpatient and learned the hard way.  Have fun with this one.</li>
            <li> This product was great at reducing my black heads and clearing my acne.  I would use it.  It is very strong so be sure to follow the instructions that come with it.  ~Sam Mraovich, Licensed Cosmetologist</li>
            <li> I really like the salicylic acid peel 20% from planet Eden I have oily Skin and this works so good for me I am extremely happy with my order and will definitely order again when I run out. Fast shipping as well thanks again planet Eden</li>
            <li> I had this product on for 3 to 4 seconds and it left my skin so blistered I looked like I had second degree burns for a week.</li>
            <li> I am a 26-year-old woman who has had cystic acne on my face and back for 10 years. I have tried Proactive, many different face washes, tea tree and lavender essential oils, but cysts have kept coming. (Antibiotics work for me, but they are just a temporary fix to a lifelong problem; it&#x27;s not healthy to take antibiotics for a long period of time.) After four treatments, this has not stopped the cysts from forming, but it has made them more manageable. For example, last night, what would normally have become a full-blown cyst, I was able to squeeze out as a hard &amp;#34;plug&amp;#34; before it was able to get really inflamed. I think this is due to the layers of skin peeling off making the clogged pore more accessible. Hopefully with continued treatments, my pores will open up even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: my oily skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but my skin has seemed a little bit less oily than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of at home peels for my oily, acne-marked skin. This is the best! The results are like having a facial! Be careful though, because you will be RED for a few days. I also peel a lot after, but I understand that this depends on your skin type. It really fades excess pigmentation and cleans the hell out of your pores! Oh and it stings pretty badly. Still worth it.</li>
            <li> I voted this &amp;#34;it&#x27;s ok&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars is because I found it to be a little too thin and runny. It was running off my face even though I used a rather sparingly amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously purchased Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional Chemical Peel)&lt;br /&gt;by PERFECT IMAGE.&lt;br /&gt;The Perfect Image one was a little thicker formula so it stayed exactly on my face where I put it and for as long as I wanted it there.  It is priced higher than this one.&lt;br /&gt;Both formulas performed well though.</li>
            <li> I love this acid peel because of its many uses! I have had on and off breakouts for as long as I can remember and this has left my face nice and smooth. It also works to even out the skin tone on my face as well. I also love to use this peel on my legs too because it makes it super soft and more clear toned and  radiant than before using the acid peel.&lt;br /&gt;The more you use this, the more your pores seem to shrink too! I mainly got this product to shrink the pores on my legs and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this I recommend that you use a really good moisturizer ( not too oily or too thick, like c.booth 4 in 1 Multi Action Body Lotion) because when  you first use it, you may notice a bit of peeling...it&#x27;s not very noticeable but it does tend to dry your skin out.  The day after, you should lightly exfoliate with a scrub. Also I recommend doing a treatment before you go to bed so that you can give your skin a break and allow the moisturizer you use to hydrate your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this product and I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> It hurts like crap, but this is the ONLY thing that has ever cleared up my cystic acne, and I&#x27;ve tried everything. Your skin will look terrible the first time or two you use it, and you will need some high powered moisturizer (I use Nivea), but keep using it once a week and your skin will thank you. I am in wholehearted love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> As an 18 year old bodybuilder with terrible acne, I can say that these peels did help. They cleared my acne up a bit, and evened out my complexion, also making my skin smoother and more even toned. But I had to do it on a weekly basis to keep these results, and eventually my skin began to regress a bit, even though I stayed consistent. I would still recommend though.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin... But Amazon credited my C.C. Immediately., did not even make me return it.</li>
            <li> Burns like hell. I have sensitive acne prone skin. It helps a lot. I break out the following day but then it heals super fast. I have way less breakouts and far less blackheads now that I use this.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is one of the few products that actually gets rid of my acne. I have tried many popular brands with out results. It can take a while of use to get full results. Also they customer service is awesome. I will buy as many products from them that I can. Great product!</li>
            <li> Instead of using it as a peel, I dilute mix 1 part Salicylic Acid with 5 parts witch hazel and 2 parts purified water in a spray bottle for an excellent acne control system.</li>
            <li> Did nothing. Had to apply more. Face burned a little. I can tell you after using this product, I actually GOT A WRINKLE! This stuff is absolute junk. I&#x27;ve done peels for 15 years and this stuff did burn, but I did not peel. So, of course since I did not peel I got a wrinkle of all places around my mouth. This is something I was trying to avoid. I would not consider buying again or recommending.</li>
            <li> I have been using this weekly for oily skin and large pores. I don&#x27;t have acne as I am too old for it now (45) but have oily skin and large pores. I do see a difference. My skin looks brighter and clearer and slightly less oily. I don&#x27;t notice any peeling when using it for 4 minutes every week. Overall, I think this does what it says. Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent peel. I love how this peel is alcohol based and not gel based. The peel is easy to use and will start working right after I put it on. It will also dry faster and frost faster than the previous gel peel that I used by Perfect Skin Labs. The peel also does not burn as long as the gel peel. I also like the other essential oils added to the peel to give it an overall better application experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid 50&#x27;s male and have way too many sun spots especially on my forehead and some bug pores on my nose. I haven&#x27;t used this too long but it looks like it&#x27;s going to help. My skin is very dry because I don&#x27;t do so well at keeping moisturizer on it so it does start to burn after a couple minutes. I&#x27;m sure when I start using it more often and taking better care of my skin it will stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This peel is really a great one to use, especially for ingrown hairs and acne.  I use it not on my face but actually to peel my underarms to help with my ingrown hair issue that crept up from out of no where.  This has made a night and day difference.  After the first use my area is so much clearer and the bumps have drastically gone down and it seems to have cleared up 75% of the issue.  The peel did tingle for a few minutes and I neutralized with products that I had on hand.  Although many users will use this one their face, it is wonderful on ingrown hair on other areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definently purchase more in the future.</li>
    </ol>
