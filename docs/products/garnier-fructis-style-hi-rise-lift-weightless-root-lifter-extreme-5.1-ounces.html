            <li>This is okay.</li>

            <li>So glad to have found this.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves it nice &amp; shinny, it&#x27;s still lightweight to run my fingers through, such a great product.</li>
            <li>and of course it&#x27;s been discontinued, and so many people out there are upset, so we search the internet for this product and hope we don&#x27;t get gouged with extreme prices (some sellers want $35 or more for 1 bottle, plus shipping, and I say one posting for almost $70.00 for just 1 bottle!!!).</li>
            <li>Hands down best root lifter</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and rather oily.</li>
            <li>This product works well for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with fine hair who needs body.</li>
            <li>This item works great for my short hair.</li>
            <li>It gives you great lift and volume in your short hair.</li>
            <li>Is light &amp; doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I bought a pack of 3 and liked it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>and it works better than most high dollar products.</li>
            <li>great product for giving lift to hair, even long hair.  </li>
            <li>That in itself irks me, and many others, that in this day and age of online information that the manufacturer is just interested in the bottom line no matter what the consensus.  </li>
            <li>works better for me than heavier styling gels in my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair have incredible volume without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>If you have short, fine hair, this will give you good volume without being sticky</li>
            <li>Makes my very fine, flat-as-a-pancacke hair so much fuller.</li>
            <li>The product smells great, is easy to work with while styling my hair, and my hair has body and lift while looking soft and natural.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m old enough to have used a great many of them.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I can purchase this product which does a good job for me for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair appears soft and nicely styled, with some body.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes your hair so much thicker.</li>
            <li>Works great on fine, limp hair to give it some body and lift.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this online even though the price was higher than if it was on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried one bottle, then went back for more.</li>
            <li>However, this seller was great with a reasonable price and shipping that I recommend those of you interested in this product to keep your eyes open online for a decent deal.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different volumizing gels and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am not thinking I saved any money.  </li>
            <li>WOW this stuff really works!!!  </li>
            <li>Have had trouble finding in stores and was glad that Amazon carried it!</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I know it will not be available forever, but I just bought three bottles for close to what I used to pay total retail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than the Redken root lifter I was using.</li>
            <li>Then your  hair poofs out nicely when blow dried.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and find that volume mousses work better than root boosters.</li>
            <li>That said, I do get virtually the same effect...and it does last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Since Garnier stopped selling this, I&#x27;ve tried many many root lifting products, but none have worked in my thin, hard to hold, just longer than shoulder length hair better than this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the way it keeps my hair fluffy</li>
            <li>I could no longer find these at Wal*Mart (where I normally buy them), so I stocked up (thank goodness for Amazon)</li>
            <li>I have been a long time devotee of Big Sexy Hair Root Boost.  </li>
            <li>I read several reviews that said this was the only thing that gave body to their fine hair.</li>
            <li>It truly makes a difference with my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy on your hair and puts volume in your hair.</li>
            <li>I go through this much faster than my Root Boost to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li>Its not heavy or sticky, and it lasts.</li>
            <li>Have fine hair and is mousse is not enough to get my hair to curl and yet not weigh hair down like a gel alone would.  </li>
            <li>I have very little fine hair and this gives me some body without the crunchy product feeling and move</li>
            <li>I CAN SPRAY THIS ON MY DAMP HAIR AND BLOW DRY IT AND GET SOME MUCH NEEDED VOLUME.  </li>
            <li>The only place I&#x27;ve been able to get it lately is through Amazon</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far, but I like it!  </li>
            <li>She loves it so much she spent three years hunting for it,</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I had difficulty finding it in my local stores, so was glad to see it listed on Amazon!</li>
            <li>There is not a single thing that worked like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>least expensive here and works fine on fine hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Then your  hair poofs out nicely when blow dried.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and find that volume mousses work better than root boosters.</li>
            <li> That said, I do get virtually the same effect...and it does last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Since Garnier stopped selling this, I&#x27;ve tried many many root lifting products, but none have worked in my thin, hard to hold, just longer than shoulder length hair better than this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the way it keeps my hair fluffy</li>
            <li> I could no longer find these at Wal*Mart (where I normally buy them), so I stocked up (thank goodness for Amazon)</li>
            <li> I have been a long time devotee of Big Sexy Hair Root Boost.  </li>
            <li> I read several reviews that said this was the only thing that gave body to their fine hair.</li>
            <li> It truly makes a difference with my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy on your hair and puts volume in your hair.</li>
            <li> I go through this much faster than my Root Boost to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li> Its not heavy or sticky, and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Have fine hair and is mousse is not enough to get my hair to curl and yet not weigh hair down like a gel alone would.  </li>
            <li> I have very little fine hair and this gives me some body without the crunchy product feeling and move</li>
            <li> I CAN SPRAY THIS ON MY DAMP HAIR AND BLOW DRY IT AND GET SOME MUCH NEEDED VOLUME.  </li>
            <li> The only place I&#x27;ve been able to get it lately is through Amazon</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far, but I like it!  </li>
            <li> She loves it so much she spent three years hunting for it,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had difficulty finding it in my local stores, so was glad to see it listed on Amazon!</li>
            <li> There is not a single thing that worked like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> least expensive here and works fine on fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very heavy thick hair, it was ok.</li>
            <li> my hair has parted and or is flat again.</li>
            <li> I spray only the roots of my hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> My mom has spent the last three years checking every store in Vermont for this product.  </li>
            <li> Even way better than expensive brands!</li>
            <li> ;  gives hair volume without making hair too dry--</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS VERY THICK AND STRAIGHT...</li>
            <li> Too bad the company has decided not to make it any more.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair upside down after applying to build all that volume, and finish off with either the dryer or a curling wand.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beyond sad that the manufacturer isn&#x27;t interested in keeping this product on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I purchase 3 bottles one for myself and for two other people who found it works well for them.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair due to meds, and it doesn&#x27;t have any body.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and was disappointed when I could not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I Spray a little bit of this product on my scalp and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on my slightly damp hair, then comb it through.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a little boost without being sticky or flaky.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hair care product that gives my dreadfully baby fine hair any body.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;spray gel&amp;#34; adds shiny body and volume, without weighing my hair down, and it lasts!.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick, even after being &amp;#34;thinned&amp;#34; that even with other root lifters/root boosters, teasing, AND hair spray within an hour or less</li>
            <li> Suddenly it is not available in stores.  </li>
            <li> It makes the hair heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays on towel dried hair does the trick!</li>
            <li> It dries hard and stiff in your hair.</li>
            <li> and I need this because I have flat and thin hair!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair hard and greasy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> no one guesses its thin as it is nothing else</li>
            <li> My problem isn&#x27;t thin hair..</li>
            <li> seriously don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without these!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair.  The root lifter helped my hair have body no one guesses its thin as it is nothing else works.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE bring it back</li>
            <li> Makes your hair hard and greasy</li>
            <li> great product for giving lift to hair, even long hair.  It has been difficult to find until I looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Root Booster! It is the only thing that gives my hair the proper boost and volume. My hair is fine and rather oily. This product helps it last longer and keep the shape.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.  It dries hard and stiff in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great buy and worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair. It is not heavy on your hair and puts volume in your hair.</li>
            <li> Use this daily. Have had trouble finding in stores and was glad that Amazon carried it! Works great on fine, limp hair to give it some body and lift.</li>
            <li> Have fine hair and is mousse is not enough to get my hair to curl and yet not weigh hair down like a gel alone would.  Using this to replace discontinued root booster from another brand.  Quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays on towel dried hair does the trick! Then your  hair poofs out nicely when blow dried.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this.  It gives some control to curly hair.  Because she couldn&#x27;t find this in the store, she went online and ordered a pack of this product.  (wife)  I was excited to find this online even though the price was higher than if it was on the shelf.  The packaging was good and the product arrived in a timely manner. I&#x27;m not the only one looking for this root lifter.  I read several reviews that said this was the only thing that gave body to their fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way it keeps my hair fluffy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different hair products to get lift at the crown of my head. My problem isn&#x27;t thin hair..it&#x27;s thick hair. My hair is so thick, even after being &amp;#34;thinned&amp;#34; that even with other root lifters/root boosters, teasing, AND hair spray within an hour or less my hair has parted and or is flat again. And with the hair spray it can feel to &amp;#34;stiff and gunky&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product, reviews were excellent as was price so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product works, so well that I have to be careful to NOT have &amp;#34;80&#x27;s metal hair band&amp;#34; hair. LOL. A little bit goes a long way. The product smells great, is easy to work with while styling my hair, and my hair has body and lift while looking soft and natural. So now the only &amp;#34;80&#x27;s flashbacks&amp;#34; for me are listening to an occasional song and looking thru my wedding album photos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay . Not as good as the body boost they used to make.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  I have thin, fine hair and find that volume mousses work better than root boosters.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It gives my hair a little boost without being sticky or flaky.  I ordered four bottles.  On bottle lasted me over a year.  Too bad this product has been taken off the shelves.</li>
            <li> This product. Garnier Fructis Root Lifter (or Root Booster) is great and of course it&#x27;s been discontinued, and so many people out there are upset, so we search the internet for this product and hope we don&#x27;t get gouged with extreme prices (some sellers want $35 or more for 1 bottle, plus shipping, and I say one posting for almost $70.00 for just 1 bottle!!!). It&#x27;s beyond sad that the manufacturer isn&#x27;t interested in keeping this product on the shelves. That in itself irks me, and many others, that in this day and age of online information that the manufacturer is just interested in the bottom line no matter what the consensus.  However, this seller was great with a reasonable price and shipping that I recommend those of you interested in this product to keep your eyes open online for a decent deal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product anywhere else.  Wouldn&#x27;t be able to leave the house without it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I HAVE SHORT HAIR BUT IT IS VERY THICK AND STRAIGHT... I CAN SPRAY THIS ON MY DAMP HAIR AND BLOW DRY IT AND GET SOME MUCH NEEDED VOLUME.  I ALSO COUDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANY STORES.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy thick hair, it was ok. used it on humid day, may work better in cooler months.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for sometime it does a great job.  The only place I&#x27;ve been able to get it lately is through Amazon I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  I purchase 3 bottles one for myself and for two other people who found it works well for them.</li>
            <li> very  satisfied w/ product;  gives hair volume without making hair too dry--</li>
            <li> I have tried many different volumizing gels and this is by far my favorite.  Fructis Root Boost adds volume evenly and makes hair very easy to style.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> My mom has spent the last three years checking every store in Vermont for this product.  She could not find it anywhere.  In those three years, she has not been able to find a product that comes even close to matching this product.  She talked to friend, researched online, and tried countless brands.  There is not a single thing that worked like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was so happy she hugged me and rocked me from side to side when I found this.  She thanked me more times than I can count.  What else could possibly said about this product?  She loves it so much she spent three years hunting for it, and nothing matched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing this product.  You literally made my moms year when I found it.</li>
            <li> Best product ever, so glad I found it again</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this stuff.  Great to buy in quantity.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price. Works at giving me the volume I need for my roots. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product. Works well on my hair.  Suddenly it is not available in stores.  Found it on Amazon while looking for another unavailable Garnier product.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff really works!!!  It&#x27;s great for root lift and if you use it all over - adds great body and style!!!!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> works better for me than heavier styling gels in my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Too bad it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> One of the best root lifters I&#x27;ve used. Lot&#x27;s of volume.</li>
            <li> Love the lift this gives my hair and holds all day.</li>
            <li> This item works great for my short hair. I was pleased it arrived without having any leaking bottles and was packed really good.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at the local CVS &amp; Rite Aide...called all over, even Walmart...guess its discontinued, so was very happy to learn that I can still obtain this product through Amazon...it totally works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product at Amazon after Garnier Fructis dropped it from its line.  It&#x27;s the best product of its kind I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m old enough to have used a great many of them. Also I&#x27;m a former hairdresser, and I like to think I know what I&#x27;m talking&lt;br /&gt;about.</li>
            <li> Hands down best root lifter I&#x27;ve ever found! Even way better than expensive brands! I could no longer find these at Wal*Mart (where I normally buy them), so I stocked up (thank goodness for Amazon), I bought 30 bottles - seriously don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without these! Makes my very fine, flat-as-a-pancacke hair so much fuller. It also leaves it nice &amp; shinny, it&#x27;s still lightweight to run my fingers through, such a great product. Another one I like, but is sticky is a powder, but I like this way better!</li>
            <li> This is okay. I like my redken and even my suave better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product as I used to get at Walmart. It makes the hair heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> least expensive here and works fine on fine hair everyone should get it if they need more thickness in the hair root</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I have thinning hair due to meds, and it doesn&#x27;t have any body.  I Spray a little bit of this product on my scalp and blow dry.  It makes my hair have incredible volume without weighing it down.  Too bad the company has decided not to make it any more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It truly makes a difference with my fine, limp hair. My hair feels thicker and the hold lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great shipping great will be ordering more at a later date thanx</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Happy I can still find on here since you can find in stores and it&#x27;s a great product too!!</li>
            <li> Iove this root booster. I disappointed they discontinued this produce. You find something that works for you and then they take it off the market😂😟</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives you great lift and volume in your short hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I can purchase this product which does a good job for me for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time devotee of Big Sexy Hair Root Boost.  I happened to run out, and gave this a try to save a bit of money.  First of all, I am not thinking I saved any money.  I go through this much faster than my Root Boost to get the same effect.  That said, I do get virtually the same effect...and it does last most of the day.  I won&#x27;t order again, but it does do the job well.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed that Garnier discontinued this product! I know it will not be available forever, but I just bought three bottles for close to what I used to pay total retail. It&#x27;s the real thing and it works better than most high dollar products. I have very little fine hair and this gives me some body without the crunchy product feeling and move hair cuts look good again when I style them.</li>
            <li> This product works really great on my fine hair. I spray only the roots of my hair and then blow dry. Gives me the volume I like without being sticky. Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s being discontinued. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that I like. Hope Garnier brings this product back.</li>
            <li> I am so bummed that they discontinued this product! It is the best thing I&#x27;ve used for adding volume to fine hair...</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have ever used, I use it as an all over gel to hold my fine hair just the way I like it.  Too bad that it is not discontinued from Garnier!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I still can&#x27;t believe it was discontinued! I ordered enough to get me through a year... I hope</li>
            <li> Everything went great!</li>
            <li> Love this product and was disappointed when I could not find it in the stores. Glad I could find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Totally disappointeed it is a discontinued product of Garnier.</li>
            <li> Why on earth isn&#x27;t this made anymore?? It is by far the best volume booster out there! Its not heavy or sticky, and it lasts. I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Hope that they bring it back on the market . I am very pleased .</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is the only product that gives your roots a lift.</li>
            <li> Since Garnier stopped selling this, I&#x27;ve tried many many root lifting products, but none have worked in my thin, hard to hold, just longer than shoulder length hair better than this product. This &amp;#34;spray gel&amp;#34; adds shiny body and volume, without weighing my hair down, and it lasts!. For better control, and even application of product, I spray it into my fingertips, and apply to scalp and finger comb through aprox. 3 inches of my hair. I blow dry my hair upside down after applying to build all that volume, and finish off with either the dryer or a curling wand. I&#x27;m thinking of applying to all but the last inch or 2 of my hair to replace the body building gel Garnier no longer sells.</li>
            <li> Can no longer find this in box stores, even though they show as an item they carry. Was quite happy when I found a three pack on Amazon. For me, it works better than the product I purchased in the salon. And I paid about the same for three Garnier as I did the salon product. If you have short, fine hair, this will give you good volume without being sticky</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Gives body at roots of hair &amp; holds well.  Is light &amp; doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the trick.  Works bett4er than any mousse I&#x27;ve tried.  Would recommend to anyone with fine hair who needs body.</li>
            <li> just received - I only used it once so far, but I like it!  Purchased because it got great reviews....and it was at a great price!</li>
            <li> I originally tried one bottle, then went back for more. That was at Walgreens, and now I can no longer find it there. Happily, I see Amazon has it, but it understand it is discontinued?? This is the ONLY hair care product that gives my dreadfully baby fine hair any body. I spray it on my slightly damp hair, then comb it through. Then I spray hair spray on my hair and put my hair dryer to it  and the combination does the trick. For styling, I use a curling iron/brush, whatever they are called. My hair appears soft and nicely styled, with some body. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to admit I was impressed. I bought a pack of 3 and liked it so much I bought another. I heard they were not making it any more. My hair stays mostly in place, looks shiny, and isn&#x27;t sticky. It is much cheaper than the Redken root lifter I was using.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works very well on thinner hair and gives it great volume. Unfortunately, I had difficulty finding it in my local stores, so was glad to see it listed on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The best stuff! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and I need this because I have flat and thin hair! It works great! I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes your hair so much thicker.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love and have to have this product. I am very grateful and happy that I am able to purchase this from you.  It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this.  I was disappointment when they discontinued it.</li>
