            <li>I love everything about  Moroccan oil.</li>

            <li>After applying this oil hair becomes smooth and shiny, easy to style.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, fine, wavy hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to light.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give the hair a greasy look and I apply it while my hair is damp then again after styling to smooth</li>
            <li>and I was amazed how silky smooth, light and non-greasy</li>
            <li>Wonderful product - I use it everyday</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s LIGHT, made for light hair color, so now my husband uses it.</li>
            <li>I have lived in Virginia, Georgia and Colorado and it has kept my hair frizz free and prevents tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My stylist introduced me to Moroccanoil Light.  </li>
            <li>this is perfect for my hair which tends to get greasy (if I put anything heavy and sticky).</li>
            <li>i guess you have to pick the right product for the hair type. :)</li>
            <li>I tried another hair treatments but nothing compared to this one: non-greasy, light, nice scent and highly profitable.</li>
            <li>this oil is the original one</li>
            <li>my coworkers preferred the original for their hair.  </li>
            <li>Spend you money on their mask, now that&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>i tried the light this time, because my hair is fine, and though it seems to have a nice affect on the shine and manageability, the smell is slightly different</li>
            <li>Smells so amazing and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it leaves your locks so soft.</li>
            <li>i have always used the regular moroccanoil before, and LOVED the smell, it relaxed me...</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t love it as much--</li>
            <li>I am so happy that there is a light version of this product so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I put two feeders to wet hair after washing, because the water is the best conductor is distributed primarily on the ends of her hair, then along the entire length, after which the land hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the &#x27;light&#x27; version</li>
            <li>I love Moroccan Oil, but the original version was making my light blonde hair brassy.  </li>
            <li>Use this stuff pretty much every time after I wash my hair and love it.</li>
            <li>Great product,  price was a savings and it arrived in just a few days</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>For me it is soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li>Plus the bottle lasts a long time, which makes it a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>thick, natural wavy highlighted hair and Moroccanoil Light brings perfect moisture and texture to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used other argan oil products, but they weren&#x27;t as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>And, when I flat iron my hair, it protects it from drying out as well as giving it a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>Use right after you shower on damp hair.</li>
            <li>This oil is not that superior to others I&#x27;ve tried that cost a lot less.</li>
            <li>It is a good product though and smells nice, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but good product.</li>
            <li>I bought it from another vendor the first time, but this one comes with a convenient pump</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>It came fast!</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>bought this item from PLUSH HAIR BUYS thinking i was going to get a bottle that was exactly the size of 4.23oz</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super soft and gets rid of fly-aways!</li>
            <li>I like the other oils so much for their shine and the elimination of dryness on my own hair: I bought a bottle for my friend.</li>
            <li>And, I recommend the Light treatment for fine hair as it will not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>love it, it truly helps my hair seeing its chemically treated and dry.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my fine, straight long hair silky smooth and so soft, like baby hair.</li>
            <li>and it gives me shiny nice ringlets when I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I had ordered the light version, but I like it as much as the regular.</li>
            <li>I use the light and also the regular.</li>
            <li>so I use the Light Oil Treatment daily after drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps flyways ,makes my hair feel healthier.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this from my hairdresser, but I got this through Amazon for a much lower price</li>
            <li>Absolutely irreplaceable item for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I feel like the oil doesn&#x27;t really revive the air.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>but i guess it doesnt work as good for thick treated hair..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other ones but they all make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair shinning with a natural soft, not oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase it online,</li>
            <li>i like how its consistency is not as thick as the original since my hair is fine</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, naturally light-blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li>I have also used as a deep conditioner when I am outdoors relaxing by the pool or outside doing chores (wet hair, apply and put on a hat or baseball cap and let product penetrate and then wash/condition hair normally and finish with Moroccanoil Light, air dry) for amazing hair.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use it on wet hair (love the way my natural waves look when air dried ...</li>
            <li>Indispensable tool after the sun, sea and other aggressive actions on the hair.</li>
            <li>I have lightly colored hair and some of my go to hair suppliers stopped stocking this brand due to the cost.  </li>
            <li>this provides lightweight, long lasting moisture that is perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I can no longer live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where it is very hot and dry</li>
            <li>and it is the exact same product and quantity.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this size in salons, and since I&#x27;m addicted to it, the more the merrier!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on imposter products that are out there (like in Wal Mart, etc.)</li>
            <li>Came with an off smell might have been old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this can turn anyone&#x27;s hair into soft locks.</li>
            <li>hair feels so soft plus it has a clean/fresh natural scent</li>
            <li>and this was more expensive than Moroccanoil Light) in addition to drug store products such as Organix and John Frieda Frizz Ease and did not like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it goes far</li>
            <li>Seriously, would love to wear this scent as a cologne.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I had that product before, and is exactly like I expected..</li>
            <li>I used in my hair, since South-East Texas is very humid and had the tendency to make your hair frizzy , but also I used on my hands for dry skin..</li>
            <li>Other product claim to be similar but these products do not contain pure moroccanoil oil (lots of synthetics in the ingredients)and do not perform</li>

            <li> I have lived in Virginia, Georgia and Colorado and it has kept my hair frizz free and prevents tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to Moroccanoil Light.  </li>
            <li> this is perfect for my hair which tends to get greasy (if I put anything heavy and sticky).</li>
            <li> i guess you have to pick the right product for the hair type. :)</li>
            <li> I tried another hair treatments but nothing compared to this one: non-greasy, light, nice scent and highly profitable.</li>
            <li> this oil is the original one</li>
            <li> my coworkers preferred the original for their hair.  </li>
            <li> Spend you money on their mask, now that&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> i tried the light this time, because my hair is fine, and though it seems to have a nice affect on the shine and manageability, the smell is slightly different</li>
            <li> Smells so amazing and leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it leaves your locks so soft.</li>
            <li> i have always used the regular moroccanoil before, and LOVED the smell, it relaxed me...</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t love it as much--</li>
            <li> I am so happy that there is a light version of this product so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I put two feeders to wet hair after washing, because the water is the best conductor is distributed primarily on the ends of her hair, then along the entire length, after which the land hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the &#x27;light&#x27; version</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil, but the original version was making my light blonde hair brassy.  </li>
            <li> Use this stuff pretty much every time after I wash my hair and love it.</li>
            <li> Great product,  price was a savings and it arrived in just a few days</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For me it is soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li> Plus the bottle lasts a long time, which makes it a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> thick, natural wavy highlighted hair and Moroccanoil Light brings perfect moisture and texture to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used other argan oil products, but they weren&#x27;t as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> And, when I flat iron my hair, it protects it from drying out as well as giving it a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> Use right after you shower on damp hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is not that superior to others I&#x27;ve tried that cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> It is a good product though and smells nice, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but good product.</li>
            <li> I bought it from another vendor the first time, but this one comes with a convenient pump</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It came fast!</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> bought this item from PLUSH HAIR BUYS thinking i was going to get a bottle that was exactly the size of 4.23oz</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super soft and gets rid of fly-aways!</li>
            <li> I like the other oils so much for their shine and the elimination of dryness on my own hair: I bought a bottle for my friend.</li>
            <li> And, I recommend the Light treatment for fine hair as it will not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> love it, it truly helps my hair seeing its chemically treated and dry.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my fine, straight long hair silky smooth and so soft, like baby hair.</li>
            <li> and it gives me shiny nice ringlets when I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had ordered the light version, but I like it as much as the regular.</li>
            <li> I use the light and also the regular.</li>
            <li> so I use the Light Oil Treatment daily after drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps flyways ,makes my hair feel healthier.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from my hairdresser, but I got this through Amazon for a much lower price</li>
            <li> Absolutely irreplaceable item for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I feel like the oil doesn&#x27;t really revive the air.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> but i guess it doesnt work as good for thick treated hair..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other ones but they all make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair shinning with a natural soft, not oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase it online,</li>
            <li> i like how its consistency is not as thick as the original since my hair is fine</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, naturally light-blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> I have also used as a deep conditioner when I am outdoors relaxing by the pool or outside doing chores (wet hair, apply and put on a hat or baseball cap and let product penetrate and then wash/condition hair normally and finish with Moroccanoil Light, air dry) for amazing hair.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use it on wet hair (love the way my natural waves look when air dried ...</li>
            <li> Indispensable tool after the sun, sea and other aggressive actions on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have lightly colored hair and some of my go to hair suppliers stopped stocking this brand due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> this provides lightweight, long lasting moisture that is perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I can no longer live without it.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where it is very hot and dry</li>
            <li> and it is the exact same product and quantity.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this size in salons, and since I&#x27;m addicted to it, the more the merrier!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on imposter products that are out there (like in Wal Mart, etc.)</li>
            <li> Came with an off smell might have been old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this can turn anyone&#x27;s hair into soft locks.</li>
            <li> hair feels so soft plus it has a clean/fresh natural scent</li>
            <li> and this was more expensive than Moroccanoil Light) in addition to drug store products such as Organix and John Frieda Frizz Ease and did not like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes far</li>
            <li> Seriously, would love to wear this scent as a cologne.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I had that product before, and is exactly like I expected..</li>
            <li> I used in my hair, since South-East Texas is very humid and had the tendency to make your hair frizzy , but also I used on my hands for dry skin..</li>
            <li> Other product claim to be similar but these products do not contain pure moroccanoil oil (lots of synthetics in the ingredients)and do not perform</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moroccanoil Light is more expensive than other products but a little goes a long way and does last a long time due to this.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on dry hair (on ends for extra moisturizing) and a bit when I sleek hair back in a pony tail for that celebrity/perfect red carpet look.  </li>
            <li> After laying can put a small amount if you shove much hair.</li>
            <li> And it last long in this size bottle.</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft and shiny without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> and then I blow dry it and it left my hair shiny and silky</li>
            <li> I truly believe it helps keep my ends from drying out and protecting them in the long run.  </li>
            <li> This oil-find for my porous and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from getting dry.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and little goes a long way, and it also doesn&#x27;t darken my highlights since it&#x27;s not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> my hair is not too tangly, not too dry, and not too oily!</li>
            <li> ( my hair are coarse and heavy )</li>
            <li> Put it on while your hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh it down or feel noticeable at all once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of this type of oil and none compare.</li>
            <li> I use it on a regular basis and even keep a small travel bottle in my purse for touch ups--</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil has other hair products</li>
            <li> Product not exactly described</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> but I do not use (my stylist tried a few but did not particularly care forhow they worked on my hair).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser swears I have the healthiest color-treated hair of all her clients and I firmly believe it is due to Morrocan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> it was after he blow dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this in my hair after I shower to give my hair the missing oils I lost with age.</li>
            <li> It does not leave hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I tried to find a replacement and go cheaper versions, just bought plain argan oil</li>
            <li> and it adds shine and softness with a heavy feel!</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone who often paints hair and those who are not satisfied with the quality of hair, this oil will return your hair to life.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s usually all the product I need to use to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just plain addicted to the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned a few people on to it, and they all have nothing but things to say!!</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but pleasing.  </li>
            <li> either smell weird or make my hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the expensive brands of hair oil such as Ojon (smell was horrible plus left a tacky film on hair), Josie Maran argon oil (did not work for me plus product is a thin texture</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> was very skeptical, but the product works.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell, I have used this before so I knew I liked it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had ordered the light version, but I like it as much as the regular.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but good product.</li>
            <li> perfect for frizzy hair,even small drop is so effective and hair are light and easy manageable. ( my hair are coarse and heavy )</li>
            <li> Very good product. I can no longer live without it. I use the light and also the regular. Both work for me. Will continue buying.</li>
            <li> Took sometime to be delivered, but product is great!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. I love this stuff... just one pump after I shower and my hair is not too tangly, not too dry, and not too oily!</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oil products, but they weren&#x27;t as good as this one.  I bought it from another vendor the first time, but this one comes with a convenient pump so it&#x27;s easier to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to light.  But didn&#x27;t want to return it, because I had used it and when I tried to return it, the seller wanted to take a chunk of money out from the refund.  I&#x27;ll use it &#x27;till it&#x27;s finished, but will not order from this seller again and definitely not the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> It great.  It make my hair shinny and manageable.  And it last long in this size bottle. Very great product.</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair and this works great on it. It leaves it soft and shiny without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Makes your hair super soft and gets rid of fly-aways! It doesn&#x27;t give the hair a greasy look and I apply it while my hair is damp then again after styling to smooth and it adds shine and softness with a heavy feel! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> A beautician began using this on my hair after I got highlights and I bought a bottle to use on a regular basis.  My hair is thin so I use the Light Oil Treatment daily after drying my hair.  It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase it online,</li>
            <li> Love moroccanoil oil treatment. Makes my hair look and feel softer.  I have course hair, so it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thinning hair, which is silver.  My hairdresser began using this on my hair and I was amazed how silky smooth, light and non-greasy it was after he blow dried my hair.  The smell is subtle but pleasing.  It does wonders for my hair on humid days !  I will always use this product on my hair and love telling friends about it too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Great product,  price was a savings and it arrived in just a few days</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my hair look shiny without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve used many other ones but they all make my hair look greasy. This one is perfect and it smells delightful. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil! My hair is thin but it doesn&#x27;t weight it down. I buy and use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> i have always used the regular moroccanoil before, and LOVED the smell, it relaxed me...i tried the light this time, because my hair is fine, and though it seems to have a nice affect on the shine and manageability, the smell is slightly different and i don&#x27;t love it as much--but it&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li> this oil is the original one and i love it, but i received it in an envelope and i am guessing that in the process the cap broke and 1/3 of the bottle got spilled, i have to asked for a refund so once i get it i will reorder hopefully this time it is well pack..</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but even the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; moroccan oil yellows my platinum hair.  Nothing else works like this product, though.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love This Oil.  It sure makes Healthy Hair</li>
            <li> This oil-find for my porous and dry hair. I put two feeders to wet hair after washing, because the water is the best conductor is distributed primarily on the ends of her hair, then along the entire length, after which the land hair dryer. After applying this oil hair becomes smooth and shiny, easy to style. After laying can put a small amount if you shove much hair. Indispensable tool after the sun, sea and other aggressive actions on the hair. In the journey of this oil is always sent to me. I recommend everyone who often paints hair and those who are not satisfied with the quality of hair, this oil will return your hair to life.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Came quickly. This was the best price I found for this size product at the time. Will buy again through this site.</li>
            <li> I have to use a good oil in my hair but the Moroccanoil is by far the best. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot (if you use a lot it make your hair too oily). Oh and it smells divine! I&#x27;ve turned a few people on to it, and they all have nothing but things to say!!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil, but the original version was making my light blonde hair brassy.  This is perfect...and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and use it every time I wash my hair. Absolutely love this! Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of this type of oil and none compare.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Should have read the bottle correct though. It&#x27;s LIGHT, made for light hair color, so now my husband uses it. He loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect. It came fast!</li>
            <li> I have lightly colored hair and some of my go to hair suppliers stopped stocking this brand due to the cost.  For me it is soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have lived in Virginia, Georgia and Colorado and it has kept my hair frizz free and prevents tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this treatment. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, blonde hair and this treatment is perfect - makes my hair silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down. Do not waste your money on imposter products that are out there (like in Wal Mart, etc.) When it comes to Moroccan Argan oil, you truly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine, straight long hair silky smooth and so soft, like baby hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and little goes a long way, and it also doesn&#x27;t darken my highlights since it&#x27;s not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells amazing!!! :)</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this in my hair after I shower to give my hair the missing oils I lost with age.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair. I get it colored about every 6 weeks, which includes overall root touch ups, bleaching, and adding purple streaks, so I need the extra moisture to keep my hair from frizzing or breakage. I am so happy that there is a light version of this product so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down. The light MorroccanOil helps my hair stay looking strong and healthy even though it is very fine. It smells nice, too!</li>
            <li> Eu já havia comprado este óleo e gosto muito. Esta embalagem vem com 150ml o que dá para usar por muito tempo. Principalmente se você não usa todos os dias! Vem com um bico para tirar fácil.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I think I&#x27;m just plain addicted to the smell. Works great on my thick hair. Does not weigh it down or feel noticeable at all once my hair is dry. Use right after you shower on damp hair. Apply generously, it won&#x27;t yuck up your hair. I just wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have frizzy, fine, wavy hair and it gives me shiny nice ringlets when I let it dry naturally.  And, when I flat iron my hair, it protects it from drying out as well as giving it a nice sheen.  It has a wonderful scent that people always comment on when we hug each other.  And, I recommend the Light treatment for fine hair as it will not weigh it down.  Put it on while your hair is still wet.  So, all in all, a winning product!</li>
            <li> This oil will literally be a miracle for your hair!!! I use it right after getting out of the shower, so the hair can soak it up while drying!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel beautiful</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil it makes my hair not greasy and it really helps flyways ,makes my hair feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now and LOVE it!!!  It makes my hair nice and soft, and it smells great.  Plus the bottle lasts a long time, which makes it a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this, you already know it&#x27;s the best hair care line EVER.  This is a great size for the price...I can&#x27;t find this size in salons, and since I&#x27;m addicted to it, the more the merrier!</li>
            <li> I use this on my own hair and my puppy ...the vet said big she has great skin and hair ...I said moraccanoil oil</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for my hair. Keeps my hair from getting dry.  I live in Arizona where it is very hot and dry and it really works. I used to buy this from my hairdresser, but I got this through Amazon for a much lower price and it is the exact same product and quantity. Will order from here from now on.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It&#x27;s the best hair treatment ever. I tried another hair treatments but nothing compared to this one: non-greasy, light, nice scent and highly profitable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely irreplaceable item for me. Use this stuff pretty much every time after I wash my hair and love it. It does not leave hair heavy or oily. I tried to find a replacement and go cheaper versions, just bought plain argan oil but hey don&#x27;t work for me - either smell weird or make my hair greasy or heavy. Now back to this forever I guess.</li>
            <li> I had that product before, and is exactly like I expected.. I used in my hair, since South-East Texas is very humid and had the tendency to make your hair frizzy , but also I used on my hands for dry skin.. I like the smell too..</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten thicker, and grown about 2in</li>
            <li> I really like this product, this is actually the second bottle that I have bought.  The smell is amazing and it leaves your locks so soft. I truly believe it helps keep my ends from drying out and protecting them in the long run.  I only get my hair cut about every 4 months or longer and I don&#x27;t have any split ends which is a victory in itself. I recommend this to all my friends and probably would just for the fabulous smell. :)</li>
            <li> Came with an off smell might have been old.</li>
            <li> This stuff rules. I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil for 3 years and I&#x27;m totally hooked. This was the first time I tried the &#x27;light&#x27; version but I honestly don&#x27;t notice a difference. Either way, my hair feels like baby hair even though I dye it and curl it often. I&#x27;m convinced this can turn anyone&#x27;s hair into soft locks.</li>
            <li> love it, it truly helps my hair seeing its chemically treated and dry.  my hair soaks it up and some days i can go without washing it out the next day.  Thats how thirsty my hair is.</li>
            <li> This super popular brand does its job and has a great smell. I use it on a regular basis and even keep a small travel bottle in my purse for touch ups--I have really dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, naturally light-blonde hair.  This oil works great to soften my hair and add shine.  I apply the size of a nickel to the palm of my hands, rub my hands together, and then apply it from root to tip of damp hair.  That&#x27;s usually all the product I need to use to style my hair.  It adds softness and a healthy shine to my hair.  I love this product and can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to Moroccanoil Light.  I have thick, natural wavy highlighted hair and Moroccanoil Light brings perfect moisture and texture to my hair.  I primarily use it on wet hair (love the way my natural waves look when air dried ... no frizz whatsoever) and hair feels so soft plus it has a clean/fresh natural scent so hair smells great  (no chemical smell).  I have also used it on dry hair (on ends for extra moisturizing) and a bit when I sleek hair back in a pony tail for that celebrity/perfect red carpet look.  I have also used as a deep conditioner when I am outdoors relaxing by the pool or outside doing chores (wet hair, apply and put on a hat or baseball cap and let product penetrate and then wash/condition hair normally and finish with Moroccanoil Light, air dry) for amazing hair.  I do not get split ends, hair breakage or hair loss.  I have healthy/shiny hair and get lots of compliments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccanoil Light is more expensive than other products but a little goes a long way and does last a long time due to this.  Other product claim to be similar but these products do not contain pure moroccanoil oil (lots of synthetics in the ingredients)and do not perform (plus you have to use a lot of the product).  I tried some of the expensive brands of hair oil such as Ojon (smell was horrible plus left a tacky film on hair), Josie Maran argon oil (did not work for me plus product is a thin texture and I had to use a lot and this was more expensive than Moroccanoil Light) in addition to drug store products such as Organix and John Frieda Frizz Ease and did not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product; it works for me.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.  There is also a Moroccanoil (regular treatment) which is a darker/heavier texture for darker shades of hair (which I have never used).  Moroccanoil has other hair products but I do not use (my stylist tried a few but did not particularly care forhow they worked on my hair).</li>
            <li> This is the greatest hair product EVER!  My hairdresser swears I have the healthiest color-treated hair of all her clients and I firmly believe it is due to Morrocan Oil.  It is expensive but well worth the cost.  And a little goes a long way so it lasts quite a while.  Try it &amp; you will love it!</li>
            <li> was very skeptical, but the product works. i have very fine hear</li>
            <li> The product is ok not all that. I feel like the oil doesn&#x27;t really revive the air.&lt;br /&gt;its felt like you were literally putting baby oil on ur hair only with the morrocanoil smell.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item from PLUSH HAIR BUYS thinking i was going to get a bottle that was exactly the size of 4.23oz but what i got was one regular 3.4 bottle with a .85 oz tiny bottle. Product not exactly described</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this 30 yrz ago doesnt feel like product atnall u just need 1-2 pumps of it .... it goes far</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair shinning with a natural soft, not oily. Arrived fast!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years and love this.  Price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> now a staple in my beauty regimen. this provides lightweight, long lasting moisture that is perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very nice on my hair!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil light great for fine or treated hair! Smells so amazing and leaves hair super soft! Their volumizing conditioner is to die for also! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair healthy and smells wonderful.  Seriously, would love to wear this scent as a cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks now and I love everything about it! It works great - makes my hair very shiny and smooth. So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> I love everything about  Moroccan oil. this is perfect for my hair which tends to get greasy (if I put anything heavy and sticky). I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product I use it after I wash my hair and then I blow dry it and it left my hair shiny and silky</li>
            <li> I like the other oils so much for their shine and the elimination of dryness on my own hair: I bought a bottle for my friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of this brand. However,  not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> bought 3 of this for me and my coworkers.. i like how its consistency is not as thick as the original since my hair is fine but i guess it doesnt work as good for thick treated hair.. my coworkers preferred the original for their hair.  i guess you have to pick the right product for the hair type. :)</li>
            <li> Great price. It is wonderful. I have used for over a year and paid lots more.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to be dry. This oil is not that superior to others I&#x27;ve tried that cost a lot less. It is a good product though and smells nice, a little goes a long way.  Spend you money on their mask, now that&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
