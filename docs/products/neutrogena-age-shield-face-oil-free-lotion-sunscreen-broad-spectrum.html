            <li>Very good product for sure!</li>
            <li>Neutrogen is awesome, very light and fell like im using the organic product,,</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth on face (not oily) and the best part is that it has no sunscreen smell.</li>

            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>However, it might be a good idea to try the product so you have some credibility.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>Melanoma runs in my family and after watching loved ones go through chemo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I thought 110 SPF would be good.</li>
            <li>I can say that it is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Feels really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It stays on good and it comes off in the shower good too.</li>
            <li>Guess it works how does know, maybe when your eighty feels good on skin and not greasy</li>
            <li>Good for skin with acne,</li>
            <li>and it is just good coverage.</li>
            <li>Not to mention a good</li>
            <li>and she says that is the best SPF ever, so If you need a SPF oil free this is the one you should buy</li>
            <li>but maybe this is not so good for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>so I need a good sun screen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistence is really good.</li>
            <li>received in good shape</li>
            <li>say all this even though the Age Shield is a good product.</li>
            <li>But their Dry-touch is superior in every way, so -1</li>
            <li>Provides good blockage</li>
            <li>It will protect your skin, however and does a good job at it.</li>
            <li>have extremely fair skin and this summer I used this every day on my face for two months at 5° from the equator.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my skin isn&#x27;t oily with this on.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good sunscreen</li>
            <li>Not greasy and good protection</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, rosacea, and keratosis pilaris, so that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was fair.</li>
            <li>that stated, this is a good product and one I will stick with for now.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>very* fair skin that burns quickly</li>
            <li>love this very good spf 110 and really !!!</li>
            <li>This is amazing for sun block.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is an amazing product for me.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth and seems to work great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is freaking amazing.</li>
            <li>texture of it is great as well, it&#x27;s really smooth and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to everything I&#x27;ve tried besides this, including neutrogena&#x27;s own Drytouch line.</li>
            <li>My wife started using mine rather than her own, which she had brought for the purpose.  </li>
            <li>Applies nicely to skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Never got burned the whole summer, was great on my face, not oily at all and mixed excellent with my foundation to provide the best makeup coverage with the sunscreen of my choice.</li>
            <li>Convenience of online ordering is so nice.  </li>
            <li>Loving it</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is a good product most times.</li>
            <li>I used it every morning of my two week trip (where we had unseasonably nice weather), never re-applied, and I didn&#x27;t get sunburned at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, shiny feeling on skin</li>
            <li>Either product alone would not be nearly as effective as using both.</li>
            <li>Works as promised, non-irritating, non-clogging, non-greasy, smells good and protects even better.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting this to be a nice coat over my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>nice absorcion.</li>
            <li>Used at the beach and really liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;</li>
            <li>It blends in well with my skin, and it fits nicely under foundation</li>
            <li>your skin healthy and looking good.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face kind of greasy .</li>
            <li>so, this helps to just block the sun and does a nice job on my face.  </li>
            <li>ok good nice</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly, obsorbs nicely, feels great</li>
            <li>Really nice</li>
            <li>Really thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant though, reminds me of Este Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures, and it isn&#x27;t too strong smelling.</li>
            <li>, best there is and we live in the desert.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and sunburn easily.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily and has a good feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>We have very strong sun on Rocky mountain.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin very easily without being greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is just very strong, I guess.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding sun protection is needed there more than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and kept sunburn free.</li>
            <li>not shining, suitable for all skin types, even oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used to completely block all sun without clogging my pours.</li>
            <li>It offers the best protection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t not like its smell on my face; however; it give me a good feeling that my skin is smooth and protected.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m outdoors all the time so a good sunscreen is important to me.</li>
            <li>While I would get a nice tan on my body my face was indeed notably lighter (like 2 shades lighter) than my body, after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom, and it the best product that she has used so far for sun protection.</li>
            <li>So far, this product has worked the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love love love this!</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very nice and useful product.</li>
            <li>Very good at blocking high UV rays.  </li>
            <li>Good product fast delivery and good prices</li>
            <li>Excellent, non-greasy, does&#x27;t leave white residue and effective as a sunblock.</li>
            <li>which I both like and am on the fence about, but it is pleasant and dissipates quickly enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Age Shield face oil-free lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 110 is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used to limit sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>Having said that I do think that Neutrogena makes some of the best Broad Spectrum Sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>It is really hot here in Afghanistan and this sun screen will come in just great and will provide me the protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Wore for eight straight days in the sun and it protected my skin beautifully.</li>
            <li>and I like it because it very light</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>Is lightweight and easy to apply, and the smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>I am one of those super fair gals who can tan, but seem to have spots that just don&#x27;t tan evenly (vitiligo)..</li>
            <li>I ran into an older lady with the most beautiful skin and asked her what she uses.  </li>
            <li>product, being a chemical sunscreen exclusively, is much better than zinc based formulations.</li>
            <li>This seems to be much more water resistant.</li>
            <li>I really love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does his job!&lt;br /&gt;Rapid absorption, excellent feeling and last</li>
            <li>There are better sunscreens out there (like Kiehl&#x27;s--</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most exposed part of my body predisposed to hyperpigmentation caused by the sun.</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I just deal with the shininess by buffing some mineral powder on top.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a lot of peeling on my shoulders, not any more.</li>
            <li>Lizard makes a much better product which gives MORE protection and does not burn your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon also sells the Blue Lizard sunscreen for a excellent price.</li>
            <li>no smell fragrant free!</li>
            <li>Until now I have adored the product using it faithfully in my many hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product worked great for me no sun burns this time thanks.</li>
            <li>this product was priced well i would pay more for the protection this product gave me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had to wear powder on top of it to get rid of the shine but</li>
            <li>Love this non-greasy sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li>Excellent for daily use</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; so gotta love it.</li>
            <li>, this sunscreen didn&#x27;t absorb well but instead sat on top of the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have not use it yet and love this brand.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who ask me :-)</li>
            <li>Better than any clarins, dior, philosophy, etc.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with, but the what I did have is now gone.</li>
            <li>In a couple of weeks I&#x27;ll be able to tell what my skin thinks of it :)</li>
            <li>but when combined with the sunscreen, has more of a satin finish).  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I just will not be completely satisfied until they make it thinner and easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion SPF 110 for a couple of years now and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>What I love about it the most though is it&#x27;s side properties</li>
            <li>Non greasy and goes on light!</li>
            <li>And, I am so glad he did.</li>
            <li>Love all of the Nutrogena Sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>You are able to put your make up on within a couple minutes without all the caking and grossness.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and not greasy like some sunscreens!</li>
            <li>But the again this will be an issue with most creams.</li>
            <li>So I may not have a healthy looking tan</li>
            <li>I tried many luxury brands including Lancôme, Clarins, Dior and Shiseido.</li>
            <li>It is not oily at all (great for my combination skin), and it really works (my skin tune doesnot turn darker after using it).</li>
            <li>But for me, it&#x27;s just better than SPF 70.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena for many years.</li>
            <li>Perfect for being outside all day.</li>
            <li>Pros: excellent protection, not greasy, lasted for several hours in Florida sun&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it works like a champ for most of you.  </li>
            <li>- just be sure you don&#x27;t sweat this stuff in your eyes or rub your eyes or use it before swimming.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone would need 110 spf, but it makes my daughter feel safe</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love this product and don;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen because I do not tan when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Although calico, patchy cats are cute, that look is not en vogue for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sun is what causes the most damage to our skin</li>
            <li>I thought this face lotion sounded great, but it really burns my eyes and makes them water.</li>
            <li>The 70 spf goes on nice and light.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the cream and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Love the neutrogena products</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>It goes on smoothly and helps my skin look nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this product</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and forms of sunscreen and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>most mornings I had to continue rubbing it in a bit after I got to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;ll clog your pores, making your face sweat more than it should.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, and I love SPF 110)))</li>
            <li>Jury is still out - can&#x27;t tell if the 110 SPF works better than the 55 or 70.  </li>
            <li>, that is why I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this at all.</li>
            <li>I love the neutrogenia age shield sun screen.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than most of the more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; sunscreens and doesn&#x27;t feel like you ran your face into Slimer from Ghostbusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I trusted all of them because I was paying more</li>
            <li>They concluded that SPF values should be capped at 50+ because the current system is \\&quot;at best, misleading to consumers\\&quot; and \\&quot;may inappropriately influence their purchase decision\\&quot; (P&amp;G 2011).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The best facial sunscreen lotion I&#x27;ve found on the market for two reasons- highest SPF w/a non greasy/sticky formula.</li>
            <li>Able to apply makeup on top of it effortlessly.</li>
            <li>as many end up experiencing symptoms like burning or irritation.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Feels great on skin, and really protects from the sun.</li>
            <li>But since I started using this product is much better</li>
            <li>I would like to preface my review by saying that this is likely an excellent product, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to persuade anybody not to use it.  </li>
            <li>Just the process of cleaning it off made it burn more.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it really helps to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>Its a bit greasy if you apply more quantity, but the product works.</li>
            <li>thought I would love this, as I do most neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>Melanoma is the most deadliest skin Cancer around.</li>
            <li>Skin feels better as well as protected from sun.</li>
            <li>Versus the sun&#x27;s rays, this product always comes out on top.</li>
            <li>Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>

            <li>best facial moisturizer I have used</li>
            <li>I made the choice to switch to Coppertone Faces SPF 30 and it worked considerably better.</li>
            <li>This has a nice smooth feel.</li>
            <li>been using it for years, slightly better price online.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena and their oil free products!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SUN BUT MUST AVOID</li>

            <li>I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li>its ok I guess.</li>
            <li>Most of them make eyes water and sting.</li>
            <li>While this product is a very good broad spectrum sunscreen and I would recommend it,  </li>
            <li>I have read that both are pretty good, but zinc oxide is better.</li>
            <li>It goes on very clean and does not feel greesy.  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels light on the face, it has a nice smell and, most importantly, it does not leave your face looking greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena works pretty good layered under makeup</li>
            <li>very nice because is high in SPF</li>
            <li>I love how strong the SPF is.</li>
            <li>When I put this cream on my face it goes smoothly and even, no white residues, non greasy, and the best of all it did not make flakes when  put my makeup over it.</li>
            <li>I have had a great deal of difficulty finding this product on store shelves, and I much prefer to order it from Amazon.com, because it is always available.  </li>
            <li>I say it is very good overall.</li>
            <li>Works very well in bright afternoon sunshine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ease of application in the morning...and complete daytime protection (including the sweat test) without re-application is great...</li>
            <li>So far, its going great.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly as well, no issues, love the cream and the protection.</li>
            <li>I love this product so light on the skin</li>
            <li>This product fit the bill, works well to block harmful sun rays  as I wearing a hat and using this sun shield walk outdoors for an hour as many days as I can each week.  </li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this, she is of fair complexion and being sailors it got tested to the max and passed with flying colors</li>
            <li>fast shipping good product</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this to me, and it&#x27;s been very effective thus far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br</li>

            <li>and i can easily apply makeup over it without getting a greasy look.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily just like the others.</li>
            <li>application is easy and not at all greasy or shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but it leaves my face feeling so greasy that I need to wash it off every time I&#x27;ve attempted to use it, especially if I need to put on makeup.</li>
            <li>It also can be removed from clothing quite easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on my experience, I strongly suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li>strongly protect your skin.</li>
            <li>Works well, sunscreen odor is not too strong.  </li>

            <li>, I have allergies, and no sneezing or watering eyes with this, I live in a very hot climate, so I wanted to get a good spf, and this seems to be the ticket.</li>
            <li>I looked high and low on the web for the best product.</li>
            <li>My dad works outdoors for 12 hours on hot summer days and this stuff has worked great for him as far as wrinkles and aging go.</li>
            <li>It dries to a nice matte finish that I imagine would serve as a decent primer for makeup.</li>
            <li>It works just like a normal moisturizer, but giving you such great protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly so if you look in the mirror you can catch it and with your finger quickly even the application out.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Superior Anti-Aging Protection\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone needing a good broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The odor of the SPF was barely noticeable, a good selling point for me.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply evenly, it works very well!</li>
            <li>When I first apply it, it is okay.  </li>
            <li>, she says give her full protection and makes her face feel light.</li>
            <li>By far the best facial sunscreen I have used</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a more cost effective solution for daily wear.</li>
            <li>A great sunscreen, does very well to protect my sensitive skin from the sun</li>
            <li>perfect on my extra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am happy with it, and will keep using it every single day</li>
            <li>While Vitamin D is very important, I can&#x27;t handle too much sun on my face because of melasma (sp?).  </li>
            <li>People can never guess my age right!</li>
            <li>ARRIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED GREAT SERVICE ...</li>
            <li>However, only good for 80 minutes if using by the pool or at the beach.</li>
            <li>The product is very oily and leaves my skin so shinny - no way I can able to walk out of my house with it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get fooled by the word lotion as it is not a fluidy liquidy clear lotion kind of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 60 yr-old fair blonde.  </li>
            <li>Even those with really oily skin will love it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, after about a 1/2 hr, I went it and ran cool water over my eyeballs hoping that the searing pain would subside.  </li>
            <li>My body see&#x27;s sunlight a hand full of times out of the year</li>
            <li>I loved the 70 spf of this product,but this one is much thicker and more prone to leaving white streaks.  </li>
            <li>This kept mine cool and protected.  </li>
            <li>I suggest getting the walgreens version of this before you spend the full price on the Name brand one.</li>
            <li>While this one is not at the top of consumer reports list at the moment, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Loving this one so far.</li>
            <li>However after using it for more days, the smell didn&#x27;t irritate me so much and my skin wasn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize was how important finding the right combination of moisturizer + collagen rebuilder was to this type of intensive care.</li>
            <li>excellent, maybe the best there is, thick put it doesnt feel heavy and greasy on skin, it does the work very</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall you have to pretty creative when finding your own facial solutions, but these are what worked for me</li>
            <li>when I go out during a very hot sunny day with the temperature up to 36C, I don&#x27;t even feel any heat on my skin, because this sunscreen somehow keeps my skin cool.</li>
            <li>super nice not itching as expected :)</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>, it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you all shiny.  </li>
            <li>Super oily and makes you break out.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is no greasy feeling left after application and how well it all absorbs in.  </li>
            <li>super protection with that&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena</li>
            <li>It protects the face and doesn&#x27;t appear super oily, nor does it make me break out.  </li>
            <li>It also has a mild scent of sunscreen which isn&#x27;t bothersome at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that mixing this product with my mild face cream and its&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found out about this when I was in Phoenix -super sunny place.</li>
            <li>It absorbes quickly.  </li>
            <li>I rub it on in the morning as part of my skin care regiment and it absorbs quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is a high SPF and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Neutrogena products, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>In a letter to the FDA P&amp;G warned that the intense UV light used in laboratory SPF tests are different than the conditions experienced in the real world, and of \\&quot;dubious value\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>In a letter to the FDA P&amp;G warned that the intense UV light used in laboratory SPF tests are different than the conditions experienced in the real world, and of \\&quot;dubious value\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Because it has such a high SPF, you can easily mix this with foundation at about 30% and still be covered better than most SPF foundations.</li>
            <li>I live in one of the hottest places in the country and this sunscreen has saved my life more than once.</li>
            <li>Not super great protection as I put on two layers and still have sun exposure from a two hour outing.</li>
            <li>that one is much looser and easily blendable</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this to be as good of a product for my face as the Neutrogena Ultra Dry Touch 100 SPF sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Really works, does not get oily, easy application, does not alter the texture and look of my foundation.</li>
            <li>I like this b/c it is not greasy and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>First and foremost, my concern is avoiding skin cancer!</li>
            <li>The product was not expired and the expiration date was far away, so I figured the product was good and new.</li>
            <li>Very effective at blocking sun, as long as you don&#x27;t perspire too much.  </li>
            <li>The good part is it leaves your skin non-greasy looking, but does leave you looking very pale :)</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t require much makeup or even frequently wear makeup but having to bring the tube with me all the time is kind of bit to keep up with when I&#x27;m busy most of the time in the summer</li>
            <li>Love it because I have sensitive skin and breakout really easy with normal sunscreen!</li>
            <li>and if you have light skin, or really anyone, this product is a must.</li>
            <li>It works really well under my makeup, and makes my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>NOTHING is worth the price of eye irritation so severe your eyes tear and swell</li>
            <li>but I loved it so much that I bought it the same day after trying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a slow adopter but knew I&#x27;d  better bring something good to the Galapagos (at the equator.)  </li>
            <li>I love neutrogena products for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The SPF is what I love because I don&#x27;t want my face to get all wrinkly when i&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li>I look fresh and put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I opened the cap, a considerable amount of yellowish oil leaked out and I squeezed out most of it.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of thinking that perhaps the oil was just a natural separation between the oil and the lotion (?) components of the product, so after I squeezed out most of the oil, I put some of the product on my face.</li>
            <li>You have to pull across the skin to get it evened out an absorbed.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if one bottle for the same price could cover 2 people for a week (about 14 applications)</li>
            <li>Your face is most exposed and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test its effectiveness for any longer than an hour,but was satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li>If you are active and sweat easily during warm weather, this is probably not the sunscreen for you.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to caution people with skin sensitivities that this particular product might be too strong for them.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno is the only sunblock that has felt nice and non greasy to me</li>
            <li>honestly I don&#x27;t even like it for that as it will leave a white trace anywhere it rubs off on that</li>
            <li>I always get compliments about how young I look and that I don&#x27;t seem to age like everyone else :-)</li>
            <li>its like you&#x27;re protected from a nuke sun screen powerful.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason, my eyes are sensitive to most lotions (they burn), so I&#x27;ve avoided using sunscreen on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I do not notice any scent, and it is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago, Hawaiian Tropic made a sunscreen that I thought was very effective.</li>
            <li>This was refreshing because it kind of saves us ladies from the whole runaround of chasing darker foundations through out the summer that are no longer usable during the winter because it leaves that unsightly distinction between your face and your neck that eventually goes back to its normal color.</li>
            <li>The only rewarding points are that it is not as heavy/greasy as most, and it has a high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t know if this product is good on other levels.  </li>
            <li>No greasy or oily film to discolor clothing and washes right out if any contact.  </li>
            <li>HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OPINION</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I threw out the sunscreen right away.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C does is help your skin lock in the moisture that comes when using the right cream.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry if I don&#x27;t reapply right away.</li>
            <li>so this is the right SPF for me)</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it is clear, not greasy nor sticky and it completely shields my face from the sun (trust me I live in the Caribbean)</li>
            <li>and its pretty much smell free</li>
            <li>Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought this was an everyday moisturizer (&amp;#34;Face Lotion&amp;#34;) with a great sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>This was far stronger than anything else I saw on the market, and I felt pretty confident using it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth without the grease, leaves no terrible residue and lasts for an extremely long time.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning I wash my face with a gentle cleanser to remove any oils from the night before as well as any bacteria or germs from the sheets (they&#x27;re clean) but just in case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth without the grease, leaves no terrible residue and lasts for an extremely long time.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and all you need is a little since it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels, and that it&#x27;s Broad Spectrum.</li>
            <li>is a highly recommended product for those keeping their light complexion for all day use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very reliable product specially for skin cancer survivors like me.</li>
            <li>I have light tan skin, anyway I put this on and everything seemed normal, then I turned off the bathroom lights and looked at the mirror</li>
            <li>it is an amazing product and better than more expensive brands....</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m spending more time outside -- exercising  :&gt;  -- and we haven&#x27;t seen a real cloud here in New Mexico in quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smoothes easily on the skin, leaving my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and fair skin and wear this daily.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of differently products, Clinique, arbonne, and while great products, they do not have the total blockage that is needed to remedy the vitiligo spots!</li>
            <li>Also, even though it&#x27;s oil free, it&#x27;s pretty heavy and greasy, so I need to wait after applying it to put on my makeup, which is kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and usually use the spray Neutrogena SPF 70, but needed some extra protection for my face after reading some concerning articles on what any kind of tan from the sun</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do agree that this product works fairly well as a sun block I need to warn you that it&#x27;s a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>I burn easily and I was out in full sun in the water several days with no problem.</li>
            <li>i like it very much</li>
            <li>I Like very much</li>
            <li>It is very much a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; as opposed to a &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However I do have to say that this sunscreen is much more light weight than any other one I ever tried and it did not make my oily face any oilier.</li>
            <li>Rich aroma, smooth texture and oil-free application are key to this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and absorbs better and faster than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used and is truly non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, it absorbs super quick and it does not cause me allergies nor pimples so far.</li>
            <li>Protection good, but not very enjoyable if it got in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>friends tell me my face looks different :))..</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is reasonable and it does the job!</li>
            <li>I love to go to the beach with my dog and with this sunscreen I can go for several hours without ending up burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li>Although someone says that the &#x27;industry&#x27; standard distinguishes between the two terms -- most consumers do not.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena better not fail me or I&#x27;ll be posting my medical bills.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended for those who love spending time out under the sun.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Age Shield has contained the \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;...softened and evened-out my skin tone...and eliminated the crust on my nose...</li>
            <li>I am only confident to go out during a hot day when I put this on my face.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen, I stock up on these for the entire summer.</li>
            <li>we went back to our organic sunblock of SPF 30 which work much better for all of us.</li>
            <li>Because you get much more for your money using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer and 2)</li>
            <li>Which also brings me to mention that if you are of color or have olive or darker skin(3 skin tone or higher) ifyou wear the lotion with out makeup</li>
            <li>So with all that said I reserve this product for when I’m out in the sun for extended periods of time like 4-6 hours or more, and or when I go travel on vacation to warmer climates (southern U.S./tropics).</li>
            <li>So much for &amp;#34;won&#x27;t clog your pores&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this every day I plan on being outside for more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>To be more specific, I went to my dermatologist to discuss my situation</li>
            <li>and she gave me some pretty informative opinions.</li>
            <li>I am here to tell you that sunscreens of 50 spf or lower (many different brands including Neutrogena) DID NOT help in avoiding the sun or protecting my melanoma from the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li>, I wish I had tried that first.  </li>
            <li>, I buy this, hoping it will help maintain my color through another hot summer.</li>
            <li>Went to Riviera Maya and our only regret was not buying more of this.</li>
            <li>only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the price / quantity ratio could be a bit better.</li>
            <li>When I was putting it on, it was ok for the first second, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does exactly that--and that&#x27;s because it clogs up your pores.</li>
            <li>it has to be pretty dang</li>
            <li>whenver you are planning to travel to hot countries, from my point of view this is not oily.</li>
            <li>(wipe with a terry cloth towel, not with a tissue because a tissue will leave more flecks behind), but this is a small inconvenience in exchange for good value, good sun protection, and a matte finish.</li>
            <li>It actually doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look like most sunscreens leave on your skin</li>
            <li>Even though I realize that it is more than likely ME and not the product, I don&#x27;t tolerate it at all.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying something else more sheer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i bought it from amazon, cheaper price than going to my local target.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It feels more like 40-50 and doesn&#x27;t avoid my skin to become red after some exposure to sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I use it most in the summer and only water resistant for 80min.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this religiously that has mostly diminished.</li>
            <li>Haha, anyone know why they are stealing it?!</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens leave this gritty, greasy feeling but this one did not.</li>
            <li>got the product because I am well aware that it is the UVA rays that are so damaging to your skin and thihs product</li>
            <li>Really protects~!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial sunscreen that&#x27;s more than a SPF 30.</li>
            <li>goes on fairly &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; but will blend into your skin after a few rubs.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and I am in a very harsh environment and it does a excellent job of protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>On top of the strong chemical smell, it also feels heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have a black interior in your car like I do, it may rub off making white stains (which are easily removable with any good cleaner for interiors)</li>
            <li>- there is sadly no tanning, I just go from white to bright red.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I paid too much money on expensive sunscreen all this time when this Neutrogena sunblock was the best one all</li>
            <li>Perfect for a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;CON: Too thick for daily use under makeup.  </li>
            <li>as I read the various reviews on Amazon--of this and comparable products--I pictured them being written by younger women, all with good skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;</li>
            <li>Compared to others, this is inexpensive and highly protective, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>, I will keep this product and just make sure that I certainly use the deep cleansing brush in conjunction with my Clarisonic to ensure that I get as much product out of my pores after use.  </li>
            <li>It sinks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Keep looking for sunscreen and don&#x27;t let all the positive reviews influence you.</li>
            <li>This is the case with everything I&#x27;ve tried though, and you become a pro at application pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I used this product during a week long trip through the Grand Canyon.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for a few years now and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>--now it&#x27;s pretty much all even.</li>
            <li>This one lasts as long as most.</li>
            <li>Washes off pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Not sure how to rate if its doing its job or not - but it&#x27;s fairly lightweight and blends well.</li>
            <li>The top reviewer on this item is recommending three different items to a healthy looking skin who has received high number of helpful votes only in few weeks, amazing.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and smooth of this product and feel that at its high number will be protective of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up using it not just on my face, but on my arms/shoulders as well.&lt;br /&gt;And I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different sunscreens this is by far the best protection, the best scent, the least irritating, and no burns!</li>
            <li>See, I tan easily and as a result, I am about 20 different shades a brown.</li>
            <li>your dry skin can cause more wrinkles on your face.</li>
            <li>When I apply certain sunscreens and wear sunglasses my eyes begin to water uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a relatively large tube of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I was advised I needed a facial skin block as I live most the year in Florida.  </li>
            <li>have fair skin and do not want sun spots or premature aging ( I live in Florida, sunny all year round).</li>
            <li>I wear it under my makeup and while it&#x27;s not my absolute favorite (that would be Dr. Peter Thomas Roth Uber Dry Sunscreen)</li>
            <li>I felt a very mild sting, but it was very tolerable and I just continued with my regular routine and went to work.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of applying too much the first time I used it (more than a quarter sized) and liked never to rub all of that thick white cream into my skin!</li>
            <li>Very high spf too</li>
            <li>Very light, not filmy or ghostly, it also completely- completely leaves you white...</li>
            <li>My skin is light African American..doesn&#x27;t matter this is necessary for ALL complexions with or without makeup.. doesn&#x27;t leave a film so makeup application is fine even with a moisturizer added like I do..</li>
            <li>This product works great just as long as you don&#x27;t do anything active or move around much.</li>
            <li>This rubs in very well given its strength.</li>
            <li>Way, way too much perfume.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight but provides maximum coverage...</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This lasts a whole day -</li>
            <li>I used to play golf twice on a week, it protect me very well against the skin damage for too much sun</li>
            <li>i really like this product.</li>
            <li>it really works for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>however if you perspire the cream can get in your eyes and really stings, so I have stopped using</li>
            <li>I can not tell much about it yet since I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, unscented -- in MY OPINION -- is the same as &#x27;Fragrance Free&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much we like it</li>
            <li>There are using some type of oil in this product that I think is responsible for this issue.  </li>
            <li>So you must gently pat it into the face.  </li>
            <li>but I sweat so much that this product doesn&#x27;t stand a chance on the waterproof part.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and really works.</li>
            <li>Use a mirror for even, precise application, lest you wanna look like a clown; yes, it&#x27;s a bit chalky white, but can be blended in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not recommended for oily skin, as it covers very well.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on really pastey.</li>
            <li>I do wear it alone, on beach days, and it protects really well.  </li>
            <li>REALLY means for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s really softened my skin and evened it out--</li>
            <li>so I really have to use sunscreen every time to protect my skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>Spreads well and very moist.</li>
            <li>doctor said they needed to watch and it really helps them avoid exposure.  </li>
            <li>You really have to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I know that the product protected my skin very well because when I would go to the beach I would apply this product to my face and like Coppertone SPF 70 to the rest of my body to protect my skin and pace the progression of my tan through out the summer.</li>
            <li>This didn’t worry me too much.</li>
            <li>but when I used my face become very oily.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again, absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li>not very oily I apply make up on top of sunscreen and my make up</li>
            <li>/&gt;Along with that, it does not sink into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>but you really feel the difference wearing it in the sun.</li>
            <li>This works REALLY REALLY  </li>
            <li>(I men, really, who wants to wear a hat in the ocean???)</li>
            <li>its cakey to much to handle, I have grown to dislike it and have switched to alba organics emollient sunscreen</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li>Very oily, maybe I should change the product I wish prozone gel but&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sister and she loves it, it works really well under makeup and is not oily at all</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really tan</li>
            <li>and you have to really blend it&lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it</li>
            <li>but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;</li>
            <li>You can really feel it on your fingertips which makes me want to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic facial sun screen and one</li>
            <li>It thoroughly protects against any hint of sunburn and I&#x27;m very fair-skinned.</li>
            <li>If using powdered makeup you will need to gently blot your face with a paper towel after application of the sunscreen and before the powdery makeup but the sun protection is still there.</li>
            <li>Really valuable if you are outdoors  a lot.</li>
            <li>The cast would stay on my face for about an hour or two, not all day by any means, but it was VERY noticeable and</li>
            <li>Works very well in the Caribbean trip we took.</li>
            <li>It does not feel very greasy, I do feel that something is on.    </li>
            <li>It was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really work for me.  </li>
            <li>It is light enough and non greasy so that I can wear this under makeup.</li>
            <li>I just got a light tan on my face even after staying in the Florida sun for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I rub it on my whole face, ears and neck.</li>
            <li>The product is extremely reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>I have struggled wi acnea my whole life.</li>
            <li>This product caused an intense rash to break out on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>fast delivery,</li>
            <li>No sheen, and doesn&#x27;t have much of an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I really believe on Neutrogena sunblock products, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me the felling that&#x27;s a 110 SPF.</li>
            <li>I used this in Roatan, where it is very sunny.</li>
            <li>It protected my face &amp; neck very well from the sun.</li>
            <li>Well it makes it more harder if you are dressed up with this under makeup foundation /face powder concealer and having to do your makeup all over for reapplication of this.</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s very picky with face products.</li>
            <li>She wants to keep buying Neutrogena SPF 110..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>Hopefully someone will develop a form of travel, because I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>As much as it cost, I try to save when I can.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;skin type: very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not greasy and really protects from the sun.</li>
            <li>Just check the ewg&#x27;s skin deep cosmetics database online to find out how hazardous this product can be to us, human.    </li>
            <li>It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>If I am working in the yard for more than a couple of hours, I apply it a second time for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely and is not heavy or hard to absorb as others have commented - in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong product since it goes several layers deep</li>
            <li>Feels like most other for-the-face sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend in super easy, but not sure any with that much SPF would.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a lot more even as far as some oily spots and some dry spots</li>
            <li>Light, non-greasy, spreads evenly and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I clearly did not get too much sun that day!</li>
            <li>I get dark spots from the sun a lot, but I still love going out to the beach.</li>
            <li>definitely something to put on when planning to be in direct/heavy sun for a while because feels much better than actual sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that 110SPF isn&#x27;t really &#x27;necessary&#x27;, but this stuff it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face, it isn&#x27;t overly oily, or overly drying, and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had any kind of allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>It has a higher SPF, It applies evenly without streaking, it truly is completely matte even over my moisturizer</li>
            <li>I was previously using a day cream that had only 15 SPF, and wanted something more potent, especially given that I live in a sunny, hot climate and am trying to avoid sun damage.</li>
            <li>I found the Age Shield Face Lotion to be more greasy and found that it would run down my face a bit when I sweat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First class product which I wish was sold in UK where I live!</li>
            <li>Even better, the cream doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy like a lot of sunscreens, so I find I&#x27;m much less hesitant to put in on.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and I feel comfortable with that lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion is typically oily feeling as most all sunscreens are, even cetaphil&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; face lotion is.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried using less of the product and spreading it more vigorously doesn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li>- this is typical with most sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and clear - no hazy white residue</li>
            <li>When buying sunscreen look for zinc oxyde as a main ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t penetrate your skin and stays on the surface protecting your skin.</li>
            <li>I get a decent burn or end up with color by summer&#x27;s end.  </li>
            <li>The sun damages this protein, which is why we ladies who sun a lot look older.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it still makes my face oily when I apply it so after I apply it I use an oil blot and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a really decent sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The Age Shield is decent at what it does.</li>
            <li>I purchased Age Shield face SPF 110 because as I&#x27;ve gotten older the sun wreaks havoc with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have gotten older</li>
            <li>I also was interested in having  high SPF because I live in a beach town and therefore go to the beach frequently in the summer time.</li>
            <li>high quality sunscreen</li>
            <li>I get this stuff close to my eyes (eye lids after I got a burn from high noon exposure despite chunky sunglasses) and don&#x27;t get it in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>it is rated 7/10, high hazard.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend-</li>
            <li>I started wearing sun screen at the advise of my doctor because my face is highly susceptible to sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I use this high spf version on my face when I go cycling.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as it is value for money.</li>
            <li>First time I use this product (Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110) and I bought it based on the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as greasy as most, but it&#x27;s still a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s reviews that claim that it does not  leave a white film on your face, because of EXACTLY what it does!  </li>
            <li>My face and bald head seems to break out easy with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using retinol and other things on my skin that make me sunburn really easy.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say if this works any better than SPF 45, but it&#x27;s really no more expensive and works fine</li>
            <li>B. not place MUCH stronger language cautioning users with sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick feel on the skin (face).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spent a lot of time in the sun, but came home comfortable.</li>
            <li>Clean dry.</li>
            <li>I have moderately sensitive skin...not overly so, but I&#x27;m selective in choosing gentle products for my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li>There is a light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long or upset my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although it is suppose to be reapplied frequently-I apply it twice a day and most and do not have trouble with burning.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normal to oily and this leaves a dewy finish that interferes with the application of my foundation.  </li>
            <li>This is nice and not greasy (or at least in my experience).  </li>
            <li>as an aside, I have no allergies, skin or otherwise, and have &#x27;normal&#x27; skin on my face.</li>
            <li>The temporary white appearance is worth it.</li>
            <li>The higher SPF level didn&#x27;t matter, really, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it for the white filmy look.</li>
            <li>hope FDA regulation on sunscreen chemicals changes soon so that the US sunscreen market can match European and Asian markets in effective relatively inexpensive chemical products..</li>
            <li>Thicker stuff than a normal lotion, but works well and dries to a lighter feel.</li>
            <li>It is kind of thick, but I like it.</li>
            <li>This product is ideal for serious daily protection without looking like a tourist slathered in sweet smelling mess.  </li>
            <li>This is a chemical sunscreen which are generally less effective than the physical.</li>
            <li>B00L3KEIZO a cucumber eye cream]] when you&#x27;re not in the sun as that&#x27;s more natural and has less</li>
            <li>To its credit, it&#x27;s not as greasy as most generic body sunscreens, but it does NOT leave a dry finish.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and in the country where I live the UV radiation is too high.</li>
            <li>Except...when I thought about it, Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free face wash back in high school did something very similar...</li>
            <li>Light and not oily like some other sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li>You know how cheap moisturizers make your face sweat in sunlight, even though you&#x27;re not hot?</li>
            <li>Cant live without this product.</li>
            <li>And yea, yea, yea I don&#x27;t live under a rock, I&#x27;ve heard that once you get to 30</li>
            <li>I guess I can live without a &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I started using this since I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Re purchase, condition of the item was new as described by seller (the box and the item itself), everything A-okay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HAVE AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE WITH SEVERE PHOTOSENSATIVITY AND LIVE IN HI...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>good product except it leaves your face with a white tint to it that people will notice.it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I had a melanoma, but some people more conscientious mean not like that pale look it gives you.</li>
            <li>However, it feels pretty light and does not seem to make my face overwarm which has been an issue for me in the past with some thicker sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This sun block is the only one that keeps myself and my son relatively free from sunburn despite being out in the middle of the day for soccer practice and tournaments.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY sunscreen and the ONLY spf strength that allows me to enjoy the sun, without a hat</li>
            <li>Deep From Skin-Aging UVA Rays\\&quot;\\&quot; is a lie since the chemicals that form a product&#x27;s sun protection factor are aimed at blocking ultraviolet B rays, which are the primary cause of sunburn and non-melanoma skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma (von Thaler 2010).</li>
            <li>I found the later mentioned gourp were kind of greasy with the feeling of thickness and heavy for me.</li>
            <li>I put it on each morning after my shower, I live in Florida and so far no sun burn on my face!</li>
            <li>And I would think Neutrogena ought to label their products and clearly state &#x27;highly scented&#x27; or &#x27;unscented&#x27; on their products.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m quite surprised given their highly regarded brand that they would a. Sell this product at all and</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with the high quality of this Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Even after doing my best to spread it thinly, I look oddly pale.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I would change this product for another is that the spf would be higher in the new product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and living in Rio de Janeiro I am constantly out in the scorching hot sun.</li>
            <li>It has the same exact ingredients in the same exact amounts as their SPF 85 spray.</li>
            <li>but my 17 month old broke out into hives and rashes everywhere!</li>
            <li>so it does leave some of a white cast at first</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin by any means, so if you do, be cautious!</li>
            <li>In conclusion, this product will remain in my cosmetic skin care arsenal, but I will continue to use Clinique’s City sunblock SPF 40 for my daily sunscreen until I find a higher SPF that wont break me out.</li>
            <li>Doesnt sting, burn, run into my eyes during outdoor exercise, and so far, no sunburns!</li>
            <li>You can definitely get it on sale for cheaper at CVS if you&#x27;re willing to wait for a sale.</li>
            <li>So I ended up buying 2 tubes for the price of 1 of Neutrogenia for the exact same things.</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave my face all oily like some other sunscreen (because its oil free) and it leaves my face feeling and looking young.</li>
            <li>You can put on as much as you want and you can barely feel it on your face!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The hike was out in the open for about 80% of that hike, and the day was hot (90 degree day).</li>
            <li>so I first went to a local store and bought some.  </li>
            <li>it leave my face so soft!</li>
            <li>Ok, ranking lotions and sunscreens isn&#x27;t what I usually do, but after reading a lot of reviews on Amazon, I settled on this product.</li>
            <li>Also seems to be relatively easy on my sensitive skin and wont leave me oily or with breakouts which are common from most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>feel confident with this sunscreen having a high SPF, for the mountain summer has been bright this year, and I make trips to Louisiana and Texas, where the sun is brutal.</li>
            <li>My new dermatologist nearly fainted when I told her</li>
            <li>It dries and doesn&#x27;t feel oily a few minutes after putting it on, and can be washed off easily with face soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve found with Neutrogena is that it&#x27;s one of the best facial lotions+moisturizers for active people like me because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or give me pimples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even remotely oily and good to use everyday!</li>
            <li>t is not super thick and strong smelling like most sunscreens and eventually rubs in.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this sunscreen is that I live in a hot humid place and on a hot humid day it doesn&#x27;t protect as well as on a dry day.</li>
            <li>No other sunscreen I have ever found has this high of an SPF rating.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m outside for more than half an hour</li>
            <li>My current dermatologist has approved this product, and I certainly will be using it for life.  </li>
            <li>The next time I used about a nickel size and applied it to my face, and then a little more to my throat and chest.</li>
            <li>People always compliment on my skin and how clear it is...</li>
            <li>minutes)\\&quot; clearly on the front of the tube.  </li>
            <li>, i switched to neutrogena clear face</li>
            <li>The FDA should get around to limiting wild SPF claims like Europe and Australia have already done.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply it anywhere near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s a complete part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn since using this sunscreen but it caused my sensitive, acne-prone skin to break out.</li>
            <li>but i did use it for my 17 month old</li>
            <li>Her face swelled up and turned red,her eyes were very puffy.her whole body was covered in hives.i did test a small spot first</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;ll use this tube up on days when I wear no makeup and am outside in the intense Florida sunshine.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve sold me on my old standby, Obagi.d me on my old standby, Obagi.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft supple.</li>
            <li>then I Googled &amp;#34;Allergic to Neutrogena products&amp;#34; and a whole slough of reviews/complaints/reports came up on countless websites about issues with all of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not acne prone, but I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It turns out that the SPF rating only pertains to UVB rays -- not UVA ray which cause the real damage to skin and skin cells.</li>
            <li>And no breakouts, so far.</li>
            <li>Applying also helps reduce acne and reduces scars from old acne 👌</li>
            <li>By the 3rd day of our honeymoon you could tell I was not applying it over my feet very well</li>
            <li>was to completely wash it off all together which defeats the purpose of wearing sunscreen.</li>
            <li>it is soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes or it will burn.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and leaves my skin moist.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my face feel soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as far as I know, this product does what it&#x27;s stated to do otherwise.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy nor greasy, and it makes my skin softer.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena Product is really helping her look younger, she says, and she also likes the fact it is SPF 110, too.</li>
            <li>No producer has any mix that protects human skin from UVA, none, absolutely none.</li>
            <li>far, my skin hasn&#x27;t been sensitive to this product</li>
            <li>Works well for my neck, chest, and arms, but burns my sensitive face and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>Is not harsh on skin as it works as a moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li>Then I would really have a ghostly white paste all over my face.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Works well against the sun&#x27;s rays, wear hat/cap to keep direct rays away from facial/neck skin.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised when I found about this product with Spf 110.</li>
            <li>and my face went completely unburned despite snorkeling, swimming, and sweating.</li>
            <li>What sold me were two reviews: One written by an 80+ year old woman who says she has used the product for years, and one by someone who says it doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put too much on and it leaves white streaks but that is operator error with over application.</li>
            <li>a lot of sunscreens you really cannot blend makeup over it properly - if it is a matt sunscrreen you can&#x27;t blend and if it is too oily</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it is the only noe that really works on my &amp;#34;Irish&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and have never had any reaction to this product and have been using it for over a month</li>
            <li>You should apply whatever your daily routine consists of only after waiting 15-30 minutes for the sunscreen to be absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>Although I am sure this product does its job of protecting your skin, it has a thick consistency.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect base for makeup primer and foundation.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with the Obagi, whose matte finish works perfectly as a makeup base alone in the summer when I don&#x27;t need additional moisturizer on my T zone.  </li>
            <li>Very dry so cream or dry foundation/powder apply easily.</li>
            <li>works well on face, light sweating no problem with eyes, last a long time, will buy this again next time</li>
            <li>My dark spots do not get darker, larger, or more obvious.</li>
            <li>Which means constant reapplication is necessary for full effect especially for someone like me who sweats throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people swear by zinc based sunscreens, but I have used MANY products over years of daily sunscreen use, and every zinc containing sunscreen I used broke down into a white milky liquid when I started to sweat.</li>
            <li>So in the long run, I&#x27;m not really saving a huge amount by switching brands.  </li>
            <li>Even does pretty well over short facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I had paid 3 x times as much for some of the High End Brands at Macy&#x27;s and was always disappointed, Now, I am in love with this, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>( Asian, female, 42 ) I need to check the mirror carefully to make sure no white residue on my face.</li>
            <li>Some one would say it is no necessary to use high SPF as 110.</li>
            <li>I have tried over a dozen sunscreens on my face including $40/bottle high end brands and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or skin.  </li>
            <li>this high would leave my face with a white cast.</li>
            <li>It used to be pretty much a given that you could trust Neutrogena to be good for people with allergies or sensitive skin, but these days it&#x27;s just the same old crap</li>
            <li>Because of the way SPF values are calculated these errors would be most dramatic for high SPF products.</li>
            <li>Because of the way SPF values are calculated these errors would be most dramatic for high SPF products.</li>
            <li>Plus the main drag, is that it does not have a high viscosity.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any burns or a tan and have been walking over an hour a day at high noon and take my son to the park with my husband for about an hour and a half, so that is 2.5 hours of direct sun on Very High UV days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sheer, not thick on the skin like some others.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and the light, almost imperceptible scent makes it guy-friendly too!</li>
            <li>Not sure why I thought it was fragrance free</li>
            <li>how after I apply it, it really doesnt take long to sink in.  </li>
            <li>Goes on like any other sun block, but like that it offers a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and does not clog my pores like other sunscreens have in the past.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I would look a little sun baked after a day outside even though I wore a huge amount of these suncreens (and applied 30 minutes before sun exposure, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sheer is much drier feeling and overall lighter.</li>
            <li>- you rub in too much - you start sweating a lot (initially, in the mirror you don&#x27;t see white, but people will tell you after you start sweating a lot)  </li>
            <li>So although the product does make your skin go a bit white, that really does not matter if you can totally blend makeup over</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m only in my very early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s face is very sensitive, and this is the only product that helps her.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum SPF 110</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a sunscreen that claimed to last more than 80 minutes, though you usually have to search for the tiny writing that says to reapply after 80 minutes.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum SPF 110, 3.0 FL...</li>
            <li>Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110, 3.0 FL...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy in hot and humid sun, but as a daily sunscreen, I have no complaints outside of the white cast.</li>
            <li>This is Broad Spectrum SPF 110.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and broad sun protection.</li>
            <li>, unfortunately I have a whole tube barley used, i use it for my body feet, anything but my face, it really broke out after one use, and I NEVER break out to much TOO MUCH CHEMICALS, stay away GO ORGANIC,</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a great value and it was not like the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, where you have that oily uncomfortable feeling for the rest of the day, like there&#x27;s something on your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of other lotions for my face because, you know, avoiding cancer and stuff, but I think I disliked this one the most out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>According to other sources, anything above SPF 50 is kind of pointless.</li>
            <li>The same active ingredients or pure chemicals in this item are sold by many other sunscreen makers for five times less in cost with one exception, others do not have Helioplex which offers rash and burning eyes.</li>
            <li>essential for anyone who lives in the middle east and doesn&#x27;t want to look like a tortoise when they get older.</li>
            <li>Like a jerk I ordered 4 of these because it&#x27;s so hard to find a sunblock that&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I easily get dark spots when my skin is in the sun and other discolorations.</li>
            <li>I still like the quality of some other products, like Blue Lizard; but this absorbs better, is less greasy and works just as well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a daily sunscreen with a very high SPF, to help fade the hyperpigmentation, and further protect my skin on a daily basis to prevent aging.</li>
            <li>it keeps me protected from the sun and at the same time, it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never going back to my old stuff.  </li>
            <li>When applying, the lotion does take away some color and gives a ghostly white appearance but my skin feels so soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is non-greasy, you barely know you put any on even before it dries.  </li>
            <li>Very light feeling on the skin with little to no shine once fully dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of using sunscreen in general along with other products, such as moisturizer or foundation, use sunscreen first after cleansing and toning your face.</li>
            <li>She have a very sensitive skin, and also had acne for a long time</li>
            <li>There is a slight &#x27;suntan product&#x27; odor, but it&#x27;s not strong and I&#x27;m sure no one can smell it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use very often, but would definitely use when staying outside for a long time.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is one of the few (if not the only) companies that specializes in purely chemical sunscreens which have high enough PA (system used to rate blocking of UVA rays, the ones that cause the majority of skin aging)..</li>
            <li>I sat all day in full sun watching a rodeo and any usual sunblock would have left me like a lobster.</li>
            <li>50spf and up is decent in terms of practical durations of time spent out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does leave a thin white film on my skin that becomes particularly prominent over time.</li>
            <li>so the other reviewers said that this is not thick?!</li>
            <li>happy with the product, feels a little thick but does blend into your skin well after a little massage…</li>
            <li>No other sunscreen I have ever found has no greasy feeling white cast, or off putting scent either.  </li>
            <li>One major issue is that this sunscreen does look very white when applied.</li>
            <li>For the cheap price and for how long a tube lasts with generous application, I would recommend it to those on a very tight budget who still want to wear sunscreen daily.</li>
            <li>it will run and it will run a little white, but for me its worth the extra protection!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it started as slight irritation - the kind of irratation that causes your kids to scream about sunscreen in their eyes but as an adult male you suck it up and pretend that it&#x27;s not getting worse.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face, neck, decolletage and back of my hands - as I&#x27;m outside for up to four hours everyday and its essential to have adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena sunscreen was a FAIL for me but it will be suitable for the beach</li>
            <li>The part about not getting a sunburn was accurate because I was not able to stand the burning eyeballs long enough to get any sun exposure!  </li>
            <li>I will not be repurchasing this product, but that&#x27;s because in general I prefer a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>it will  be apparent on your skin, and give of an ashy like, or what people describe a purplish look on your skin when, and especially if you are perspire on the beach.  </li>
            <li>but hopefully I will not have to suffer any pain for going out in the sun in the near and long term.  </li>
            <li>a few \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; it couldn&#x27;t contain...</li>
            <li>Heavy sun exposure is the main culprit for aging skin, as sun affects the collagen, which is a protein fiber produced in the body that keeps you looking young.</li>
            <li>tube is a bit pricey, after I found the exact same thing at walgreens, the generic version for half the price.</li>
            <li>It is a little wonder Sunscreen, more than usual sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, usually no waiting time to dry prior to moisturizer application.  </li>
            <li>Leaves white residue that are very noticeable on my dark skin</li>
            <li>Now with modern dermatology, I have rid myself of dark circles and must use sunscreen religiously .</li>
            <li>and it disappears in a few minutes (although it&#x27;s white when first applied).  </li>
            <li>So I did a little research and found out that this is a very misleading product along with other high SPF products.</li>
            <li>I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i bought this lotion because my skin is sensitive to sunlight (burns within 3 hours), and feels slightly hotter than i can stand under direct exposure.  </li>
            <li>If I put too much on at one time, there are white &#x27;streaks,&#x27; but I found that two applications, using less lotion, tackles this.</li>
            <li>just recommend using a little if you are darker skinned because it makes your face white if you use too much.</li>
            <li>gave this the ultimate challenge of taking a long walk on a 90 degree afternoon with mid-day sun and no other form of sun protection.</li>

            <li> this is a very effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so this was very effective in daylight in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> Very good product for sure!</li>
            <li> Neutrogen is awesome, very light and fell like im using the organic product,,</li>
            <li> It feels very smooth on face (not oily) and the best part is that it has no sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> it works not just as a face but as a great all body sunscreen for those with fair skin.</li>
            <li> and I loved it , great product</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is the best and easy too use and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent protection for face and easy to use.</li>
            <li> now that&#x27;s good stuff) but not at this price.</li>
            <li> it is good for my skin that I like it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> However, it might be a good idea to try the product so you have some credibility.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Melanoma runs in my family and after watching loved ones go through chemo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I thought 110 SPF would be good.</li>
            <li> I can say that it is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> Feels really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It stays on good and it comes off in the shower good too.</li>
            <li> Guess it works how does know, maybe when your eighty feels good on skin and not greasy</li>
            <li> Good for skin with acne,</li>
            <li> and it is just good coverage.</li>
            <li> Not to mention a good</li>
            <li> and she says that is the best SPF ever, so If you need a SPF oil free this is the one you should buy</li>
            <li> but maybe this is not so good for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> so I need a good sun screen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistence is really good.</li>
            <li> received in good shape</li>
            <li> say all this even though the Age Shield is a good product.</li>
            <li> But their Dry-touch is superior in every way, so -1</li>
            <li> Provides good blockage</li>
            <li> It will protect your skin, however and does a good job at it.</li>
            <li> have extremely fair skin and this summer I used this every day on my face for two months at 5° from the equator.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my skin isn&#x27;t oily with this on.  </li>
            <li> Good protection among all the sun-blocking products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> absolutely loved by everyone</li>
            <li> It gives me good protection from the sun, and i found myself a bit lighter just from using it one day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sunscreen</li>
            <li> Not greasy and good protection</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, rosacea, and keratosis pilaris, so that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was fair.</li>
            <li> that stated, this is a good product and one I will stick with for now.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s my clue that it&#x27;s a good sunscreen for me.</li>
            <li> Goes on really easily with very good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use make up after and it&#x27;s fine!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup fresh and protects against the sun, making it the perfect sunscreen product for me.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, EVEN BETTER PRICE.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like so many others have.</li>
            <li> Love it my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> am very satisfied with Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Smells good for a sun block and feels nice for a sunblock cream.</li>
            <li> But it is good, it works wonders, very strong SPF</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> very* fair skin that burns quickly</li>
            <li> love this very good spf 110 and really !!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing for sun block.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is an amazing product for me.  </li>
            <li> goes on smooth and seems to work great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking amazing.</li>
            <li> texture of it is great as well, it&#x27;s really smooth and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything I&#x27;ve tried besides this, including neutrogena&#x27;s own Drytouch line.</li>
            <li> My wife started using mine rather than her own, which she had brought for the purpose.  </li>
            <li> Applies nicely to skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Never got burned the whole summer, was great on my face, not oily at all and mixed excellent with my foundation to provide the best makeup coverage with the sunscreen of my choice.</li>
            <li> Convenience of online ordering is so nice.  </li>
            <li> Loving it</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a good product most times.</li>
            <li> I used it every morning of my two week trip (where we had unseasonably nice weather), never re-applied, and I didn&#x27;t get sunburned at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, shiny feeling on skin</li>
            <li> Either product alone would not be nearly as effective as using both.</li>
            <li> Works as promised, non-irritating, non-clogging, non-greasy, smells good and protects even better.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting this to be a nice coat over my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> nice absorcion.</li>
            <li> Used at the beach and really liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;</li>
            <li> It blends in well with my skin, and it fits nicely under foundation</li>
            <li> your skin healthy and looking good.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face kind of greasy .</li>
            <li> so, this helps to just block the sun and does a nice job on my face.  </li>
            <li> ok good nice</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, obsorbs nicely, feels great</li>
            <li> Really nice</li>
            <li> Really thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant though, reminds me of Este Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures, and it isn&#x27;t too strong smelling.</li>
            <li> , best there is and we live in the desert.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and sunburn easily.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily and has a good feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> We have very strong sun on Rocky mountain.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin very easily without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is just very strong, I guess.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding sun protection is needed there more than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and kept sunburn free.</li>
            <li> not shining, suitable for all skin types, even oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to completely block all sun without clogging my pours.</li>
            <li> It offers the best protection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t not like its smell on my face; however; it give me a good feeling that my skin is smooth and protected.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m outdoors all the time so a good sunscreen is important to me.</li>
            <li> While I would get a nice tan on my body my face was indeed notably lighter (like 2 shades lighter) than my body, after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and it the best product that she has used so far for sun protection.</li>
            <li> So far, this product has worked the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love love love this!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very nice and useful product.</li>
            <li> Very good at blocking high UV rays.  </li>
            <li> Good product fast delivery and good prices</li>
            <li> Excellent, non-greasy, does&#x27;t leave white residue and effective as a sunblock.</li>
            <li> which I both like and am on the fence about, but it is pleasant and dissipates quickly enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Age Shield face oil-free lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 110 is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used to limit sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> Having said that I do think that Neutrogena makes some of the best Broad Spectrum Sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li> It is really hot here in Afghanistan and this sun screen will come in just great and will provide me the protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Wore for eight straight days in the sun and it protected my skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> and I like it because it very light</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> Is lightweight and easy to apply, and the smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> I am one of those super fair gals who can tan, but seem to have spots that just don&#x27;t tan evenly (vitiligo)..</li>
            <li> I ran into an older lady with the most beautiful skin and asked her what she uses.  </li>
            <li> product, being a chemical sunscreen exclusively, is much better than zinc based formulations.</li>
            <li> This seems to be much more water resistant.</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does his job!&lt;br /&gt;Rapid absorption, excellent feeling and last</li>
            <li> There are better sunscreens out there (like Kiehl&#x27;s--</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most exposed part of my body predisposed to hyperpigmentation caused by the sun.</li>
            <li> what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I just deal with the shininess by buffing some mineral powder on top.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of peeling on my shoulders, not any more.</li>
            <li> Lizard makes a much better product which gives MORE protection and does not burn your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon also sells the Blue Lizard sunscreen for a excellent price.</li>
            <li> no smell fragrant free!</li>
            <li> Until now I have adored the product using it faithfully in my many hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product worked great for me no sun burns this time thanks.</li>
            <li> this product was priced well i would pay more for the protection this product gave me.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had to wear powder on top of it to get rid of the shine but</li>
            <li> Love this non-greasy sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Excellent for daily use</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; so gotta love it.</li>
            <li> , this sunscreen didn&#x27;t absorb well but instead sat on top of the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not use it yet and love this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who ask me :-)</li>
            <li> Better than any clarins, dior, philosophy, etc.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with, but the what I did have is now gone.</li>
            <li> In a couple of weeks I&#x27;ll be able to tell what my skin thinks of it :)</li>
            <li> but when combined with the sunscreen, has more of a satin finish).  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I just will not be completely satisfied until they make it thinner and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion SPF 110 for a couple of years now and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> We will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> What I love about it the most though is it&#x27;s side properties</li>
            <li> Non greasy and goes on light!</li>
            <li> And, I am so glad he did.</li>
            <li> Love all of the Nutrogena Sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li> You are able to put your make up on within a couple minutes without all the caking and grossness.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and not greasy like some sunscreens!</li>
            <li> But the again this will be an issue with most creams.</li>
            <li> So I may not have a healthy looking tan</li>
            <li> I tried many luxury brands including Lancôme, Clarins, Dior and Shiseido.</li>
            <li> It is not oily at all (great for my combination skin), and it really works (my skin tune doesnot turn darker after using it).</li>
            <li> But for me, it&#x27;s just better than SPF 70.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena for many years.</li>
            <li> Perfect for being outside all day.</li>
            <li> Pros: excellent protection, not greasy, lasted for several hours in Florida sun&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it works like a champ for most of you.  </li>
            <li> - just be sure you don&#x27;t sweat this stuff in your eyes or rub your eyes or use it before swimming.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would need 110 spf, but it makes my daughter feel safe</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love this product and don;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because I do not tan when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Although calico, patchy cats are cute, that look is not en vogue for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sun is what causes the most damage to our skin</li>
            <li> I thought this face lotion sounded great, but it really burns my eyes and makes them water.</li>
            <li> The 70 spf goes on nice and light.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the cream and the way it makes my face feel.</li>

            <li> love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and forms of sunscreen and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> most mornings I had to continue rubbing it in a bit after I got to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;ll clog your pores, making your face sweat more than it should.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and I love SPF 110)))</li>
            <li> Jury is still out - can&#x27;t tell if the 110 SPF works better than the 55 or 70.  </li>
            <li> , that is why I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this at all.</li>
            <li> I love the neutrogenia age shield sun screen.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than most of the more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; sunscreens and doesn&#x27;t feel like you ran your face into Slimer from Ghostbusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I trusted all of them because I was paying more</li>
            <li> They concluded that SPF values should be capped at 50+ because the current system is \\&quot;at best, misleading to consumers\\&quot; and \\&quot;may inappropriately influence their purchase decision\\&quot; (P&amp;G 2011).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They concluded that SPF values should be capped at 50+ because the current system is \\&quot;at best, misleading to consumers\\&quot; and \\&quot;may inappropriately influence their purchase decision\\&quot; (P&amp;G 2011).    </li>
            <li> The best facial sunscreen lotion I&#x27;ve found on the market for two reasons- highest SPF w/a non greasy/sticky formula.</li>
            <li> Able to apply makeup on top of it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> as many end up experiencing symptoms like burning or irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin, and really protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> But since I started using this product is much better</li>
            <li> I would like to preface my review by saying that this is likely an excellent product, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to persuade anybody not to use it.  </li>
            <li> Just the process of cleaning it off made it burn more.  </li>
            <li> Great product, it really helps to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> Its a bit greasy if you apply more quantity, but the product works.</li>
            <li> thought I would love this, as I do most neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Melanoma is the most deadliest skin Cancer around.</li>
            <li> Skin feels better as well as protected from sun.</li>
            <li> Versus the sun&#x27;s rays, this product always comes out on top.</li>
            <li> Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month now.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is it is fairly inexpensive and offers some protection from the sun...</li>
            <li> and I can wear it all day without even noticing it. :)</li>
            <li> It really is nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As a survivor of melanoma for 40 years I have tried many brands.</li>
            <li> One of the things I love most is how it goes on and into the skin.</li>
            <li> love love love this...</li>

            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my sister tells me that I need to rub in it more</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Then when I needed some more, I remembered Amazon.com</li>
            <li> so I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd time ordering and the best product I have bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> best facial moisturizer I have used</li>
            <li> I made the choice to switch to Coppertone Faces SPF 30 and it worked considerably better.</li>
            <li> This has a nice smooth feel.</li>
            <li> been using it for years, slightly better price online.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena and their oil free products!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SUN BUT MUST AVOID</li>
            <li> Feels more like sunblock than a lotion with sunblock.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> its ok I guess.</li>
            <li> Most of them make eyes water and sting.</li>
            <li> While this product is a very good broad spectrum sunscreen and I would recommend it,  </li>
            <li> I have read that both are pretty good, but zinc oxide is better.</li>
            <li> It goes on very clean and does not feel greesy.  </li>
            <li> This lotion feels light on the face, it has a nice smell and, most importantly, it does not leave your face looking greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena works pretty good layered under makeup</li>
            <li> very nice because is high in SPF</li>
            <li> I love how strong the SPF is.</li>
            <li> When I put this cream on my face it goes smoothly and even, no white residues, non greasy, and the best of all it did not make flakes when  put my makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I have had a great deal of difficulty finding this product on store shelves, and I much prefer to order it from Amazon.com, because it is always available.  </li>
            <li> I say it is very good overall.</li>
            <li> Works very well in bright afternoon sunshine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ease of application in the morning...and complete daytime protection (including the sweat test) without re-application is great...</li>
            <li> So far, its going great.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoothly as well, no issues, love the cream and the protection.</li>
            <li> I love this product so light on the skin</li>
            <li> This product fit the bill, works well to block harmful sun rays  as I wearing a hat and using this sun shield walk outdoors for an hour as many days as I can each week.  </li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this, she is of fair complexion and being sailors it got tested to the max and passed with flying colors</li>
            <li> fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this to me, and it&#x27;s been very effective thus far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very effective but keeps my skin natural.</li>
            <li> Oil free, great for sensitive skin and hypo-algergenic.</li>
            <li> easy to aborb to your skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to put under makeup.</li>
            <li> and i can easily apply makeup over it without getting a greasy look.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Applies easily just like the others.</li>
            <li> application is easy and not at all greasy or shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but it leaves my face feeling so greasy that I need to wash it off every time I&#x27;ve attempted to use it, especially if I need to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> It also can be removed from clothing quite easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on my experience, I strongly suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> strongly protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Works well, sunscreen odor is not too strong.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Strong Fragrance.</li>
            <li> Really high is spf and does a good job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy your summer; I&#x27;ll enjoy this and many more to come while keeping my youth and looking fresh 😄💯</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t had pimples of ANY kind in decades, it was pretty</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the weather to cool off more</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> My fine lines, age spots, freckles, they&#x27;ve disappeared.</li>
            <li> ,my husband and I. it worked fine for my husband and I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that what fine lines I did have seem to be fading.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> son play golf everyday.he has oily skin that can cause pimple easy ,but oil free sunscreen helped out his skin.</li>
            <li> Its totally fine under make up.</li>
            <li> I applied foundation over it and it worked fine together.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is an excellent brand, reliable for those of us that burn easily, I use all year round .</li>
            <li> It works great, easy to apply, and most of all, little to no nasty smell.</li>
            <li> A little greasy but otherwise very good coverage!</li>
            <li> A little too shiny for my face, but does it&#x27;s job wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I am a huge neutrogena fan and have been for 35+ years.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and feels light on my skin, do not clog the pores</li>
            <li> Smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I am not gonna buy it again because I stopped using product that are not cruelty free</li>
            <li> It does have the spf smell even though it says it is fragrance free (depending on the tube/box you get)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t enjoy sunblocks</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Important</li>
            <li> light and not too greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to try a sun block that was specific to aging and for the face.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> $11 - $15 a pop, it&#x27;s a fantastic investment for your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought for my son and daughter, to protect their light skin from skin cancers.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has the protection their faces need every day.</li>
            <li> Overall though this was a great product.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> of).This seems to be the highest SPF available on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li> AND IT IS CHEAP</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and greaseless</li>
            <li> I still wear a hat, but with this  product I feel secure that my skin is fully protected.</li>
            <li> This product is oil free</li>
            <li> Now I can enjoy all day in the pool.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and has a glow to it.</li>
            <li> I know that now with this sunscreen I will keep it damage free.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and oil free and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and qui kly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and feels moisturizing but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does have the spf smell even though it says it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> In this case a 1.7 percent change in the light transmission yields a SPF measurement of 37 instead of 100.</li>
            <li> I feel light after I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> Works great, but does seem to leave that white ghost look even after it&#x27;s rubbed in!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does not make me break out at all and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Non oily and smooth to apply</li>
            <li> This lotion feels incredibly light.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly over moisturizer and leaves no shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> oil free &amp; shine free product for golfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the few sunscreens that allows you to blend in your makeup afterwards - totally flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> smooth, non-greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Blends in smooth.  </li>
            <li> it definitely works as it should and does a great job protecting your face.</li>
            <li> Should Be Fragrance Free</li>
            <li> SO I CAN STILL ENJOY SOME TIME IN THE POOL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good spf lotion..am a fair lady,I have been using for awhile now but only on my face where I really need it</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and so far so good.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and this one doesn&#x27;t break her out, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin but this one is really good for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> everywhere you apply it and don&#x27;t plan on touching anyone or thing, it might be the right sunscreen for you</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be very effective if you have to wash it off before you ever make it outside.</li>
            <li> , I have allergies, and no sneezing or watering eyes with this, I live in a very hot climate, so I wanted to get a good spf, and this seems to be the ticket.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low on the web for the best product.</li>
            <li> My dad works outdoors for 12 hours on hot summer days and this stuff has worked great for him as far as wrinkles and aging go.</li>
            <li> It dries to a nice matte finish that I imagine would serve as a decent primer for makeup.</li>
            <li> It works just like a normal moisturizer, but giving you such great protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly so if you look in the mirror you can catch it and with your finger quickly even the application out.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Superior Anti-Aging Protection\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone needing a good broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The odor of the SPF was barely noticeable, a good selling point for me.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply evenly, it works very well!</li>
            <li> When I first apply it, it is okay.  </li>
            <li> , she says give her full protection and makes her face feel light.</li>
            <li> By far the best facial sunscreen I have used</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a more cost effective solution for daily wear.</li>
            <li> A great sunscreen, does very well to protect my sensitive skin from the sun</li>
            <li> perfect on my extra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am happy with it, and will keep using it every single day</li>
            <li> While Vitamin D is very important, I can&#x27;t handle too much sun on my face because of melasma (sp?).  </li>
            <li> People can never guess my age right!</li>
            <li> ARRIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED GREAT SERVICE ...</li>
            <li> However, only good for 80 minutes if using by the pool or at the beach.</li>
            <li> The product is very oily and leaves my skin so shinny - no way I can able to walk out of my house with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get fooled by the word lotion as it is not a fluidy liquidy clear lotion kind of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 yr-old fair blonde.  </li>
            <li> Even those with really oily skin will love it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, after about a 1/2 hr, I went it and ran cool water over my eyeballs hoping that the searing pain would subside.  </li>
            <li> My body see&#x27;s sunlight a hand full of times out of the year</li>
            <li> I loved the 70 spf of this product,but this one is much thicker and more prone to leaving white streaks.  </li>
            <li> This kept mine cool and protected.  </li>
            <li> I suggest getting the walgreens version of this before you spend the full price on the Name brand one.</li>
            <li> While this one is not at the top of consumer reports list at the moment, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Loving this one so far.</li>
            <li> However after using it for more days, the smell didn&#x27;t irritate me so much and my skin wasn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t realize was how important finding the right combination of moisturizer + collagen rebuilder was to this type of intensive care.</li>
            <li> excellent, maybe the best there is, thick put it doesnt feel heavy and greasy on skin, it does the work very</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall you have to pretty creative when finding your own facial solutions, but these are what worked for me</li>
            <li> when I go out during a very hot sunny day with the temperature up to 36C, I don&#x27;t even feel any heat on my skin, because this sunscreen somehow keeps my skin cool.</li>
            <li> super nice not itching as expected :)</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> , it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you all shiny.  </li>
            <li> Super oily and makes you break out.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is no greasy feeling left after application and how well it all absorbs in.  </li>
            <li> super protection with that&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena</li>
            <li> It protects the face and doesn&#x27;t appear super oily, nor does it make me break out.  </li>
            <li> It also has a mild scent of sunscreen which isn&#x27;t bothersome at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that mixing this product with my mild face cream and its&lt;br</li>
            <li> Found out about this when I was in Phoenix -super sunny place.</li>
            <li> It absorbes quickly.  </li>
            <li> I rub it on in the morning as part of my skin care regiment and it absorbs quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is a high SPF and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Neutrogena products, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> In a letter to the FDA P&amp;G warned that the intense UV light used in laboratory SPF tests are different than the conditions experienced in the real world, and of \\&quot;dubious value\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> In a letter to the FDA P&amp;G warned that the intense UV light used in laboratory SPF tests are different than the conditions experienced in the real world, and of \\&quot;dubious value\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Because it has such a high SPF, you can easily mix this with foundation at about 30% and still be covered better than most SPF foundations.</li>
            <li> I live in one of the hottest places in the country and this sunscreen has saved my life more than once.</li>
            <li> Not super great protection as I put on two layers and still have sun exposure from a two hour outing.</li>
            <li> that one is much looser and easily blendable</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be as good of a product for my face as the Neutrogena Ultra Dry Touch 100 SPF sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Really works, does not get oily, easy application, does not alter the texture and look of my foundation.</li>
            <li> I like this b/c it is not greasy and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, my concern is avoiding skin cancer!</li>
            <li> The product was not expired and the expiration date was far away, so I figured the product was good and new.</li>
            <li> Very effective at blocking sun, as long as you don&#x27;t perspire too much.  </li>
            <li> The good part is it leaves your skin non-greasy looking, but does leave you looking very pale :)</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t require much makeup or even frequently wear makeup but having to bring the tube with me all the time is kind of bit to keep up with when I&#x27;m busy most of the time in the summer</li>
            <li> Love it because I have sensitive skin and breakout really easy with normal sunscreen!</li>
            <li> and if you have light skin, or really anyone, this product is a must.</li>
            <li> It works really well under my makeup, and makes my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> NOTHING is worth the price of eye irritation so severe your eyes tear and swell</li>
            <li> but I loved it so much that I bought it the same day after trying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a slow adopter but knew I&#x27;d  better bring something good to the Galapagos (at the equator.)  </li>
            <li> I love neutrogena products for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The SPF is what I love because I don&#x27;t want my face to get all wrinkly when i&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li> I look fresh and put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I opened the cap, a considerable amount of yellowish oil leaked out and I squeezed out most of it.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking that perhaps the oil was just a natural separation between the oil and the lotion (?) components of the product, so after I squeezed out most of the oil, I put some of the product on my face.</li>
            <li> You have to pull across the skin to get it evened out an absorbed.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if one bottle for the same price could cover 2 people for a week (about 14 applications)</li>
            <li> Your face is most exposed and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test its effectiveness for any longer than an hour,but was satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li> If you are active and sweat easily during warm weather, this is probably not the sunscreen for you.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to caution people with skin sensitivities that this particular product might be too strong for them.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno is the only sunblock that has felt nice and non greasy to me</li>
            <li> honestly I don&#x27;t even like it for that as it will leave a white trace anywhere it rubs off on that</li>
            <li> I always get compliments about how young I look and that I don&#x27;t seem to age like everyone else :-)</li>
            <li> its like you&#x27;re protected from a nuke sun screen powerful.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, my eyes are sensitive to most lotions (they burn), so I&#x27;ve avoided using sunscreen on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I do not notice any scent, and it is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, Hawaiian Tropic made a sunscreen that I thought was very effective.</li>
            <li> This was refreshing because it kind of saves us ladies from the whole runaround of chasing darker foundations through out the summer that are no longer usable during the winter because it leaves that unsightly distinction between your face and your neck that eventually goes back to its normal color.</li>
            <li> The only rewarding points are that it is not as heavy/greasy as most, and it has a high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t know if this product is good on other levels.  </li>
            <li> No greasy or oily film to discolor clothing and washes right out if any contact.  </li>
            <li> HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OPINION</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I threw out the sunscreen right away.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C does is help your skin lock in the moisture that comes when using the right cream.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry if I don&#x27;t reapply right away.</li>
            <li> so this is the right SPF for me)</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it is clear, not greasy nor sticky and it completely shields my face from the sun (trust me I live in the Caribbean)</li>
            <li> and its pretty much smell free</li>
            <li> Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought this was an everyday moisturizer (&amp;#34;Face Lotion&amp;#34;) with a great sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> This was far stronger than anything else I saw on the market, and I felt pretty confident using it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth without the grease, leaves no terrible residue and lasts for an extremely long time.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning I wash my face with a gentle cleanser to remove any oils from the night before as well as any bacteria or germs from the sheets (they&#x27;re clean) but just in case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth without the grease, leaves no terrible residue and lasts for an extremely long time.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and all you need is a little since it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels, and that it&#x27;s Broad Spectrum.</li>
            <li> is a highly recommended product for those keeping their light complexion for all day use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very reliable product specially for skin cancer survivors like me.</li>
            <li> I have light tan skin, anyway I put this on and everything seemed normal, then I turned off the bathroom lights and looked at the mirror</li>
            <li> it is an amazing product and better than more expensive brands....</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m spending more time outside -- exercising  :&gt;  -- and we haven&#x27;t seen a real cloud here in New Mexico in quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smoothes easily on the skin, leaving my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and fair skin and wear this daily.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of differently products, Clinique, arbonne, and while great products, they do not have the total blockage that is needed to remedy the vitiligo spots!</li>
            <li> Also, even though it&#x27;s oil free, it&#x27;s pretty heavy and greasy, so I need to wait after applying it to put on my makeup, which is kind of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and usually use the spray Neutrogena SPF 70, but needed some extra protection for my face after reading some concerning articles on what any kind of tan from the sun</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do agree that this product works fairly well as a sun block I need to warn you that it&#x27;s a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I burn easily and I was out in full sun in the water several days with no problem.</li>
            <li> i like it very much</li>
            <li> I Like very much</li>
            <li> It is very much a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; as opposed to a &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However I do have to say that this sunscreen is much more light weight than any other one I ever tried and it did not make my oily face any oilier.</li>
            <li> Rich aroma, smooth texture and oil-free application are key to this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs better and faster than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used and is truly non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, it absorbs super quick and it does not cause me allergies nor pimples so far.</li>
            <li> Protection good, but not very enjoyable if it got in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> friends tell me my face looks different :))..</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is reasonable and it does the job!</li>
            <li> I love to go to the beach with my dog and with this sunscreen I can go for several hours without ending up burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li> Although someone says that the &#x27;industry&#x27; standard distinguishes between the two terms -- most consumers do not.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena better not fail me or I&#x27;ll be posting my medical bills.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended for those who love spending time out under the sun.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Age Shield has contained the \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;...softened and evened-out my skin tone...and eliminated the crust on my nose...</li>
            <li> I am only confident to go out during a hot day when I put this on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, I stock up on these for the entire summer.</li>
            <li> we went back to our organic sunblock of SPF 30 which work much better for all of us.</li>
            <li> Because you get much more for your money using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer and 2)</li>
            <li> Which also brings me to mention that if you are of color or have olive or darker skin(3 skin tone or higher) ifyou wear the lotion with out makeup</li>
            <li> So with all that said I reserve this product for when I’m out in the sun for extended periods of time like 4-6 hours or more, and or when I go travel on vacation to warmer climates (southern U.S./tropics).</li>
            <li> So much for &amp;#34;won&#x27;t clog your pores&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this every day I plan on being outside for more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> To be more specific, I went to my dermatologist to discuss my situation</li>
            <li> and she gave me some pretty informative opinions.</li>
            <li> I am here to tell you that sunscreens of 50 spf or lower (many different brands including Neutrogena) DID NOT help in avoiding the sun or protecting my melanoma from the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> , I wish I had tried that first.  </li>
            <li> , I buy this, hoping it will help maintain my color through another hot summer.</li>
            <li> Went to Riviera Maya and our only regret was not buying more of this.</li>
            <li> only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the price / quantity ratio could be a bit better.</li>
            <li> When I was putting it on, it was ok for the first second, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does exactly that--and that&#x27;s because it clogs up your pores.</li>
            <li> it has to be pretty dang</li>
            <li> whenver you are planning to travel to hot countries, from my point of view this is not oily.</li>
            <li> (wipe with a terry cloth towel, not with a tissue because a tissue will leave more flecks behind), but this is a small inconvenience in exchange for good value, good sun protection, and a matte finish.</li>
            <li> It actually doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look like most sunscreens leave on your skin</li>
            <li> Even though I realize that it is more than likely ME and not the product, I don&#x27;t tolerate it at all.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying something else more sheer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i bought it from amazon, cheaper price than going to my local target.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It feels more like 40-50 and doesn&#x27;t avoid my skin to become red after some exposure to sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I use it most in the summer and only water resistant for 80min.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this religiously that has mostly diminished.</li>
            <li> Haha, anyone know why they are stealing it?!</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens leave this gritty, greasy feeling but this one did not.</li>
            <li> got the product because I am well aware that it is the UVA rays that are so damaging to your skin and thihs product</li>
            <li> Really protects~!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial sunscreen that&#x27;s more than a SPF 30.</li>
            <li> goes on fairly &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; but will blend into your skin after a few rubs.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily and I am in a very harsh environment and it does a excellent job of protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> On top of the strong chemical smell, it also feels heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a black interior in your car like I do, it may rub off making white stains (which are easily removable with any good cleaner for interiors)</li>
            <li> - there is sadly no tanning, I just go from white to bright red.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid too much money on expensive sunscreen all this time when this Neutrogena sunblock was the best one all</li>
            <li> Perfect for a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;CON: Too thick for daily use under makeup.  </li>
            <li> as I read the various reviews on Amazon--of this and comparable products--I pictured them being written by younger women, all with good skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;</li>
            <li> Compared to others, this is inexpensive and highly protective, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> , I will keep this product and just make sure that I certainly use the deep cleansing brush in conjunction with my Clarisonic to ensure that I get as much product out of my pores after use.  </li>
            <li> It sinks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Keep looking for sunscreen and don&#x27;t let all the positive reviews influence you.</li>
            <li> This is the case with everything I&#x27;ve tried though, and you become a pro at application pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I used this product during a week long trip through the Grand Canyon.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few years now and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> --now it&#x27;s pretty much all even.</li>
            <li> This one lasts as long as most.</li>
            <li> Washes off pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate if its doing its job or not - but it&#x27;s fairly lightweight and blends well.</li>
            <li> The top reviewer on this item is recommending three different items to a healthy looking skin who has received high number of helpful votes only in few weeks, amazing.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and smooth of this product and feel that at its high number will be protective of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up using it not just on my face, but on my arms/shoulders as well.&lt;br /&gt;And I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different sunscreens this is by far the best protection, the best scent, the least irritating, and no burns!</li>
            <li> See, I tan easily and as a result, I am about 20 different shades a brown.</li>
            <li> your dry skin can cause more wrinkles on your face.</li>
            <li> When I apply certain sunscreens and wear sunglasses my eyes begin to water uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a relatively large tube of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I was advised I needed a facial skin block as I live most the year in Florida.  </li>
            <li> have fair skin and do not want sun spots or premature aging ( I live in Florida, sunny all year round).</li>
            <li> I wear it under my makeup and while it&#x27;s not my absolute favorite (that would be Dr. Peter Thomas Roth Uber Dry Sunscreen)</li>
            <li> I felt a very mild sting, but it was very tolerable and I just continued with my regular routine and went to work.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of applying too much the first time I used it (more than a quarter sized) and liked never to rub all of that thick white cream into my skin!</li>
            <li> Very high spf too</li>
            <li> Very light, not filmy or ghostly, it also completely- completely leaves you white...</li>
            <li> My skin is light African American..doesn&#x27;t matter this is necessary for ALL complexions with or without makeup.. doesn&#x27;t leave a film so makeup application is fine even with a moisturizer added like I do..</li>
            <li> This product works great just as long as you don&#x27;t do anything active or move around much.</li>
            <li> This rubs in very well given its strength.</li>
            <li> Way, way too much perfume.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight but provides maximum coverage...</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lasts a whole day -</li>
            <li> I used to play golf twice on a week, it protect me very well against the skin damage for too much sun</li>
            <li> i really like this product.</li>
            <li> it really works for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> however if you perspire the cream can get in your eyes and really stings, so I have stopped using</li>
            <li> I can not tell much about it yet since I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, unscented -- in MY OPINION -- is the same as &#x27;Fragrance Free&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much we like it</li>
            <li> There are using some type of oil in this product that I think is responsible for this issue.  </li>
            <li> So you must gently pat it into the face.  </li>
            <li> but I sweat so much that this product doesn&#x27;t stand a chance on the waterproof part.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and really works.</li>
            <li> Use a mirror for even, precise application, lest you wanna look like a clown; yes, it&#x27;s a bit chalky white, but can be blended in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not recommended for oily skin, as it covers very well.  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on really pastey.</li>
            <li> I do wear it alone, on beach days, and it protects really well.  </li>
            <li> REALLY means for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s really softened my skin and evened it out--</li>
            <li> so I really have to use sunscreen every time to protect my skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Spreads well and very moist.</li>
            <li> doctor said they needed to watch and it really helps them avoid exposure.  </li>
            <li> You really have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I know that the product protected my skin very well because when I would go to the beach I would apply this product to my face and like Coppertone SPF 70 to the rest of my body to protect my skin and pace the progression of my tan through out the summer.</li>
            <li> This didn’t worry me too much.</li>
            <li> but when I used my face become very oily.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again, absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li> not very oily I apply make up on top of sunscreen and my make up</li>
            <li> /&gt;Along with that, it does not sink into my skin very well.</li>
            <li> but you really feel the difference wearing it in the sun.</li>
            <li> This works REALLY REALLY  </li>
            <li> (I men, really, who wants to wear a hat in the ocean???)</li>
            <li> its cakey to much to handle, I have grown to dislike it and have switched to alba organics emollient sunscreen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and works very well.</li>
            <li> Very oily, maybe I should change the product I wish prozone gel but&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and she loves it, it works really well under makeup and is not oily at all</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really tan</li>
            <li> and you have to really blend it&lt;</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it</li>
            <li> but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;</li>
            <li> You can really feel it on your fingertips which makes me want to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic facial sun screen and one</li>
            <li> It thoroughly protects against any hint of sunburn and I&#x27;m very fair-skinned.</li>
            <li> If using powdered makeup you will need to gently blot your face with a paper towel after application of the sunscreen and before the powdery makeup but the sun protection is still there.</li>
            <li> Really valuable if you are outdoors  a lot.</li>
            <li> The cast would stay on my face for about an hour or two, not all day by any means, but it was VERY noticeable and</li>
            <li> Works very well in the Caribbean trip we took.</li>
            <li> It does not feel very greasy, I do feel that something is on.    </li>
            <li> It was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work for me.  </li>
            <li> It is light enough and non greasy so that I can wear this under makeup.</li>
            <li> I just got a light tan on my face even after staying in the Florida sun for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I rub it on my whole face, ears and neck.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I have struggled wi acnea my whole life.</li>
            <li> This product caused an intense rash to break out on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> fast delivery,</li>
            <li> No sheen, and doesn&#x27;t have much of an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I really believe on Neutrogena sunblock products, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me the felling that&#x27;s a 110 SPF.</li>
            <li> I used this in Roatan, where it is very sunny.</li>
            <li> It protected my face &amp; neck very well from the sun.</li>
            <li> Well it makes it more harder if you are dressed up with this under makeup foundation /face powder concealer and having to do your makeup all over for reapplication of this.</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s very picky with face products.</li>
            <li> She wants to keep buying Neutrogena SPF 110..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> Hopefully someone will develop a form of travel, because I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> As much as it cost, I try to save when I can.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;skin type: very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not greasy and really protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> Just check the ewg&#x27;s skin deep cosmetics database online to find out how hazardous this product can be to us, human.    </li>
            <li> It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> If I am working in the yard for more than a couple of hours, I apply it a second time for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> I am also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely and is not heavy or hard to absorb as others have commented - in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong product since it goes several layers deep</li>
            <li> Feels like most other for-the-face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend in super easy, but not sure any with that much SPF would.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a lot more even as far as some oily spots and some dry spots</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy, spreads evenly and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I clearly did not get too much sun that day!</li>
            <li> I get dark spots from the sun a lot, but I still love going out to the beach.</li>
            <li> definitely something to put on when planning to be in direct/heavy sun for a while because feels much better than actual sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that 110SPF isn&#x27;t really &#x27;necessary&#x27;, but this stuff it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face, it isn&#x27;t overly oily, or overly drying, and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had any kind of allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> It has a higher SPF, It applies evenly without streaking, it truly is completely matte even over my moisturizer</li>
            <li> I was previously using a day cream that had only 15 SPF, and wanted something more potent, especially given that I live in a sunny, hot climate and am trying to avoid sun damage.</li>
            <li> I found the Age Shield Face Lotion to be more greasy and found that it would run down my face a bit when I sweat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First class product which I wish was sold in UK where I live!</li>
            <li> Even better, the cream doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy like a lot of sunscreens, so I find I&#x27;m much less hesitant to put in on.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and I feel comfortable with that lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion is typically oily feeling as most all sunscreens are, even cetaphil&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; face lotion is.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried using less of the product and spreading it more vigorously doesn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> - this is typical with most sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and clear - no hazy white residue</li>
            <li> When buying sunscreen look for zinc oxyde as a main ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t penetrate your skin and stays on the surface protecting your skin.</li>
            <li> I get a decent burn or end up with color by summer&#x27;s end.  </li>
            <li> The sun damages this protein, which is why we ladies who sun a lot look older.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it still makes my face oily when I apply it so after I apply it I use an oil blot and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a really decent sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The Age Shield is decent at what it does.</li>
            <li> I purchased Age Shield face SPF 110 because as I&#x27;ve gotten older the sun wreaks havoc with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have gotten older</li>
            <li> I also was interested in having  high SPF because I live in a beach town and therefore go to the beach frequently in the summer time.</li>
            <li> high quality sunscreen</li>
            <li> I get this stuff close to my eyes (eye lids after I got a burn from high noon exposure despite chunky sunglasses) and don&#x27;t get it in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it is rated 7/10, high hazard.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend-</li>
            <li> I started wearing sun screen at the advise of my doctor because my face is highly susceptible to sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I use this high spf version on my face when I go cycling.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as it is value for money.</li>
            <li> First time I use this product (Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110) and I bought it based on the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as greasy as most, but it&#x27;s still a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s reviews that claim that it does not  leave a white film on your face, because of EXACTLY what it does!  </li>
            <li> My face and bald head seems to break out easy with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using retinol and other things on my skin that make me sunburn really easy.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if this works any better than SPF 45, but it&#x27;s really no more expensive and works fine</li>
            <li> B. not place MUCH stronger language cautioning users with sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick feel on the skin (face).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spent a lot of time in the sun, but came home comfortable.</li>
            <li> Clean dry.</li>
            <li> I have moderately sensitive skin...not overly so, but I&#x27;m selective in choosing gentle products for my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li> There is a light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long or upset my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although it is suppose to be reapplied frequently-I apply it twice a day and most and do not have trouble with burning.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normal to oily and this leaves a dewy finish that interferes with the application of my foundation.  </li>
            <li> This is nice and not greasy (or at least in my experience).  </li>
            <li> as an aside, I have no allergies, skin or otherwise, and have &#x27;normal&#x27; skin on my face.</li>
            <li> The temporary white appearance is worth it.</li>
            <li> The higher SPF level didn&#x27;t matter, really, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it for the white filmy look.</li>
            <li> hope FDA regulation on sunscreen chemicals changes soon so that the US sunscreen market can match European and Asian markets in effective relatively inexpensive chemical products..</li>
            <li> Thicker stuff than a normal lotion, but works well and dries to a lighter feel.</li>
            <li> It is kind of thick, but I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is ideal for serious daily protection without looking like a tourist slathered in sweet smelling mess.  </li>
            <li> This is a chemical sunscreen which are generally less effective than the physical.</li>
            <li> B00L3KEIZO a cucumber eye cream]] when you&#x27;re not in the sun as that&#x27;s more natural and has less</li>
            <li> To its credit, it&#x27;s not as greasy as most generic body sunscreens, but it does NOT leave a dry finish.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and in the country where I live the UV radiation is too high.</li>
            <li> Except...when I thought about it, Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free face wash back in high school did something very similar...</li>
            <li> Light and not oily like some other sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li> You know how cheap moisturizers make your face sweat in sunlight, even though you&#x27;re not hot?</li>
            <li> Cant live without this product.</li>
            <li> And yea, yea, yea I don&#x27;t live under a rock, I&#x27;ve heard that once you get to 30</li>
            <li> I guess I can live without a &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I started using this since I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Re purchase, condition of the item was new as described by seller (the box and the item itself), everything A-okay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HAVE AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE WITH SEVERE PHOTOSENSATIVITY AND LIVE IN HI...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> good product except it leaves your face with a white tint to it that people will notice.it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I had a melanoma, but some people more conscientious mean not like that pale look it gives you.</li>
            <li> However, it feels pretty light and does not seem to make my face overwarm which has been an issue for me in the past with some thicker sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This sun block is the only one that keeps myself and my son relatively free from sunburn despite being out in the middle of the day for soccer practice and tournaments.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sunscreen and the ONLY spf strength that allows me to enjoy the sun, without a hat</li>
            <li> Deep From Skin-Aging UVA Rays\\&quot;\\&quot; is a lie since the chemicals that form a product&#x27;s sun protection factor are aimed at blocking ultraviolet B rays, which are the primary cause of sunburn and non-melanoma skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma (von Thaler 2010).</li>
            <li> I found the later mentioned gourp were kind of greasy with the feeling of thickness and heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I put it on each morning after my shower, I live in Florida and so far no sun burn on my face!</li>
            <li> And I would think Neutrogena ought to label their products and clearly state &#x27;highly scented&#x27; or &#x27;unscented&#x27; on their products.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m quite surprised given their highly regarded brand that they would a. Sell this product at all and</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the high quality of this Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Even after doing my best to spread it thinly, I look oddly pale.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I would change this product for another is that the spf would be higher in the new product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and living in Rio de Janeiro I am constantly out in the scorching hot sun.</li>
            <li> It has the same exact ingredients in the same exact amounts as their SPF 85 spray.</li>
            <li> but my 17 month old broke out into hives and rashes everywhere!</li>
            <li> so it does leave some of a white cast at first</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin by any means, so if you do, be cautious!</li>
            <li> In conclusion, this product will remain in my cosmetic skin care arsenal, but I will continue to use Clinique’s City sunblock SPF 40 for my daily sunscreen until I find a higher SPF that wont break me out.</li>
            <li> Doesnt sting, burn, run into my eyes during outdoor exercise, and so far, no sunburns!</li>
            <li> You can definitely get it on sale for cheaper at CVS if you&#x27;re willing to wait for a sale.</li>
            <li> So I ended up buying 2 tubes for the price of 1 of Neutrogenia for the exact same things.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave my face all oily like some other sunscreen (because its oil free) and it leaves my face feeling and looking young.</li>
            <li> You can put on as much as you want and you can barely feel it on your face!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The hike was out in the open for about 80% of that hike, and the day was hot (90 degree day).</li>
            <li> so I first went to a local store and bought some.  </li>
            <li> it leave my face so soft!</li>
            <li> Ok, ranking lotions and sunscreens isn&#x27;t what I usually do, but after reading a lot of reviews on Amazon, I settled on this product.</li>
            <li> Also seems to be relatively easy on my sensitive skin and wont leave me oily or with breakouts which are common from most other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> feel confident with this sunscreen having a high SPF, for the mountain summer has been bright this year, and I make trips to Louisiana and Texas, where the sun is brutal.</li>
            <li> My new dermatologist nearly fainted when I told her</li>
            <li> It dries and doesn&#x27;t feel oily a few minutes after putting it on, and can be washed off easily with face soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve found with Neutrogena is that it&#x27;s one of the best facial lotions+moisturizers for active people like me because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or give me pimples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even remotely oily and good to use everyday!</li>
            <li> t is not super thick and strong smelling like most sunscreens and eventually rubs in.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this sunscreen is that I live in a hot humid place and on a hot humid day it doesn&#x27;t protect as well as on a dry day.</li>
            <li> No other sunscreen I have ever found has this high of an SPF rating.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m outside for more than half an hour</li>
            <li> My current dermatologist has approved this product, and I certainly will be using it for life.  </li>
            <li> The next time I used about a nickel size and applied it to my face, and then a little more to my throat and chest.</li>
            <li> People always compliment on my skin and how clear it is...</li>
            <li> minutes)\\&quot; clearly on the front of the tube.  </li>
            <li> , i switched to neutrogena clear face</li>
            <li> The FDA should get around to limiting wild SPF claims like Europe and Australia have already done.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply it anywhere near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s a complete part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn since using this sunscreen but it caused my sensitive, acne-prone skin to break out.</li>
            <li> but i did use it for my 17 month old</li>
            <li> Her face swelled up and turned red,her eyes were very puffy.her whole body was covered in hives.i did test a small spot first</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ll use this tube up on days when I wear no makeup and am outside in the intense Florida sunshine.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve sold me on my old standby, Obagi.d me on my old standby, Obagi.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft supple.</li>
            <li> then I Googled &amp;#34;Allergic to Neutrogena products&amp;#34; and a whole slough of reviews/complaints/reports came up on countless websites about issues with all of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not acne prone, but I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It turns out that the SPF rating only pertains to UVB rays -- not UVA ray which cause the real damage to skin and skin cells.</li>
            <li> And no breakouts, so far.</li>
            <li> Applying also helps reduce acne and reduces scars from old acne 👌</li>
            <li> By the 3rd day of our honeymoon you could tell I was not applying it over my feet very well</li>
            <li> was to completely wash it off all together which defeats the purpose of wearing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it is soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes or it will burn.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and leaves my skin moist.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my face feel soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as far as I know, this product does what it&#x27;s stated to do otherwise.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy nor greasy, and it makes my skin softer.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Product is really helping her look younger, she says, and she also likes the fact it is SPF 110, too.</li>
            <li> No producer has any mix that protects human skin from UVA, none, absolutely none.</li>
            <li> far, my skin hasn&#x27;t been sensitive to this product</li>
            <li> Works well for my neck, chest, and arms, but burns my sensitive face and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> Is not harsh on skin as it works as a moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li> Then I would really have a ghostly white paste all over my face.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works well against the sun&#x27;s rays, wear hat/cap to keep direct rays away from facial/neck skin.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised when I found about this product with Spf 110.</li>
            <li> and my face went completely unburned despite snorkeling, swimming, and sweating.</li>
            <li> What sold me were two reviews: One written by an 80+ year old woman who says she has used the product for years, and one by someone who says it doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put too much on and it leaves white streaks but that is operator error with over application.</li>
            <li> a lot of sunscreens you really cannot blend makeup over it properly - if it is a matt sunscrreen you can&#x27;t blend and if it is too oily</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it is the only noe that really works on my &amp;#34;Irish&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and have never had any reaction to this product and have been using it for over a month</li>
            <li> You should apply whatever your daily routine consists of only after waiting 15-30 minutes for the sunscreen to be absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> Although I am sure this product does its job of protecting your skin, it has a thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect base for makeup primer and foundation.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with the Obagi, whose matte finish works perfectly as a makeup base alone in the summer when I don&#x27;t need additional moisturizer on my T zone.  </li>
            <li> Very dry so cream or dry foundation/powder apply easily.</li>
            <li> works well on face, light sweating no problem with eyes, last a long time, will buy this again next time</li>
            <li> My dark spots do not get darker, larger, or more obvious.</li>
            <li> Which means constant reapplication is necessary for full effect especially for someone like me who sweats throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people swear by zinc based sunscreens, but I have used MANY products over years of daily sunscreen use, and every zinc containing sunscreen I used broke down into a white milky liquid when I started to sweat.</li>
            <li> So in the long run, I&#x27;m not really saving a huge amount by switching brands.  </li>
            <li> Even does pretty well over short facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I had paid 3 x times as much for some of the High End Brands at Macy&#x27;s and was always disappointed, Now, I am in love with this, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> ( Asian, female, 42 ) I need to check the mirror carefully to make sure no white residue on my face.</li>
            <li> Some one would say it is no necessary to use high SPF as 110.</li>
            <li> I have tried over a dozen sunscreens on my face including $40/bottle high end brands and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or skin.  </li>
            <li> this high would leave my face with a white cast.</li>
            <li> It used to be pretty much a given that you could trust Neutrogena to be good for people with allergies or sensitive skin, but these days it&#x27;s just the same old crap</li>
            <li> Because of the way SPF values are calculated these errors would be most dramatic for high SPF products.</li>
            <li> Because of the way SPF values are calculated these errors would be most dramatic for high SPF products.</li>
            <li> Plus the main drag, is that it does not have a high viscosity.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any burns or a tan and have been walking over an hour a day at high noon and take my son to the park with my husband for about an hour and a half, so that is 2.5 hours of direct sun on Very High UV days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sheer, not thick on the skin like some others.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and the light, almost imperceptible scent makes it guy-friendly too!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I thought it was fragrance free</li>
            <li> how after I apply it, it really doesnt take long to sink in.  </li>
            <li> Goes on like any other sun block, but like that it offers a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and does not clog my pores like other sunscreens have in the past.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would look a little sun baked after a day outside even though I wore a huge amount of these suncreens (and applied 30 minutes before sun exposure, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sheer is much drier feeling and overall lighter.</li>
            <li> - you rub in too much - you start sweating a lot (initially, in the mirror you don&#x27;t see white, but people will tell you after you start sweating a lot)  </li>
            <li> So although the product does make your skin go a bit white, that really does not matter if you can totally blend makeup over</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m only in my very early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s face is very sensitive, and this is the only product that helps her.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum SPF 110</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a sunscreen that claimed to last more than 80 minutes, though you usually have to search for the tiny writing that says to reapply after 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum SPF 110, 3.0 FL...</li>
            <li> Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110, 3.0 FL...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy in hot and humid sun, but as a daily sunscreen, I have no complaints outside of the white cast.</li>
            <li> This is Broad Spectrum SPF 110.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and broad sun protection.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately I have a whole tube barley used, i use it for my body feet, anything but my face, it really broke out after one use, and I NEVER break out to much TOO MUCH CHEMICALS, stay away GO ORGANIC,</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a great value and it was not like the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, where you have that oily uncomfortable feeling for the rest of the day, like there&#x27;s something on your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other lotions for my face because, you know, avoiding cancer and stuff, but I think I disliked this one the most out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> According to other sources, anything above SPF 50 is kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> The same active ingredients or pure chemicals in this item are sold by many other sunscreen makers for five times less in cost with one exception, others do not have Helioplex which offers rash and burning eyes.</li>
            <li> essential for anyone who lives in the middle east and doesn&#x27;t want to look like a tortoise when they get older.</li>
            <li> Like a jerk I ordered 4 of these because it&#x27;s so hard to find a sunblock that&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I easily get dark spots when my skin is in the sun and other discolorations.</li>
            <li> I still like the quality of some other products, like Blue Lizard; but this absorbs better, is less greasy and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a daily sunscreen with a very high SPF, to help fade the hyperpigmentation, and further protect my skin on a daily basis to prevent aging.</li>
            <li> it keeps me protected from the sun and at the same time, it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never going back to my old stuff.  </li>
            <li> When applying, the lotion does take away some color and gives a ghostly white appearance but my skin feels so soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is non-greasy, you barely know you put any on even before it dries.  </li>
            <li> Very light feeling on the skin with little to no shine once fully dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of using sunscreen in general along with other products, such as moisturizer or foundation, use sunscreen first after cleansing and toning your face.</li>
            <li> She have a very sensitive skin, and also had acne for a long time</li>
            <li> There is a slight &#x27;suntan product&#x27; odor, but it&#x27;s not strong and I&#x27;m sure no one can smell it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use very often, but would definitely use when staying outside for a long time.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is one of the few (if not the only) companies that specializes in purely chemical sunscreens which have high enough PA (system used to rate blocking of UVA rays, the ones that cause the majority of skin aging)..</li>
            <li> I sat all day in full sun watching a rodeo and any usual sunblock would have left me like a lobster.</li>
            <li> 50spf and up is decent in terms of practical durations of time spent out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave a thin white film on my skin that becomes particularly prominent over time.</li>
            <li> so the other reviewers said that this is not thick?!</li>
            <li> happy with the product, feels a little thick but does blend into your skin well after a little massage…</li>
            <li> No other sunscreen I have ever found has no greasy feeling white cast, or off putting scent either.  </li>
            <li> One major issue is that this sunscreen does look very white when applied.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price and for how long a tube lasts with generous application, I would recommend it to those on a very tight budget who still want to wear sunscreen daily.</li>
            <li> it will run and it will run a little white, but for me its worth the extra protection!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it started as slight irritation - the kind of irratation that causes your kids to scream about sunscreen in their eyes but as an adult male you suck it up and pretend that it&#x27;s not getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck, decolletage and back of my hands - as I&#x27;m outside for up to four hours everyday and its essential to have adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena sunscreen was a FAIL for me but it will be suitable for the beach</li>
            <li> The part about not getting a sunburn was accurate because I was not able to stand the burning eyeballs long enough to get any sun exposure!  </li>
            <li> I will not be repurchasing this product, but that&#x27;s because in general I prefer a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it will  be apparent on your skin, and give of an ashy like, or what people describe a purplish look on your skin when, and especially if you are perspire on the beach.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully I will not have to suffer any pain for going out in the sun in the near and long term.  </li>
            <li> a few \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; it couldn&#x27;t contain...</li>
            <li> Heavy sun exposure is the main culprit for aging skin, as sun affects the collagen, which is a protein fiber produced in the body that keeps you looking young.</li>
            <li> tube is a bit pricey, after I found the exact same thing at walgreens, the generic version for half the price.</li>
            <li> It is a little wonder Sunscreen, more than usual sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, usually no waiting time to dry prior to moisturizer application.  </li>
            <li> Leaves white residue that are very noticeable on my dark skin</li>
            <li> Now with modern dermatology, I have rid myself of dark circles and must use sunscreen religiously .</li>
            <li> and it disappears in a few minutes (although it&#x27;s white when first applied).  </li>
            <li> So I did a little research and found out that this is a very misleading product along with other high SPF products.</li>
            <li> I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i bought this lotion because my skin is sensitive to sunlight (burns within 3 hours), and feels slightly hotter than i can stand under direct exposure.  </li>
            <li> If I put too much on at one time, there are white &#x27;streaks,&#x27; but I found that two applications, using less lotion, tackles this.</li>
            <li> just recommend using a little if you are darker skinned because it makes your face white if you use too much.</li>
            <li> gave this the ultimate challenge of taking a long walk on a 90 degree afternoon with mid-day sun and no other form of sun protection.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; at first, but soon sinks into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> Despite being very thick, once it was rubbed in it left a light, dry finish.</li>
            <li> : If you have dark skin, you might have a noticeable white film if: - you don&#x27;t rub it in completely</li>
            <li> , spfs are just relative to how long you can have that sunscreen on in the sun or outside before the need of reapplication.</li>
            <li> This goes on pretty thick and waaaayyyy too white!</li>
            <li> And remember these rays are still present even at night when the sun is down so always apply quality sunscreen before you head out to keep your skin looking young and reduce aging/damage caused by the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Scientists know less about the dangers of UVA radiation, but the general consensus is that it is less obvious than UVB damage but possibly more serious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a few bucks too high online and will be cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> and I am prone to melisma, so I must wear high level SPF everyday.  </li>
            <li> The only down side with physical sunscreens are that they generally leave a white haze on your skin.</li>
            <li> I live abroad and asked a friend to bring a few things back from the states for me.</li>
            <li> maybe i got an old product or something because this sunscreen is super thick and makes applying foundation pretty difficult.</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams, this barely leaves a white layer like look</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an SPF of 70.&lt;br /&gt;It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A minor amount of perspiration (or even humidity) will make this film bead into white droplets that are unseemly.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first because it went on thick</li>
            <li> a little oily at the begin but a few minuts is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Neutrogena Sunblocks ( Dry touch and Sensitive Skin)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and the white residue is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I’m a mixed race black whose skin tone falls anywhere between 3-4 maybe half way into 5 according to theFitzpatrick Skin Tone chart depending on how much I beach it up in the summer time on the .</li>
            <li> In the future I would probably just but the Ultra Dry Touch and use that on my face and body instead of buying a separate face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I previously used another sunscreen by another company, which I loved, but this Neutrogena is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I did dress covering myself just like the Galapagos guides, covered in khaki and wide brimmed hats,  but occasionally this obviously worked, like when snorkeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll definitely feel it on your face--certainly not lightweight.</li>
            <li> These white spots will turn pink if I am out in the sun or simply driving in my car, unless I use spf 110.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 tubes and a little goes a long way I will continue for as long as God let&#x27;s me live</li>
            <li> Over the years I have built up less sun tolerance, and a need for sunscreen daily because of the use of other products that my skin very sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> When I started using it on the first day, my first impressions were, the cream was so oily and uncomfortable on my skin and it smells like typical beach sunscreen.</li>
            <li> There would always be white left somewhere on my face, especially in the little hairs around my eyebrows and hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> The other thing that I noticed is that after awhile upon application, the sunscreen balls up into tiny white balls that make you look like you have dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feeling is definitely more like the sheer line of Neutrogena sunscreens but still has an unpleasant feeling/smell long after putting it on.</li>
            <li> With an SPF spectrum of 110 and oil free, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen feels light and airy, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me aside from the faint sunscreen smell (unavoidable in my experience).  </li>
            <li> I apply this product to areas with dark spots on my face that are a result of working in the sun for years, using it in combination with  Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 70 for overall protection.</li>
            <li> spent hours in the sun and barely red.  </li>
            <li> After seeing friends and family deal with the results of accumulated sun exposure I asked my dermatologist what to use to avoid this for both now and long term.  </li>
            <li> I find I have to really be careful when I got outside because of the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  </li>
            <li> Use it for long bike rides in the sun.</li>
            <li> so I expected stinging and burning but the only time I felt</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and the thickness (but not too thick) really makes me feel like I am protecting my face.</li>
            <li> It had the same ingredients in it and smells almost the same, but at half the price.</li>
            <li> warning: as other reviews state, this WILL burn/sting your eyes if you accidentally get even a tiny bit of it in them from, for example, scratching your face, and it DOES take a long time for the irritation to subside.</li>
            <li> , i need a very small amount if i put too much</li>
            <li> Also, the tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Looks really finished and at that point you&#x27;ve got some serious UVA protection.</li>
            <li> I like the dry touch product line.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt dry out the skin when applied.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> anyway it doesn&#x27;t let my skin dry</li>
            <li> Way too dry for my skin, I recommend this for people wth oily skin or else</li>
            <li> I have dry skin too, so if it makes me look greasy</li>
            <li> I like it as it is with dry touch, non-greasy and non-shinny.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not oily and can be reapplied a few times daily especially when out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Seems like this Neutrogena age shield face sunscreen does the opposite; at least for young people with almost no wrinkle pre-lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too hard and does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well because it is made like an underarm deodorant&lt;br /&gt;The cap is poorly designed and you have to make sure that you roll it back down into the applicator or the lid</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little too thick and dries too quickly like the other one, so you need more&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> secret ;)</li>
            <li> Worse of all is that it caused lots of additional breakouts which can scar defeating the purpose of why I was using the sunscreen in the first place.</li>
            <li> I appreciated this aspect of the product because typically women who have acne prone skin have to purchase quality foundations/products that are high end and expensive to avoid breakouts.</li>
            <li> Even though I live in the Southwest, I&#x27;ve been slow to get on the sunscreen band-wagon.</li>
            <li> I have white spots on my upper arms, which a dermatologist simply described as absence of color, because the color cells were too tired to make pigment.  </li>
            <li> BUT when they say oil-less  and/or dry, they lie!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something with a real dry finish, go for Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Dry Touch\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight white sheen on the face-</li>
            <li> but I am not sure that is possible with a sunscreen at all, especially one that works.</li>
            <li> However, if I don&#x27;t have a half hour to let it sink in, it leaves a noticeable white cast on my face.</li>
            <li> After I apply a small amount, I&#x27;m left with a white color on my face.</li>
            <li> and I do find that this lotion gives my skin a slight white tint, so</li>
            <li> no be so red and less break outs.</li>
            <li> I am on medications that make my skin burn within 20 mins of sun exposure and I apply this usually once in the morning and on a normal day (that I&#x27;m in and out, not outside all day) usually don&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is expensive for how much you get; it will not last long</li>
            <li> I have a a short trimmed black beard and there was really no problem with the sunscreen except it coating the hairs and making them shinier.</li>
            <li> My eyes were still a little irritated the next morning.  </li>
            <li> but they always made me look a little bit shiny with daily use.</li>
            <li> By far worth the money if you want to save some down the line on expensive age repair creams!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little tiny bit greasy (as expected from any sunscreen) and it does the trick without complications.</li>
            <li> With broad Spectrum SPF 110, it seems to slow the further darkening of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> is refunding me the $ I spent.</li>
            <li> and I recently started using it everyday to protect my self from getting wrinkles.</li>
            <li> its a shame because i&#x27;d would use this everyday if it wouldn&#x27;t leave my face white.</li>
            <li> When my face got wet, I didn&#x27;t have sunscreen running into my eyes or burning them.</li>
            <li> works the way I expected and advertised</li>
            <li> A rays penetrate deeper into the skin and are harder to block with sunscreen ingredients approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for use in US sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Which makes this review even harder to write.</li>
            <li> any of that was when I applied it too thick, and too near my eyes.</li>
            <li> it helps protecting  my face a lot from the heat esp living in Vegas where there&#x27;s always dry heat in summertime...highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I try to use this spf as a daily base under makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> I put on sunscreen and I never worry about rash or burning eyes since the ingredients are organic not pure chemicals with fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the powerful scent very irritating to my nose.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this must not have been enough or I didn&#x27;t reapply as often as I should have because I got new brown spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> although, unlike any other sunscreen lotion this tends to make my face look oily, so I use some powder based make up on my face after applying this.</li>
            <li> Will probably try other products for use under make-up.</li>
            <li> this is one that exceeds all other Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not be using it except on other body parts.  </li>
            <li> The other side of the coin is zits.  </li>
            <li> this is a sunscreen cream like all other creams.</li>
            <li> So I end up keeping a couple different types of sunscreens--cheaper greasy sunscreen I put on just for the beach or those horrible 100 degree 100% humidty days and this one whom I love!  </li>
            <li> Its not as oily as other skin beauty products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I use it on my scar and other blemishes where I&#x27;m trying to restrict sun exposure</li>
            <li> In addition, I noted that if you don&#x27;t spread it extremely well and have a darker skin tone it will leave you with a ghost face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other sunscreens with lower spfs after hearing health reports that an spf higher than @ 50 is useless.</li>
            <li> Only takes small amount for coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not blend well with face cream or other lotions&lt;</li>
            <li> My face has never gotten burned or turned pink while using this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Using other sunscreens, every 2 hours, I still got burned on my face.  </li>
            <li> Truly keeps rays of the sun from face and other body parts.</li>
            <li> sunscreen, on the other hand, is everything I was hoping to avoid.</li>
            <li> but my face was never even pink!</li>
            <li> Small difference in application thickness could have a similar effect.</li>
            <li> There is no oder to clash with other cosmetics I wear.  </li>
            <li> Almost want to apply this to all my body to replace my other Neutrogena sun screen product.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> But I still like it because of non-greasy product compared to other sun-screams.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I forget I have it on</li>
            <li> But other than that</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this expensive crap, initially based on the high SPF and the high # of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-50s and have to be very careful in the sun.  </li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL when applying under the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and white when initially applied, but vanishes as it&#x27;s blended in.  </li>
            <li> Active Ingredients I got off the tube: avobenzone 3%, homosalate 15%, octisalate 5%, octocrylene 10%, oxybenzone 6%  </li>
            <li> I remember on the bottle that the active ingredient was zinc dioxide.</li>
            <li> I came back outside to the pool and made it about another 20 minutes and contemplated scrubbing my eyes with some nearby muriatic acid but decided that would make it worse.  </li>
            <li> Just have to be careful if you&#x27;re wearing black since it tends to rub off onto clothing.  </li>
            <li> If i wear sunglasses and take them off, there is a white line of sunscreen left behind where the sunglasses touched</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients; Avobenzone (3%) , Homosalate (15%) , Octisalate (5%) , Octocrylene (4%) , Oxybenzone (5%)  </li>
            <li> Recommended by dr (for very pale people) and has made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> It was terrible, after use my skin had an extreme burning sensation for a good 3 days after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than other versions of Neutrogena&#x27;s face sunblock.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t make your skin white(I&#x27;m dark skin)</li>
            <li> My dark spots have minimized drastically.</li>
            <li> and I get dark spots from the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ineffective and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this to combine it with my BB cream, but it&#x27;s too thick, white, and pasty.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be way too thick for daily use under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left a thick greasy film everywhere</li>
            <li> When I went for a run it looked like milk was running down my face.</li>
            <li> And the Neutrogena sunscreen makes my makeup slide down my face in a couple of hours,</li>
            <li> Then I apply this sunscreen all the way down to my neck.</li>
            <li> The SPF levels did not let me down</li>
            <li> this is one that exceeds all other Neutrogena products!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as other sunscreens, but stings a little around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it burns because I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Some other kinds of sun cream make me like crying.</li>
            <li> With my previous sunblock (cetaphil spf 50)</li>
            <li> And the liquid Neutrogena,which is $10 for 1.7 ounces, is half the size of the Obagi, which is $25 with Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> I would get the Neutrogena SPF 110 and just dilute it a little with my face cream for my face and a little body lotion for other areas.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased it for every day use, as I&#x27;m getting serious about sun care to prevent signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> have to be careful to wipe my eyebrows after applying because sometimes the sunblock leaves powdery white flecks behind</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is not suitable for using under makeup unless your skin is dry, which mine is not.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact it does not make a mess and its not oily.</li>
            <li> No greasy mess</li>
            <li> , why would it take so long to ship this in a day and age where two-day shipping is usually guaranteed?!</li>
            <li> and now I have a lot less after using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Practically all other sun screens say very little at al about the strength of their UVA shield.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had little brown spots on my hand</li>
            <li> I just dust a little bit of powder on and go.</li>
            <li> I have tried all other products and still get small burns here and there.</li>
            <li> will a little face cream,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little too expensive&lt;</li>
            <li> I found this product and a little dab does wonders.</li>
            <li> 5 mins later it dried and left a terrible white residue on my face and the only way to fix it</li>
            <li> Almost too heavy.  </li>
            <li> and it is never greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Twice I have returned to Neutrogena&#x27;s 110 SPF, both times with a rash occurring within a few hours&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> somewhat pigmented, acne prone, oily, 20-something, few lines, semi-sensitive</li>
            <li> You will be crying for a couple of hours if you get even the smallest amount of this product in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble finding a product that doesn&#x27;t feel so heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like to wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would take a few days to ship.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy and even blends well with my brown skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face oily, but I still had a few blemishes after using this every day for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It went away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Even if I wait a few hours before putting on sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since I bought</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> I put this on all year round.</li>
            <li> and I use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> I now mix a few drops in my moisturizer instead of using the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; product on my face.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday for sun protection.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it as an everyday protection.</li>
            <li> when this lotion i can walk in the sunlight without feeling that uncomfortable burning sensation from direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> IT keeps your skin from getting wrinkles caused by the sun, apply everyday 20-30 min before going out into the sun.........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of lotions with SPF and they all feel really heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I got a few breakouts from it</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste money, but</li>
            <li> Most of the products she used in the past are very expensive and at the end she was never happy with the product and keep changing brands.</li>
            <li> It stings around my eyes, so I ended up crying to wash it out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, let&#x27;s hope it achieves its ultimate goal, which is reducing the likelihood I&#x27;ll get burned--or worse, skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy - I wear it EVERYDAY even in winter.</li>
            <li> It has a heavy consistency and takes a few minutes to soak in, but I ride motorcycle and have never gotten a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I mean, I just don&#x27;t get where they&#x27;re getting this arbitrary number.</li>
            <li> The only flaw, as in other reviews, is the uncomfortable feeling if it gets in the eyes or if applied too close.  </li>
            <li> but I have pale skin with freckles</li>
            <li> It also left my skin really dry which is not attractive at the least!</li>
            <li> stopped using this sunscreen now twice, using other products for at least a month.</li>
            <li> No strong smell, not visible, not oily.</li>
            <li> No strong whitecast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my personal experience with this product has been pretty horrifying.  </li>
            <li> This also broke me out a little on my forhead and chin, small pimples emerged a couple days after I used the product, every time I used it on my face...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> but it is nowhere near as bad as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Im 20 and with very little acne</li>
            <li> I usually use powder over it to help take care of the coloring issue as well as the oily-ish look that results from wearing it.</li>
            <li> Wear this everyday!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well, but it stings like crazy if I get it anywhere near my eyes.</li>
            <li> you are crying for at least 30 min.</li>
            <li> I usually apply in the a.m., refresh midday with Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit cleansing wipes and re-apply for [sunny] walk home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For something so small and within the states</li>
            <li> Not sure about the SPF 110, but they could call it SPF 1 million for all I care...</li>
            <li> I think for just office work wear but need the SPF for the mail run or lunch outing that this does not need hourly reapplication - but not sure.</li>
            <li> The last sunscreen I used was this: [[ASIN:B002JAYMEE Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen, SPF 100, 3 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]].</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to do the job, but I do wake up with small blemishes from time-to-time since I began using it.  </li>
            <li> By the time I reached work, it was burning enough for me to be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Usually an spf</li>
            <li> If you find some sunscreens irritating, be careful!</li>
            <li> IOW on one of those FL days when just stepping out the car is enough to make you break a sweat the sunscreen is almost useless, as soon as you start sweating you start burning, or at least I do--same thing at beach.  </li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin that is very pale.</li>
            <li> My wife was the only other one complaining about her eyes being irratated - albeit not as bad.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;d turn \\&quot;angry red\\&quot; during long sun exposures...</li>
            <li> Works we but really irritates my eyes:(</li>
            <li> It leaves a horrible thick white residue all over your face, you&#x27;d think this would at least offer some moisture, but no, it dries out your skin and left my face flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> I used to get tags and freckles and now hardly any.</li>
            <li> It still feels a little greasy and is irritating to the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I currently and have had a history of acne prone skin that has left unfortunate marks of hyperpigmentation on my skin from bad flare ups in response hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Since it is labeled as a face lotion, loses a lot of stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, smells inoffensive.</li>
            <li> This product was too thick for my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and rubs in well and protects from the sun.  </li>
            <li> However, a thick slab of this on my face and arms and I can&#x27;t seem to get it to blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried Neutrogena&#x27;s UltraSheer Dry-Touch sunscreen with SPF 55, but it felt thick on my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves a thick, sticky &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on your hands after application.</li>
            <li> It is thick</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> No breakouts from this product, despite the fact that is is thick.  </li>
            <li> what I mean is ALL products that have a SPF use chemicals that your face does not need to achieve that.</li>
            <li> It came as no shock that after years of swimming my skin was in need of some serious TLC.</li>
            <li> If you need serious skin protection, this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> It also smells a little weird</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> not a good look</li>
            <li> it leaves your skin feeling greasy and gives a shiny appeance, and it is not good to use under make-up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy, oily, uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> The horrible sections of blotchy red, raised and severely irritated skin over every single section that this product was supposedly protecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Summers in NJ get brutal, May had seen 75-90° days, and even overcast gets a High UV Index.</li>
            <li> Only thing I hate about it is it&#x27;s hard to spread across your face.</li>
            <li> Only used once, very thick, applied to the face, less than a day to start Changdou, very bad, no longer used.</li>
            <li> The company determined that a very small differences in the testing conditions can have a dramatic influence on the calculated SPF.</li>
            <li> but I found it very hard to rub in all the way.</li>
            <li> I am black so it leaves a terrible white mask over my face.</li>
            <li> Works well, but is very thick and gunky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For something for you face, it is very very thick</li>
            <li> This goes on very thick</li>
            <li> I wear it every day under my makeup and have not experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li> But with this sunscreen, my ears are behind an impenetrable sun shield.  </li>
            <li> and without fear that my sun spots will get worse.</li>
            <li> Cleaning my face made it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not reviewing it poorly because I know that it is the combination of my skin and this product that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how addicted I am to using this sunscreen as part of my routine every day.</li>
            <li> That being said, I always go for the highest anyway and false advertising aside, I do like the product.</li>
            <li> This product claims to be \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but it definitely has an unpleasant smell!  </li>
            <li> , I look pale as a ghost!!!</li>
            <li> I mean you will instead be inside searching for an eye wash station or bottle of rubbing alcohol to numb the burning sensation if this stuff gets into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> it is very thick and stings like hell if it gets into your eyes!</li>
            <li> Why is that SO difficult to understand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Sunscreen Leaves a TERRIBLE WHITE CAST on your FACE!</li>
            <li> I used really expensive sunscreens for years, always looking for 50+ SPF.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT ON your FACE or NECK unless you wanna look like a terrible ghost mess.</li>
            <li> It protects me from the sun and cold air.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Neutrogena!  </li>
            <li> Very faint scent</li>
            <li> I have excema really bad too</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t like my opinion -- TOO BAD,</li>
            <li> I burn badly.</li>
            <li> but i guess with the amount she had caused a bad reaction.she broke out in about 15 mins after it was put</li>
            <li> IT BROKE ME OUT SO BADLY</li>
            <li> This sunscreen always keeps my face from getting sunburnt and I do not have bad breakouts after.</li>
            <li> In any case, this is painful and,</li>
            <li> I had those brown ugly  looking Age spots on my face</li>
            <li> Nope - disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by a Neutragena product since being introduced to thier soap as a teenager over 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> disappointed in the product considering the PRICE $$$$$.</li>
            <li> if you have a darker skin tone, you may hate the way this makes your skin look.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product instead of the ones I have been using, because I really hate when my skin is oily because of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I hate sun screen.</li>
            <li> really bad!</li>
            <li> I passed a brutal summer sun without a tinge of sunburn.</li>
            <li> I HATE putting on sun screen; one of the worst, slimiest feelings in this world.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is categorically the worst sunblock that has ever attempted to protect my face.</li>
            <li> Hate the way sun screen smells!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still recovering from the aftermaths of the horrible break out.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible</li>
            <li> Terrible for your skin, see the EWG ratings:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t smell nasty like the spray can types.</li>
            <li> Aside from that this product is awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I work in the sun a lot, this protects my face and doesn&#x27;t stink</li>
            <li> proven product, works great</li>
            <li> Almost too heavy.  After I bought it, I was told by friends that anything over 50 is overkill.</li>
            <li> This rubs in very well given its strength. Even does pretty well over short facial hair.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything I&#x27;ve tried besides this, including neutrogena&#x27;s own Drytouch line. I was about to give up daily sunscreen use until I found this product. My only issue is it will bother your eyes unless you apply it around them with a 2cm or so margin. This is the case with everything I&#x27;ve tried though, and you become a pro at application pretty fast. Besides that, no complaints. No strong smell, not visible, not oily. Did not cause any acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, being a chemical sunscreen exclusively, is much better than zinc based formulations. I know a lot of people swear by zinc based sunscreens, but I have used MANY products over years of daily sunscreen use, and every zinc containing sunscreen I used broke down into a white milky liquid when I started to sweat. When I went for a run it looked like milk was running down my face. This seems to be much more water resistant. By far the best facial sunscreen I have used</li>
            <li> Not too oily. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen. It&#x27;s a very reliable product specially for skin cancer survivors like me.</li>
            <li> I used this product during a week long trip through the Grand Canyon. I have fair skin and kept sunburn free. No burning of eyes. Great protection.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does his job!&lt;br /&gt;Rapid absorption, excellent feeling and last all the day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Definily I recommend this cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Can give a touch of a white sheen to the skin. I usually use powder over it to help take care of the coloring issue as well as the oily-ish look that results from wearing it. However, it feels pretty light and does not seem to make my face overwarm which has been an issue for me in the past with some thicker sunscreens. There are better sunscreens out there (like Kiehl&#x27;s--now that&#x27;s good stuff) but not at this price.</li>
            <li> Cant live without this product. I have been using it regularly for 3 years ... sometimes when going out on evenings under makeup .. suits my skin and my routine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great sunblock and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good spf lotion..am a fair lady,I have been using for awhile now but only on my face where I really need it cos it&#x27;s the most exposed part of my body predisposed to hyperpigmentation caused by the sun. friends tell me my face looks different :))..secret ;)</li>
            <li> A great face cream for all day moisturizing and protection from the sun.  Oil free, great for sensitive skin and hypo-algergenic.</li>
            <li> Way, way too much perfume. One reviewer mentioned bringing tears to the eyes. I find the powerful scent very irritating to my nose. Why does a sunblock/sunscreen have perfume scents at all? And I would think Neutrogena ought to label their products and clearly state &#x27;highly scented&#x27; or &#x27;unscented&#x27; on their products.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and feels light on my skin, do not clog the pores and I do not have to be constantly re applying it. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than other versions of Neutrogena&#x27;s face sunblock. It still feels a little greasy and is irritating to the skin around my eyes. Otherwise it&#x27;s exactly as advertised. It provides great protection in the sun.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I try to use this spf as a daily base under makeup, etc. It&#x27;s very lightweight but provides maximum coverage...what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Great product, I wear it every day. It takes a minute to soak in, and I always wipe my eyebrows off with a towel, but once it is in it&#x27;s great. I wear it under powder or just alone and it is never greasy or heavy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and I never got burned when wearing it!</li>
            <li> It is really hot here in Afghanistan and this sun screen will come in just great and will provide me the protection from the sun.  I received this package in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! not shining, suitable for all skin types, even oily skin. Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended! easy to aborb to your skin.</li>
            <li> It has the same exact ingredients in the same exact amounts as their SPF 85 spray. I mean, I just don&#x27;t get where they&#x27;re getting this arbitrary number. The FDA should get around to limiting wild SPF claims like Europe and Australia have already done. That being said, I always go for the highest anyway and false advertising aside, I do like the product. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, smells inoffensive. I just deal with the shininess by buffing some mineral powder on top.  Looks really finished and at that point you&#x27;ve got some serious UVA protection.</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams, this barely leaves a white layer like look which is why i like it. although, unlike any other sunscreen lotion this tends to make my face look oily, so I use some powder based make up on my face after applying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several vacations at the beach this year.  All I have to say is I haven&#x27;t gotten burn at all.  Before I go to the beach I apply liberally all over my face, neck, and shoulders.  I used to have a lot of peeling on my shoulders, not any more.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this, she is of fair complexion and being sailors it got tested to the max and passed with flying colors</li>
            <li> This product burns your eyes even if you don&#x27;t sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard makes a much better product which gives MORE protection and does not burn your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon also sells the Blue Lizard sunscreen for a excellent price.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110, best there is and we live in the desert. Coats with a creamy film which disappears in minutes.  No greasy or oily film to discolor clothing and washes right out if any contact.  This lasts a whole day - Of course I also wear sun glasses and a big floppy hat to protect my face and eyes.Have used this for quite a while,;tried copies, forget it.  This is reasonable and it does the job! I have it on auto delivery so it&#x27;s always on hand.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> happy with the product, feels a little thick but does blend into your skin well after a little massage… no smell fragrant free!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave the house without it</li>
            <li> NOTHING is worth the price of eye irritation so severe your eyes tear and swell shut.  I didn&#x27;t apply it anywhere near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;How can it keep you younger looking if your eyes are swollen and irritated?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because you are blinded you IMAGINE you look younger?&lt;br /&gt;Who knows?  In any case, this is painful and, well...painful.</li>
            <li> I love to go to the beach with my dog and with this sunscreen I can go for several hours without ending up burnt to a crisp. Even better, the cream doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy like a lot of sunscreens, so I find I&#x27;m much less hesitant to put in on. Their SPF 70 and 85 are also great for the body. I like the dry touch product line.</li>
            <li> Great Shipping and good products !!</li>
            <li> Non greasy , does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> After years of use, suddenly each time I use this product I get a rash with itch. Until now I have adored the product using it faithfully in my many hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the formula has changed or I am being sold a counterfeit product. I give this a one-star rating to warn folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this sunscreen now twice, using other products for at least a month. Twice I have returned to Neutrogena&#x27;s 110 SPF, both times with a rash occurring within a few hours&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> Good product fast delivery and good prices</li>
            <li> I always use this product, because it has a SPF 110. It is kind of thick, but I like it. It does not distort my makeup.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s a complete part of my morning routine. I don&#x27;t go out without my sunscreen and this one is perfect, no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> this product worked great for me no sun burns this time thanks. this product was priced well i would pay more for the protection this product gave me.</li>
            <li> it is good for my skin that I like it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells nice and the white residue is not too bad.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for sun block. I sat all day in full sun watching a rodeo and any usual sunblock would have left me like a lobster. I had no sunburn at all. I will continue using this product..</li>
            <li> I used to play golf twice on a week, it protect me very well against the skin damage for too much sun</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Wear this everyday! Its great!</li>
            <li> I bought this neutrogena sunscreen for my wife, even she having a burn accident 2nd grade , she feels that sunlight does not bother the skin</li>
            <li> i really like this product. it really works for me. it keeps me protected from the sun and at the same time, it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves white residue that are very noticeable on my dark skin</li>
            <li> Very good at blocking high UV rays.  I have fair skin and sunburn easily.  Works well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great product I bought it for me and my mom&lt;br /&gt;But I am not gonna buy it again because I stopped using product that are not cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> Great Item, 12 Hours on a boat and just got tanned.... Recommended for sports or just sun protection. Must buy</li>
            <li> Some Neutrogena products work for me and some don&#x27;t-this is one that exceeds all other Neutrogena products! I have oily acne prone skin that is very pale. Over the years I have built up less sun tolerance, and a need for sunscreen daily because of the use of other products that my skin very sensitive to sunlight. It does leave a slight white sheen on the face-but because of this I only need a powder and not a liquid foundation as well. I have never burned when using this sunblock and my skin does not breakout because of it. Some sunblocks make my skin turn red and get a burning sensation around this eyes-this does neither and my eyes never water after application.   This is both a chemical and physical sunscreen. It does have the spf smell even though it says it is fragrance free (depending on the tube/box you get) but it is nowhere near as bad as other sunscreens. Although it is suppose to be reapplied frequently-I apply it twice a day and most and do not have trouble with burning.   A note to Neutrogena-please start distributing in Australia/Asia! Outstanding sun protection is needed there more than anywhere else!  Active Ingredients I got off the tube: avobenzone 3%, homosalate 15%, octisalate 5%, octocrylene 10%, oxybenzone 6%  Skin type: somewhat pigmented, acne prone, oily, 20-something, few lines, semi-sensitive</li>
            <li> I have tried other Neutrogena Sunblocks ( Dry touch and Sensitive Skin) they both left my face either white or greasy. This was in my mom&#x27;s bedroom so I decided to try it, I was amazed, it felt like I was wearing nothing. No white cast, no oily face. I&#x27;m prone to acne so I don&#x27;t enjoy sunblocks but I have pale skin with freckles so I need sunblock. With my previous sunblock (cetaphil spf 50) I had to wear powder on top of it to get rid of the shine but with Neutrogena Spf 110 there is no need. The price is a little high but I loved it so much that I bought it the same day after trying it.</li>
            <li> Love this non-greasy sunscreen.  It&#x27;s sheer, not thick on the skin like some others.  I bought a second one for the car in case I forget to apply it before I leave the house.  Neutrogena always comes through for me in its skin products.</li>
            <li> high quality sunscreen</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping. Very satisfied. Good price</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Goes on like any other sun block, but like that it offers a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> A very good sunscreen...however if you perspire the cream can get in your eyes and really stings, so I have stopped using</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few years now and I am very pleased. Since it&#x27;s not oily and can be reapplied a few times daily especially when out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Excellent for daily use</li>
            <li> This is categorically the worst sunblock that has ever attempted to protect my face. It goes on smooth and clear - no hazy white residue so you think everything is going just swimmingly. Then reality sets in. Within 12 hours of some sun exposure and extensive application of this sunscreen my entire face was lit up. The horrible sections of blotchy red, raised and severely irritated skin over every single section that this product was supposedly protecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I purchased this on Amazon and Neutrogena is refunding me the $ I spent. However, I&#x27;m quite surprised given their highly regarded brand that they would a. Sell this product at all and B. not place MUCH stronger language cautioning users with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I strongly suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> People with hyperpigmentation this is your go to. A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t make your skin white(I&#x27;m dark skin) I have excema really bad too and it doesnt dry out the skin when applied. Summer here I come!</li>
            <li> My wife is a Nurse Practicioner, and professor of nursing, so she is very big on protecting your skin, (she&#x27;s beautiful.)  I&#x27;m a slow adopter but knew I&#x27;d  better bring something good to the Galapagos (at the equator.)  This was far stronger than anything else I saw on the market, and I felt pretty confident using it.  I did dress covering myself just like the Galapagos guides, covered in khaki and wide brimmed hats,  but occasionally this obviously worked, like when snorkeling.  My wife started using mine rather than her own, which she had brought for the purpose.  That&#x27;s the best recommendation I can give it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a good value for the money. I wear it under my makeup and while it&#x27;s not my absolute favorite (that would be Dr. Peter Thomas Roth Uber Dry Sunscreen) it&#x27;s a more cost effective solution for daily wear.</li>
            <li> A wee bit greasy for me. Works well as a sunscreen. Will probably try other products for use under make-up.</li>
            <li> I can not tell much about it yet since I have not used it yet. I will be in Mexico for 10 days and I will test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am simply impressed about the SPF 110.</li>
            <li> A little greasy but otherwise very good coverage! Plus it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; so gotta love it.</li>
            <li> This product claims to be \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but it definitely has an unpleasant smell!  Yuk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this sunscreen didn&#x27;t absorb well but instead sat on top of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;And, it looks oily on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand the smell or the feel of this sunscreen, and won&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED COMMENT --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES the product does say UNSCENTED !  See the comments from \\&quot;Sweetdream\\&quot; who also read the product info which says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Important Information&lt;br /&gt;Indications. It protects and cares for your skin to help maintain skins youthful appearance every time you wear it. It is used for sun protection. It is UNSCENTED. Health Facts: Oil Free.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, unscented -- in MY OPINION -- is the same as &#x27;Fragrance Free&#x27;.  Although someone says that the &#x27;industry&#x27; standard distinguishes between the two terms -- most consumers do not.  I am not in the &#x27;industry&#x27; -- I am a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;And to \\&quot;BELLA TRAINER\\&quot;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAVE YOU EVEN TRIED THE PRODUCT???  Your comment says you researched it, but does NOT say you used it for yourself !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t give a hoot if the product has a 4.5 star rating on every web site in the universe.  I STILL DON&#x27;T LIKE THE PRODUCT and if you don&#x27;t like my opinion -- TOO BAD, SO SAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OPINION and I am not prohibiting you from forming your opinion.  Why is that SO difficult to understand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have good things to say about the product - great! However, it might be a good idea to try the product so you have some credibility.</li>
            <li> Seems like this Neutrogena age shield face sunscreen does the opposite; at least for young people with almost no wrinkle pre-lines. I would advise everyone to not buy sunscreens that do not have : zinc and titanium dioxide or w/e (google it) those protect you from all wavelengths or uv rays both UVA AND UVB. And remember these rays are still present even at night when the sun is down so always apply quality sunscreen before you head out to keep your skin looking young and reduce aging/damage caused by the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, spfs are just relative to how long you can have that sunscreen on in the sun or outside before the need of reapplication. 50spf and up is decent in terms of practical durations of time spent out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your summer; I&#x27;ll enjoy this and many more to come while keeping my youth and looking fresh 😄💯</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside in the Florida sun and I am completely Irish. Neutrogena better not fail me or I&#x27;ll be posting my medical bills. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Ordered 5, one for each member of the family.  That&#x27;s how much we like it</li>
            <li> You will be crying for a couple of hours if you get even the smallest amount of this product in your eyes. There are using some type of oil in this product that I think is responsible for this issue.  I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t know if this product is good on other levels.  I personally will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> it is really very good, Thank you</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well, but it stings like crazy if I get it anywhere near my eyes. Also, even though it&#x27;s oil free, it&#x27;s pretty heavy and greasy, so I need to wait after applying it to put on my makeup, which is kind of a hassle. I think I&#x27;ll be looking for another option when I finish this one.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face sunscreens I&#x27;ve found.  It dries and doesn&#x27;t feel oily a few minutes after putting it on, and can be washed off easily with face soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day.  I am prone to breakouts but haven&#x27;t had any breakouts because of this product.</li>
            <li> light and not too greasy feeling</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen when you want uv protection.</li>
            <li> I like it. My skin is dry and I feel comfortable with that lotion. It very good protection from sun.</li>
            <li> Protection good, but not very enjoyable if it got in your eyes.  Also smell not agreeable</li>
            <li> have not use it yet and love this brand.</li>
            <li> it works not just as a face but as a great all body sunscreen for those with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product without looking up the ingredients and i regret my purchase. It contains avobenzone and oxybenzone, chemicals that build up in your body and can cause SKIN CANCER. When buying sunscreen look for zinc oxyde as a main ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t penetrate your skin and stays on the surface protecting your skin.</li>
            <li> Non greasy.  Goes on smoothly.  Absorbs quickly.  works well under makeup.  However, only good for 80 minutes if using by the pool or at the beach.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist from Denver following basal cell carcinoma skin cancer.  I wear it faithfully (well, 95% of the time!).  I apply it prior to moisturizer &amp; foundation.  Absorbs quickly, usually no waiting time to dry prior to moisturizer application.  Wouldn&#x27;t be w/out it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Singapore no longer carries this version. I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it through Amazon. Please do not discontinue it, ever!</li>
            <li> I am in Africa, 10 1/2 degrees above the equator, and this stuff is the only sunblock that actually works. Well done!</li>
            <li> This migrates, into the mouth (and tastes horrid) from the cheeks. Not super great protection as I put on two layers and still have sun exposure from a two hour outing.</li>
            <li> I apply this product to areas with dark spots on my face that are a result of working in the sun for years, using it in combination with  Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 70 for overall protection. With broad Spectrum SPF 110, it seems to slow the further darkening of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product over 100 times! Is theeee best... Love it!</li>
            <li> Applies nicely to skin and absorbs well. Non greasy which is great and as promised delivery time.</li>
            <li> Some Neutrogena products work for me and some don&#x27;t-this is one that exceeds all other Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> So Amazon always has what I need. I use this product daily. I am 41 and look 25 because I take immaculate care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Although I am sure this product does its job of protecting your skin, it has a thick consistency.  I was hoping it would be a lighter formula for the face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I get dark spots from the sun a lot, but I still love going out to the beach. My doctor recommended this to me, and it&#x27;s been very effective thus far. It goes on smooth without the grease, leaves no terrible residue and lasts for an extremely long time. Definitely recommended for those who love spending time out under the sun.</li>
            <li> It seems to have diaper rash ointment in it.  This product leaves the face with a whitish hue.  Plus the main drag, is that it does not have a high viscosity.  So you must gently pat it into the face.  I guess you should do that with most things, but I am wrong.</li>
            <li> My skin is light African American..doesn&#x27;t matter this is necessary for ALL complexions with or without makeup.. doesn&#x27;t leave a film so makeup application is fine even with a moisturizer added like I do..Great Protection!!!</li>
            <li> This product contains just the ingredients I&#x27;ve been looking for to protect me from the sun. Goes on well. I used during workouts but I sweat so much that this product doesn&#x27;t stand a chance on the waterproof part. Drips off</li>
            <li> I have been using NightSkin for 3 months which bleached my skin and I need to protect my skin. It was such a dissapointing to find brown spots!  Matter of fact, I will be demanding the refund. The product is very oily and leaves my skin so shinny - no way I can able to walk out of my house with it. I sat for 10 min. tryihng to rub it in. It protect from Burning ray of UVB but if this can&#x27;t protect me from having brown spots, why spend money?</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Excellent protection.</li>
            <li> I only purchase Neutrogena sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or break my skin out.  lt&#x27;s also a great price.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-50s and have to be very careful in the sun.  I was happy to try a sun block that was specific to aging and for the face.  Within three days of using it I had zits on my forehead.  Since I haven&#x27;t had pimples of ANY kind in decades, it was pretty upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using it except on other body parts.  Since it is labeled as a face lotion, loses a lot of stars.</li>
            <li> A little too shiny for my face, but does it&#x27;s job wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I love love love this! I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> I burn badly. If I slather on an spf 50 and I&#x27;m outside for more than half an hour I get a decent burn or end up with color by summer&#x27;s end.  The other side of the coin is zits.  I have to choose which I prefer, looking like I&#x27;m 32 going on 50 or 32 going on 15.  This stuff is amazing.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any burns or a tan and have been walking over an hour a day at high noon and take my son to the park with my husband for about an hour and a half, so that is 2.5 hours of direct sun on Very High UV days.  This doesn&#x27;t run in my eyes and burn while sweating, it doesn&#x27;t gather and look chalky, and I&#x27;m not burning or breaking out!  Summers in NJ get brutal, May had seen 75-90° days, and even overcast gets a High UV Index. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m never going back to my old stuff.  I get this stuff close to my eyes (eye lids after I got a burn from high noon exposure despite chunky sunglasses) and don&#x27;t get it in my eyes.  Goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> Do not wear white clothing should you choose to use this stuff.  I still cannot figure out how to get the orange shade out of my t-shirts.  What a mistake it was to try this.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble finding a product that doesn&#x27;t feel so heavy and oily.  This one is moderately oily feeling so I don&#x27;t like to wear it everyday.  Just for going to the pool or beach it works fine.</li>
            <li> strongly protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Works great buy sweat drips this into your eyes you are crying for at least 30 min.</li>
            <li> My dad works outdoors for 12 hours on hot summer days and this stuff has worked great for him as far as wrinkles and aging go. He&#x27;s been using it for years and I recently started using it everyday to protect my self from getting wrinkles. Can&#x27;t say if that part has worked yet lol but it works for my dad and I love it because it&#x27;s not greasy! Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn since using this sunscreen but it caused my sensitive, acne-prone skin to break out.</li>
            <li> As a landscaper of 40yrs in SoCal I wish I&#x27;d had found this product earlier...It&#x27;s ease of application in the morning...and complete daytime protection (including the sweat test) without re-application is great...With my last sunscreen (BananaBoat Sport 50) I had a few \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; it couldn&#x27;t contain...and they&#x27;d turn \\&quot;angry red\\&quot; during long sun exposures...Neutrogena Age Shield has contained the \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;...softened and evened-out my skin tone...and eliminated the crust on my nose...I appreciate the \\&quot;age shield\\&quot; component of this product as well as it&#x27;s excellent sunscreen.</li>
            <li> this is a sunscreen cream like all other creams. Don&#x27;t get fooled by the word lotion as it is not a fluidy liquidy clear lotion kind of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I have SLE, and sunscreen is a must. I&#x27;ve been using this one since I was diagnosed (December 2014) and worked perfectly for me. I would recommend this to anyone who ask me :-)</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and really works. So happy I found this</li>
            <li> My new dermatologist nearly fainted when I told her I&#x27;d never EVER used facial sunscreen lotion on a daily basis--only when at the beach. After appt., I RAN to the nearest pharmacy and got the highest SPF: 110. 1 month later, I&#x27;m elated with the results and keep spreading \\&quot;the Gospel of Neutrogena\\&quot;. Light, non-greasy, spreads evenly and goes a long way. A pea-sized drop is usually enough for my forehead and cheeks. Use a mirror for even, precise application, lest you wanna look like a clown; yes, it&#x27;s a bit chalky white, but can be blended in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact 3oz. size is great for purse and air travel. I usually apply in the a.m., refresh midday with Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit cleansing wipes and re-apply for [sunny] walk home. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this product sooner. Save your $ and avoid &amp;uuml;ber-expensive sunscreens--at avg. $11 - $15 a pop, it&#x27;s a fantastic investment for your skin. Oh, and the light, almost imperceptible scent makes it guy-friendly too!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I still like the quality of some other products, like Blue Lizard; but this absorbs better, is less greasy and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent protection for face and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works well, sunscreen odor is not too strong.  Only downside is that it is a standalone sunscreen, and not a moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> I live abroad and asked a friend to bring a few things back from the states for me. I ordered this thinking it would take a few days to ship. Look out, it took over a week. My friend is returning and this item will not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something so small and within the states, why would it take so long to ship this in a day and age where two-day shipping is usually guaranteed?!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the one thing about it that bugs me is the whiteness of it. You have to keep rubbing it in to get rid of the white residue.</li>
            <li> Very effective at blocking sun, as long as you don&#x27;t perspire too much.  Not recommended for oily skin, as it covers very well.  I have dry skin so it works quite well.</li>
            <li> I bought for my son and daughter, to protect their light skin from skin cancers.  It goes on smoothly and has the protection their faces need every day.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to completely block all sun without clogging my pours. If you use Retin-A  this product is a must.</li>
            <li> Added this to my foundation bottle and it made the bottle a shade lighter because the sunscreen was white. Note to self, buy a shade darker of your foundation if you plan to add sunscreen. Overall though this was a great product. Never got burned the whole summer, was great on my face, not oily at all and mixed excellent with my foundation to provide the best makeup coverage with the sunscreen of my choice.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. First and foremost, my concern is avoiding skin cancer! Melanoma runs in my family and after watching loved ones go through chemo I needed to wake up about my sun protection (or lack there of).This seems to be the highest SPF available on the market. And yea, yea, yea I don&#x27;t live under a rock, I&#x27;ve heard that once you get to 30+ SPF they&#x27;re all the same, BUT I&#x27;m telling you, they&#x27;re not! I&#x27;ve used lots of different sunscreens this is by far the best protection, the best scent, the least irritating, and no burns! No freckles! No wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the neutrogena age repair facial moisturizer with SPF 30, (along with smashbox BB cream) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the three, in conjunction with eachother have TRANSFORMED my skin. Better than any clarins, dior, philosophy, etc. My fine lines, age spots, freckles, they&#x27;ve disappeared. I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with, but the what I did have is now gone. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love recommending this product!</li>
            <li> The sun screen was very good. It is easy to put under makeup.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on really pastey. On top of the strong chemical smell, it also feels heavy on my skin. ( Asian, female, 42 ) I need to check the mirror carefully to make sure no white residue on my face.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen out there. I am only confident to go out during a hot day when I put this on my face. It offers the best protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 yr-old fair blonde.  Made my face itch and break out.  I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, I stock up on these for the entire summer. It&#x27;s just a little tiny bit greasy (as expected from any sunscreen) and it does the trick without complications. I regularly recommend these to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and so far so good. It&#x27;s oil free so it doesn&#x27;t make your face oily &amp; gross. In a couple of weeks I&#x27;ll be able to tell what my skin thinks of it :)</li>
            <li> This is the best armour against premature aging. Also  a great sunblock. I used to get tags and freckles and now hardly any. I use every day.  Not to heavy and even blends well with my brown skin</li>
            <li> I am using it but not daily. I don&#x27;t not like its smell on my face; however; it give me a good feeling that my skin is smooth and protected.</li>
            <li> i did not buy this but i did use it for my 17 month old,my husband and I. it worked fine for my husband and I but my 17 month old broke out into hives and rashes everywhere! Her face swelled up and turned red,her eyes were very puffy.her whole body was covered in hives.i did test a small spot first and i didn&#x27;t not see any reaction but i guess with the amount she had caused a bad reaction.she broke out in about 15 mins after it was put on.we had to give her benedryl and scrub it off and she continued to have hives for about 24 hrs.so we had to give her benedryl every 4 hours. we went back to our organic sunblock of SPF 30 which work much better for all of us.</li>
            <li> Love it! I wear it every day under my makeup and have not experienced any breakouts. I feel protected in the Flarida sun.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is not suitable for using under makeup unless your skin is dry, which mine is not.  I&#x27;m normal to oily and this leaves a dewy finish that interferes with the application of my foundation.  I do wear it alone, on beach days, and it protects really well.  But I bought it to wear daily under makeup and it doesn&#x27;t work well for that purpose.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t make me break out though and it disappears in a few minutes (although it&#x27;s white when first applied).  My plan was to mix this with my moisturizer, which has no SPF, albeit diluting the sun protection somewhat.  I&#x27;ve been using Obagi Matt Sunscreen SPF 50 for this purpose and thought I would save myself some money by using this Neutrogena product.  However, the Obagi sunscreen doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny film on my skin and when mixed with my moisturizer (Embryolisse) gives me a satin, rather than a dewy finish (the moisturizer is quite hydrating so it leaves a somewhat dewy look but when combined with the sunscreen, has more of a satin finish).  This is a perfect base for makeup primer and foundation.  And the Neutrogena sunscreen makes my makeup slide down my face in a couple of hours, not a good look I assure you.  Still, I&#x27;ll use this tube up on days when I wear no makeup and am outside in the intense Florida sunshine.  I found it at Walgreens for $3 so no big loss.  And the liquid Neutrogena,which is $10 for 1.7 ounces, is half the size of the Obagi, which is $25 with Amazon Prime.  So in the long run, I&#x27;m not really saving a huge amount by switching brands.  I will stick with the Obagi, whose matte finish works perfectly as a makeup base alone in the summer when I don&#x27;t need additional moisturizer on my T zone.  It keeps my makeup fresh and protects against the sun, making it the perfect sunscreen product for me.  Even those with really oily skin will love it.  This Neutrogena sunscreen was a FAIL for me but it will be suitable for the beach and when I&#x27;m gardening.  Sorry Neutrogena!  You&#x27;ve sold me on my old standby, Obagi.d me on my old standby, Obagi.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. The consistency is nice and does not clog my pores like other sunscreens have in the past. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product was too thick for my face but...it works. I love neutrogena products for my sensitive skin so I will continue to use it. I just will not be completely satisfied until they make it thinner and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face oily, but I still had a few blemishes after using this every day for two weeks. It&#x27;s pretty thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. When I put this cream on my face it goes smoothly and even, no white residues, non greasy, and the best of all it did not make flakes when  put my makeup over it. I would buy  it again and again.</li>
            <li> a little oily at the begin but a few minuts is absorbed by the skin. I like it. AND IT IS CHEAP</li>
            <li> Been using this product within three years nd it helps protecting  my face a lot from the heat esp living in Vegas where there&#x27;s always dry heat in summertime...highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and usually use the spray Neutrogena SPF 70, but needed some extra protection for my face after reading some concerning articles on what any kind of tan from the sun REALLY means for your skin.  Bottom line is it means DAMAGE, no matter how you look at it!  So i use the spray and also add this just to my face. It is heavier of course, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all because it isn&#x27;t greasy.  Put it on when you aren&#x27;t sweating, I don&#x27;t have AC and have to put it on in front of a fan or else it will run and it will run a little white, but for me its worth the extra protection!  I like it and usually only use it when I know my face will be exposed to the sun for a prolonged amount of time like at the beach or a BBQ.  Great to keep on hand, its great protection!</li>
            <li> love this very good spf 110 and really !!! does not feel greasy or leave your face shiney</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion SPF 110 for a couple of years now and am quite pleased with it. I ski, cycle, hike, golf and fly fish - I&#x27;m outdoors all the time so a good sunscreen is important to me. I must admit though I also use a zinc sunscreen. Layering the two works well for me.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband who has to wear sunscreen daily.  It&#x27;s light and greaseless so it&#x27;s a winner for us.  Convenience of online ordering is so nice.  We will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this to combine it with my BB cream, but it&#x27;s too thick, white, and pasty. And it smells like sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t like it too much. But, I guess that&#x27;s what you get for SPF 110.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is an amazing product for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for the majority of the summer. I am multiracial and have an almond skin tone so it does leave some of a white cast at first but it fades within ten minutes.  I am on medications that make my skin burn within 20 mins of sun exposure and I apply this usually once in the morning and on a normal day (that I&#x27;m in and out, not outside all day) usually don&#x27;t burn.  What I love about it the most though is it&#x27;s side properties--it&#x27;s really softened my skin and evened it out--I used to have some blotchy spots from scars/freckles/sun and now I have a lot less after using it for a few months.  Also it&#x27;s a lot more even as far as some oily spots and some dry spots--now it&#x27;s pretty much all even. Also I&#x27;m only in my very early 30&#x27;s but I&#x27;ve noticed that what fine lines I did have seem to be fading.  The only problem I have with this sunscreen is that I live in a hot humid place and on a hot humid day it doesn&#x27;t protect as well as on a dry day. IOW on one of those FL days when just stepping out the car is enough to make you break a sweat the sunscreen is almost useless, as soon as you start sweating you start burning, or at least I do--same thing at beach.  So I end up keeping a couple different types of sunscreens--cheaper greasy sunscreen I put on just for the beach or those horrible 100 degree 100% humidty days and this one whom I love!  Can&#x27;t wait for the weather to cool off more so I can stop wearing the greasy one all together!</li>
            <li> Just started using it. So far, its going great. Its not as oily as other skin beauty products I&#x27;ve purchased. Loving it</li>
            <li> I bike a lot so I really have to use sunscreen every time to protect my skin from sun damage. This is the brand I trust and I like it because it very light, it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I thought it was fragrance free but it isn&#x27;t. The smell is pleasant though, reminds me of Este Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures, and it isn&#x27;t too strong smelling. The lotion is typically oily feeling as most all sunscreens are, even cetaphil&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; face lotion is. But it is good, it works wonders, very strong SPF and it doesn&#x27;t irritate skin or clog pores. Still relieving to wash it off at night though. I say it is very good overall. It would perfect if it could feel a bit lighter on the skin and not smell at all but I am not sure that is possible with a sunscreen at all, especially one that works. Compared to others, this is inexpensive and highly protective, definitely worth it. I would suggest just putting a bit of face powder on over it even before and after applying concealer, if you do wear makeup. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> i assume its delivering the spf 110 protection but it leaves your face white. i&#x27;ve tried using less of the product and spreading it more vigorously doesn&#x27;t seem to help. its a shame because i&#x27;d would use this everyday if it wouldn&#x27;t leave my face white. i bought hawaiian tropic spf30 hydration to use instead i assume its working but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face white.</li>
            <li> I had skin cancer last year on the tip of my nose. I had to have two surgeries. I still wear a hat, but with this  product I feel secure that my skin is fully protected.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome. Only thing I hate about it is it&#x27;s hard to spread across your face. So to fix this issue I use Avene face spray and apply the lotion after. Spreads well and very moist. My makeup looks awesome. Light and not oily like some other sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Non greasy and goes on light!</li>
            <li> I thought 110 SPF would be good. No way. I never ever get my face sunburned because I have always used products 50 or 70 or both. I put two applications of this on and my face is sunburned.</li>
            <li> I mix it with lotion or makeup and it mixes well.  I purchased this for a person who had had spots on their face&lt;br /&gt;the doctor said they needed to watch and it really helps them avoid exposure.  It&#x27;s a very strong product since it goes several layers deep but it&#x27;s an awesome product.  Also, the tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and seems to work great.  spent hours in the sun and barely red.  Next to try it in Baja while spending a lot of time in and on the water.</li>
            <li> No breakouts or excess oil with this stuff! Love it because I have sensitive skin and breakout really easy with normal sunscreen! Not with this! and its pretty much smell free which is another plus. Hate the way sun screen smells! LOVE and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This product works great just as long as you don&#x27;t do anything active or move around much. This product begins to show white blotches before I even start sweating!</li>
            <li> Excellent products - pricy but good. Would recommend them to anyone. i don;t have anything else to say about these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sunblock fiend. Does the job. Blends well</li>
            <li> And, I am so glad he did. I use it every day of the year as my moisturizer under my makeup. I have T Zone skin and it does not cause oiliness and keeps the rest of my skin moisturized. My dark spots have minimized drastically. My skin is soft supple. I would not use anything but Neutrogena products on my skin.</li>
            <li> excellent protection, non greasy</li>
            <li> I love how strong the SPF is. I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible until I saw this!</li>
            <li> Love all of the Nutrogena Sunscreen products.  I use this daily and I am in a very harsh environment and it does a excellent job of protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> I sampled several sunscreen lotions before deciding on the purchase. This one had the highest SPF value but feels a bit greasy/heavy on the face. Feels like most other for-the-face sunscreen. Not a daily wear cream BUT definitely something to put on when planning to be in direct/heavy sun for a while because feels much better than actual sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores as much. I ended up NOT getting the Age Shield because 1) Because you get much more for your money using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer and 2) According to other sources, anything above SPF 50 is kind of pointless.</li>
            <li> leaves streaks on your face. You really have to rub it in. It also stung my eyes. I only put it on my forehead, cheeks, nose and chin. Somehow, every time I apply it, It makes my eyes water.</li>
            <li> Neutrogen is awesome, very light and fell like im using the organic product,,</li>
            <li> Made my face break out in hives...never had this happen with ANY products in my life....ever. Except...when I thought about it, Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free face wash back in high school did something very similar...then I Googled &amp;#34;Allergic to Neutrogena products&amp;#34; and a whole slough of reviews/complaints/reports came up on countless websites about issues with all of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin by any means, so if you do, be cautious!</li>
            <li> Just check the ewg&#x27;s skin deep cosmetics database online to find out how hazardous this product can be to us, human.    it is rated 7/10, high hazard. 10 is the highest. So, even it has real good reviews, i&#x27;d not recommend it.    See url here, [...]</li>
            <li> This soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you all shiny.  You are able to put your make up on within a couple minutes without all the caking and grossness.  Neutrogena is a good product most times.</li>
            <li> Only used once, very thick, applied to the face, less than a day to start Changdou, very bad, no longer used.</li>
            <li> Product blends in well. And does not leave a white overcast. It is light weight and not greasy like some sunscreens!</li>
            <li> First time I use this product (Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110) and I bought it based on the reviews I read.  I can say that it is a good product for the price.  I can wear it under my make up without a grease appearance or feel.  It&#x27;s not thick feel on the skin (face).  The only flaw, as in other reviews, is the uncomfortable feeling if it gets in the eyes or if applied too close.  But the again this will be an issue with most creams.</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I was in a cruise for 8 days and protect me from the head to my feets.</li>
            <li> Facial sunscreen that burns your eyes. Does this make sense? My eyes burned for 2 1/2 hours and that was after I washed them twice to get it out. Can&#x27;t be very effective if you have to wash it off before you ever make it outside.</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars because it does what it says it supposed to do, which is provide excellent sun protection, however it didn’t meet my expectation for what I specifically needed it for. I currently and have had a history of acne prone skin that has left unfortunate marks of hyperpigmentation on my skin from bad flare ups in response hormonal acne. I was looking for a daily sunscreen with a very high SPF, to help fade the hyperpigmentation, and further protect my skin on a daily basis to prevent aging. I also was interested in having  high SPF because I live in a beach town and therefore go to the beach frequently in the summer time. While this product did amply protect my skin from the sun, it appeared to make my skin congested, and did cause breakouts. I know that the product protected my skin very well because when I would go to the beach I would apply this product to my face and like Coppertone SPF 70 to the rest of my body to protect my skin and pace the progression of my tan through out the summer. While I would get a nice tan on my body my face was indeed notably lighter (like 2 shades lighter) than my body, after a day at the beach. This was refreshing because it kind of saves us ladies from the whole runaround of chasing darker foundations through out the summer that are no longer usable during the winter because it leaves that unsightly distinction between your face and your neck that eventually goes back to its normal color. I appreciated this aspect of the product because typically women who have acne prone skin have to purchase quality foundations/products that are high end and expensive to avoid breakouts. I’m a mixed race black whose skin tone falls anywhere between 3-4 maybe half way into 5 according to theFitzpatrick Skin Tone chart depending on how much I beach it up in the summer time on the . I do have brown eyes and hair. Which also brings me to mention that if you are of color or have olive or darker skin(3 skin tone or higher) ifyou wear the lotion with out makeup it will  be apparent on your skin, and give of an ashy like, or what people describe a purplish look on your skin when, and especially if you are perspire on the beach.  So with all that said I reserve this product for when I’m out in the sun for extended periods of time like 4-6 hours or more, and or when I go travel on vacation to warmer climates (southern U.S./tropics). It’s not a daily SPF for those with acne prone skin. Again I would like to share that the product did not wreak havoc on my skin. Using it on occasion did not cause like damaging self-esteem acne, I could just tell the product congested my skin (a pimple or two here and there after application). This didn’t worry me too much. For instances as I described above such as vacations etc., I will keep this product and just make sure that I certainly use the deep cleansing brush in conjunction with my Clarisonic to ensure that I get as much product out of my pores after use.  In conclusion, this product will remain in my cosmetic skin care arsenal, but I will continue to use Clinique’s City sunblock SPF 40 for my daily sunscreen until I find a higher SPF that wont break me out.</li>
            <li> I have light tan skin, anyway I put this on and everything seemed normal, then I turned off the bathroom lights and looked at the mirror, I look pale as a ghost!!! It freaked me out for a bit then I started laughing. It went away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So much for &amp;#34;won&#x27;t clog your pores&amp;#34;! I&#x27;m not acne prone, but I do have sensitive skin. It used to be pretty much a given that you could trust Neutrogena to be good for people with allergies or sensitive skin, but these days it&#x27;s just the same old crap everyone else sells, in a more expensive bottle.&lt;br /&gt;No, I didn&#x27;t get burned, but every time I have used it I end up breaking out the next day. Boo. It also smells a little weird</li>
            <li> This product is oil free but when I used my face become very oily. I doesn&#x27;t like!! I want my money back!</li>
            <li> goes on fairly &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; but will blend into your skin after a few rubs.  Someone informed me (after i bought this) that any SPF over 35 is ineffective...thus the four stars.</li>
            <li> Really high is spf and does a good job but it still leaves an oily sheen on my skin after application, hence docking one star</li>
            <li> I like this face lotion.  While Vitamin D is very important, I can&#x27;t handle too much sun on my face because of melasma (sp?).  I am now getting into the habit of spritzing on some vitamin C and then putting this on every morning.</li>
            <li> After seeing friends and family deal with the results of accumulated sun exposure I asked my dermatologist what to use to avoid this for both now and long term.  This was the product of choice.  It works well.  So I may not have a healthy looking tan and I may remain pasty white but hopefully I will not have to suffer any pain for going out in the sun in the near and long term.  I guess I can live without a &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34;.  This is nice and not greasy (or at least in my experience).  It is not perfumy either.</li>
            <li> works well on face, light sweating no problem with eyes, last a long time, will buy this again next time</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking amazing. I&#x27;ve read that 110SPF isn&#x27;t really &#x27;necessary&#x27;, but this stuff it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face, it isn&#x27;t overly oily, or overly drying, and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had any kind of allergic reaction to it. Will purchase again, absolutely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I ever used. I tried many luxury brands including Lancôme, Clarins, Dior and Shiseido. This Neutrogena beats all the others. It is not oily at all (great for my combination skin), and it really works (my skin tune doesnot turn darker after using it). Some one would say it is no necessary to use high SPF as 110. But for me, it&#x27;s just better than SPF 70.</li>
            <li> This sun block is the only one that keeps myself and my son relatively free from sunburn despite being out in the middle of the day for soccer practice and tournaments.  I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone who has tried several options which do not work.</li>
            <li> got what i ordered and it was mailed to me quick.i have no complaints.im totally satisfied.i will continue to practice ordering</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn anywhere except my ears, and boy do they burn.  But with this sunscreen, my ears are behind an impenetrable sun shield.  Now I can enjoy all day in the pool.  Also great for noses, under the eyes, and anywhere else on your face that burns you.  Not sure about the SPF 110, but they could call it SPF 1 million for all I care...it works, and that&#x27;s all that matters, right?</li>
            <li> The SPF is what I love because I don&#x27;t want my face to get all wrinkly when i&#x27;m old. Not too oily.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my face lotion every morning. Not sure how to rate if its doing its job or not - but it&#x27;s fairly lightweight and blends well. Works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and smooth of this product and feel that at its high number will be protective of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> excellent, maybe the best there is, thick put it doesnt feel heavy and greasy on skin, it does the work very neat.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it can use some vitamins, minerals to nourish and pamper skin</li>
            <li> very nice because is high in SPF</li>
            <li> How did I not know about this before?? I&#x27;m totally in love with this sunscreen. Here is what I do. When I wake up in the morning I wash my face with a gentle cleanser to remove any oils from the night before as well as any bacteria or germs from the sheets (they&#x27;re clean) but just in case. Then I apply this sunscreen all the way down to my neck. My skin feels so smooth and has a glow to it. The best part is that I know I will be protected from the sun on my way to work! :) Then I just apply concealer, mascara, and lipstick and that is it; I look fresh and put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and do not want sun spots or premature aging ( I live in Florida, sunny all year round). People always compliment on my skin and how clear it is... I know that now with this sunscreen I will keep it damage free. Also, it absorbs super quick and it does not cause me allergies nor pimples so far. This lotion is definitely a keeper on my bathroom closet.</li>
            <li> not very oily I apply make up on top of sunscreen and my make up can still stay all day</li>
            <li> Very nice and useful product. I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena for many years. I will recommend the product to any one</li>
            <li> Perfect for being outside all day. I specifically bought this for a trip to Alaska, where I knew I&#x27;d be outside a lot.  I was particuarly worried about a glacier trek where the sun would be reflecting off the ice all day.  I used it every morning of my two week trip (where we had unseasonably nice weather), never re-applied, and I didn&#x27;t get sunburned at all.  I will continue to use this every day I plan on being outside for more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this expensive crap, initially based on the high SPF and the high # of positive reviews. My skin burned and got red and tanned quicker than if I put nothing on. So I did a little research and found out that this is a very misleading product along with other high SPF products. It turns out that the SPF rating only pertains to UVB rays -- not UVA ray which cause the real damage to skin and skin cells. The FDA reclassified how sunscreens and sunblocks are classified in 2013. No manufacturer can advertise that their product is sunblock. Basically everything is now classified as a sunscreen. There are basically two kinds of sunscreens: 1) chemical and 2) physical. This is a chemical sunscreen which are generally less effective than the physical. The physical sunscreens use zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. I have read that both are pretty good, but zinc oxide is better. The only down side with physical sunscreens are that they generally leave a white haze on your skin. A few years ago, Hawaiian Tropic made a sunscreen that I thought was very effective. I remember on the bottle that the active ingredient was zinc dioxide. I also remember that it left a white haze. For some reason they stopped selling that product.</li>
            <li> Pros: excellent protection, not greasy, lasted for several hours in Florida sun&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When it got into my eyes (either from rubbibg or from sweat) it did sting quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my face.  I would recommend the sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li> so the other reviewers said that this is not thick?! maybe i got an old product or something because this sunscreen is super thick and makes applying foundation pretty difficult. i would recommend neutrogena&#x27;s even out moisturizer with sunscreen. that one is much looser and easily blendable</li>
            <li> Feels really good on my skin. I like the fact it does not make a mess and its not oily. It stays on good and it comes off in the shower good too. I used to use the Coppertone sunscreen but it was oily and greasy and it took forever to get off my skin in the shower. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is just a great product.  It&#x27;s thick and rubs in well and protects from the sun.  I use it on my scar and other blemishes where I&#x27;m trying to restrict sun exposure</li>
            <li> Works very well in bright afternoon sunshine. Used it on a trip to Cabo, and didn&#x27;t get sunburned once, a record for me, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, shiny feeling on skin</li>
            <li> If you find some sunscreens irritating, be careful! When I apply certain sunscreens and wear sunglasses my eyes begin to water uncontrollably. Even if I wait a few hours before putting on sunglasses. My eyes definitely water when I wear this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with that, it does not sink into my skin very well.</li>
            <li> Doesnt sting, burn, run into my eyes during outdoor exercise, and so far, no sunburns! And no breakouts, so far.</li>
            <li> Great price.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t whiten your face like snowwhite. Very high spf too</li>
            <li> The product was not expired and the expiration date was far away, so I figured the product was good and new. When I opened the cap, a considerable amount of yellowish oil leaked out and I squeezed out most of it. I made the mistake of thinking that perhaps the oil was just a natural separation between the oil and the lotion (?) components of the product, so after I squeezed out most of the oil, I put some of the product on my face. IT BROKE ME OUT SO BADLY, it took me about 2 months to recover. I&#x27;m still recovering from the aftermaths of the horrible break out. I threw out the sunscreen right away. Waste of money. Super oily and makes you break out.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect sunscreen for me. I burn easily and I was out in full sun in the water several days with no problem. When my face got wet, I didn&#x27;t have sunscreen running into my eyes or burning them. The odor of the SPF was barely noticeable, a good selling point for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products from Neutrogena and decided to give this a try since it&#x27;s 110 SPF. I love this!! It goes on light and oil free and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I will definitely be buying it again in the future. It&#x27;s probably a few bucks too high online and will be cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> No other sunscreen I have ever found has this high of an SPF rating.  No other sunscreen I have ever found has no greasy feeling white cast, or off putting scent either.  This product is ideal for serious daily protection without looking like a tourist slathered in sweet smelling mess.  Also seems to be relatively easy on my sensitive skin and wont leave me oily or with breakouts which are common from most other sunscreens.  By far worth the money if you want to save some down the line on expensive age repair creams!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the high quality of this Sunscreen. I give this company 5 stars. The Lotion doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy, it absorbs immediately and protects against sun so well! Also it somehow revives the skin. It is a little wonder Sunscreen, more than usual sunscreen. I definitely recommend it to anybody who cares about her or his skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered these products together The  Aveeno  Continuous Protection Sunblock and the Twin Pack Neutrogena Age Shield which&lt;br /&gt;came to me in separate postage and my twin pack was only one item. I have never before had any problem with Amazon&lt;br /&gt;and am wondering what may have happened.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Age Shield face oil-free lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 110 is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used to limit sun exposure.  And by limiting sun exposure I mean you will instead be inside searching for an eye wash station or bottle of rubbing alcohol to numb the burning sensation if this stuff gets into your eyes.  About 20 minutes prior to a family swim, I applied this sunscreen protection that my wife bought to my face thinking - \\&quot;It&#x27;s Neutrogena (quality), it&#x27;s SPF 110, it&#x27;s designed for your face and the bottle states \\&quot;water resistant (80 minutes)\\&quot; clearly on the front of the tube.  This will be PERFECT for a swim under the hot Texas sun and I won&#x27;t have to worry about getting a sunburn. The part about not getting a sunburn was accurate because I was not able to stand the burning eyeballs long enough to get any sun exposure!  Anyway, it started as slight irritation - the kind of irratation that causes your kids to scream about sunscreen in their eyes but as an adult male you suck it up and pretend that it&#x27;s not getting worse.  Anyway, after about a 1/2 hr, I went it and ran cool water over my eyeballs hoping that the searing pain would subside.  I came back outside to the pool and made it about another 20 minutes and contemplated scrubbing my eyes with some nearby muriatic acid but decided that would make it worse.  At that point, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and went inside.  My eyes were still a little irritated the next morning.  I eliminated the chlorine in the pool as the problem (several people in the pool had no eye issues that day).  My wife was the only other one complaining about her eyes being irratated - albeit not as bad.  And you guessed it.  She used the same stuff.  I see all the glowing reviews on this product and I&#x27;m glad it works like a champ for most of you.  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy it - just be sure you don&#x27;t sweat this stuff in your eyes or rub your eyes or use it before swimming.  I keep the tube around now as a reminder of whatNOT to buy.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain - it worked as promised.  I clearly did not get too much sun that day!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I had little brown spots on my hand and I used this twice a day a the spots were gone in like a week!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great product.  I did not have any sun burn on my face when I used this on a beach trip.  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best ever for a GUY not greasy</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and the thickness (but not too thick) really makes me feel like I am protecting my face. My makeup goes on smoothly as well, no issues, love the cream and the protection.</li>
            <li> Guess it works how does know, maybe when your eighty feels good on skin and not greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would need 110 spf, but it makes my daughter feel safe so we use it. It works just fine. I&#x27;ve never found a sunscreen that claimed to last more than 80 minutes, though you usually have to search for the tiny writing that says to reapply after 80 minutes. This one lasts as long as most. My daughter has sensitive skin and this one doesn&#x27;t break her out, so that&#x27;s good. It doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky on my hands as some do, also a plus.</li>
            <li> works the way I expected and advertised</li>
            <li> Works well, but is very thick and gunky. You have to pull across the skin to get it evened out an absorbed.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my complexion</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since I bought and I loved it , great product and it&#x27;s affordable, not oilly at all. Good for skin with acne,</li>
            <li> Used this on a trip to Florida (Sanibel) in April.  I&#x27;d spent a lot of time in the sun, but came home comfortable.</li>
            <li> It came as no shock that after years of swimming my skin was in need of some serious TLC. What I didn&#x27;t realize was how important finding the right combination of moisturizer + collagen rebuilder was to this type of intensive care. To be more specific, I went to my dermatologist to discuss my situation and she gave me some pretty informative opinions. Heavy sun exposure is the main culprit for aging skin, as sun affects the collagen, which is a protein fiber produced in the body that keeps you looking young. The sun damages this protein, which is why we ladies who sun a lot look older. What I didn&#x27;t know was that a moisturizer alone wouldn&#x27;t do the trick. My dermatologist recommended [[ASIN:B00I0N24TY this Vitamin C serum]] to use in conjunction with Nuetrogena Age Shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Vitamin C does is help your skin lock in the moisture that comes when using the right cream. Either product alone would not be nearly as effective as using both. What I&#x27;ve found with Neutrogena is that it&#x27;s one of the best facial lotions+moisturizers for active people like me because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or give me pimples. One issue I&#x27;ve had with this product is when I sweat it gets into my eyes and burns - this is typical with most sunscreen lotions. You need to use a different cream around your eyes, and for this I recommend [[ASIN:B004D2C57M this Neutragena eye moisturizer]], because it has SPF 30 but doesn&#x27;t leave such a burning sensation as the Age Shield. If you&#x27;re not going to be in the sun, for example if it&#x27;s night time, then I wouldn&#x27;t use the Neutrogena eye cream, as there&#x27;s no need to add SPF to your face when you don&#x27;t need it. SPF is not a chemical (it stands for Sun Protection Factor) but what I mean is ALL products that have a SPF use chemicals that your face does not need to achieve that. You&#x27;re better off using [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO a cucumber eye cream]] when you&#x27;re not in the sun as that&#x27;s more natural and has less chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall you have to pretty creative when finding your own facial solutions, but these are what worked for me and I hope that helps.</li>
            <li> This product is the best. It does not leave white streaks on my skin. It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I just wish they would offer this product in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> essential for anyone who lives in the middle east and doesn&#x27;t want to look like a tortoise when they get older. not greasy but you really feel the difference wearing it in the sun.</li>
            <li> Awesome protect, haven&#x27;t burned my nose or head utilizing this product.  What I love the most is no greasy feeling left after application and how well it all absorbs in.  Great product and if you have light skin, or really anyone, this product is a must.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110, 3.0 FL...super protection with that&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 110, 3.0 FL...</li>
            <li> My face and bald head seems to break out easy with other sunscreens. I haven&#x27;t had any break outs yet using this product.</li>
            <li> How are sunblock every day whether it&#x27;s cloud cover for sunshine and it is just good coverage. Not to mention a good Moorshire riser for the skin. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Great! A very nice product! Love it! You can buy it that will not regret! Very good product for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen because we were going on a sunny beach vacation and I wanted to prevent any further sun damage.  Unfortunately, this must not have been enough or I didn&#x27;t reapply as often as I should have because I got new brown spots on my face.  In addition, I noted that if you don&#x27;t spread it extremely well and have a darker skin tone it will leave you with a ghost face.  However I do have to say that this sunscreen is much more light weight than any other one I ever tried and it did not make my oily face any oilier.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> This works REALLY REALLY  well.  However, you are chalky with white streaks everywhere.  I couldn&#x27;t get it go blend in but it did what you purchase sunscreen for perfectly. You just don&#x27;t look terrific while you have it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other lotions for my face because, you know, avoiding cancer and stuff, but I think I disliked this one the most out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. It wasn&#x27;t terrible but I found it very hard to rub in all the way. There would always be white left somewhere on my face, especially in the little hairs around my eyebrows and hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it was fine. It wasn&#x27;t too heavy, it didn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. I&#x27;ll probably keep shopping around.</li>
            <li> I have melanoma and this is the only sunscreen I use for my face. Eventually I will need laser surgery to remove my darks spots, but in the meantime, this sunscreen allows my to go outside, WITHOUT a hat!! My dark spots do not get darker, larger, or more obvious. I have tried other sunscreens with lower spfs after hearing health reports that an spf higher than @ 50 is useless. I am here to tell you that sunscreens of 50 spf or lower (many different brands including Neutrogena) DID NOT help in avoiding the sun or protecting my melanoma from the effects of the sun. This is the ONLY sunscreen and the ONLY spf strength that allows me to enjoy the sun, without a hat (I men, really, who wants to wear a hat in the ocean???) and without fear that my sun spots will get worse. Reapplym of course, after swimming, sweating, etc. and follow directions on how often to reapply. I love this product and don;t see me switching this product for any reason, ever!</li>
            <li> Works as promised, non-irritating, non-clogging, non-greasy, smells good and protects even better.</li>
            <li> It was terrible, after use my skin had an extreme burning sensation for a good 3 days after. Cleaning my face made it worse. It was like acid. If you don&#x27;t want a face, use this s***.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK. It&#x27;s not tinted so it can turn you to a ghost. And if you have acne prone skin stay away from this.</li>
            <li> My lady likes this product and it helps prevent the damaging rays of the sun.</li>
            <li> This is a great product of neutrogena, I have a friend that is using it and she says that is the best SPF ever, so If you need a SPF oil free this is the one you should buy</li>
            <li> Non-greasy protection. I passed a brutal summer sun without a tinge of sunburn. This is definitely a repeat purchase. After countless Florida summers, this product simply works.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because I do not tan when I wear it. My only complaint is that it still makes my face oily when I apply it so after I apply it I use an oil blot and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very dry so cream or dry foundation/powder apply easily. Very faint scent but it goes away. I think for just office work wear but need the SPF for the mail run or lunch outing that this does not need hourly reapplication - but not sure. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I put this on all year round. I love how it feels, and that it&#x27;s Broad Spectrum. I don&#x27;t need a lot to cover my face and neck. However, if I don&#x27;t have a half hour to let it sink in, it leaves a noticeable white cast on my face. I just dust a little bit of powder on and go. It works really well under my makeup, and makes my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> its cakey to much to handle, I have grown to dislike it and have switched to alba organics emollient sunscreen, unfortunately I have a whole tube barley used, i use it for my body feet, anything but my face, it really broke out after one use, and I NEVER break out to much TOO MUCH CHEMICALS, stay away GO ORGANIC,</li>
            <li> does not crease under makeup...easy to apply on skin .Really it is an amazing product and better than more expensive brands....I tried them all .</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s face is very sensitive, and this is the only product that helps her. Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> Overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It protects the face and doesn&#x27;t appear super oily, nor does it make me break out.  I recently got a sample of the Age Face Shield SHEER stuff and I have to admit, I wish I had tried that first.  The sheer is much drier feeling and overall lighter.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting this to be a nice coat over my moisturizer. See, I tan easily and as a result, I am about 20 different shades a brown. Although calico, patchy cats are cute, that look is not en vogue for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I buy this, hoping it will help maintain my color through another hot summer. However, a thick slab of this on my face and arms and I can&#x27;t seem to get it to blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. Is lightweight and easy to apply, and the smell is nice too.It protects my skin like i wanted and i can easily apply makeup over it without getting a greasy look.I like this one a lot but im going to try the eta md too.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have been using Neutrogena sun screen products and recently tried this.  It applies easily and has a good feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion/sunscreen doesn&#x27;t absorb well.  After I apply a small amount, I&#x27;m left with a white color on my face.</li>
            <li> Works great and is non greasy which I like!</li>
            <li> I want to stick with this sunscreen. It&#x27;s affordable and works very well. Applying also helps reduce acne and reduces scars from old acne 👌</li>
            <li> My skin looks like whitish! Very oily, maybe I should change the product I wish prozone gel but&lt;br /&gt;Your company Do not have in stock, is Darier laboratories! I try with obagi.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and she loves it, it works really well under makeup and is not oily at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in my gym bag and I use this product everyday.  It protects me from the sun and cold air.  People can never guess my age right!</li>
            <li> i like this , i need a very small amount if i put too much feels oily but is not oily , anyway it doesn&#x27;t let my skin dry i like it very much but maybe this is not so good for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> excellent. i use every day.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I&#x27;m a golfer (in Florida) so I need a good sun screen. I also have problem skin &amp; this does not seem to aggravate any break-outs.</li>
            <li> Great.  nice absorcion.</li>
            <li> Best sun protection.  The sun is what causes the most damage to our skin so I use Neutrogena anytime I&#x27;m going to be outdoors for an extended period of time.  I actually use it for arms, neck and back too.  It goes on easily.  Just have to be careful if you&#x27;re wearing black since it tends to rub off onto clothing.  It does wash out with no problem.</li>
            <li> I thought this face lotion sounded great, but it really burns my eyes and makes them water. It&#x27;s a shame because I have very fair skin and need a good face lotion (I don&#x27;t really tan, I freckle.). It goes on very nicely and is not heavy or hard to absorb as others have commented - in my opinion. But oh my eyes! Its back to Aveeno or Kiss My Face (L&#x27;Oreal also makes me tear up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as an aside, I have no allergies, skin or otherwise, and have &#x27;normal&#x27; skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as I am in the process of whitening my skin with kojic acid. As some of you may know, sunscreen is of the upmost importance during the process of skin whitening. I have tried Neutrogena&#x27;s UltraSheer Dry-Touch sunscreen with SPF 55, but it felt thick on my face. This product, however, has double the SPF and feels twice as lighter. When wearing this sunscreen, I have noticed that my face has become a shade or two lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of using sunscreen in general along with other products, such as moisturizer or foundation, use sunscreen first after cleansing and toning your face. You should apply whatever your daily routine consists of only after waiting 15-30 minutes for the sunscreen to be absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> this is a very effective sunscreen. it is very thick and stings like hell if it gets into your eyes! whoa! I now mix a few drops in my moisturizer instead of using the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; product on my face. I would repurchase if only for the SPF!</li>
            <li> Works great. Used at the beach and really liked it. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Went to Riviera Maya and our only regret was not buying more of this. Make sure you apply evenly, it works very well! By the 3rd day of our honeymoon you could tell I was not applying it over my feet very well and they are the only part of my body that got burned. My body see&#x27;s sunlight a hand full of times out of the year, I&#x27;m usually very white and burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the price / quantity ratio could be a bit better. We bought two of these and used them within 4 days between 2 people, applying about twice a day. It would be nice if one bottle for the same price could cover 2 people for a week (about 14 applications)</li>
            <li> This Sunscreen Leaves a TERRIBLE WHITE CAST on your FACE! When I was putting it on, it was ok for the first second, but 5 mins later it dried and left a terrible white residue on my face and the only way to fix it was to completely wash it off all together which defeats the purpose of wearing sunscreen. This doesn&#x27;t even work on your neck either. The only part I would put this sunscreen is on my arms or legs. It also left my skin really dry which is not attractive at the least! Overall I would only recommend this product if you plan to wear it on your arms and legs or back BUT NOT ON your FACE or NECK unless you wanna look like a terrible ghost mess.</li>
            <li> Wore for eight straight days in the sun and it protected my skin beautifully. Only takes small amount for coverage.</li>
            <li> never got a sunburn again from surfing. I surf a lot and this stuff works the best. I have tried all other products and still get small burns here and there. I will continue to buy from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I bought the Thinkbaby SPF50, the Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen and the Neutrogena Sunscreen Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70 to compare.  I wanted something I could use on my face when outside that had a high SPF, but could also use on other parts of my body without smelling like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neotrogena Age Shield  SPF 110 The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF 110&lt;br /&gt;You can see where you put it&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be effective&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;It blends well with face cream, which makes it go on better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neotrogena Age Shield  SPF 110 The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something for you face, it is very very thick&lt;br /&gt;It is very white and you have to really blend it&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly while you are blending it, so it doesn&#x27;t spread very far and you need more&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin shiny; but if you are wearing it under makeup and powder, you won&#x27;t notice.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clog my pores and break me out a little&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive for how much you get; it will not last long&lt;br /&gt;You really need to dilute it will a little face cream, but then I wonder how much of the SPF I am loosing by doing that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70 The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very very light, so if that is what you are going after it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice scent that is neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;It did not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF of 70.&lt;br /&gt;It will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Stick SPF The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too hard and does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well because it is made like an underarm deodorant&lt;br /&gt;The cap is poorly designed and you have to make sure that you roll it back down into the applicator or the lid will not go on.&lt;br /&gt;It is too sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby SPF 50+ The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent&lt;br /&gt;It does not clog my pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinkbaby SPF 50+ The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too thick and dries too quickly like the other one, so you need more&lt;br /&gt;It does not blend well with face cream or other lotions&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too expensive&lt;br /&gt;It could be a higher SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to purchase any of these again.  I would get the Neutrogena SPF 110 and just dilute it a little with my face cream for my face and a little body lotion for other areas. But, I think I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on smoothly and qui kly. Not sticky.</li>
            <li> I loved the 70 spf of this product,but this one is much thicker and more prone to leaving white streaks.  The 70 spf goes on nice and light.</li>
            <li> Product has a great smell. I love the texture of the cream and the way it makes my face feel. Just a warning:  I accidentally rubbed my eyes before washing my hands of the product and now my eyes have been burning for hours. That is entirely user error though.</li>
            <li> Works but turns face white .</li>
            <li> Love the neutrogena products</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it everyday for sun protection. Love it because its lightweight and soothing.</li>
            <li> My face has never gotten burned or turned pink while using this sunscreen! It blends in well with my skin, and it fits nicely under foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistence is really good. I can use make up after and it&#x27;s fine!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Clean dry. Recommend.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist  gave me a sample of Neutrogena UltraSheer dry-touch SPF85. When I went to buy some I found this on Amazon and I do like it.  A little expensive but so was having the Basel cell  carcinoma off my nose!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it is clear, not greasy nor sticky and it completely shields my face from the sun (trust me I live in the Caribbean) it is soft on my skin. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  In addition to the sunscreen, it has anti-aging ingredients.  It goes on smoothly and helps my skin look nice.  I wear it under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a really decent sunscreen. With an SPF spectrum of 110 and oil free, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. It also has a mild scent of sunscreen which isn&#x27;t bothersome at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I don&#x27;t like about it are:&lt;br /&gt;1) It leaves a thick, sticky &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on your hands after application. You can really feel it on your fingertips which makes me want to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;2) The other thing that I noticed is that after awhile upon application, the sunscreen balls up into tiny white balls that make you look like you have dry, flaky skin. So if you were yo rub your face during the day, you will literally feel it coming off in &amp;#34;tiny balls.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I can tolerate these things at the moment, I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dr (for very pale people) and has made a big difference.  Since using this sunscreen I have seen fewer freckles, lines, spots, and sunburns.  Using other sunscreens, every 2 hours, I still got burned on my face.  Using this I can put it on in the morning, reply at lunch and not see any signs of burning.</li>
            <li> I use this every am and later in the day if I am going to be outside.  Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes or it will burn.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your skin healthy and looking good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take a lot to make my face break out in pimples and this is no different.  I use it though because skin cancer seems to like me.</li>
            <li> Your face is most exposed and sensitive.  This kept mine cool and protected.  Anything Neutrogena I have tried works wonders!</li>
            <li> very good quality product.exactly what i was expecting</li>
            <li> A great sunscreen, does very well to protect my sensitive skin from the sun</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, EVEN BETTER PRICE. YOU CAN GET IT A LIL CHEAPER IN AMAZON THAN ON YOUR LOCAL WALMART. DEFINITELY WORKS.. HAVE BEEN PURCHASING IT FOR MY SELF AND MY CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this product this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I HATE putting on sun screen; one of the worst, slimiest feelings in this world.  Not with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth without the grease, leaves no terrible residue and lasts for an extremely long time.  It is a fantastic facial sun screen and one I had no qualms about applying again and again.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This lotion feels light on the face, it has a nice smell and, most importantly, it does not leave your face looking greasy at all. It feels like a treat whenever i apply it in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect protection against solar burn and UVA ray.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used for a year, i note the result</li>
            <li> Way too dry for my skin, I recommend this for people wth oily skin or else your dry skin can cause more wrinkles on your face.</li>
            <li> Very effective but keeps my skin natural.</li>
            <li> received in good shape</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  It is not heavy and leaves my skin moist.  It also has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> Best loción i have never used</li>
            <li> Non-greasey. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test its effectiveness for any longer than an hour,but was satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li> super nice not itching as expected :)</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this product. Truly keeps rays of the sun from face and other body parts. You don&#x27;t have to stay out of the sun...just cover up with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent ítems and service super on time!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Age Shield after my Neutrogena Dry-touch sunscreen SPF 100 ran out. The Age Shield is decent at what it does. It does leave a thin white film on my skin that becomes particularly prominent over time. A minor amount of perspiration (or even humidity) will make this film bead into white droplets that are unseemly. If i wear sunglasses and take them off, there is a white line of sunscreen left behind where the sunglasses touched my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say all this even though the Age Shield is a good product. But their Dry-touch is superior in every way, so -1 star for the age shield.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. I actually purchased it for every day use, as I&#x27;m getting serious about sun care to prevent signs of aging.  after I wash my face in the morning, I apply this, and wait for it to sink in for a couple minutes.  Then I apply a regular face moisturizer, wait for that to sink in, then apple foundation and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how after I apply it, it really doesnt take long to sink in.  It also seems like it makes my face feel softer.  It does not make my foundation flake up or anything like that, and provides really great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of it is great as well, it&#x27;s really smooth and not greasy at all.  I am happy with it, and will keep using it every single day</li>
            <li> Leaves my face kind of greasy . Washes off pretty fast. You have to constantly re apply .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and forms of sunscreen and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. It thoroughly protects against any hint of sunburn and I&#x27;m very fair-skinned. If using powdered makeup you will need to gently blot your face with a paper towel after application of the sunscreen and before the powdery makeup but the sun protection is still there. I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with this product at all and am so glad to have found it!!</li>
            <li> This gets the job done. It also makes my face feel soft</li>
            <li> We have very strong sun on Rocky mountain.  This cream is always protect my skin.  Even though I get sun burn.....</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin on my face feeling great.  I use it every day after shaving or not. Really valuable if you are outdoors  a lot.</li>
            <li> Provides good blockage BUT when they say oil-less  and/or dry, they lie!  This stuff is as greasy as Crisco! It will protect your skin, however and does a good job at it. If you have a black interior in your car like I do, it may rub off making white stains (which are easily removable with any good cleaner for interiors)</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for every-day use, and I&#x27;ve been impressed with it.  I was previously using a day cream that had only 15 SPF, and wanted something more potent, especially given that I live in a sunny, hot climate and am trying to avoid sun damage. This sunscreen is a great value and it was not like the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, where you have that oily uncomfortable feeling for the rest of the day, like there&#x27;s something on your face.  This sunscreen feels light and airy, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me aside from the faint sunscreen smell (unavoidable in my experience).  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> OMG! This product burns...really bad! I&#x27;m not sure if it burns because I have dry skin or because I combined it with olive oil...but definitely cannot stand it. It&#x27;s been 5 days and my skin is still healing!</li>
            <li> While this product is a very good broad spectrum sunscreen and I would recommend it,  I would not recommend it to be used on  your face. While it states that it is Oil-Free it leaves your skin feeling greasy and gives a shiny appeance, and it is not good to use under make-up. Having said that I do think that Neutrogena makes some of the best Broad Spectrum Sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the SPF 100. This doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and works great. I love it.</li>
            <li> I just used up the tube of this that I purchased three months ago for daily use on my face and neck. I am white with a yellow olive skin tone, and I never burn but tan. This left a definite white cast on my skin, despite leaving it to sit on my face after spreading it and then rubbing it in after several minutes (this method works to prevent white casts with physical sunscreens for me). The cast would stay on my face for about an hour or two, not all day by any means, but it was VERY noticeable and most mornings I had to continue rubbing it in a bit after I got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as I know, this product does what it&#x27;s stated to do otherwise. I have been wearing this in the winter months, November-February, so I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy in hot and humid sun, but as a daily sunscreen, I have no complaints outside of the white cast. It dries to a nice matte finish that I imagine would serve as a decent primer for makeup. For the cheap price and for how long a tube lasts with generous application, I would recommend it to those on a very tight budget who still want to wear sunscreen daily. I will not be repurchasing this product, but that&#x27;s because in general I prefer a physical sunscreen. I just wanted to try this one for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warning: as other reviews state, this WILL burn/sting your eyes if you accidentally get even a tiny bit of it in them from, for example, scratching your face, and it DOES take a long time for the irritation to subside. BE VERY CAREFUL when applying under the eyes. I would not recommend wearing this to swim.</li>
            <li> When applying, the lotion does take away some color and gives a ghostly white appearance but my skin feels so soft throughout the day. The temporary white appearance is worth it.</li>
            <li> The last sunscreen I used was this: [[ASIN:B002JAYMEE Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen, SPF 100, 3 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]]. Despite being very thick, once it was rubbed in it left a light, dry finish. This made it perfect for use under makeup. It did not clog my pores, or look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen, on the other hand, is everything I was hoping to avoid. It may be \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s still somewhat greasy and clogs your pores! To its credit, it&#x27;s not as greasy as most generic body sunscreens, but it does NOT leave a dry finish. You know how cheap moisturizers make your face sweat in sunlight, even though you&#x27;re not hot? This sunscreen does exactly that--and that&#x27;s because it clogs up your pores. I can&#x27;t wear it on my nose or cupid&#x27;s bow, because those areas get all sweaty when I wear this! I have dry skin too, so if it makes me look greasy it has to be pretty dang greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? It&#x27;s not as greasy as most, but it&#x27;s still a little greasy. And it&#x27;ll clog your pores, making your face sweat more than it should. It&#x27;s heavy and if you have sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll definitely feel it on your face--certainly not lightweight. The only rewarding points are that it is not as heavy/greasy as most, and it has a high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something with a real dry finish, go for Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Dry Touch\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li> I put it on each morning after my shower, I live in Florida and so far no sun burn on my face! Great moisturizer and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Works very well in the Caribbean trip we took. My wife can get a moon burn so this was very effective in daylight in the Caribbean. She did not get burnt.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Did not feel oily.  My face did not get burned and I was out in the sun all day for a week in 85 degree weather.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and I love SPF 110))) whenver you are planning to travel to hot countries, from my point of view this is not oily.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on.</li>
            <li> Because it has such a high SPF, you can easily mix this with foundation at about 30% and still be covered better than most SPF foundations. It goes on smooth and feels moisturizing but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fair skin and this summer I used this every day on my face for two months at 5° from the equator. I used regylar 50 spf sweat proof sunscreen on my back and shoulders and they were literally burned to the point of bleeding ... but my face was never even pink! Why didn&#x27;t I use this everywhere???&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not always sell toiletries at a competitive price compared to CVS but this product is about the same in stores. You can definitely get it on sale for cheaper at CVS if you&#x27;re willing to wait for a sale.</li>
            <li> Terrible for your skin, see the EWG ratings:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/618851/Neutrogena_Age_Shield_Face_Sunscreen%2C_SPF_110/</li>
            <li> Shipped as advertised</li>
            <li> Jury is still out - can&#x27;t tell if the 110 SPF works better than the 55 or 70.  Applies easily just like the others.</li>
            <li> It does not feel very greasy, I do feel that something is on.    One major issue is that this sunscreen does look very white when applied. Even after doing my best to spread it thinly, I look oddly pale.</li>
            <li> I Like very much, that is why I bought 3 more. It was more than I expected.I never used neutrogena,but I would like to try another one for the day in my face</li>
            <li> PRO: + non-greasy, no sheen, not sticky  CON: If you have dark skin, you might have a noticeable white film if: - you don&#x27;t rub it in completely - you rub in too much - you start sweating a lot (initially, in the mirror you don&#x27;t see white, but people will tell you after you start sweating a lot)  I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this at all. If you are active and sweat easily during warm weather, this is probably not the sunscreen for you.  The higher SPF level didn&#x27;t matter, really, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it for the white filmy look.</li>
            <li> I like a lot the way this product feels in my skin. It is not heavy nor greasy, and it makes my skin softer.</li>
            <li> Very light, not filmy or ghostly, it also completely- completely leaves you white... On the beach,in Florida. In July. People, in July!</li>
            <li> I love the neutrogenia age shield sun screen. It is not greasy, it blends in well, it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts and it protects from UV rays. I recommend.</li>
            <li> perfect for my trip to Egypt--it&#x27;s great coverage for a sunny place.  It smoothes easily on the skin, leaving my skin soft.  There&#x27;s no  chemical smell, either.  application is easy and not at all greasy or shiny.  You can&#x27;t see it on the skin after you apply it it</li>
            <li> If you need serious skin protection, this will do the trick.  Best yet, its cheaper here than at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s not even remotely oily and good to use everyday!</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to do the job, but I do wake up with small blemishes from time-to-time since I began using it.  It&#x27;s very thick and white when initially applied, but vanishes as it&#x27;s blended in.  Surprisingly, my skin isn&#x27;t oily with this on.  I ran into an older lady with the most beautiful skin and asked her what she uses.  She said she uses a glycolic acid lotion every night and this in the morning.  Hey, if this helps my skin look like hers when I&#x27;m in my 80s, I&#x27;ll be a very happy consumer.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Product is really helping her look younger, she says, and she also likes the fact it is SPF 110, too.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen daily now that I know the impact of the sun on my face . For years I had hyper-pigmentation around my eyes. Now with modern dermatology, I have rid myself of dark circles and must use sunscreen religiously .</li>
            <li> Good protection among all the sun-blocking products.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is it&#x27;s too sticky.</li>
            <li> Despite the oil-free selling point it did not work well according to my assumptions and caused lots of breakouts. Neutrogena is one of the few (if not the only) companies that specializes in purely chemical sunscreens which have high enough PA (system used to rate blocking of UVA rays, the ones that cause the majority of skin aging).. It is cheaper than most of the more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; sunscreens and doesn&#x27;t feel like you ran your face into Slimer from Ghostbusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling is definitely more like the sheer line of Neutrogena sunscreens but still has an unpleasant feeling/smell long after putting it on. Worse of all is that it caused lots of additional breakouts which can scar defeating the purpose of why I was using the sunscreen in the first place. I have a a short trimmed black beard and there was really no problem with the sunscreen except it coating the hairs and making them shinier. No strong whitecast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope FDA regulation on sunscreen chemicals changes soon so that the US sunscreen market can match European and Asian markets in effective relatively inexpensive chemical products..</li>
            <li> I used really expensive sunscreens for years, always looking for 50+ SPF. Kiehls, Dermalogica, Sisheido....I trusted all of them because I was paying more but they always made me look a little bit shiny with daily use. Sometimes I would look a little sun baked after a day outside even though I wore a huge amount of these suncreens (and applied 30 minutes before sun exposure, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SUNSCREEN BEATS THEM ALL. I&#x27;ve been using it all summer and fall, every day, and it&#x27;s the best. It has a higher SPF, It applies evenly without streaking, it truly is completely matte even over my moisturizer and I don&#x27;t look like a ghost in pictures. It actually protects my skin for hours and I don&#x27;t have to worry if I don&#x27;t reapply right away. I can&#x27;t believe I paid too much money on expensive sunscreen all this time when this Neutrogena sunblock was the best one all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be careful to wipe my eyebrows after applying because sometimes the sunblock leaves powdery white flecks behind (wipe with a terry cloth towel, not with a tissue because a tissue will leave more flecks behind), but this is a small inconvenience in exchange for good value, good sun protection, and a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Brown spots on hands and face have disappeared.</li>
            <li> I did not like the texture left on my face. It left a white residue on my face. It does not have enough moisture in the cream. I don&#x27;t use it. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if this works any better than SPF 45, but it&#x27;s really no more expensive and works fine</li>
            <li> Good. Don&#x27;t use very often, but would definitely use when staying outside for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work for me.  This is both a chemical and physical sunscreen. It does have the spf smell even though it says it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.  I&#x27;m an outdoor enthusiast and I am prone to melisma, so I must wear high level SPF everyday.  Neutrogena works pretty good layered under makeup</li>
            <li> I find this product very good. I have sensitive and fair skin and wear this daily. It is light enough and non greasy so that I can wear this under makeup. Good buy.</li>
            <li> The top reviewer on this item is recommending three different items to a healthy looking skin who has received high number of helpful votes only in few weeks, amazing. SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays; an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays; and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98% of rays. This Neutrogena with SPF 110 is only a marketing tool. \\&quot;\\&quot;Shields Skin 6-Layers Deep From Skin-Aging UVA Rays\\&quot;\\&quot; is a lie since the chemicals that form a product&#x27;s sun protection factor are aimed at blocking ultraviolet B rays, which are the primary cause of sunburn and non-melanoma skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma (von Thaler 2010). Ultraviolet A rays penetrate deeper into the skin and are harder to block with sunscreen ingredients approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for use in US sunscreens.  Scientists know less about the dangers of UVA radiation, but the general consensus is that it is less obvious than UVB damage but possibly more serious. There is no protection from UVA except staying out of sun. No producer has any mix that protects human skin from UVA, none, absolutely none. \\&quot;\\&quot;Helioplex Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Superior Anti-Aging Protection\\&quot;\\&quot;, Helioplex will cause skin irritation and is no protection from UVA either. The same active ingredients or pure chemicals in this item are sold by many other sunscreen makers for five times less in cost with one exception, others do not have Helioplex which offers rash and burning eyes. I put on sunscreen and I never worry about rash or burning eyes since the ingredients are organic not pure chemicals with fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Procter &amp; Gamble tested a competitor&#x27;s SPF 100 product at five different labs the results varied between SPF 37 and SPF 75. The company determined that a very small differences in the testing conditions can have a dramatic influence on the calculated SPF. In this case a 1.7 percent change in the light transmission yields a SPF measurement of 37 instead of 100. Small difference in application thickness could have a similar effect. Because of the way SPF values are calculated these errors would be most dramatic for high SPF products. In a letter to the FDA P&amp;G warned that the intense UV light used in laboratory SPF tests are different than the conditions experienced in the real world, and of \\&quot;dubious value\\&quot;. They concluded that SPF values should be capped at 50+ because the current system is \\&quot;at best, misleading to consumers\\&quot; and \\&quot;may inappropriately influence their purchase decision\\&quot; (P&amp;G 2011).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients; Avobenzone (3%) , Homosalate (15%) , Octisalate (5%) , Octocrylene (4%) , Oxybenzone (5%)&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients; Water , Styrene Acrylamide Copolymer , Silica , Beeswax (Apis Mellifera) , Cyclopentasiloxane , Ethylhexl Glycerin , Glyceryl Stearate , PEG 100 , PEG 100 Stearate , Acrylates/Dimethicone Copolymer , Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer , Chlorphenesin , Triethanolamine , Disodium EDTA , Dipotassium EDTA , Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root) , BHT , Methylisothiazolinone , Diethylexyl 2 , 6 Naphthalate , Fragrance.e in application thickness could have a similar effect.

            <li> absolutely loved by everyone</li>
            <li> I love this product so light on the skin not gressy and i feel protected in the sun</li>
            <li> Used it all summer... does the job!  Doesn&#x27;t blend in super easy, but not sure any with that much SPF would.</li>
            <li> The best facial sunscreen lotion I&#x27;ve found on the market for two reasons- highest SPF w/a non greasy/sticky formula. It&#x27;s very comfortable on the skin. Able to apply makeup on top of it effortlessly. One of the products I use on a daily basis. Would highly recommend-</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin but this one is really good for me.&lt;br /&gt;This product protect my skin from sun.</li>
            <li> The was my exclusive sunscreen for my face on our recent trip to Jamaica. Thicker stuff than a normal lotion, but works well and dries to a lighter feel.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is an excellent brand, reliable for those of us that burn easily, I use all year round . It absorbs into the skin very easily without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t smell nasty like the spray can types. I ran across this on Amazon and the reviews made it seem like it was the lotion I was looking for. It works great, easy to apply, and most of all, little to no nasty smell. It actually doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look like most sunscreens leave on your skin which was another bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube is a bit pricey, after I found the exact same thing at walgreens, the generic version for half the price. So I ended up buying 2 tubes for the price of 1 of Neutrogenia for the exact same things. It had the same ingredients in it and smells almost the same, but at half the price. So if you want to save money, I would try the walgreens generic version of this......it even says &amp;#34;compare to Neutrogena ingredients&amp;#34; on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my skin hasn&#x27;t been sensitive to this product as many end up experiencing symptoms like burning or irritation. I suggest getting the walgreens version of this before you spend the full price on the Name brand one.</li>
            <li> is the best sunscreen is not greasy and it stays all day, I recommend it for warm weather and perfect for use under makeup!!</li>
            <li> I have tried over a dozen sunscreens on my face including $40/bottle high end brands and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or skin.  It is thick but after I rub it in I cannot tell I&#x27;m wearing anything at all.  Good value!!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. I put it under my make-up. As well as pm my neck &amp; chest. It is not greasy or heavy. It does string (A LOT) if you get it in your eyes. Apply with caution.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my face!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best product of its kind I have tried. Feels great on skin, and really protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> I use this product as my day cream during the day. If I need to put make up on, just put before the application of fundation. I feel light after I put it on my face. I like it as it is with dry touch, non-greasy and non-shinny. Before switching to the Neutrogena Age Shield SP110 and Neutrogena SPF85 procucts I was using the Ombrelle SPF60; SPF45; Banana Boat Sport SPF100 and the Sun Play Perfect Shield SPF130. I found the later mentioned gourp were kind of greasy with the feeling of thickness and heavy for me. I will definately recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and living in Rio de Janeiro I am constantly out in the scorching hot sun. This sun block is a life saver.</li>
            <li> This product protects my skin very good. I have fragile skin and I get dark spots from the sun a lot. But since I started using this product is much better and I dint get sunburn.i recommend to everyone..</li>
            <li> Works well for my neck, chest, and arms, but burns my sensitive face and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works great, but does seem to leave that white ghost look even after it&#x27;s rubbed in! The good part is it leaves your skin non-greasy looking, but does leave you looking very pale :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excelent product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years.  It goes on very clean and does not feel greesy.  There is no oder to clash with other cosmetics I wear.  I started wearing sun screen at the advise of my doctor because my face is highly susceptible to sunburn.  This is the best I have found.  No sunburn on my face in 2 years.  I can actually feel the difference if I forget to put it on and go out in the sun.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I would like to preface my review by saying that this is likely an excellent product, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to persuade anybody not to use it.  However, my personal experience with this product has been pretty horrifying.  I have moderately sensitive skin...not overly so, but I&#x27;m selective in choosing gentle products for my skincare regimen.  Even though I realize that it is more than likely ME and not the product, I don&#x27;t tolerate it at all.  When I first apply it, it is okay.  I felt a very mild sting, but it was very tolerable and I just continued with my regular routine and went to work.  By the time I reached work, it was burning enough for me to be uncomfortable.  By noon, I tried to wash it off.  Just the process of cleaning it off made it burn more.  By that evening, my face started scaling up, and was peeling by the time I went to bed.  This product is just very strong, I guess.  I&#x27;m not reviewing it poorly because I know that it is the combination of my skin and this product that didn&#x27;t work.  I just wanted to caution people with skin sensitivities that this particular product might be too strong for them.  It was for me, and I&#x27;m still paying for it.  And no, there was nothing else about my skincare regimen that morning that was any different...only the application of this product.  I am really happy for everybody who tolerates it.</li>
            <li> Great product, it really helps to protect my skin. I go out in the sun alot because I work out and I jog. So by using this product it has been protecting me skin. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It gives me good protection from the sun, and i found myself a bit lighter just from using it one day.&lt;br /&gt;I just recommend using a little if you are darker skinned because it makes your face white if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I am a huge neutrogena fan and have been for 35+ years. Neutrogena sunblock is wonderful. We consume all forms of Neutrogena sunblock. I use this high spf version on my face when I go cycling.  I am outside for around 6 - 10 hours each week riding and running and this sunblock definitely does the trick!!</li>
            <li> Its a bit greasy if you apply more quantity, but the product works. I just got a light tan on my face even after staying in the Florida sun for the entire day.</li>
            <li> thought I would love this, as I do most neutrogena products. Nope - disappointed. This goes on pretty thick and waaaayyyy too white! It is very much a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; as opposed to a &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34;. Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought this was an everyday moisturizer (&amp;#34;Face Lotion&amp;#34;) with a great sunscreen in it. But after applying, I am thinking its actually a &amp;#34;sunscreen - for the face&amp;#34;. ??? I use it on my neck and chest, daily, and on my face if I&#x27;m hitting the beach/pool....not a total loss, but definitely not a regular face lotion with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> I started using this since I live in Florida and I am constantly in the sun. It goes on nicely and all you need is a little since it spreads easily. It does not leave a shiny oily look like cheaper sunscreens do. Hoping it prevents sun damage to my face.</li>
            <li> I had surgery for facial skin cancer and I was advised I needed a facial skin block as I live most the year in Florida.  This product fit the bill, works well to block harmful sun rays  as I wearing a hat and using this sun shield walk outdoors for an hour as many days as I can each week.  Is not harsh on skin as it works as a moisturizer as well.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and was recently was diagnosed with Melanoma skin cancer. I have lived in Southern California and had Sunroofs with my vehicles. Not knowing the damage I was doing in my 20&#x27;s. Melanoma is the most deadliest skin Cancer around. I looked high and low on the web for the best product. My dermatologist tried to sell me their stuff $70 for 3 ounces. After purchasing skin cancer clothing and spending almost $500 dollars. I have no extra money. I found this product and a little dab does wonders. I rub it on my whole face, ears and neck. It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue. It doesn&#x27;t smell like BEN-GAY. The product is extremely reasonable priced. I bought 2 tubes and a little goes a long way I will continue for as long as God let&#x27;s me live</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is the best and easy too use and the smell is great. I am a landscaper so I don&#x27;t mind putting this on all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and it the best product that she has used so far for sun protection.</li>
            <li> That was what my mom was looking for. It works, that was that she was expecting because she knows how that cream works.</li>
            <li> I have struggled wi acnea my whole life. This moisturizer does not make me break out at all and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This product caused an intense rash to break out on my face and neck. I would never use it again nor recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be as good of a product for my face as the Neutrogena Ultra Dry Touch 100 SPF sunscreen. I found the Age Shield Face Lotion to be more greasy and found that it would run down my face a bit when I sweat. In the future I would probably just but the Ultra Dry Touch and use that on my face and body instead of buying a separate face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Non oily and smooth to apply</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used it during golf playing. It will not make your eyes burned after 2-3 hours playing under the direct sun and your skin arround eyes get wet. Some other kinds of sun cream make me like crying. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> product as advertised.  fast delivery,</li>
            <li> I had those brown ugly  looking Age spots on my face I accidentelly&lt;br /&gt;Discovered that mixing this product with my mild face cream and its&lt;br /&gt;Goodby Age spots! I use it as an everyday protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sunscreen but I found it to be way too thick for daily use under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Perfect for a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;CON: Too thick for daily use under makeup.  I ended up buying something else more sheer.</li>
            <li> No sheen, and doesn&#x27;t have much of an oily feeling. I like this.</li>
            <li> i bought this lotion because my skin is sensitive to sunlight (burns within 3 hours), and feels slightly hotter than i can stand under direct exposure.  when this lotion i can walk in the sunlight without feeling that uncomfortable burning sensation from direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how addicted I am to using this sunscreen as part of my routine every day. It takes some getting used to because it&#x27;s so thick. I put a pea-sized amount, rub it between my hands, and press or rub into my face over all my Philosophy skincare products. It seals everything in and gives me the perfect sun protection. NO breakouts at all, but it can hurt a  lot if you get it into your eyes. If Neutrogena ever discontinues this product, I will cry!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and good protection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by a Neutragena product since being introduced to thier soap as a teenager over 40 years ago. Which makes this review even harder to write. I purchased Age Shield face SPF 110 because as I&#x27;ve gotten older the sun wreaks havoc with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;While I do agree that this product works fairly well as a sun block I need to warn you that it&#x27;s a greasy mess. I made the mistake of applying it on my arms as well as my face and had to spend 20 minutes cleaning off the interior of my car. It left a thick greasy film everywhere I touched.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind being seen with a greasy film everywhere you apply it and don&#x27;t plan on touching anyone or thing, it might be the right sunscreen for you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best feeling sunblock I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s thick and slightly greasy. I am black so it leaves a terrible white mask over my face. Aveeno is the only sunblock that has felt nice and non greasy to me but it didn&#x27;t contain enough protection.</li>
            <li> This is non-greasy, you barely know you put any on even before it dries.  Lightwight and no pimples, yet works great.  All the kids want it.</li>
            <li> Good as always, 110 protects your face and skin from harmful rays, been using for a couple of years and it does what it supposed to do, i do believe that it acts like an AGE SHIELD! IT keeps your skin from getting wrinkles caused by the sun, apply everyday 20-30 min before going out into the sun......... (Miami sun over here so this is the right SPF for me) I&#x27;m glad i bought it from amazon, cheaper price than going to my local target.&lt;br /&gt;Will Re purchase, condition of the item was new as described by seller (the box and the item itself), everything A-okay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Greasy but protects well</li>
            <li> Skin feels better as well as protected from sun. No oily feeling. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really believe on Neutrogena sunblock products, but this one doesn&#x27;t give me the felling that&#x27;s a 110 SPF. It feels more like 40-50 and doesn&#x27;t avoid my skin to become red after some exposure to sun.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I prefer to use it on my face instead of a regular/body sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Rediculous!  How can you put this on your face if it stings your eyes???  Can&#x27;t even out on mascara afterwards because my eyes are so irritated..</li>
            <li> Really works, does not get oily, easy application, does not alter the texture and look of my foundation. Perfect! I had paid 3 x times as much for some of the High End Brands at Macy&#x27;s and was always disappointed, Now, I am in love with this, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Versus the sun&#x27;s rays, this product always comes out on top.</li>
            <li> Found out about this when I was in Phoenix -super sunny place. The fragrance makes me sneeze and my nose itch.</li>
            <li> I am one of those super fair gals who can tan, but seem to have spots that just don&#x27;t tan evenly (vitiligo)..so, this helps to just block the sun and does a nice job on my face.  I have tried lots of differently products, Clinique, arbonne, and while great products, they do not have the total blockage that is needed to remedy the vitiligo spots!</li>
            <li> Excellent product my father use to apply it twice a day extremelly recomended what else cay a say  ok good nice</li>
            <li> I used this in Roatan, where it is very sunny. It protected my face &amp; neck very well from the sun.</li>
            <li> Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>
            <li> it does not burn when it runs in my eyes. which it does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it stays on about 15 minutes in sweat.  it is not oily but glunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the zinc would stay on in sweat.</li>
            <li> NEUTROGENA - the mark of excellence in skin products.  Kudos!!!!!</li>
            <li> Invariably, I rub my eyes while I&#x27;m wearing the sunscreen and it burns.  While I think it works, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena should know that when you make a sunscreen for the face it should not make your eyes burn, sting &amp; water !!!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the product considering the PRICE $$$$$. Guess I&#x27;ll save it &amp; try in the winter...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month now. I use it daily as my day lotion. It keep my face moist alright. It doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy, oily, uncomfortable feeling. Almost want to apply this to all my body to replace my other Neutrogena sun screen product. It works just like a normal moisturizer, but giving you such great protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Very light feeling on the skin with little to no shine once fully dried. I&#x27;ve been applying this under my makeup every day since I purchased it, and I see no difference in the application, wear-time, or appearance of my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this the ultimate challenge of taking a long walk on a 90 degree afternoon with mid-day sun and no other form of sun protection. Even thought my face felt like it was on fire, I didn&#x27;t burn. I have fair skin, rosacea, and keratosis pilaris, so that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews have described this product as unscented, and I don&#x27;t necessarily agree. There is a light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger for too long or upset my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I wear it under my makeup when I&#x27;m going to be outside all day, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using retinol and other things on my skin that make me sunburn really easy.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of lotions with SPF and they all feel really heavy and greasy.  This lotion feels incredibly light.  It soaks in well and doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  I have a medium complexion and I do find that this lotion gives my skin a slight white tint, so if you have a darker skin tone, you may hate the way this makes your skin look.</li>
            <li> I get sunburned pretty easily usually even with sunscreen on but not with this. Works great and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like so many others have.</li>
            <li> This goes on very thick and I got a few breakouts from it, i switched to neutrogena clear face and I get no breakouts, it&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I like to tan but not on my face.  This gives me excellent protection.  I use it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> Smells good for a sun block and feels nice for a sunblock cream. Gives peace of mind for trying to protect the skin. It is my go to for sunblock and the price I got it was fair. It does have one of the highest spf on store shelves. However I use it most in the summer and only water resistant for 80min. Which means constant reapplication is necessary for full effect especially for someone like me who sweats throughout the day. Well it makes it more harder if you are dressed up with this under makeup foundation /face powder concealer and having to do your makeup all over for reapplication of this. Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t require much makeup or even frequently wear makeup but having to bring the tube with me all the time is kind of bit to keep up with when I&#x27;m busy most of the time in the summer</li>
            <li> Works we but really irritates my eyes:(</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have oily, acne prone skin, and I wanted a sunscreen that was non comedogenic with anti-aging properties. The good thing about this product is it is fairly inexpensive and offers some protection from the sun... Aside from that this product is awful! It leaves a horrible thick white residue all over your face, you&#x27;d think this would at least offer some moisture, but no, it dries out your skin and left my face flaky and dry. It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as other sunscreens, but stings a little around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product only last two hours so you are then supposed to re-apply! No, way! Then I would really have a ghostly white paste all over my face. This also broke me out a little on my forhead and chin, small pimples emerged a couple days after I used the product, every time I used it on my face... I switched to using this on my arms and legs so I don&#x27;t waste money, but honestly I don&#x27;t even like it for that as it will leave a white trace anywhere it rubs off on that will in some cases be permanent. I put this on my legs, and then got in the car, and it rubbed off on my seats, staining them! Keep looking for sunscreen and don&#x27;t let all the positive reviews influence you. I don&#x27;t think they are legit!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! No greasy mess and I can wear it all day without even noticing it. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried other Neutrogena products, this is by far the best. Love it my skin feels great. Non oily and it has helped with my skin tone no be so red and less break outs. I have used this for 5 months now. I will continue to use this every morning!  I have T-zone oily skin combination,</li>
            <li> not greasy or sticky, works well</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife.  She have a very sensitive skin, and also had acne for a long time, she&#x27;s very picky with face products. Most of the products she used in the past are very expensive and at the end she was never happy with the product and keep changing brands. She&#x27;s being using Neutrogena SPF 110 for six weeks, and she&#x27;s very happy with it, she says give her full protection and makes her face feel light. She wants to keep buying Neutrogena SPF 110.. I&#x27;m very please &#x27;cause the price it&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li> I always put on this lotion on before I go outside.  It really is nice and smooth and I put my makeup on over it.  I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. As a survivor of melanoma for 40 years I have tried many brands. While this one is not at the top of consumer reports list at the moment, it works very well. One of the things I love most is how it goes on and into the skin. I just attended my 50th HS reunion and people could not stop commenting on how beautiful my skin is. Drinking lots of water and good sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well, but left a layer of gunk (I don&#x27;t know how to describe it; it wasn&#x27;t oily) on your skin after several hours.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments about how young I look and that I don&#x27;t seem to age like everyone else :-)</li>
            <li> love love love this... i went on a vacation where&#x27;s its sunny and decided to give this a try.. oh how i love this product. i use it under my makeup :) doesnt make my face shiny</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. I feel like my skin has improved since using it. I easily get dark spots when my skin is in the sun and other discolorations. Since I started using this religiously that has mostly diminished. t is not super thick and strong smelling like most sunscreens and eventually rubs in. Sometimes my sister tells me that I need to rub in it more but once I do it disappears. I am on my 3rd bottle and will probably always use this.</li>
            <li> This suncreen is awsome!! It doesnt leave my face all oily like some other sunscreen (because its oil free) and it leaves my face feeling and looking young. Im 20 and with very little acne, so it looks wonderous on my skin. My family is stealjng it from me though... not that I mind. Haha, anyone know why they are stealing it?!</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen and am using it everywhere except on my face; I have something else for my face.  I like this b/c it is not greasy and is absorbed quickly.  I would recommend to anyone needing a good broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I chose this product since I needed a face sunblock that blocks the sun well. Not only that it does that, but it also brightens my face without it feeling greasy and gross. You can put on as much as you want and you can barely feel it on your face!&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly recommended product for those keeping their light complexion for all day use.</li>
            <li> If were to visit the Sun I would definitely use this product. Rich aroma, smooth texture and oil-free application are key to this product. I applied when I went to Death Valley and it did its job. I figured if it works here on one of the hottest places on Earth, it would or should work on the Sun. Hopefully someone will develop a form of travel, because I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> Just what my plastic surgeon recommended.  Goes on smoothly over moisturizer and leaves no shine.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, obsorbs nicely, feels great, I have allergies, and no sneezing or watering eyes with this, I live in a very hot climate, so I wanted to get a good spf, and this seems to be the ticket.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  If you do not want any sun on your face, this is the stuff to get.  Works great in the water.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It feels very smooth on face (not oily) and the best part is that it has no sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> Loving this one so far. I brought this along to a 10 hour hike to the summit of Mt. St. Helens. The hike was out in the open for about 80% of that hike, and the day was hot (90 degree day). This sunscreen shielded me from getting burnt to a charcoal while being out in the sun in the open mountains. I actually ended up using it not just on my face, but on my arms/shoulders as well.&lt;br /&gt;And I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like most other sunscreens. The smell is a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> perfect on my extra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Like a jerk I ordered 4 of these because it&#x27;s so hard to find a sunblock that&#x27;s fragrance free. I can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s reviews that claim that it does not  leave a white film on your face, because of EXACTLY what it does!  Had to wash it off immediately and couldn&#x27;t even think of going out with it on. Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> or just want to keep the sun off your face, this stuff is great. It sinks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily like most sunscreens. The smell isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34;-pun intended. Perfect for wearing under your makeup-which has always been a problem for me. It also has not caused one pimple.</li>
            <li> Since I have gotten older I find I have to really be careful when I got outside because of the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  My dermatologist recommended I use Neutrogena sunscreen so I first went to a local store and bought some.  Then when I needed some more, I remembered Amazon.com so I looked to see what it had to offer.  I found I could get it cheaper and have it delivered to my house within a matter of days.  As much as it cost, I try to save when I can.  When I order it from Amazon, I save time, gas and on the cost of the sunscreen so I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> oil free &amp; shine free product for golfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son play golf everyday.he has oily skin that can cause pimple easy ,but oil free sunscreen helped out his skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen always keeps my face from getting sunburnt and I do not have bad breakouts after.</li>
            <li> it makes my face itchy</li>
            <li> This sunscreen didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I have sensive skin and it makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Feels great! No breakouts, redness or itchiness​ from this product. Highly recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It stings around my eyes, so I ended up crying to wash it out.  But I still like it because of non-greasy product compared to other sun-screams.  Also, it seems working as a water proof because I can&#x27;t wash a spot that stained with this sun-scream with only water.</li>
            <li> I love it! this is my 2nd time ordering and the best product I have bought from Amazon. it leave my face so soft!</li>
            <li> Works great.  This product is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> best facial moisturizer I have used</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not leave any white residue.  It absorbes quickly.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and I use it daily.  If I am working in the yard for more than a couple of hours, I apply it a second time for complete coverage.  So far, this product has worked the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well against the sun&#x27;s rays, wear hat/cap to keep direct rays away from facial/neck skin.</li>
            <li> You can feel that this sun screen is going to protect you.  its 110 SPF... its like you&#x27;re protected from a nuke sun screen powerful.  Only downside is it makes you look like casper... also... it kinda flakes on the sides of your hair if it gets on there.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and in the country where I live the UV radiation is too high. I have always been using Bioderma&#x27;s sunblock with Spf 50+ and I was really surprised when I found about this product with Spf 110. The product&#x27;s description says, the sunscreen is not oily and not perfumed. I decided to try this product instead of the ones I have been using, because I really hate when my skin is oily because of the sunscreen. When I started using it on the first day, my first impressions were, the cream was so oily and uncomfortable on my skin and it smells like typical beach sunscreen. I didn&#x27;t like it. However after using it for more days, the smell didn&#x27;t irritate me so much and my skin wasn&#x27;t oily at all. I have never had so perfect skin as now when using this sunscreen. And I have also experienced the awesome cooling effect of the skin, when I go out during a very hot sunny day with the temperature up to 36C, I don&#x27;t even feel any heat on my skin, because this sunscreen somehow keeps my skin cool.</li>
            <li> I have *very* fair skin that burns quickly - there is sadly no tanning, I just go from white to bright red. I bought this in preparation for a trip to Belize as I remembered how SPF 50 sunscreen was lacking the last time I was on vacation. The SPF levels did not let me down and my face went completely unburned despite snorkeling, swimming, and sweating. You do have to reapply in these cases but it did its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, for daily use, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate. Most sunscreens leave this gritty, greasy feeling but this one did not. I was worried at first because it went on thick but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy nor did I break out as a result of use. As for scent, I didn&#x27;t notice any so no complaints there either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Ok, ranking lotions and sunscreens isn&#x27;t what I usually do, but after reading a lot of reviews on Amazon, I settled on this product. Even though I live in the Southwest, I&#x27;ve been slow to get on the sunscreen band-wagon. But, I&#x27;m spending more time outside -- exercising  :&gt;  -- and we haven&#x27;t seen a real cloud here in New Mexico in quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 52-year-old male, and as I read the various reviews on Amazon--of this and comparable products--I pictured them being written by younger women, all with good skin. What sold me were two reviews: One written by an 80+ year old woman who says she has used the product for years, and one by someone who says it doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes. For whatever reason, my eyes are sensitive to most lotions (they burn), so I&#x27;ve avoided using sunscreen on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that stated, this is a good product and one I will stick with for now. As others have noted, the lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. If I put too much on at one time, there are white &#x27;streaks,&#x27; but I found that two applications, using less lotion, tackles this. There is a slight &#x27;suntan product&#x27; odor, but it&#x27;s not strong and I&#x27;m sure no one can smell it but me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, let&#x27;s hope it achieves its ultimate goal, which is reducing the likelihood I&#x27;ll get burned--or worse, skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Excellent, non-greasy, does&#x27;t leave white residue and effective as a sunblock.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for a trip to Hawaii to summit Mauna Loa. It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all. But... it simply doesn&#x27;t work. This is Broad Spectrum SPF 110. I applied and reapplied as directed and still got a sunburn. I made the choice to switch to Coppertone Faces SPF 30 and it worked considerably better. Overall, I cannot recommend this at all. It&#x27;s ineffective and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Finally, no greasy face! I have been on the hunt for a sunscreen face cream that isn&#x27;t greasy. This has a nice smooth feel. It does go on white like others are saying but just keep blending. I like the way it feels, not too drying, not too greasy. Def try it!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy - I wear it EVERYDAY even in winter. Its totally fine under make up. Sometimes I put too much on and it leaves white streaks but that is operator error with over application. It dries very quickly so if you look in the mirror you can catch it and with your finger quickly even the application out. I use it on my face, neck, decolletage and back of my hands - as I&#x27;m outside for up to four hours everyday and its essential to have adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. Use it for long bike rides in the sun. Not greasy and protects well!</li>
            <li> Really nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the few sunscreens that allows you to blend in your makeup afterwards - totally flawlessly.  So although the product does make your skin go a bit white, that really does not matter if you can totally blend makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a lot of sunscreens you really cannot blend makeup over it properly - if it is a matt sunscrreen you can&#x27;t blend and if it is too oily it does not mix properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product because I am well aware that it is the UVA rays that are so damaging to your skin and thihs product seems to specialise in this area.  Practically all other sun screens say very little at al about the strength of their UVA shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First class product which I wish was sold in UK where I live!</li>
            <li> This product mix with Lots of water.</li>
            <li> Great brand. Really protects~!</li>
            <li> Have been using it got about 2 months and recommend it. Non greasy and broad sun protection. Really thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all.  It can serve the overall protection purpose.  Highly recommended as it is value for money.</li>
            <li> been using it for years, slightly better price online. smooth, non-greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> age: 50s&lt;br /&gt;skin type: very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a relatively large tube of sunscreen. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial sunscreen that&#x27;s more than a SPF 30. I made the mistake of applying too much the first time I used it (more than a quarter sized) and liked never to rub all of that thick white cream into my skin! The next time I used about a nickel size and applied it to my face, and then a little more to my throat and chest. That time it was easier to run in. It does feel a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; at first, but soon sinks into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I expected stinging and burning but the only time I felt any of that was when I applied it too thick, and too near my eyes. Other than that, I forget I have it on and that&#x27;s my clue that it&#x27;s a good sunscreen for me. It has a &amp;#34;beachy scent,&amp;#34; which I both like and am on the fence about, but it is pleasant and dissipates quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident with this sunscreen having a high SPF, for the mountain summer has been bright this year, and I make trips to Louisiana and Texas, where the sun is brutal. I am also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive facial skin. I applied foundation over it and it worked fine together. I previously used another sunscreen by another company, which I loved, but this Neutrogena is much less expensive. This tube should last me a while, and when I&#x27;m finished with it, I&#x27;ll likely re-purchase it or a comparable Neutrogena sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena and their oil free products! I camp and fish a lot (always on the water)....this has been a great product this year! Lightweight and no breakouts! Blends in smooth.  LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but it leaves my face feeling so greasy that I need to wash it off every time I&#x27;ve attempted to use it, especially if I need to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> good product except it leaves your face with a white tint to it that people will notice.it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I had a melanoma, but some people more conscientious mean not like that pale look it gives you. it definitely works as it should and does a great job protecting your face.</li>
            <li> Strong Fragrance. Should Be Fragrance Free</li>
            <li> Not greasy and really protects from the sun. I missed a spot and the difference was very obvious.</li>
            <li> It works fantastically!</li>
            <li> THUMBS UP ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE WITH SEVERE PHOTOSENSATIVITY AND LIVE IN HI...LOVE THE SUN BUT MUST AVOID SO THIS PRODUCT IS ESSENTIAL.  IT IS DOING THE JOB SO I CAN STILL ENJOY SOME TIME IN THE POOL.</li>
            <li> Usually an spf this high would leave my face with a white cast. No so with this brand. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years...it is the only noe that really works on my &amp;#34;Irish&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED SOONER THAN EXPECTED GREAT SERVICE ...I WOULD ORDER AGAIN ! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I prefere the Neutrogena Sport for the face, this one leaves white sediments on everything.</li>
            <li> greasy.Didn&#x27;t expect it t be so greasy and shiny. Felt compelled throughout the day to wipe it off my face. I could feel it, not lightweight at all. Feels more like sunblock than a lotion with sunblock.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs better and faster than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used and is truly non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I have white spots on my upper arms, which a dermatologist simply described as absence of color, because the color cells were too tired to make pigment.  These white spots will turn pink if I am out in the sun or simply driving in my car, unless I use spf 110.  My current dermatologist has approved this product, and I certainly will be using it for life.  I use a lesser spf on my face, 85, but I also use a number of Lumene products that help to protect it.  The only reason I would change this product for another is that the spf would be higher in the new product.  I do not notice any scent, and it is easily absorbed.  It also can be removed from clothing quite easily.  I have had a great deal of difficulty finding this product on store shelves, and I much prefer to order it from Amazon.com, because it is always available.  I have this on the automatic reorder plan, so I will have a supply on hand.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Lo compre para usarlo en mi rostro y a pesar que es en crema, se absorbe por completo y no deja sensación grasosa. Puedes aplicarte una crema previamente y luego colocarte el protector sin problema alguno.&lt;br /&gt;De olor suave y agradable, no dela grumos.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend.  Good price, fast shipping.  It has a heavy consistency and takes a few minutes to soak in, but I ride motorcycle and have never gotten a sunburn.</li>
            <li> No-one likes greasy sticky sunscreen on their face and this is just wonderful.  You put it on and there&#x27;s no greasy feeling.  As a matter of fact I thought I started noticing a change in the look of my skin. I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> Cant use it as often as I should, the smell makes me nauseous. But other than that its ok I guess.</li>
            <li> I hate sun screen. I have to use it however. Most of them make eyes water and sting. This does not. So I will use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a non-greasy face sunscreen, and I think I will be sticking with this. It&#x27;s not greasy at all! Goes on really easily with very good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have never had any reaction to this product and have been using it for over a month</li>
            <li> I love that this is a high SPF and is non-greasy.  I rub it on in the morning as part of my skin care regiment and it absorbs quickly and evenly.  No breakouts from this product, despite the fact that is is thick.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> What is about expire ?</li>
            <li> I live in one of the hottest places in the country and this sunscreen has saved my life more than once.</li>
