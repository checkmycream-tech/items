    <ol>
            <li>BEST!!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ecstatic because Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner is one of the best toner/ pore minimizing product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It was very good to use in Summer !</li>
            <li>I am very happy that they sell this at amazon with prime instead waiting for a month to receive it.</li>

            <li>Great on the skin, reduces pores.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>I have a Korean skincare regimen and I heard great things about this toner</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this freshener and I am so happy Amazon have this!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t see any pore minimizing effect, BUT!</li>
            <li>good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>So good.</li>
            <li>2 pumps, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>What I found though, is that it is somewhat of a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and the pump helps easier application.</li>
            <li>Also very refreshing packaging</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone and on its own isn&#x27;t magical but with a good routine has great benefits.</li>
            <li>The ingenious no-waste pump is great.  </li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>soooooo glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found a seller on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is in it,but my face feels amazing just after one day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how it moisturize  my skin...</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>but as a toner, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is just amazing..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a toner this effective at cleaning pores.</li>
            <li>It does not &amp;#34;minimize&amp;#34; pores like it claims, but it is a nice toner.</li>
            <li>When you use this it has a nice sensation when you wipe it on.</li>
            <li>I m loving it.</li>
            <li>It is nice toner given the price.</li>
            <li>The packaging and the cotton pads it came with was nice and all</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because it had so many good reviews</li>
            <li>the product itself is very good, it really is the Wonder Woman for your pores ^^</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with my purchase and I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li>I just love it ! :) :)</li>
            <li>I love this toner and it&#x27;s very huge</li>
            <li>Plus, the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products before (proactive, neutrogena...), and none of them work for me.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 500ml it came in cute packaging with a box of cotton pads.</li>
            <li>I love the fact these come with cotton pads and the pump style of the bottle</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>and I never fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a push top dispenser.</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase this product, it was great!</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>And cheap !</li>
            <li>I have 2 Weeks using this toner and love it.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had anything wonderful happen to my face since using this toner, and I actually get better results from another toner I use by Innesfree.</li>
            <li>Cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is the 10 in 1 which i guess is better.</li>
            <li>already i love it</li>
            <li>I like it, it makes my face feel better.</li>
            <li>and I love the pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied w/the product.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself and the dispenser is to die for, but when I got it in the mail some of it spilled and I lost like 40mL</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I feel it working on my pores sometimes and my pores have gotten consistently better since I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li>I always feel much more refreshed and my face feels cleaner after I use this.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal!</li>
            <li>Really great product, often times I&#x27;ll find that something (be it a face wash, toner, mask, or anything) will work for a very finite amount of time before my skin acclimates to it</li>
            <li>and it still works like a charm in clearing my skin and leaving it smooth before bedtime!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I got a hang of this product in 500ml version.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, don&#x27;t know how i lived without it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I shared some of this product with my mother, and she too, was pleased with the pore minimizing results.</li>
            <li>Still, it couldn&#x27;t get rid of those stubborn leftover eyeliner but removed of most of it.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up, and has better skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>so it compensates by trying to make more oil??</li>
            <li>I do love the packaging</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to trying more products by Etude.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing even after the first try!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my face which is good because stronger products tend to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>when you just start using it it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived!</li>
            <li>this toner is so far the best i ever tried, leaves my pores clean and my face smooth,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad others have had great success with it though, but some people just breakout with certain products</li>
            <li>The 500ml bottle is huge in one hand, and has a top pump beneath the snap cap.  </li>
            <li>This is a good value toner that was delivered very promptly.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because of all the good reviews</li>
            <li>Cool !</li>
            <li>The applicator lets you easily get it on a cotton wipe and apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts since my skin has a tendency to break out when I try some new for skin</li>
            <li>I am quite content after receiving this product in the mail so quickly and even more content with the results.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge too and it comes with a package of cotton pads.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and the pump prevents from over using and spills.</li>
            <li>It truly does what it claims to do; it minimize my huge pores</li>
            <li>It also came with two free samples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also left my skin in great condition.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, will repurchase.</li>
            <li>Defenitly worth the money :)</li>
            <li>It comes with free cotton pads.</li>
            <li>a great sample of their exfoliant glove which just may be my next purchase.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent too</li>
            <li>The Wonder Pore Freshner (in addition to the TONYMOLY Egg Pore Silky Smooth Balm) has been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li>Very nice makes pores look smaller</li>
            <li>I needed a toner that was light but could still make my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>After one week of using, I saw a significant change on my face.</li>
            <li>Fresh !</li>
            <li>After integrating it into my routine THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ACNE.</li>
            <li>The 500ml is absolutely huge, and it has this really nice pump top so you can just press down with a cotton pad on the top</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel refreshed and amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>but it makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and refreshed after each application.</li>
            <li>It does clean off some of the residual make-up/dirt that my face wash didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>Product is much larger than I thought it would be and even came with cotton pads which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple and smells good.</li>
            <li>I must say I regret not buying this while I was there because this is such a good product.</li>
            <li>:) THANKS.</li>
            <li>I really want to love this toner, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample size of this toner before buying the full bottle</li>
            <li>but once again, it did not do much except make my skin produce more oil.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It  leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>But I do like this product because it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The whole wonder pore line works great together, and i would definitely re-buy it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels refreshing going on and has made my skin look better overall.</li>
            <li>But once again the product itself is rave worthy.</li>
            <li>Very nice, cooling, soothing toner to tighten you pores and remove excess cleansers, exfoliaters or other products, before moisturizing</li>
            <li>This product made my face tingle from the very first use.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle :) The refill bottle lasted me over a year!</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this toner!!</li>
            <li>Def love it so far!</li>
            <li>First of all, the product came in by itself!</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all!</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t used my Mario Badesco facial spray since.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so fresh for my face when I use it.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toner</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>for cute packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 5 days so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it seems to be okay</li>
            <li>Really cleans out the left over makeup and feels refreshing!</li>
            <li>It feels so nice and moisturizing and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>okay, that&#x27;s why its a little bit more higher price.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it lasts super long</li>
            <li>It is very gentle with my skin, and i use it twice a day, when i wakeup, and at night when i remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first how big it was but</li>
            <li>but my skin is much softer!</li>
            <li>I was on my first bottle</li>
            <li>I just really like it and recommend it!</li>
            <li>I use this freshner as a makeup remover also and omg i absolutely love it, it removes like 90% of my makeup instantly</li>
            <li>first of al,l I</li>
            <li>but this product didn&#x27;t at first try.  </li>
            <li>and it made me pretty upset.</li>
            <li>Plus I like the larger size&#x27;s application style way better.</li>
            <li>It reallu helps minimize my pores and makes my skin feel very refreshed!</li>
            <li>Love using it as a facial spray</li>
            <li>Oh and if you have oily skin you should really give it a try!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I just started getting into Korean skin care and adding this to my regiment made a very noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the bigger size!</li>
            <li>Despite the heavy alcohol smell (which could be pretty good for oily skin?</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also not minimizing my pores, AND it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty.</li>
            <li>have asked many products at the same time and is the first that I heard</li>
            <li>I feel pretty pain like burning.</li>
            <li>I really love the product and have just purchased the bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>and it came with a full size box of Korean style cotton pads which are very soft and don&#x27;t leave any residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>After use it, my face feel really soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It came reaaally fast and it helped my skin very much.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent product!</li>
            <li>i just love this product and as long as theyre selling it</li>
            <li>I refreshes your skin and leaves it super clean ready for the next step.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and will be purchasing it for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It also, oddly, smells just like my rose water witch hazel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like for real I have pretty much tried all the toners from target and walmart.</li>
            <li>I am pretty noob when it comes to make-up and skincare, I never really experiment or use many products.</li>
            <li>and it does have a slight cooling sensation which is nice.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect your skin to change overnight nor a huge difference but for me, where I&#x27;ve struggled with horrible oily skin and huge marks, I feel like this makes a great difference!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if I got a genuine product, so I really cannot determine whether or not the product actually works.  </li>
            <li>I have huge pores on my nose and after several uses, I do not see any difference nor any reduce in sebum.</li>
            <li>Like this one and a very generous portion for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing too much</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gentle cleansing toner to pick up any residuals that your cleanser and water missed (around the edges of face).&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>Was hoping this would be my HG toner, but this wasn&#x27;t really a stand out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger size because I love to use this everyday and don&#x27;t plan on stopping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any changes to my pore</li>
            <li>Keeps you from using too much.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this freshener really does its job by absorbing the oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Really cleans your face and minimizes your pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have visible pores</li>
            <li>Didnt do much of my pores after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it really works for my pores</li>
            <li>I notice that after using this product I didn&#x27;t have as much breakouts as before.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have combo skin with a very oily t-zone.   </li>
            <li>I think it is because it strips my skin of too much moisture</li>
            <li>My face feels very refreshed after using it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much for pores.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t really like the smell at all.</li>
            <li>I cleanse my skin first, then I get one of the cotton pads nice and damp and just swipe it over any area on my skin that usually has visible pores or breakouts.</li>
            <li>Effective w/o being too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel nice and tight!</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling clean and supple.</li>
            <li>Love it helps a lot with keeping my face from being too oily and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or break me out considering I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is for that</li>
            <li>Even though it has alcohol as an ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the average toner, it&#x27;s much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Wow, this toner makes my skin feel awesome and not super dry like almost every American toner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I also love the press down pump-</li>
            <li>Every time I use this toner, I notice that my t-zone actually gets more oily than if I use a different toner.</li>
            <li>It works really well so far!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not use this item (try looking for a toner with no alcohol or use plain rose water).   </li>
            <li>I had some noticeablly large pores on my cheeks and after only a couple days they already went down in size to where you would have to look pretty close to be able to see my pores.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t stopped looking for my all-time favorite facial mist (I have the Innisfree Green Tea one on the way), but my skin definitely loves it more than the MD spray.</li>
            <li>Instead of you pouring it out, you just place a cotton pad on top and press down for some!</li>
            <li>but I do like its gentle for my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>I will probably continue use because my chin and nose look better and they&#x27;re usually trouble areas for enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>Since I purchased the 500ml bottle, I experimented a little and found a new use – one that I love.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new part of my morning ritual.</li>
            <li>But this time, I decided to try this new toner that my mom recommended, along with some new foam cleanser and face cream..</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
            <li>but not sure if it still working now since i have been using it for more than 6months</li>
            <li>its pretty big</li>
            <li>But as a customer if the 500ml is to big as a first try then just try 250ml even though it doesn&#x27;t have a pump.</li>
            <li>At first I ordered the smaller product</li>
            <li>it leaves the skin really soft !</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and I know it will last me a  really long time.</li>
            <li>dried out my face a tiny bit at first, but I&#x27;ve been using a moisturizer afterwards and everything is fine.</li>
            <li>I have a combination face with notorious pores known for being large and hard to smooth with products.  </li>
            <li>It certainly has and I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week!</li>
            <li>Not only is it gentle on my sensitive skin, but it moisturizes my skin AND keeps my oil under control.</li>
            <li>its just clear liquid used.....  </li>
            <li>My face would clear up faster, blemishes I would get were milder and it helped me get clear</li>
            <li>I have bought 2 of these so far.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can use this both day and night.</li>
            <li>My pores really got smaller because of it.</li>
            <li>(balance your skin&#x27;s natural pH range of 4 to 7),&lt;br /&gt;  3.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>Get rid of my make up completely.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for all sensitive skin type</li>
            <li>This is like clouds and soft pillows to your skin.</li>
            <li>After washing my face, I pump 2-3 times using a cotton pad and wipe my whole entire face.</li>
            <li>Pores looked smaller for a while but pores didn&#x27;t change so much.</li>
            <li>I am amazed how it completely cleans my skin, even after I have washed my face.  </li>
            <li>After trying this for almost two weeks, I realized that I prefer using my regular Thayer&#x27;s rose petal witch hazel after cleansing over EH&#x27;s Wonder Pore Freshner, but this product wasn&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tight but very soft after using this but after about an hour or so my nose starts to get super oily again.</li>
            <li>and I think this would last several months/a year since it is very large.</li>
            <li>But seriously, seeing that many people saying good things about this toner makes me wonder if I got a fake??</li>
            <li>My pores are no longer visible, while they were visible and full of black dirt before.</li>
            <li>Bought the smaller one and came back to buy this when the first one ran out.</li>
            <li>but it was a decent price for a toner big bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that drying at all), it cleans my face pretty well.  </li>
            <li>At least now I&#x27;ve learn to always buy a smaller size of a new product to try it first instead of jumping right into it...</li>
            <li>Your pores only look slightly smaller right after using the toner but the effect doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was the 10 in 1, not the 7 in 1, which was a relief for me because the new formulation is definitely superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also depends on the day you opened it, but usually Korean Toners its usually about 3 years (36 months) before opening the product and after opening, it’s good to use it within 1 year (12 months).</li>
            <li>at first i thought it was a little too much strong for my face, but after using it for a few days my skin started to feel soft and my pores looked smaller, i will totally buy again.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;ve seen any dramatic, amazing effects after using it for the last month</li>
            <li>I use this right after my cleansing routine BEFORE applying any other facial products.</li>
            <li>Good item, don&#x27;t feel my skin nor pores better but at least it doesn&#x27;t feel that bad.</li>
            <li>I always have a bottle a facial mist near me, whether at home or on the go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old and have been using this daily.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but didn&#x27;t do what I expected.</li>
            <li>Came much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say if you have sensitive skin you should see if you can try this out somewhere before buying.</li>
            <li>Did not make my skin better or worse.  </li>
            <li>Plus it lasted me almost 6 months before buying a new one, in my opinion it would last longer for me if I only used 2 pumps every use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>Over a short period of time my pores became noticeably smaller (I was surprised).</li>
            <li>2 pumps nightly on a cotton ball - leaves my skin feeling refreshed and not dry or taut.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, dry skin, so I was worried about this product helping clear my acne but drying my skin out, due to its high alcohol levels.</li>
            <li>, if you stop using this for a couple days they will start to expand a bit again, but still smaller than when I started, and using it everyday is a small price to pay for better skin tone and pores.</li>

            <li> good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> So good.</li>
            <li> 2 pumps, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> What I found though, is that it is somewhat of a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and the pump helps easier application.</li>
            <li> Also very refreshing packaging</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone and on its own isn&#x27;t magical but with a good routine has great benefits.</li>
            <li> The ingenious no-waste pump is great.  </li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> soooooo glad I found this product!</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how it moisturize  my skin...</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> but as a toner, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a toner this effective at cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;minimize&amp;#34; pores like it claims, but it is a nice toner.</li>
            <li> When you use this it has a nice sensation when you wipe it on.</li>
            <li> I m loving it.</li>
            <li> It is nice toner given the price.</li>
            <li> The packaging and the cotton pads it came with was nice and all</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it had so many good reviews</li>
            <li> the product itself is very good, it really is the Wonder Woman for your pores ^^</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with my purchase and I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li> I just love it ! :) :)</li>
            <li> I love this toner and it&#x27;s very huge</li>
            <li> Plus, the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products before (proactive, neutrogena...), and none of them work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 500ml it came in cute packaging with a box of cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I love the fact these come with cotton pads and the pump style of the bottle</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> and I never fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a push top dispenser.</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase this product, it was great!</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> And cheap !</li>
            <li> I have 2 Weeks using this toner and love it.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had anything wonderful happen to my face since using this toner, and I actually get better results from another toner I use by Innesfree.</li>
            <li> Cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is the 10 in 1 which i guess is better.</li>
            <li> already i love it</li>
            <li> I like it, it makes my face feel better.</li>
            <li> and I love the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied w/the product.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself and the dispenser is to die for, but when I got it in the mail some of it spilled and I lost like 40mL</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I feel it working on my pores sometimes and my pores have gotten consistently better since I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> I always feel much more refreshed and my face feels cleaner after I use this.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Really great product, often times I&#x27;ll find that something (be it a face wash, toner, mask, or anything) will work for a very finite amount of time before my skin acclimates to it</li>
            <li> and it still works like a charm in clearing my skin and leaving it smooth before bedtime!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I got a hang of this product in 500ml version.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, don&#x27;t know how i lived without it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I shared some of this product with my mother, and she too, was pleased with the pore minimizing results.</li>
            <li> Still, it couldn&#x27;t get rid of those stubborn leftover eyeliner but removed of most of it.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up, and has better skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> so it compensates by trying to make more oil??</li>
            <li> I do love the packaging</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying more products by Etude.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing even after the first try!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my face which is good because stronger products tend to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> when you just start using it it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived!</li>
            <li> this toner is so far the best i ever tried, leaves my pores clean and my face smooth,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad others have had great success with it though, but some people just breakout with certain products</li>
            <li> The 500ml bottle is huge in one hand, and has a top pump beneath the snap cap.  </li>
            <li> This is a good value toner that was delivered very promptly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because of all the good reviews</li>
            <li> Cool !</li>
            <li> The applicator lets you easily get it on a cotton wipe and apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts since my skin has a tendency to break out when I try some new for skin</li>
            <li> I am quite content after receiving this product in the mail so quickly and even more content with the results.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge too and it comes with a package of cotton pads.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and the pump prevents from over using and spills.</li>
            <li> It truly does what it claims to do; it minimize my huge pores</li>
            <li> It also came with two free samples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also left my skin in great condition.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Defenitly worth the money :)</li>
            <li> It comes with free cotton pads.</li>
            <li> a great sample of their exfoliant glove which just may be my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent too</li>
            <li> The Wonder Pore Freshner (in addition to the TONYMOLY Egg Pore Silky Smooth Balm) has been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> Very nice makes pores look smaller</li>
            <li> I needed a toner that was light but could still make my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> After one week of using, I saw a significant change on my face.</li>
            <li> Fresh !</li>
            <li> After integrating it into my routine THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ACNE.</li>
            <li> The 500ml is absolutely huge, and it has this really nice pump top so you can just press down with a cotton pad on the top</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel refreshed and amazingly clean.</li>
            <li> but it makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and refreshed after each application.</li>
            <li> It does clean off some of the residual make-up/dirt that my face wash didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Product is much larger than I thought it would be and even came with cotton pads which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple and smells good.</li>
            <li> I must say I regret not buying this while I was there because this is such a good product.</li>
            <li> :) THANKS.</li>
            <li> I really want to love this toner, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample size of this toner before buying the full bottle</li>
            <li> but once again, it did not do much except make my skin produce more oil.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It  leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> But I do like this product because it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The whole wonder pore line works great together, and i would definitely re-buy it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels refreshing going on and has made my skin look better overall.</li>
            <li> But once again the product itself is rave worthy.</li>
            <li> Very nice, cooling, soothing toner to tighten you pores and remove excess cleansers, exfoliaters or other products, before moisturizing</li>
            <li> This product made my face tingle from the very first use.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle :) The refill bottle lasted me over a year!</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this toner!!</li>
            <li> Def love it so far!</li>
            <li> First of all, the product came in by itself!</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all!</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used my Mario Badesco facial spray since.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so fresh for my face when I use it.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toner</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> for cute packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 5 days so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it seems to be okay</li>
            <li> Really cleans out the left over makeup and feels refreshing!</li>
            <li> It feels so nice and moisturizing and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> okay, that&#x27;s why its a little bit more higher price.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it lasts super long</li>
            <li> It is very gentle with my skin, and i use it twice a day, when i wakeup, and at night when i remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first how big it was but</li>
            <li> but my skin is much softer!</li>
            <li> I was on my first bottle</li>
            <li> I just really like it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this freshner as a makeup remover also and omg i absolutely love it, it removes like 90% of my makeup instantly</li>
            <li> first of al,l I</li>
            <li> but this product didn&#x27;t at first try.  </li>
            <li> and it made me pretty upset.</li>
            <li> Plus I like the larger size&#x27;s application style way better.</li>
            <li> It reallu helps minimize my pores and makes my skin feel very refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love using it as a facial spray</li>
            <li> Oh and if you have oily skin you should really give it a try!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I just started getting into Korean skin care and adding this to my regiment made a very noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the bigger size!</li>
            <li> Despite the heavy alcohol smell (which could be pretty good for oily skin?</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also not minimizing my pores, AND it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty.</li>
            <li> have asked many products at the same time and is the first that I heard</li>
            <li> I feel pretty pain like burning.</li>
            <li> I really love the product and have just purchased the bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> and it came with a full size box of Korean style cotton pads which are very soft and don&#x27;t leave any residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> After use it, my face feel really soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It came reaaally fast and it helped my skin very much.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product!</li>
            <li> i just love this product and as long as theyre selling it</li>
            <li> I refreshes your skin and leaves it super clean ready for the next step.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and will be purchasing it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It also, oddly, smells just like my rose water witch hazel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like for real I have pretty much tried all the toners from target and walmart.</li>
            <li> I am pretty noob when it comes to make-up and skincare, I never really experiment or use many products.</li>
            <li> and it does have a slight cooling sensation which is nice.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect your skin to change overnight nor a huge difference but for me, where I&#x27;ve struggled with horrible oily skin and huge marks, I feel like this makes a great difference!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if I got a genuine product, so I really cannot determine whether or not the product actually works.  </li>
            <li> I have huge pores on my nose and after several uses, I do not see any difference nor any reduce in sebum.</li>
            <li> Like this one and a very generous portion for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing too much</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gentle cleansing toner to pick up any residuals that your cleanser and water missed (around the edges of face).&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would be my HG toner, but this wasn&#x27;t really a stand out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger size because I love to use this everyday and don&#x27;t plan on stopping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any changes to my pore</li>
            <li> Keeps you from using too much.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this freshener really does its job by absorbing the oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your face and minimizes your pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have visible pores</li>
            <li> Didnt do much of my pores after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it really works for my pores</li>
            <li> I notice that after using this product I didn&#x27;t have as much breakouts as before.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have combo skin with a very oily t-zone.   </li>
            <li> I think it is because it strips my skin of too much moisture</li>
            <li> My face feels very refreshed after using it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much for pores.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t really like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I cleanse my skin first, then I get one of the cotton pads nice and damp and just swipe it over any area on my skin that usually has visible pores or breakouts.</li>
            <li> Effective w/o being too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel nice and tight!</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling clean and supple.</li>
            <li> Love it helps a lot with keeping my face from being too oily and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or break me out considering I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is for that</li>
            <li> Even though it has alcohol as an ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the average toner, it&#x27;s much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Wow, this toner makes my skin feel awesome and not super dry like almost every American toner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I also love the press down pump-</li>
            <li> Every time I use this toner, I notice that my t-zone actually gets more oily than if I use a different toner.</li>
            <li> It works really well so far!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do not use this item (try looking for a toner with no alcohol or use plain rose water).   </li>
            <li> I had some noticeablly large pores on my cheeks and after only a couple days they already went down in size to where you would have to look pretty close to be able to see my pores.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t stopped looking for my all-time favorite facial mist (I have the Innisfree Green Tea one on the way), but my skin definitely loves it more than the MD spray.</li>
            <li> Instead of you pouring it out, you just place a cotton pad on top and press down for some!</li>
            <li> but I do like its gentle for my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I will probably continue use because my chin and nose look better and they&#x27;re usually trouble areas for enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased the 500ml bottle, I experimented a little and found a new use – one that I love.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new part of my morning ritual.</li>
            <li> But this time, I decided to try this new toner that my mom recommended, along with some new foam cleanser and face cream..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
            <li> but not sure if it still working now since i have been using it for more than 6months</li>
            <li> its pretty big</li>
            <li> But as a customer if the 500ml is to big as a first try then just try 250ml even though it doesn&#x27;t have a pump.</li>
            <li> At first I ordered the smaller product</li>
            <li> it leaves the skin really soft !</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and I know it will last me a  really long time.</li>
            <li> dried out my face a tiny bit at first, but I&#x27;ve been using a moisturizer afterwards and everything is fine.</li>
            <li> I have a combination face with notorious pores known for being large and hard to smooth with products.  </li>
            <li> It certainly has and I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week!</li>
            <li> Not only is it gentle on my sensitive skin, but it moisturizes my skin AND keeps my oil under control.</li>
            <li> its just clear liquid used.....  </li>
            <li> My face would clear up faster, blemishes I would get were milder and it helped me get clear</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these so far.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use this both day and night.</li>
            <li> My pores really got smaller because of it.</li>
            <li> (balance your skin&#x27;s natural pH range of 4 to 7),&lt;br /&gt;  3.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Get rid of my make up completely.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for all sensitive skin type</li>
            <li> This is like clouds and soft pillows to your skin.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I pump 2-3 times using a cotton pad and wipe my whole entire face.</li>
            <li> Pores looked smaller for a while but pores didn&#x27;t change so much.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how it completely cleans my skin, even after I have washed my face.  </li>
            <li> After trying this for almost two weeks, I realized that I prefer using my regular Thayer&#x27;s rose petal witch hazel after cleansing over EH&#x27;s Wonder Pore Freshner, but this product wasn&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight but very soft after using this but after about an hour or so my nose starts to get super oily again.</li>
            <li> and I think this would last several months/a year since it is very large.</li>
            <li> But seriously, seeing that many people saying good things about this toner makes me wonder if I got a fake??</li>
            <li> My pores are no longer visible, while they were visible and full of black dirt before.</li>
            <li> Bought the smaller one and came back to buy this when the first one ran out.</li>
            <li> but it was a decent price for a toner big bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that drying at all), it cleans my face pretty well.  </li>
            <li> At least now I&#x27;ve learn to always buy a smaller size of a new product to try it first instead of jumping right into it...</li>
            <li> Your pores only look slightly smaller right after using the toner but the effect doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was the 10 in 1, not the 7 in 1, which was a relief for me because the new formulation is definitely superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also depends on the day you opened it, but usually Korean Toners its usually about 3 years (36 months) before opening the product and after opening, it’s good to use it within 1 year (12 months).</li>
            <li> at first i thought it was a little too much strong for my face, but after using it for a few days my skin started to feel soft and my pores looked smaller, i will totally buy again.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;ve seen any dramatic, amazing effects after using it for the last month</li>
            <li> I use this right after my cleansing routine BEFORE applying any other facial products.</li>
            <li> Good item, don&#x27;t feel my skin nor pores better but at least it doesn&#x27;t feel that bad.</li>
            <li> I always have a bottle a facial mist near me, whether at home or on the go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old and have been using this daily.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but didn&#x27;t do what I expected.</li>
            <li> Came much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say if you have sensitive skin you should see if you can try this out somewhere before buying.</li>
            <li> Did not make my skin better or worse.  </li>
            <li> Plus it lasted me almost 6 months before buying a new one, in my opinion it would last longer for me if I only used 2 pumps every use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> Over a short period of time my pores became noticeably smaller (I was surprised).</li>
            <li> 2 pumps nightly on a cotton ball - leaves my skin feeling refreshed and not dry or taut.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, dry skin, so I was worried about this product helping clear my acne but drying my skin out, due to its high alcohol levels.</li>
            <li> , if you stop using this for a couple days they will start to expand a bit again, but still smaller than when I started, and using it everyday is a small price to pay for better skin tone and pores.</li>
            <li> Pores on the sides of my nose on my cheeks have shrunk a significant amount and pores on my nose are a little smaller but its kinda hard to tell as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> not sure if this really helps with my pores or not...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really big and and you can keep it for a long time</li>
            <li> and I know how to deal with it, my skin normally recovers in about few hours for an allergic reaction after put some medicine on.</li>
            <li> And then I had an allergic reaction, red bumps all over my face for a very long time.</li>
            <li> my pores have shrunk, my face is less oily, and I feel cleaner and fresher, all within the first few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use twice a day and it does not dry out the skin like other products</li>
            <li> My order from seoulglamour arrived a week earlier than expected</li>
            <li> The toner is a lot bigger than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The seller corrected me and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m wrong!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now but not consistently.</li>
            <li> Wait about 5 minutes for the toner to penetrate and dry.</li>
            <li> It is like an astringent but doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin.</li>
            <li> After two uses, my skin was totally even surfaced and the tiny lil bumps I have been trying to get rid of for a few weeks all disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It cleans up any residual left on your face but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> Ive notice my pores are a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> No obvious change to the big pores around my nose, maybe it is a little bit smaller but hard to say.</li>
            <li> this big bottle will probably last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> but if it does it&#x27;s not much</li>
            <li> so I tried that, but I REALLY do not like the feeling when I put it on.</li>
            <li> of my emphasis goes towards how much smaller and less noticeable my pores look!  </li>
            <li> The slight redness on my cheeks that accompanied the larger pores went down as well.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> and it does NOT irritate my skin like other toners.  </li>
            <li> (i use the other wonder pore products to finish the job).</li>
            <li> I have yet to see the oil controlling benefits, but in due time, I hope it will do as it promises.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it makes any difference in pore size, but definitely balances my skin.</li>
            <li> I was convinced to buy this item because other comments were raving about it.  </li>
            <li> I use this a few times throughout the day to get rid of excess oil on my T-zone and re-hydrate the dry areas</li>
            <li> That being said it has dramatically decreased my pore size, and the frequency of my breaks outs, my skin is brighter and this toner seems to help my skin absorb my facial creams thus allowing my skin to be less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> My skin has always had this redness to it and the toner toned it down a lot.</li>
            <li> My blemishes also have gone down a lot too.</li>
            <li> You just have to push down on the applicator, and the product comes out.</li>
            <li> and my face has become less oily</li>
            <li> I must say that some people said that it does not work but wait until you use half of you</li>
            <li> less abrasive than the Lancome toner</li>
            <li> It reduces pores the first month , but later I feel like there is no effect anymore :(</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week and half</li>
            <li> I started using it last year when I was having some serious break out issues.</li>
            <li> and it will saturate it without making a mess.</li>
            <li> It hydrates well too because it banishes that tight skin feeling I sometimes get after washing my face in the winter.</li>
            <li> After swiping, if you look down at the cotton pad, you can see little black flecks and dirt that just got dissolved out of your pores!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I poured some of Wonder Pore Freshner into a little travel-sized spray bottle and started using it when I needed a moisture boost throughout the day (with or without makeup).</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin was a little brighter and</li>
            <li> (well when the product came, it was a little dented..)</li>
            <li> I use this after washing with the Baking Powder facewash, and it clears off any dirt that my have been left behind.</li>
            <li> I use cotton pads as opposed to cotton balls, so I don&#x27;t waste.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday</li>
            <li> My skin felt very irritated and like it was suffocating!</li>
            <li> Usually after using a toner, my skin will feel tight, but this one leaves my skin feeling moist.</li>
            <li> , it is always there, but not strong to get irritated.  </li>
            <li> It came in a small box</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would actually visually minimize my pores...</li>
            <li> so the fact that it was just a bottle in a plastic bag seems really shady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if is what I need.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of any changes but I will continue to use them to see results.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this happens to anyone else</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This toner along with Mentholatum&#x27;s Acne Powder lotion (only when I&#x27;m having really bad acne) are two of my holy grail products.</li>
            <li> but it is not good for my skin at all.</li>
            <li> has decreased the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> but it makes it worse for me.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s basically useless, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for around three months</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I decided to pass on this product because I didn’t see the hype in this.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about the scent but</li>
            <li> (maybe I just have weird skin!).</li>
            <li> It got here in about 4 days which I didn&#x27;t think was bad</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> It smells like alcohol to me :(</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use those stupid pore strips because of this!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After one week of using, I saw a significant change on my face. My pores got smaller, and some disappeared. I wipe my face with this twice a day (one in morning, and before go to bed). I&#x27;ve tried so many products before (proactive, neutrogena...), and none of them work for me. I finally found what I am looking for. Just one bottle and that&#x27;s all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> when you just start using it it works pretty good. but not sure if it still working now since i have been using it for more than 6months</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived! It came in a small box so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first how big it was but its pretty big and it does last a while. It also came with two free samples.</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly! I ordered the 500ml it came in cute packaging with a box of cotton pads. I have acne prone, dry skin, so I was worried about this product helping clear my acne but drying my skin out, due to its high alcohol levels. That being said it has dramatically decreased my pore size, and the frequency of my breaks outs, my skin is brighter and this toner seems to help my skin absorb my facial creams thus allowing my skin to be less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet in pore size but my skin is much softer! Plus, it&#x27;s not drying whatsoever which to me is different from all toners I&#x27;ve ever tried! I love the fact these come with cotton pads and the pump style of the bottle is so convenient! Plus, the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my face so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It a pore clearing starters must have</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is unbelievable. So, I got the 500ml and it came with a full size box of Korean style cotton pads which are very soft and don&#x27;t leave any residue on the skin. Those are great. The 500ml is absolutely huge, and it has this really nice pump top so you can just press down with a cotton pad on the top and it will saturate it without making a mess. No turning the bottle over. The bottle I received was the 10 in 1, not the 7 in 1, which was a relief for me because the new formulation is definitely superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is magical. I cleanse my skin first, then I get one of the cotton pads nice and damp and just swipe it over any area on my skin that usually has visible pores or breakouts. After swiping, if you look down at the cotton pad, you can see little black flecks and dirt that just got dissolved out of your pores! I&#x27;ve never seen a toner this effective at cleaning pores. My pores are no longer visible, while they were visible and full of black dirt before. I no longer have to use those stupid pore strips because of this!</li>
            <li> Comes with cotton pads</li>
            <li> Bought the smaller one and came back to buy this when the first one ran out. Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> After trying this for almost two weeks, I realized that I prefer using my regular Thayer&#x27;s rose petal witch hazel after cleansing over EH&#x27;s Wonder Pore Freshner, but this product wasn&#x27;t a total waste. Since I purchased the 500ml bottle, I experimented a little and found a new use – one that I love. I always have a bottle a facial mist near me, whether at home or on the go. At the time, I had been using the Mario Badesco facial spray with herbs and rosewater. I was on my first bottle and I never fell in love with the product. (I still don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews for it.) Anyway, I poured some of Wonder Pore Freshner into a little travel-sized spray bottle and started using it when I needed a moisture boost throughout the day (with or without makeup). I honestly haven&#x27;t used my Mario Badesco facial spray since. I haven&#x27;t stopped looking for my all-time favorite facial mist (I have the Innisfree Green Tea one on the way), but my skin definitely loves it more than the MD spray.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Please read seller notes when ordering. I thought the date on the bottle meant it&#x27;s expiration not manufacturing date. The seller corrected me and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m wrong! This product is amazing even after the first try!!</li>
            <li> 2 pumps nightly on a cotton ball - leaves my skin feeling refreshed and not dry or taut. i wash my face w/ face cleanser then wipe it all over my face and proceed with the rest of my nightly routine. can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;ve seen any dramatic, amazing effects after using it for the last month but i like it. this big bottle will probably last me at least 6 months. good value for the price. would recommend!</li>
            <li> My order from seoulglamour arrived a week earlier than expected and I&#x27;m ecstatic because Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner is one of the best toner/ pore minimizing product I have ever used. I have combination skin and I find that this product truly balances out my skin&#x27;s pH and, with continued use, has decreased the size of my pores. This product has dramatically simplified my nightly skin care routine and I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product! My face looks and feels cleaner after using it and my face has become less oily which is a plus! Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Gets the remaining dirt, oil, and makeup out of my pores without over drying. It does not &amp;#34;minimize&amp;#34; pores like it claims, but it is a nice toner. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these so far.  I&#x27;m not totally sold on it not leaving residue yet, but if it does it&#x27;s not much and it does NOT irritate my skin like other toners.  I don&#x27;t use it on my forehead because I have sebaceous hyperplasia and this stuff aggravates those, but it works well on my cheeks, nose and chin.  I will probably continue use because my chin and nose look better and they&#x27;re usually trouble areas for enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use this both day and night. I love that it is a push top dispenser. The bottle is huge too and it comes with a package of cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase this product, it was great! It worked wonders on my skin. My pores really got smaller because of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for only about a week and already notice some bog improvements. My skin has always had this redness to it and the toner toned it down a lot. My blemishes also have gone down a lot too. When you use this it has a nice sensation when you wipe it on. Your skin feels so smooth and nice. I just really like it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very nice, cooling, soothing toner to tighten you pores and remove excess cleansers, exfoliaters or other products, before moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;your skin.  I like to use it after using a cleansing oil, or cleansing lotion.  On the days when I am doing a mask or exfoliating I will use&lt;br /&gt;this Wonder Pore Toner after rinsing the mask or exfoliator off.  Wait about 5 minutes for the toner to penetrate and dry. Then apply your&lt;br /&gt;day or night moisturizers etc.  Like this one and a very generous portion for a reasonable price.  Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my skin in check. Everything it says it does on the bottle...it does!</li>
            <li> It was very good to use in Summer ! Fresh ! Cool ! And cheap ! I will buy again !</li>
            <li> I started using this toner last 2014 and it makes difference. I want to tell to everyone who&#x27;s going to buy this toner that It will work overnight. I must say that some people said that it does not work but wait until you use half of you can say that there&#x27;s is a big difference. I am very happy that they sell this at amazon with prime instead waiting for a month to receive it.</li>
            <li> I use this freshner as a makeup remover also and omg i absolutely love it, it removes like 90% of my makeup instantly (i use the other wonder pore products to finish the job). It is very gentle with my skin, and i use it twice a day, when i wakeup, and at night when i remove my makeup. The whole wonder pore line works great together, and i would definitely re-buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Best product according to my GF</li>
            <li> I have oily skin. It does a good job. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. And it&#x27;s so fresh for my face when I use it. I have 2 Weeks using this toner and love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing too much but I still have a lot left</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would actually visually minimize my pores... It certainly has and I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week! It&#x27;s also left my skin in great condition. Fantastic product, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Reasonably priced;&lt;br /&gt;  2. pH &#x3D; 5 (balance your skin&#x27;s natural pH range of 4 to 7),&lt;br /&gt;  3. gentle cleansing toner to pick up any residuals that your cleanser and water missed (around the edges of face).&lt;br /&gt;Due to it&#x27;s low pH, this toner can also be use to adjust your skin&#x27;s pH immediately after cleansing prior to using acids (e.g. vitamin C, AHA, BHA) for exfoliation instead of waiting around 20 minutes or so for your skin to return to it&#x27;s nature pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none</li>
            <li> This product made my face tingle from the very first use.I don&#x27;t know what is in it,but my face feels amazing just after one day.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product. I m loving it. I use twice a day and it does not dry out the skin like other products and it&#x27;s amazing how it moisturize  my skin... Extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old and have been using this daily. I use it after removing my make-up at night before my moisturizer and also in the morning when I wake-up. I refreshes your skin and leaves it super clean ready for the next step. The bottle is huge and the pump prevents from over using and spills. My skin looks amazing. Great product.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel refreshed and amazingly clean. Cleans off residual makeup after washing my face. It also helps me not break out.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would be my HG toner, but this wasn&#x27;t really a stand out. Did not make my skin better or worse.  Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Obsessed. My skin has transformed. The best product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product.  I have dehydrated but oily skin and larger pores. Usually after using a toner, my skin will feel tight, but this one leaves my skin feeling moist. I have yet to see the oil controlling benefits, but in due time, I hope it will do as it promises.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! My blackheads are almost gone after just a couple of weeks using this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had anything wonderful happen to my face since using this toner, and I actually get better results from another toner I use by Innesfree. It also, oddly, smells just like my rose water witch hazel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> not sure if this really helps with my pores or not...but still use it daily, hopefully I will see some results soon</li>
            <li> This works!! I&#x27;m glad I bought the larger size because I love to use this everyday and don&#x27;t plan on stopping.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in my skin tone and pores after only a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;It feels refreshing going on and has made my skin look better overall. I had some noticeablly large pores on my cheeks and after only a couple days they already went down in size to where you would have to look pretty close to be able to see my pores. The slight redness on my cheeks that accompanied the larger pores went down as well.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, if you stop using this for a couple days they will start to expand a bit again, but still smaller than when I started, and using it everyday is a small price to pay for better skin tone and pores.</li>
            <li> Not only is it gentle on my sensitive skin, but it moisturizes my skin AND keeps my oil under control. This is a tall order, and Wonder Pore definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> It is nice toner given the price. Cooling and refreshing. I used it for couple months. No obvious change to the big pores around my nose, maybe it is a little bit smaller but hard to say.</li>
            <li> It is the 10 in 1 which i guess is better. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> i love it! the product was good!, i don&#x27;t know if it actually close my pore yet! but it was a decent price for a toner big bottle! is my second bottle already i love it</li>
            <li> soooooo glad I found this product! Its a lifesaver and has improved my skin a lot! This is my second bottle :) The refill bottle lasted me over a year! Defenitly worth the money :)</li>
            <li> I like it, it makes my face feel better. I don&#x27;t really notice any changes to my pore but maybe if i use it longer i will see it</li>
            <li> Love it helps a lot with keeping my face from being too oily and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or break me out considering I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> less abrasive than the Lancome toner but it gets all the leftover grime off my face should there be any. My skin has definitely been improving using this and my pores have been cleaner than ever using this. I love it and it lasts super long and I love the pump. I&#x27;m going to buy this again when I run out</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this toner!! It cleans up any residual left on your face but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight. I also love the press down pump- Keeps you from using too much.</li>
            <li> So good. I use this after washing with the Baking Powder facewash, and it clears off any dirt that my have been left behind. Feels great! Not sure if it makes any difference in pore size, but definitely balances my skin. I use cotton pads as opposed to cotton balls, so I don&#x27;t waste. 2 pumps, and you&#x27;re good to go. I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> It reduces pores the first month , but later I feel like there is no effect anymore :(</li>
            <li> Second time I bought this product so time for a review.....first of al,l I though it was a bit more expensive than last time I bought the product. But then I notice with the Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner is when I opened the box it also came with Etude House Wonder Pore Cotton Glove (suprise!!!) so I though okay, that&#x27;s why its a little bit more higher price.  So very happy!!!.....now when it comes to the product it took a while for me to notice any difference with my skin but as I keep using it I did notice my skin was a little brighter and my pores where noticeably smaller. Surprisingly I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts since my skin has a tendency to break out when I try some new for skin but this product didn&#x27;t at first try.  Plus it lasted me almost 6 months before buying a new one, in my opinion it would last longer for me if I only used 2 pumps every use but I am 3-4 pump per user. But as a customer if the 500ml is to big as a first try then just try 250ml even though it doesn&#x27;t have a pump. I would still recommend to try....also a big plus for me is that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent on it....its just clear liquid used.....  Update (10/0315): I just want to write this for anybody that has question when it comes to manufactured and expiration date like I was in the beginning......  - If you see the Korean character &amp;#34;제조,&amp;#34; then it is the Manufactured date.   - If you see the Korean character &amp;#34;까지,&amp;#34; then it is the Expiration date.  So my old empty bottle it says 제조20130514, so it was made May 14, 2013. It also depends on the day you opened it, but usually Korean Toners its usually about 3 years (36 months) before opening the product and after opening, it’s good to use it within 1 year (12 months). Hope that help on others thinking they bough an expired products when its just the manufactured date.</li>
            <li> Hebe been using this étude product for over a month and my pores look smaller and my skin has a clearer, even tone. It  leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It came reaaally fast and it helped my skin very much. It&#x27;s really big and and you can keep it for a long time</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my face in the morning and then after I shower at night before my moisturizer and it makes my skin feel nice and tight! Pores on the sides of my nose on my cheeks have shrunk a significant amount and pores on my nose are a little smaller but its kinda hard to tell as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. Def love it so far!</li>
            <li> this is my third time buying it. It&#x27;s a big bottle so it lasts for ever. Very refreshing and the pump helps easier application. It comes with free cotton pads.</li>
            <li> i got some break out after using this...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied w/the product. It came w/a great sample of their exfoliant glove which just may be my next purchase. Effective w/o being too harsh on the skin. Great value too.</li>
            <li> The toner is a lot bigger than I expected it to be. The applicator lets you easily get it on a cotton wipe and apply it to your skin. You just have to push down on the applicator, and the product comes out. It leaves a clean and refreshing feeling. But, I don&#x27;t think it has made my pores any smaller, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen smaller pores but it makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I love this toner and it&#x27;s very huge it&#x27;s gonna take a while for me to finish this product.. I would repurchase this product again. Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple and smells good. Get rid of my make up completely. I just love it ! :) :)</li>
            <li> Great toner and I&#x27;d definitely buy this again! The applicator is genius and mess-free!</li>
            <li> Im gonna buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but didn&#x27;t do what I expected. I think it actually made my pores larger and I broke out while using it. I guess I&#x27;m one of the minority that breaks out with this product. I&#x27;m glad others have had great success with it though, but some people just breakout with certain products and I guess I&#x27;m one of them.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself and the dispenser is to die for, but when I got it in the mail some of it spilled and I lost like 40mL and it made me pretty upset. But once again the product itself is rave worthy. I love it</li>
            <li> At first I ordered the smaller product but I finished and now I moved on to the larger one. I love this product! I feel it working on my pores sometimes and my pores have gotten consistently better since I&#x27;ve used this. Don&#x27;t expect your skin to change overnight nor a huge difference but for me, where I&#x27;ve struggled with horrible oily skin and huge marks, I feel like this makes a great difference! Plus I like the larger size&#x27;s application style way better. Instead of you pouring it out, you just place a cotton pad on top and press down for some! Great!</li>
            <li> This is a good value toner that was delivered very promptly. I have been using this for over a year and have no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Product is much larger than I thought it would be and even came with cotton pads which was a pleasant surprise. I&#x27;m not so crazy about the scent but the product itself is very good, it really is the Wonder Woman for your pores ^^ Also very refreshing packaging</li>
            <li> Came much quicker than I expected. It&#x27;s very gentle on my face which is good because stronger products tend to irritate my skin. I always feel much more refreshed and my face feels cleaner after I use this. It hydrates well too because it banishes that tight skin feeling I sometimes get after washing my face in the winter. I use this a few times throughout the day to get rid of excess oil on my T-zone and re-hydrate the dry areas (I have combination skin) I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toner, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This has been my yaasss I will say it. The best toner I have ever used. Like for real I have pretty much tried all the toners from target and walmart. But since discovering this while I was in Korea last summer. I have strictly been using this and my skin looks great. I think the ph balance part of it is the bomb dot com. If you ever find your self in korea but I there because there biggest bottle only cost about $10.50. Such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Really great product, often times I&#x27;ll find that something (be it a face wash, toner, mask, or anything) will work for a very finite amount of time before my skin acclimates to it and it&#x27;s basically useless, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for around three months and it still works like a charm in clearing my skin and leaving it smooth before bedtime!</li>
            <li> I think this is my 4th or 5th bottle! Can&#x27;t stop using this product! It reallu helps minimize my pores and makes my skin feel very refreshed! Love using it as a facial spray i just love this product and as long as theyre selling it I am going to.keep buying it. Oh and if you have oily skin you should really give it a try!</li>
            <li> After finishing a bottle of this product, I&#x27;m throughly convinced that it works.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and in perfect condition. I&#x27;m so glad that I got a hang of this product in 500ml version. It&#x27;s been my favourite toner ever since I started using Korean products for my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I remember walking into the Etude House store in South Korea and I would see this product everywhere and sales associate would promote this to everyone. Unfortunately I decided to pass on this product because I didn’t see the hype in this. I must say I regret not buying this while I was there because this is such a good product. I love this freshener and I am so happy Amazon have this! I have oily skin and this freshener really does its job by absorbing the oil on my face. So far I am happy with my purchase and I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Best toner!! Cleared up my zits</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toner.  After use it, my face feel really soft and clean.  I like the light scent too, it is always there, but not strong to get irritated.  I got another one on the way.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week and half and it&#x27;s great! Really cleans out the left over makeup and feels refreshing! :) THANKS.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Really cleans your face and minimizes your pores. I use this product everyday</li>
            <li> I love this product. My face feels so clean and refreshed after each application. Works well. And I definitely noticed my pores had gotten smaller. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I just started getting into Korean skin care and adding this to my regiment made a very noticeable difference! I don&#x27;t really have visible pores so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is for that but as a toner, it&#x27;s amazing. My face feels a lot softer and smoother. I&#x27;m glad I bought the bigger size!</li>
            <li> I received the 250 ml but I paid for the 500!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It feels so nice and moisturizing and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Even though it has alcohol as an ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the average toner, it&#x27;s much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have a combination face with notorious pores known for being large and hard to smooth with products.  The Wonder Pore Freshner (in addition to the TONYMOLY Egg Pore Silky Smooth Balm) has been a lifesaver.  With the toner alone, used twice a day, my pores have shrunk, my face is less oily, and I feel cleaner and fresher, all within the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my emphasis goes towards how much smaller and less noticeable my pores look!  My daily routine has not changed save for the addition of the Wonder Pore Freshner.  The 500ml bottle is huge in one hand, and has a top pump beneath the snap cap.  I absolutely love this product and will be purchasing it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Good item, don&#x27;t feel my skin nor pores better but at least it doesn&#x27;t feel that bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toner because I was also searching for a pore minimizing toner, and my friend had linked this to me.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t see any pore minimizing effect, BUT! First of all, the product came in by itself! Just the bottle! I know it&#x27;s supposed to be in a box, along with some cotton exfoliating pads...so the fact that it was just a bottle in a plastic bag seems really shady. I don&#x27;t even know if I got a genuine product, so I really cannot determine whether or not the product actually works.  Despite the heavy alcohol smell (which could be pretty good for oily skin? It&#x27;s really not that drying at all), it cleans my face pretty well.  But seriously, seeing that many people saying good things about this toner makes me wonder if I got a fake?? The seller was TheJD, even though I purchased the item on Etude House. Did anyone buy anything from them and had the same problem with the toner?  I really want to love this toner, but I just can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not THAT soothing as it claims to be (it&#x27;s supposed to be minty I think), it&#x27;s also not minimizing my pores, AND it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty. The packaging really is great though! That pump is so convenient!  But overall, if I am going to buy this toner again, I would probably only get it from Etude House...</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is like an astringent but doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin. I use this right after my cleansing routine BEFORE applying any other facial products.</li>
            <li> I would like to know what is in it. No instructions were included. I&#x27;m not sure if is what I need.</li>
            <li> I adore this toner. It serves it&#x27;s purpose with drying out my skin!</li>
            <li> Didnt do much of my pores after 2 weeks. Not drying though.</li>
            <li> Reduces my pores dramatically.  Love this product, don&#x27;t know how i lived without it.</li>
            <li> Ive notice my pores are a little bit smaller. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Great on the skin, reduces pores. I love it. I&#x27;m hooked! Definitely a new part of my morning ritual. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I am quite content after receiving this product in the mail so quickly and even more content with the results. This product left my skin feeling clean and supple. Over a short period of time my pores became noticeably smaller (I was surprised). I shared some of this product with my mother, and she too, was pleased with the pore minimizing results.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing..it leaves the skin really soft !</li>
            <li> I unfortunately regret buying this product. :-( The packaging and the cotton pads it came with was nice and all (well when the product came, it was a little dented..) but it does not do what it claims for. I have huge pores on my nose and after several uses, I do not see any difference nor any reduce in sebum. I have read in the comments that it can be used as a toner so I tried that, but I REALLY do not like the feeling when I put it on. My skin felt very irritated and like it was suffocating! What I found though, is that it is somewhat of a good makeup remover. Still, it couldn&#x27;t get rid of those stubborn leftover eyeliner but removed of most of it. I thought this product would be a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; for me after reading the reviews so I bought the 500 ml one. My excitement definitely got to me, but now six months later and there is still 75% of it left. At least now I&#x27;ve learn to always buy a smaller size of a new product to try it first instead of jumping right into it...</li>
            <li> I use this at night along with the Baking Powder Cleanser, and it seems to remove virtually any makeup I have on my face. It works really well so far!</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up, and has better skin tone. I love it. It feels refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all! If anything it soothes it. I LOVE it, will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus pts! for cute packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 5 days so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;It dried out my face a tiny bit at first, but I&#x27;ve been using a moisturizer afterwards and everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Used it for a month now.  I am not sure of any changes but I will continue to use them to see results.  I have sensitive skin and it seems to be okay so it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> It truly does what it claims to do; it minimize my huge pores</li>
            <li> I tried a sample size of this toner before buying the full bottle and I really like it. I don&#x27;t really know if it really works for my pores cuz I haven&#x27;t checked. Lol. But I do like this product because it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh. I notice that after using this product I didn&#x27;t have as much breakouts as before. The bottle is huge and I know it will last me a  really long time.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have asked many products at the same time and is the first that I heard</li>
            <li> I am pretty noob when it comes to make-up and skincare, I never really experiment or use many products. (because I dont know anything about them). I literally used to use just face wash, face lotion, mascara, done.  But this time, I decided to try this new toner that my mom recommended, along with some new foam cleanser and face cream.. After two uses, my skin was totally even surfaced and the tiny lil bumps I have been trying to get rid of for a few weeks all disappeared.  My skin feels so moisturized and even, I would recommend everyone to use this product!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for all sensitive skin type and I do not think it does its job tho. When I put this thing on face I feel pretty pain like burning. And then I had an allergic reaction, red bumps all over my face for a very long time. I had this experience before and I know how to deal with it, my skin normally recovers in about few hours for an allergic reaction after put some medicine on. It has been 2 days the bumps are 90% gone but my skin is still red and itchy. Do not risk your face!</li>
            <li> I have a Korean skincare regimen and I heard great things about this toner so I was exited to try it out. After integrating it into my routine THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ACNE. My face would clear up faster, blemishes I would get were milder and it helped me get clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone and on its own isn&#x27;t magical but with a good routine has great benefits.</li>
            <li> I was convinced to buy this item because other comments were raving about it.  But turns out I had an allergic reaction... tiny red bumps all over my face.  I would definitely say if you have sensitive skin you should see if you can try this out somewhere before buying.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great toner!  I love how my skin feels after I apply it.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I loveeee this toner! I started using it last year when I was having some serious break out issues. I needed a toner that was light but could still make my skin feel clean. Wow, this toner makes my skin feel awesome and not super dry like almost every American toner I&#x27;ve tried. This toner along with Mentholatum&#x27;s Acne Powder lotion (only when I&#x27;m having really bad acne) are two of my holy grail products. I&#x27;m so glad I found a seller on Amazon! Now I&#x27;ll never have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> This is like clouds and soft pillows to your skin. Lived the expectation and then some.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it had so many good reviews but it just does not work well with my skin type. I have combo skin with a very oily t-zone.   I have been using this product for several weeks now but not consistently. Every time I use this toner, I notice that my t-zone actually gets more oily than if I use a different toner. I think it is because it strips my skin of too much moisture so it compensates by trying to make more oil?? Not exactly sure but this is supposed to control sebum but it makes it worse for me.  I do love the packaging and I think this would last several months/a year since it is very large. After washing my face, I pump 2-3 times using a cotton pad and wipe my whole entire face. It does clean off some of the residual make-up/dirt that my face wash didn&#x27;t get. My face feels very refreshed after using it and it does have a slight cooling sensation which is nice. My skin feels tight but very soft after using this but after about an hour or so my nose starts to get super oily again. I also tried using it as a mist and sprayed it on my t-zone when it got oily but once again, it did not do much except make my skin produce more oil. I think maybe the alcohol is too drying on my face and that is why my skin produces the excess oil. I&#x27;m not sure if this happens to anyone else (maybe I just have weird skin!). If you have sensitive skin, do not use this item (try looking for a toner with no alcohol or use plain rose water).   It doesn&#x27;t really do much for pores. Your pores only look slightly smaller right after using the toner but the effect doesn&#x27;t last. Also, I don&#x27;t really like the smell at all. It smells like alcohol to me :( I regret buying the larger size because I am not going to use it anymore! I hope I can find someone to give it to. I really wanted to like this product because of all the good reviews but it is not good for my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice makes pores look smaller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much. It got here in about 4 days which I didn&#x27;t think was bad and everything was just as it was described. I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
            <li> Pores looked smaller for a while but pores didn&#x27;t change so much. Tiny bit smaller but no change over time, a continuous result. Not as hydrating as I wish but I do like its gentle for my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I just did not see the &amp;#34;7in1&amp;#34; part... Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I bought smaller bottle last year and it has last me almost a year. I use it after every face wash and can visibly see my pores are smaller and breakouts have been reduced dramatically! I really love the product and have just purchased the bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> this toner is so far the best i ever tried, leaves my pores clean and my face smooth, at first i thought it was a little too much strong for my face, but after using it for a few days my skin started to feel soft and my pores looked smaller, i will totally buy again.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.  I am amazed how it completely cleans my skin, even after I have washed my face.  My skin is smoother and my pores are actually much smaller.  The ingenious no-waste pump is great.  I am looking forward to trying more products by Etude.</li>
