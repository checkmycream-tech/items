            <li>He says it&#x27;s very good to use this.</li>
            <li>Great Product and it works.</li>
            <li>All 3 pcs work well, good quality</li>

            <li>slim and has good adhesive.</li>
            <li>Excellent for Asian eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used it for more than three years.</li>
            <li>Sure, it takes practice to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>but like all good things it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>then it will be much more invisible</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why I love it</li>
            <li>And I love these.  </li>
            <li>The BEST double eyelid tape!!!</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer here &#x27;cause it works</li>
            <li>And the price is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>The adhesive is strong and stays all day.</li>
            <li>you are looking for something better than normal eyelid tape, go get this one!!!</li>
            <li>All in all, it &#x27;s worth the investment based on how consistent you are w/ using it you nay receive better results.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite ones thus far, and I&#x27;ve used plenty others.</li>
            <li>But totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t do it right though, people can see the tape, but it isn&#x27;t too noticeable when that happens.</li>
            <li>The right product Made in Korea.</li>
            <li>It took me about a month of wearing them to get them in just the right spot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit challinging to find the right position, and mind you</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t find the right one right away every time I use these.</li>
            <li>Love how big my eyes look</li>
            <li>3 days later, the rash is still here, but it&#x27;s getting better and doesn&#x27;t sting anymore.</li>
            <li>Just be aware this could happen to you.</li>
            <li>I will give it one positive, it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just have super sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any beauty products I&#x27;ve used on my face.</li>
            <li>Use water to gently remove it from eyelid.</li>
            <li>The sticker lasts for a day without sweating too much</li>
            <li>I went for these and they really well.</li>
            <li>But if one doesn&#x27;t have that problem, it really is a way to go.</li>
            <li>Really does lift my lids.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to give these a try after reading the few available reviews.</li>
            <li>Like much better than the other brand I was using&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me about 6 tries to get it right, and I applied to clean skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wear them to help me look more awake, and make me feel like my eye-lids aren&#x27;t so heavy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have monolids and this tape really holds the double eyelid</li>
            <li>I use it very often and it stays on the entire day!</li>
            <li>But they hold really well, the whole day, even though I have extremely oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>But nothing major.</li>
            <li>I literary tired many other double eyelid tapes from different brands.</li>

            <li> Last all day long, even go swimming</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know long</li>
            <li> These are just a subtle lift, so if you are looking for something more dramatic, try the one-sided version.  </li>
            <li> A few hours later, the swelling went down, but a rash was present.</li>
            <li> Does the job, however it shows a bit(prolly due to my skin tone).</li>

            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to work - the directions are no good.</li>
            <li> I applied eyelid primer as I always do before my eye makeup, and it stung bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for Asian eyes. I have used it for more than three years. I brought a lot every time I went to China, but finally I don&#x27;t need to bring any as I found these on Amazon!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite ones thus far, and I&#x27;ve used plenty others. I have monolids and this tape really holds the double eyelid well. Sure, it takes practice to get the hang of it but like all good things it&#x27;s worth it. If you don&#x27;t do it right though, people can see the tape, but it isn&#x27;t too noticeable when that happens. I use it very often and it stays on the entire day!</li>
            <li> All 3 pcs work well, good quality</li>
            <li> I would give it a five if it was waterproof. The tape works good but if you have watery eyes then this not for you</li>
            <li> Love how big my eyes look</li>
            <li> but shape is not good for me so I always cut it smaller then it will be much more invisible</li>
            <li> It looks perfect! Last all day long, even go swimming, that&#x27;s why I love it so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something better than normal eyelid tape, go get this one!!!</li>
            <li> Like much better than the other brand I was using&lt;br /&gt;The instructions should also be in English .</li>
            <li> No good. The tape got cut into 2 pcs.This is just the copy product-made in China. The right product Made in Korea.</li>
            <li> Needs directions in English.....product is as stated.....slim and has good adhesive. Works with practice .</li>
            <li> I am a non-Asian, 31 yr old, TIRED momma - And I love these.  Yes, practice makes perfect.  It took me about a month of wearing them to get them in just the right spot.  You can put make up over them.  You can swim with them.  No one notices them.  They basically disappear, leaving only a crease - where you want it!  These are just a subtle lift, so if you are looking for something more dramatic, try the one-sided version.  (I wear both-not at the same time).  I like these because you truly can&#x27;t see them.  I wear them to help me look more awake, and make me feel like my eye-lids aren&#x27;t so heavy.  4 stars because they leave slight sticky residue after removal.  But totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The BEST double eyelid tape!!! I&#x27;ve been using eyelid tape for 4years now! I already have a double eyelid but when I wake up in the morning my eyelids sometimes disappear, so I would put these tapes on for 20minutes before putting makeup on my face and it does stay on the spot for all day. I will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It works as stated and shown. Use water to gently remove it from eyelid. The sticker lasts for a day without sweating too much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to work - the directions are no good.</li>
            <li> Love these. The adhesive is strong and stays all day. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great Product and it works.</li>
            <li> Too sticky!!!!! Not easy to use</li>
            <li> Does the job, however it shows a bit(prolly due to my skin tone). I don&#x27;t know long you have to wear it to make it last. Whenever I get tired, my eyes go back to triple lid on me. All in all, it &#x27;s worth the investment based on how consistent you are w/ using it you nay receive better results.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer here &#x27;cause it works</li>
            <li> I was excited to give these a try after reading the few available reviews. It took me about 6 tries to get it right, and I applied to clean skin. I will give it one positive, it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. 30 minutes in, I started feeling a burning sensation. I removed it and washed the sticky residue off. I went to sleep. When I woke up, where it had been applied was red and that part of my eyelid was swollen. A few hours later, the swelling went down, but a rash was present. I applied eyelid primer as I always do before my eye makeup, and it stung bad. 3 days later, the rash is still here, but it&#x27;s getting better and doesn&#x27;t sting anymore. Just be aware this could happen to you. Perhaps I just have super sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any beauty products I&#x27;ve used on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting hooded eyelids. It&#x27;s no fun and every eye cream I have tried doesn&#x27;t seem to make a change. I had an Asian friend and one day I looked closely and saw that she had something attached to her eyelid, that&#x27;s how I found about these little things. Truth to be told, she cut these things herself from double sided medical tape. Thrifty. I went for these and they really well. It&#x27;s a bit challinging to find the right position, and mind you, I don&#x27;t find the right one right away every time I use these. But they hold really well, the whole day, even though I have extremely oily eyelids. In the evening I see a bit of a product line, mascara, eyeliner, a bit of powder, that has shifted to the area where it&#x27;s glued togther. But nothing major. I have a slight allergy against glue and if I use these 2 or 3 days in a row, my eyelid looks red and swollen. But if one doesn&#x27;t have that problem, it really is a way to go. One other thing, they are terribly hard to get off the plastic sheets and I have wasted quite a lot that way.</li>
            <li> Really does lift my lids.  Takes getting use to positioning them on your lids.</li>
            <li> I literary tired many other double eyelid tapes from different brands. THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!! And the price is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. The only tape that works on me</li>
            <li> It was bought for my friend. He says it&#x27;s very good to use this. His eyes become very big.</li>
            <li> Would never buy again.</li>
