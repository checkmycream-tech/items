            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>MSM Medicinal Lotion has been an amazing find.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve both been using this lotion for these reasons, respectfully, and we&#x27;re honestly amazed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect, natural, quintessential skin lotion.</li>
            <li>my cabinet full of lotions that I ended up hating can attest to that!!</li>
            <li>, I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any unwanted ingredients so I can use</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I use this mostly on my face for acne scars</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh and works great as a lotion.</li>
            <li>they have great healing properties, and are all natural.  </li>
            <li>Also, I enjoyed the two free gifts that came with it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve looked at ingredients in products you know that isn&#x27;t always an easy task.</li>
            <li>Best natural lotion I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li>Great natural lotion, even good enough to touch up your face with it!</li>
            <li>Which is good news for me because I can wear makeup after applying this without worrying about it melting (seriously, wow).</li>
            <li>My scarring has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and got it just fine.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a safe, effective lotion.</li>
            <li>This makes it superior to so many other &amp;#34;MSM lotions&amp;#34; that just add trace amounts to sell the product but are basically just lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t oily, so I can use it as a moisturizer under my makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>docked it one star because it smells mildly of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>But honestly  it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it very quickly; it feels soft within minutes.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion that&#x27;s helped heal my Rosacea breakouts, a rash on my leg, itchy mosquito bites, and I no longer need 2</li>
            <li>lotion is called \\&quot;Medicinal\\&quot; because it has a higher 12% MSM (sulfur), Tea Tree Oil (antiseptic), and Vitamin A &amp; E. Combined</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good, I&#x27;m afraid if I write a review, there won&#x27;t be more left for me:))))</li>
            <li>It really absorbs well is not oily and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea, so I also have to use products that are gentle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, you just gently rub it in and it absorbs amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>It is mind blowing how such a cheap product can produce miraculous results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d much prefer an unscented product.  </li>
            <li>Has a high MSM content (12%).  </li>
            <li>It has simple whole ingredients I feel good about putting on my face, and our skin sucks it up thirstily.</li>
            <li>It feels very soft &amp; silky</li>
            <li>Not much of a scent, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I never thought I could find a lotion that was gentle enough to use on both my face &amp; body, and was all natural!</li>
            <li>lotion is light yet very moisturizing and seems to eliminated the red, dry patchy eczema I get on on my upper arms in the winter after a shower.</li>
            <li>And of all the natural remedies I&#x27;ve tried on my boyfriend to help this lotion is the only one to show real results almost immediately.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not really seeing many benefits from it other than helping dry skin....not noticing any &#x27;miracle cures&#x27; like some others mention.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only used it twice thus far, but the scabbing and pain is gone.</li>
            <li>The lotion feels and smells nice (really faint scent)</li>
            <li>My first goal is trying to rid myself of as many products as possible that have chemicals, artificial preservatives, and parabens.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic results to my acne so far, but I&#x27;m just glad it doesn&#x27;t leave that weird oily feeling that most moisturizers do.</li>

            <li> Only 4 stars because it makes my face break out (minimal)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m extremely careful with what I put on my skin as well as what I ingest internally.</li>
            <li> Soothes dry eczema skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> I was using it on some facial scars and while it kept the scars hydrated, I can&#x27;t say that it made them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> i have really weak, sensitive skin with all sorts of problems</li>
            <li> So what I really love about this product is that I&#x27;ve been dealing with this weird bumpy, itchy rash on my stomach for MONTHS using really expensive treatments</li>
            <li> My order also came with a little bag of dark cacao!</li>
            <li> I got this lotion a few weeks ago after I tried some of my boyfriend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion on bad sunburn and the cooling sensation was very relieving.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hands, I have really bad corporal tunnels</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it lives up to all the hype though.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure I would repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with joint pain (but that part might be in my head, hard to tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> I do like that it is light-weight and not apt to clog pores.</li>
            <li> I have pretty noticeable acne scars, and my boyfriend&#x27;s hands crack really bad (to the point of painful stinging &amp; bleeding) in dry weather.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Buyer be wary of this brand of lotion products, you might not get what you order which is a type of bait and switch.</li>
            <li> It helped moisturize my skin and prevent it from peeling too bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bad. I found to be soothing for my feet but it wasn&#x27;t life changing. It&#x27;s something I can do without.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and fresh and works great as a lotion. Only 4 stars because it makes my face break out (minimal) and I don&#x27;t see a difference in my scars, which was the reason for me buying it</li>
            <li> it is alright. I bought it because it said medicinal. I do use it. I do like it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty noticeable acne scars, and my boyfriend&#x27;s hands crack really bad (to the point of painful stinging &amp; bleeding) in dry weather. We&#x27;ve both been using this lotion for these reasons, respectfully, and we&#x27;re honestly amazed. Our skin DRINKS this stuff. Which is good news for me because I can wear makeup after applying this without worrying about it melting (seriously, wow). My scarring has improved significantly. I look very bright and happy when I wake up (elasticity). And of all the natural remedies I&#x27;ve tried on my boyfriend to help this lotion is the only one to show real results almost immediately. He&#x27;s only used it twice thus far, but the scabbing and pain is gone. And even though it&#x27;s been several days since the last time he applied to his hands (he forgets a lot, unless I do it) it still looks and feels like his skin is healing every day. The smell took a bit to get used to. But honestly  it&#x27;s completely worth it. My order also came with a little bag of dark cacao! Which was DELICIOUS. I hope this product never disappears. Will order again. maybe even before I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My hands look great and I can even slather it all over my face without breaking out and getting itchy red spots.  I will always have this in the house!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good, I&#x27;m afraid if I write a review, there won&#x27;t be more left for me:))))</li>
            <li> I used this lotion on bad sunburn and the cooling sensation was very relieving. It helped moisturize my skin and prevent it from peeling too bad. It smells like tea tree oil which is pleasant and you can tell it has tea tree in it. Tea tree has very good anti-germ properties.</li>
            <li> Not much of a scent, absorbs quickly but I&#x27;m not really seeing many benefits from it other than helping dry skin....not noticing any &#x27;miracle cures&#x27; like some others mention.</li>
            <li> Both my boyfriend and I adore this cream. It has simple whole ingredients I feel good about putting on my face, and our skin sucks it up thirstily. It really absorbs well is not oily and does not cause breakouts. In fact it has been helping my acne scarring fade. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really helps my hands, I have really bad corporal tunnels</li>
            <li> I got this lotion a few weeks ago after I tried some of my boyfriend&#x27;s. It is really great, I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any unwanted ingredients so I can use is all over, even my face, without feeling like I am rubbing toxins into my body. It pumps out and goes on just like regular lotion and there is no greasy feeling. Shipped quickly and got it just fine. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a safe, effective lotion.</li>
            <li> My first goal is trying to rid myself of as many products as possible that have chemicals, artificial preservatives, and parabens.  If you&#x27;ve looked at ingredients in products you know that isn&#x27;t always an easy task. I have Rosacea, so I also have to use products that are gentle.  So...When I started to look for a lotion I thought I might have set a goal that I would never achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MSM Medicinal Lotion has been an amazing find. I never thought I could find a lotion that was gentle enough to use on both my face &amp; body, and was all natural! Plus an added bonus...It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t oily, so I can use it as a moisturizer under my makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions....my cabinet full of lotions that I ended up hating can attest to that!! This is the first lotion that&#x27;s helped heal my Rosacea breakouts, a rash on my leg, itchy mosquito bites, and I no longer need 2 separate lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is called \\&quot;Medicinal\\&quot; because it has a higher 12% MSM (sulfur), Tea Tree Oil (antiseptic), and Vitamin A &amp; E. Combined they have great healing properties, and are all natural.  It can be used for rashes, sunburns, bug bites, scars, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, you just gently rub it in and it absorbs amazingly fast. It feels very soft &amp; silky when applied, it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores, it isn&#x27;t oily, and has healing properties...Plus, you can use it all over the face &amp; body! I love it so much I bought the larger 32 oz size!!  :)</li>
            <li> Great natural lotion, even good enough to touch up your face with it! Or all around lotion, areas that need moisture!</li>
            <li> Have to keep reapplying to maintain moisture.</li>
            <li> I am have been taking MSM supplements but also read that MSM can be applied topically.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is light yet very moisturizing and seems to eliminated the red, dry patchy eczema I get on on my upper arms in the winter after a shower.</li>
            <li> I received the MSM Orange Ylang Yang lotion instead of the MSM Medicinal Lotion I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Orange Ylang Yang is seemingly a decent lotion, however it does not have the 10% Green Tea Oil the Medicinal Lotion has in it. So the Orange Ylang Yang falls short of the product I actually ordered and was fullfilled improperly. Buyer be wary of this brand of lotion products, you might not get what you order which is a type of bait and switch.</li>
            <li> i have really weak, sensitive skin with all sorts of problems so I&#x27;m extremely careful with what I put on my skin as well as what I ingest internally. Hearing about this product from a reliable source, I thought I give it a try. I bought it specifically for my acne and oily skin. My skin absorbs it very quickly; it feels soft within minutes. I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic results to my acne so far, but I&#x27;m just glad it doesn&#x27;t leave that weird oily feeling that most moisturizers do. So what I really love about this product is that I&#x27;ve been dealing with this weird bumpy, itchy rash on my stomach for MONTHS using really expensive treatments but when I applied this lotion, it healed my rash almost 100% in one day.. Unbelievable! I also applied it on my pinky toe since I have athletes foot and it&#x27;s doing a great job. It is mind blowing how such a cheap product can produce miraculous results. Also, I enjoyed the two free gifts that came with it. Awesome product, awesome service, and prompt delivery. Best natural lotion I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels and smells nice (really faint scent) when put on. I&#x27;m not sure it lives up to all the hype though. I was using it on some facial scars and while it kept the scars hydrated, I can&#x27;t say that it made them less noticeable. I do like that it is light-weight and not apt to clog pores. But I&#x27;m not sure I would repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Soothes dry eczema skin immediately.  Great for sunburn.  Softens calluses in 2-3 days.  Seems to help with joint pain (but that part might be in my head, hard to tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality, truly all-natural ingredient list.  No perfumes or scents other than from the natural oils present.  Has a high MSM content (12%).  This makes it superior to so many other &amp;#34;MSM lotions&amp;#34; that just add trace amounts to sell the product but are basically just lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked it one star because it smells mildly of tea tree oil and I&#x27;d much prefer an unscented product.  It doesn&#x27;t say anything about the tea tree oil on the front label, though it&#x27;s there in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect, natural, quintessential skin lotion. This is pretty good but not quite perfect so the search continues.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my face for acne scars and I see improvement in the way my skin looks.</li>
