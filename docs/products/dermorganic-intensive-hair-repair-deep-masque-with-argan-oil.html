            <li>The problem with a lot of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; hair products is that they really don&#x27;t do a very good job at hydrating the hair.</li>

            <li>This product is hihgly effective for the hair type that is recommended for its use.</li>
            <li>i liked how my hair feels after washing with this shampoo: silky and shinny.</li>
            <li>I love it!  :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>, I feel I get better results using my shampoo, then this as a conditioner and using the DermOrganic</li>
            <li>The texture was softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I like it better HOWEVER,</li>
            <li>I love the way this masque smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my wash-n-go&#x27;s look much better</li>
            <li>so i love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The Dermorganic products are so much more &#x27;conditioning&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>It makes setting the hair whether by blow drying or roller set more manageable.  </li>
            <li>The results are a healthy looking and feeling mane.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The conditioner is wonderful and can be used daily.</li>
            <li>she told me am glad</li>
            <li>i also use this with DermOrganic shampoo and leave-in....and its perfect for a daily wash or my once a wk wash....</li>
            <li>I LOVE DermOrganics conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is not hydrating at all, any cheap grocery conditioner is better than this in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have type 3C natural AA hair and this conditioner works great for me.</li>
            <li>Not only is it organic, which is extremely important to me, but it is a very good, conditioning masque.  </li>
            <li>i have fine hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling great, I have used it every day since then mixing it with my other conditioner, and once on its own as the Masque and right away my hair is softer, more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely dry from many years of coloring and blow drying and this product has softened the texture of my hair a great deal.</li>
            <li>u didnt where no perfume today because your hair smells good and strong but soft...</li>
            <li>This is a nice compromise for a more natural product.</li>
            <li>A FANTASTIC HAIR MASK FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES VEGAN AND CRUELTY FREE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>It is very creamy, has a nice scent and DOES help your hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sulfate free, which is why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li>I tried this after I bought the EO Sulfate Free, Keratin Shampoo and Conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling truly silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>so in my opinion the expense is very worth it.</li>
            <li>Earthy, calming, light &amp; sweet.   </li>
            <li>I have very fine but very curly hair and these products work wonders with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products, this one by far exceeds all others.</li>
            <li>but no way not with this i dont i would say bout a 1 dime/nickel size would do me good....and it leaves my hair and scalp so clean</li>
            <li>Also after a long day in the summer heat, great as a quick rinse out.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I feel it&#x27;s a good deal for the product.</li>
            <li>I have long (mid-back) straight hair and people often compliment me on how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li>You can tell that real argan oil is in it because the bottle is tinted to keep the oil/other organic ingredients from oxidizing and becoming ineffective.</li>
            <li>and it smells fresh for days....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something more natural &amp; gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>Ordered the smaller size to see if it lived up to its reviews, and it is even better</li>
            <li>I love that this product is organic so it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it that really only harm your hair.</li>
            <li>and I really see a difference in the healthyness of my hair!  </li>
            <li>It is soft, shiny, full of body, smells great, is actually faster/easier to blow dry straight, and stays clean longer.</li>
            <li>i will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>i also have the leave in oil in this brand and my hair has not been breaking and has been growing sooo fast!</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t any different or better than it was with any of my drug store conditioners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for things to help repair my split ends, but I always read into the reviews first.</li>
            <li>but this product did not make my hair feel greasy at all and left my hair feeling super soft and easy to manage!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of runny; I&#x27;ll apply it to my hair and it just drips right off down the drain.</li>
            <li>and I use many hot tools on my hair; blow dryer, flat iron and curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I deep condition my hair about three times a week, and I love this product so much</li>
            <li>My hair actually is soft, shiny &amp; full of body.</li>
            <li>&amp; I want to cry looking at the brush afterwards because so much hair came out with brushing.</li>
            <li>I tried the sample kit and now I&#x27;m hooked on the whole system.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much styling product.</li>
            <li>The smell really turns me off, as well.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the pump top, it refused to work properly and eventually broke all together, so now I have to take the entire top off when I want to get conditioner out, which is a pain.</li>
            <li>I use the leave in conditioner too, which is also very nourishing to my hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great, it&#x27;s thick and makes my hair soft and silky, as soon as I comb it through in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy fine hair</li>
            <li>I have dyed longer thick straight hair which I flat iron and curl almost every day and nothing has left it feeling so wonderful.</li>
            <li>This condition works really good and you only have to use a little at a time..</li>
            <li>I live in the south where the humidity is horrendous!</li>
            <li>Conditions hair as expected and makes it easy to comb through hair after shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner (buy the shampoo also) if you don&#x27;t like using sulfates in your hair.</li>
            <li>Do highly recommand this product to any one...</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it has Argan Oil and this brand doesn&#x27;t any cones - it&#x27;s more natural than the other brands.  </li>
            <li>normally my hair grows incredibley slooow.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my fine hair weighted down and greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li>My hair is middle of my back length, natural curly &amp; combination fine with medium.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s enough in my hair at first, then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with other argan oil infused products (in the blue package...).</li>
            <li>Every night I rub natural oils into my scalp &amp; sleep with them till morning &amp; my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped after using this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>by the time I&#x27;m done with my shower I can already feel how soft my hair is while rinsing.   </li>
            <li>Well it smells hella good...but a natural smell.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair ultra soft and didn&#x27;t leave a moisturized feel.</li>
            <li>It has really protected my hair from damage caused by daily straightening.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, and the shampoo is sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pungent and reminds me of the old swimming pool locker room at the YMCA</li>
            <li>No heavy build up.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Before this I was using suave products, because I don&#x27;t really believe in spending a lot of hard-earned dough on beauty products, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering it.  </li>
            <li>The products are powerful and last a very long time</li>
            <li>If you have dry damaged hair this helps your hair look and feel much healthier</li>
            <li>I use very little heat products &amp; mostly air dry.</li>
            <li>I use a few other products, but since switching to this as my mid-week conditioner, I have been able to go longer between cuts.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair that is breaking pretty bad from a straightening treatment, this conditioner made my hair look and feel 100 times better right away.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is left soft and I notice my fly-aways are under control.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and manageable and totally organic.  </li>
            <li>and nothing has gotten worse but better...</li>
            <li>Thanks to these products, I only have to wash and blow out my hair every 2-3 days, depending on the weather and other factors.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;ve worked down to the length my scalp is already moisturized &amp; the ends aren&#x27;t much to finish.</li>
            <li>For starters, when I think of \\&quot;masque,\\&quot; I think of a really super thick conditioner, which this is definitely not.</li>
            <li>Amazon prices or a little bit cheaper and reasonable</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner (buy the shampoo also) if you don&#x27;t like using sulfates in your hair.</li>
            <li> Do highly recommand this product to any one...</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it has Argan Oil and this brand doesn&#x27;t any cones - it&#x27;s more natural than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> normally my hair grows incredibley slooow.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my fine hair weighted down and greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li> My hair is middle of my back length, natural curly &amp; combination fine with medium.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s enough in my hair at first, then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with other argan oil infused products (in the blue package...).</li>
            <li> Every night I rub natural oils into my scalp &amp; sleep with them till morning &amp; my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped after using this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> by the time I&#x27;m done with my shower I can already feel how soft my hair is while rinsing.   </li>
            <li> Well it smells hella good...but a natural smell.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair ultra soft and didn&#x27;t leave a moisturized feel.</li>
            <li> It has really protected my hair from damage caused by daily straightening.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, and the shampoo is sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pungent and reminds me of the old swimming pool locker room at the YMCA</li>
            <li> No heavy build up.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Before this I was using suave products, because I don&#x27;t really believe in spending a lot of hard-earned dough on beauty products, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering it.  </li>
            <li> The products are powerful and last a very long time</li>
            <li> If you have dry damaged hair this helps your hair look and feel much healthier</li>
            <li> I use very little heat products &amp; mostly air dry.</li>
            <li> I use a few other products, but since switching to this as my mid-week conditioner, I have been able to go longer between cuts.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that is breaking pretty bad from a straightening treatment, this conditioner made my hair look and feel 100 times better right away.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is left soft and I notice my fly-aways are under control.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and manageable and totally organic.  </li>
            <li> and nothing has gotten worse but better...</li>
            <li> Thanks to these products, I only have to wash and blow out my hair every 2-3 days, depending on the weather and other factors.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;ve worked down to the length my scalp is already moisturized &amp; the ends aren&#x27;t much to finish.</li>
            <li> For starters, when I think of \\&quot;masque,\\&quot; I think of a really super thick conditioner, which this is definitely not.</li>
            <li> Amazon prices or a little bit cheaper and reasonable</li>
            <li> But maybe I&#x27;m not using enough of it or leaving it on long enough??</li>
            <li> It is expensive, and although it smells nice, it is not worth losing your hair.</li>
            <li> that stuff is $50 and doesn&#x27;t last that long!</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, and coarse hair..</li>
            <li> This product left my hair dry, brittle and coarse-feeling.</li>
            <li> I am a African American female with thick, coarse, shoulder lenght hair.</li>
            <li> After using it twice, my hair became so dry and lifeless, it also made my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> my hair is color treated andf can be dry at time</li>
            <li> My hair is also noticeably shinier when I blow dry it out.</li>
            <li> noticeably reduces how often I need to trim off dry</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m guessing the larger bottles will last a few months.   </li>
            <li> Never heavy or greasy, it puts moisture back into my dried out hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it leaves my coarse colored treated hair feeling softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I started out with the little bottles, but am going to order the larger ones in a set because a little for me goes a very long way</li>
            <li> (I go through 1-2 bottles a year, as opposed to the 4-6 bottles of other shampoos and conditioners)</li>
            <li> This product does what it claimes without non-water soluable silicones and other inorganic ingredients.</li>
            <li> usually i have to squeeze like 2/3 times out of a regular store brought shampoo bottle....</li>
            <li> and I tend to blow dry / style my hair almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> This masque to me, is like an average conditioner.</li>
            <li> i was riding down the road in the car with my sister and when we made it to where we was gng</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t detangle, so in addition to pulling out half your hair after you come it</li>
            <li> It seemed like a typical drugstore conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too \\&quot;perfume-like,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase again since it is too heavy for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> After having a bad experience with hair straightening, the Derm Organic Shampoo, Mask and Oil were the only products that brought my hair back to a livable condition.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week and leave it on for at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> so it looks thick</li>
            <li> (while it&#x27;s wet), your hair feels terrible.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s not organic: if it were, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This masque has helped my hair after it was over bleached by a bad hair stylist.</li>
            <li> OMG, this is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair (AA, relaxed hair).</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

            <li> OMG, this is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair (AA, relaxed hair). It doesn&#x27;t detangle, so in addition to pulling out half your hair after you come it (while it&#x27;s wet), your hair feels terrible. It was awful. Used it three times and then threw it out.</li>
            <li> A FANTASTIC HAIR MASK FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES VEGAN AND CRUELTY FREE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little goes a long way and it leaves my coarse colored treated hair feeling softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product.  It has done wonders for my hair.  I live in the south where the humidity is horrendous! This product is great.  I have tried many, many products, this one by far exceeds all others.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair fall out - literally - which may be because of some allergy (who knows?) but when I contacted the seller to try to return it, they did not even get back to me. Would not recommend! It is expensive, and although it smells nice, it is not worth losing your hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  all the family used it and so happy with the beautiful smell and silky hair feeling.</li>
            <li> Ordered the smaller size to see if it lived up to its reviews, and it is even better I ordered the 1L within 2 days of using this product. It leaves my hair feeling great, I have used it every day since then mixing it with my other conditioner, and once on its own as the Masque and right away my hair is softer, more manageable. I have dyed longer thick straight hair which I flat iron and curl almost every day and nothing has left it feeling so wonderful. I will not order the shampoo, I feel I get better results using my shampoo, then this as a conditioner and using the DermOrganic leave in after.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my hair stylist gave me some of the oil.  I absolutely loved the way this masque worked on my hair.  The texture was softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it has Argan Oil and this brand doesn&#x27;t any cones - it&#x27;s more natural than the other brands.  It moisturized my hair and help with detangling.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it to see if there&#x27;s an improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my fine hair weighted down and greasy-looking.  However, my hair is left soft and I notice my fly-aways are under control.  The smell is pleasant and I like the consistency of the product.  I won&#x27;t purchase again since it is too heavy for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is organic so it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it that really only harm your hair. It is very creamy, has a nice scent and DOES help your hair. I feel it could be \\&quot;more\\&quot; moisturizing. But maybe I&#x27;m not using enough of it or leaving it on long enough?? Overall, I feel it&#x27;s a good deal for the product. I&#x27;ve tried WEN&#x27;s masque and I like it better HOWEVER, that stuff is $50 and doesn&#x27;t last that long! This is a nice compromise for a more natural product.</li>
            <li> After using it twice, my hair became so dry and lifeless, it also made my scalp itchy. The conditioner is not hydrating at all, any cheap grocery conditioner is better than this in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My hair is middle of my back length, natural curly &amp; combination fine with medium. I use very little heat products &amp; mostly air dry. I&#x27;ve tried to get away from chemicals in hopes of finding something to help my hair grow back in. Throughout the years I&#x27;ve processed, dyed, highlighted &amp; chemically bleached my hair to the point of it falling out.   The shampoo that goes with this masque is great at cleansing. Every night I rub natural oils into my scalp &amp; sleep with them till morning &amp; my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped after using this shampoo &amp; conditioner. My hair actually is soft, shiny &amp; full of body. I love the way this masque smells. To me it is what I imagine a spa would smell like. Earthy, calming, light &amp; sweet.   I started out with the little bottles, but am going to order the larger ones in a set because a little for me goes a very long way &amp; I&#x27;m guessing the larger bottles will last a few months.   When I condition in the shower, I add this in sections. Crown, back, sides, then length. By the time I&#x27;ve worked down to the length my scalp is already moisturized &amp; the ends aren&#x27;t much to finish. It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s enough in my hair at first, then by the time I&#x27;m done with my shower I can already feel how soft my hair is while rinsing.   I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something more natural &amp; gentle on the hair. This is the only product I have found to get rid of tangles in my hair. Everything else knots tangles up &amp; I want to cry looking at the brush afterwards because so much hair came out with brushing. Not with this product.</li>
            <li> Before i bought this i could have sworn i saw someone say this product is not scented.  Well it smells hella good...but a natural smell.</li>
            <li> After having a bad experience with hair straightening, the Derm Organic Shampoo, Mask and Oil were the only products that brought my hair back to a livable condition.  Now, almost a year later, I still use it faithfully.  Never heavy or greasy, it puts moisture back into my dried out hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist - have been using it for a couple of months now and I really see a difference in the healthyness of my hair!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This masque to me, is like an average conditioner. It didn&#x27;t make my hair ultra soft and didn&#x27;t leave a moisturized feel. It seemed like a typical drugstore conditioner on my hair. I&#x27;ve had better results with other argan oil infused products (in the blue package...).</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, and coarse hair..this conditioner leaves it looking and feeling amazing!!  The best part is that it is free of silicone.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and leave it on for at least 2 minutes. It has really protected my hair from damage caused by daily straightening. I&#x27;m not in love with the smell. It&#x27;s a little too \\&quot;perfume-like,\\&quot; but otherwise it does a very good job. My hair is shiny and healthy. I have long (mid-back) straight hair and people often compliment me on how beautiful it is. I use a few other products, but since switching to this as my mid-week conditioner, I have been able to go longer between cuts. It rinses well, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger. Good stuff. Too bad it&#x27;s not organic: if it were, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My curls love this stuff!! I have type 3C natural AA hair and this conditioner works great for me. It hydrates and detangles wonderfully. I tried the sample kit and now I&#x27;m hooked on the whole system. My hair looks and feels great after using. It&#x27;s made my wash-n-go&#x27;s look much better and I don&#x27;t have to use as much styling product.</li>
            <li> I have used DermOrganic hair products for two years now, based on a stylist recommendation - I started with just the Argan Oil leave in treatment, but expanded to the shampoo, conditioner, and masque line. I have very fine but very curly hair and these products work wonders with my hair.  It is soft, shiny, full of body, smells great, is actually faster/easier to blow dry straight, and stays clean longer. Thanks to these products, I only have to wash and blow out my hair every 2-3 days, depending on the weather and other factors. The products are powerful and last a very long time (I go through 1-2 bottles a year, as opposed to the 4-6 bottles of other shampoos and conditioners) so in my opinion the expense is very worth it.</li>
            <li> i have fine hair but i have alot of it! lol so it looks thick but this product did not make my hair feel greasy at all and left my hair feeling super soft and easy to manage! i will definitely be ordering more. i also have the leave in oil in this brand and my hair has not been breaking and has been growing sooo fast! normally my hair grows incredibley slooow. my hair is color treated andf can be dry at time so i love this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that is breaking pretty bad from a straightening treatment, this conditioner made my hair look and feel 100 times better right away. I put in on while I shaved in the shower, left it for 5 minutes then rinsed. Silky,smooth hair instantly. Not tested on animals and vegan to boot.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It makes my hair so soft, and the shampoo is sulfate-free. I highly recommend this conditioner (buy the shampoo also) if you don&#x27;t like using sulfates in your hair.</li>
            <li> For starters, when I think of \\&quot;masque,\\&quot; I think of a really super thick conditioner, which this is definitely not. It&#x27;s kind of runny; I&#x27;ll apply it to my hair and it just drips right off down the drain. My hair isn&#x27;t any different or better than it was with any of my drug store conditioners. The smell really turns me off, as well. It&#x27;s pungent and reminds me of the old swimming pool locker room at the YMCA I went to as a kid, and it really grosses me out, lol! The pros of this product, is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it&#x27;s sulfate free, which is why I gave it three stars. However, I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried this after I bought the EO Sulfate Free, Keratin Shampoo and Conditioners.  The Dermorganic products are so much more &#x27;conditioning&#x27;.  The shampoos lathers into a very creamy lather and the conditioner is conditioning without being heavy.  Really love it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  Conditions hair as expected and makes it easy to comb through hair after shampoo.  It makes setting the hair whether by blow drying or roller set more manageable.  The results are a healthy looking and feeling mane.  Very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is extremely dry from many years of coloring and blow drying and this product has softened the texture of my hair a great deal. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for things to help repair my split ends, but I always read into the reviews first. This product was so good that it deserves the five stars and review im giving it! Within 3 uses with this product I noticed my split ends going away completly. My hair was also softer, shinier, and it smelt so good! I deep condition my hair about three times a week, and I love this product so much i&#x27;m going to look into getting the shampoo! Love this product, bye split ends!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and manageable and totally organic.  No heavy build up.  Since I found this I haven&#x27;t used any othe conditioner on my hair.  Love it</li>
            <li> The conditioner is great, it&#x27;s thick and makes my hair soft and silky, as soon as I comb it through in the shower. My hair is also noticeably shinier when I blow dry it out. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the pump top, it refused to work properly and eventually broke all together, so now I have to take the entire top off when I want to get conditioner out, which is a pain.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I have an irritation on my scalp, especially after coloring.  It also makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
            <li> The problem with a lot of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; hair products is that they really don&#x27;t do a very good job at hydrating the hair. This product left my hair dry, brittle and coarse-feeling. I will not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.The conditioner is wonderful and can be used daily. This is an organic product that you can recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product I just followed the directions for home use.Leaves your hair feeling truly silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner. If you have dry damaged hair this helps your hair look and feel much healthier</li>
            <li> This product does what it claimes without non-water soluable silicones and other inorganic ingredients. This product is hihgly effective for the hair type that is recommended for its use. You can tell that real argan oil is in it because the bottle is tinted to keep the oil/other organic ingredients from oxidizing and becoming ineffective. Leave it in for the time recommended in the instructions. Also after a long day in the summer heat, great as a quick rinse out.  But also, you can&#x27;t keep damaging hair and expect damage to reverse, you have to get regular trims, and limit heat styling.</li>
            <li> I have used this wonderful product before, so I knew I would love it.  Not only is it organic, which is extremely important to me, but it is a very good, conditioning masque.  I have highlighted hair which is course and I use many hot tools on my hair; blow dryer, flat iron and curling iron.  This masque is like liquid gold to me!  It makes my hair soft and shiny.  I love it!  :)</li>
            <li> Great hair care product</li>
            <li> This masque has helped my hair after it was over bleached by a bad hair stylist. I use the leave in conditioner too, which is also very nourishing to my hair.</li>
            <li> The product was on time. i liked how my hair feels after washing with this shampoo: silky and shinny. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Let me start of by saying....I am a African American female with thick, coarse, shoulder lenght hair. Its also permed and colored....This condition works really good and you only have to use a little at a time..usually i have to squeeze like 2/3 times out of a regular store brought shampoo bottle....but no way not with this i dont i would say bout a 1 dime/nickel size would do me good....and it leaves my hair and scalp so clean and it smells fresh for days....i was riding down the road in the car with my sister and when we made it to where we was gng she told me am glad u didnt where no perfume today because your hair smells good and strong but soft...i also use this with DermOrganic shampoo and leave-in....and its perfect for a daily wash or my once a wk wash....Do highly recommand this product to any one...i have using this for a month now...and nothing has gotten worse but better...for me..i looked in my local stores at the time i was comparing prices on Amazon while in Target and CVS Pharmacy in my local area...Amazon prices or a little bit cheaper and reasonable then those two stores....for DermOrganic Argan Oil products...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to using Dermoganic products and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s done a lot to help my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months.  I have long, wavy fine hair and I tend to blow dry / style my hair almost everyday.  I&#x27;ve found using this product noticeably reduces how often I need to trim off dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Masque conditioner with the Shampoo and Hair Oil.  Before this I was using suave products, because I don&#x27;t really believe in spending a lot of hard-earned dough on beauty products, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering it.  I think it&#x27;s definitely saved me money by reducing trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE DermOrganics conditioner and shampoo. They both work so well on keeping my hair from being &amp;#34;woolly.&amp;#34;</li>
