            <li>and i use it with my Gelish Polish and 9 watt uv lamp and my nails look gorgeous!</li>
            <li>but it is a great product regardless.</li>

            <li>I loved the color of this polish.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve literally had so many people stop and ask me what this color is!</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>this color is amazing when you have a tan and even when you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The formula is the best out of the whole collection</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as it sounds, beautiful, fire-engine red in a great quality polish.</li>
            <li>A beautiful bright, red-orange coral that goes on super smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far this polish is awesome.</li>
            <li>As with most polish, two coats yielded richer color.</li>
            <li>in all okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this color, I love opi polish.</li>
            <li>I love the colour.  </li>
            <li>I just really love this.</li>
            <li>I love this polish color.</li>
            <li>I put it on right away and loved the color but within one day it started to chip.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and easily and lasts forever on my nails.</li>
            <li>The color of the polish was uniform with no separation, it had a fresh consistency and applied very smoothly to nails.</li>
            <li>Kourt definitely has good taste :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous color and lasts longer than most other nail polishes I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is so bright red!  </li>
            <li>Every lady should have a gorgeous shade of red polish in their possession.</li>
            <li>definitely buying more and more if this .</li>
            <li>Cheap, chip and not the bright color I expected but all</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and goes on evenly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>It would be good for one night out but don&#x27;t expect it to last much longer than that.</li>
            <li>Color is a nice shade of red for my olive complexion.</li>
            <li>I own a TON of polish and rarely ever use the whole bottle, but this is my third bottle of this already!</li>
            <li>my favorite red ever.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more colors of these OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Red is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>It is almost an exact match to OPI Cajun Shrimp.</li>
            <li>i just love this red OPI kardashian - it does not chip and it is long lasting and bright red.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this nail polish, I have bought several other colors since I purchased this.</li>
            <li>its typically polish good for a few days.</li>
            <li>It has lasted a week with not much else to do but just add another layer and OPI Top Coat and off we go for a total of ten days</li>
            <li>A few days later I removed it all and started over with a good base coat, two coats of polish, and then a top coat</li>
            <li>Honestly, I hate anything with the Kardadhian name attached, but the red is so beautiful I had to try it.</li>

            <li> my favorite red ever. great color coverage and a really nice shine. my friend said it looks lije a gelmpolish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just PERFECT. Every lady should have a gorgeous shade of red polish in their possession.</li>
            <li> Really good but you can get it cheaper for a $1.00 at CVS.</li>
            <li> I already have this product so I have nothing but good words for it! A beautiful bright, red-orange coral that goes on super smoothly. The formula is the best out of the whole collection and I&#x27;ve literally had so many people stop and ask me what this color is! I own a TON of polish and rarely ever use the whole bottle, but this is my third bottle of this already! Kourt definitely has good taste :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this nail polish, I have bought several other colors since I purchased this. I recommend this company and this product!!</li>
            <li> I loved the color of this polish.  It is so bright red!  I put it on right away and loved the color but within one day it started to chip.  A few days later I removed it all and started over with a good base coat, two coats of polish, and then a top coat and it still chipped.  It would be good for one night out but don&#x27;t expect it to last much longer than that.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Was shipped on time!</li>
            <li> i just love this red OPI kardashian - it does not chip and it is long lasting and bright red. definitely buying more and more if this .</li>
            <li> So far this polish is awesome. I got it within a week and i use it with my Gelish Polish and 9 watt uv lamp and my nails look gorgeous! Now i dont have to spend $15 for red Gelish polish!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why and i hate to admit those damn kardashians did it again. this color is amazing when you have a tan and even when you don&#x27;t. i wish it lasted forever. its typically polish good for a few days.</li>

            <li> I love this color and the polish has held up tremendously great! I am terribly rough with my nails. Gel manicures are tough to take off yourself and too expensive to keep current so I thought I would try this polish over an OPI Base Coat. It has lasted a week with not much else to do but just add another layer and OPI Top Coat and off we go for a total of ten days plus (maybe two weeks) before I take it all off and go again. I will shop this brand and color again!! Great product!! 😘</li>
            <li> Cheap, chip and not the bright color I expected but all in all okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this today. Color is a nice shade of red for my olive complexion. It dries quickly and goes on evenly and effortlessly. 1 coat is enough but 2 will go a long way. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t stay on long. 12 hours later it chipped and came off excessively for no good reason.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I will definitely be buying more colors of these OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this color, I love opi polish. Long lasting. Red is my favorite color. I look for different reds.</li>
            <li> I love the colour.  Kourtney is my favourite Kardashian so I had to have this colour.  I just really love this.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I hate anything with the Kardadhian name attached, but the red is so beautiful I had to try it. It&#x27;s as good as it sounds, beautiful, fire-engine red in a great quality polish. My go-to red.</li>
            <li> I love this polish color. It is almost an exact match to OPI Cajun Shrimp. It goes on so smooth and easily and lasts forever on my nails.I REALLY hate to give a positive review to anything with the Kardashian name attached to it but it is a great product regardless.</li>
