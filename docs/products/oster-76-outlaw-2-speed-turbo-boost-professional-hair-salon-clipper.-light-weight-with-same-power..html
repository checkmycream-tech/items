            <li>Excellent felt case to protect the clipper, with straps to keep the equipment in place.</li>
            <li>and I was also impressed with the quality of those - compared to the Wahl&#x27;s combs</li>
            <li>, these Oster combs were really wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great machine all that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Oster is a great company.</li>
            <li>Cuts good.  </li>
            <li>Good product....love the way it handles....</li>
            <li>All and all very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love the design and cuts great.</li>
            <li>but doees a nice cut and fade....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to invest, if you cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>Thinking these we&#x27;re the latest and greatest, why not upgrade to these right???</li>
            <li>The head gets extremely hot but they do cut very good</li>
            <li>The quality, design and biuld of these clippers are phenomenal but even tho</li>
            <li>I love how the blades are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am still glad it&#x27;s the brand I trust</li>
            <li>It works fine for us</li>
            <li>But not as strong as original 76 ...</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this Oster so far...</li>
            <li>This machine is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>own this product for almost two years - use only to cut my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Working great so far, but it warms up pretty quick it seems.</li>
            <li>the price on this particular model can&#x27;t be beat, compared to when they we&#x27;re 1st released to now, atleast 100$ plus price reduction, so if your new to the detachable clipper realm, this would be a great starter</li>
            <li>but we can&#x27;t cut my hair without having to stop and wait for the clippers to cool off.</li>
            <li>It cuts great, but practically burns your neck after just a few minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>They might come in handy for a back-up detachable when the battery on my BGR+ runs low.</li>
            <li>Of course, the blades are a bit pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li>These work better than the Classic 76&#x27;s because they have  turbo boost, so every time my wife makes a pass up the side of my grape, there is a super cool blow off noise like &amp;#34; KAPOOSH&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s like getting a sweet fade, and being in The Fast and Furious&amp;#34; all at the same time.</li>
            <li>Gets REALLY hot though.  </li>
            <li>The blade gets extremly hot after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally made the jump to quality clippers instead of buying 20 dollar garbage over and over again.</li>
            <li>They are also more quiet.  </li>
            <li>Results are good, but this thing gets too hot in just a few minutes (and not on turbo either).  </li>
            <li>This thing gets hot faster than the cheaper ones...</li>
            <li>whose service life was pretty much @</li>
            <li>It would do very well for horse hair, but it gets so hot that it will burn skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Work very well for buzz clipping hair.</li>
            <li>Unless your changing the blade out every 5 minutes you&#x27;ll burn your customers (or yourself) as these Osters lack an internal fan to cool the blade.</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavier that expected but still easy to handle</li>
            <li>Not that the clippers themself are loud, but there&#x27;s just a certain \\&quot;Clattering\\&quot; type feel</li>
            <li>but I actually like the heat, reminds me of old barbershop cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Never use the high speed setting, the normal settings seems more than enough for what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will ask for a return next as this just can&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li>Was nervous about trying something new, this is my job.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just using it for my husband, so no heavy use.</li>
            <li>whad you puddin dat sammich&amp;#34; and it brings the experience alive.</li>
            <li>The motor purrs gently and has two modes: regular and turbo.</li>
            <li>Less power than what I thought&lt;br /&gt;But strong and solid clippers</li>
            <li>&quot; we&#x27;re lacking especially compared to the classic 76&#x27;s, and the Star Teq(s) that these replaced.</li>
            <li>For that reason, and the fact that it&#x27;s less powerful than the clippers that it was supposed to REPLACE</li>
            <li>They are a little on the heavy side, but they are outstanding.</li>
            <li>Blades came sharp and ready; cut my hair (which is moderately thick and straight) fast and to my desired length.</li>
            <li>Run a little hot on your scalp</li>
            <li>The Wahls clipper combs were cheap plastic and the motor was weak, even though it was the fastest motor advertised.</li>

            <li> The Wahls clipper combs were cheap plastic and the motor was weak, even though it was the fastest motor advertised.</li>
            <li> Thy are not as heavy as the big Oster, and only slightly less powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write back if I have problems cutting with it, but it seem clear to me that this is the best hair cutting tool on the market.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep it oiled, these clippers seem like they will last forever.</li>
            <li> The clipper itself is heavy, but built to last and clearly the highest quality.</li>
            <li> Not matter how many times we oiled the blade as we were cutting he still complained it was too hot</li>

            <li> However, just after cutting 5 minutes with them brand new the blade gets so hot that it will burn your clients.</li>
            <li> They even have metal springs in them to keep the comb secured tightly on the clipper head (a big concern when combs can easily pop off during cutting).</li>
            <li> I purchased a Wahl&#x27;s 5 star clipper initially and returned it a few days after receiving it.</li>
            <li> recommended these clippers to 2 other guys I know, neither had any complaints either.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my hard earned dollars on this.</li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;Feel\\&quot; of the clipper w/ the motor Running and the blade installed was less than desire-able!!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve starting cutting about 5-6 years ago I&#x27;ve alway kept a pair of Oster detachables in my bag.</li>
            <li> My wife even throws in a couple of cheesy one liners like &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Oster.</li>
            <li> My husband did not like the feel of it cutting his hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes cutting hair easier.</li>

            <li> Cuts good.  Gets REALLY hot though.  My husband did not like the feel of it cutting his hair.  Not matter how many times we oiled the blade as we were cutting he still complained it was too hot and he didn&#x27;t have alot of hair to cut!</li>
            <li> I intially purchased these to replace a pair of [[ASIN:B001MP5WJQ Oster Star Teq Dual Speed Detachable Blade Clip # 76066010]] whose service life was pretty much @ and end. Since I&#x27;ve starting cutting about 5-6 years ago I&#x27;ve alway kept a pair of Oster detachables in my bag. Thinking these we&#x27;re the latest and greatest, why not upgrade to these right??? The quality, design and biuld of these clippers are phenomenal but even tho it boast 2 speeds I found that both of these \\&quot;Speeds\\&quot; we&#x27;re lacking especially compared to the classic 76&#x27;s, and the Star Teq(s) that these replaced. Also, the \\&quot;Feel\\&quot; of the clipper w/ the motor Running and the blade installed was less than desire-able!! Not that the clippers themself are loud, but there&#x27;s just a certain \\&quot;Clattering\\&quot; type feel that I can&#x27;t quite pin-point. I thought @ 1st that my blades could be coming in contact w/ the case but that wasn&#x27;t it. For that reason, and the fact that it&#x27;s less powerful than the clippers that it was supposed to REPLACE I can only give these clippers 3 stars... I definately wont get rid of them, atleast not yet!!! They might come in handy for a back-up detachable when the battery on my BGR+ runs low. the price on this particular model can&#x27;t be beat, compared to when they we&#x27;re 1st released to now, atleast 100$ plus price reduction, so if your new to the detachable clipper realm, this would be a great starter but if you&#x27;ve been around the block, and are considering these for a Upgrade.... Look Furthur....</li>
            <li> It works fine for us but I&#x27;m just using it for my husband, so no heavy use. It replaced another 76 that we owned which broke.</li>
            <li> The blade gets extremly hot after 5 minutes.  Unless your changing the blade out every 5 minutes you&#x27;ll burn your customers (or yourself) as these Osters lack an internal fan to cool the blade.</li>
            <li> Great machine all that I was looking for. It is a bit heavier that expected but still easy to handle</li>
            <li> They are a little on the heavy side, but they are outstanding.</li>
            <li> Good product....love the way it handles....But not as strong as original 76 ...but doees a nice cut and fade....yup I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally made the jump to quality clippers instead of buying 20 dollar garbage over and over again. You can feel the difference and realize it&#x27;s a product built to last and has replaceable parts. But I don&#x27;t see the need to replace anything for a long long time.</li>
            <li> own this product for almost two years - use only to cut my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Working great so far, but it warms up pretty quick it seems.</li>
            <li> Was nervous about trying something new, this is my job. Work in a barber shop all day with these. Thy are not as heavy as the big Oster, and only slightly less powerful. They are also more quiet.  All and all very pleased. would buy them again</li>
            <li> Results are good, but this thing gets too hot in just a few minutes (and not on turbo either).  Will ask for a return next as this just can&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li> These work better than the Classic 76&#x27;s because they have  turbo boost, so every time my wife makes a pass up the side of my grape, there is a super cool blow off noise like &amp;#34; KAPOOSH&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s like getting a sweet fade, and being in The Fast and Furious&amp;#34; all at the same time. My wife even throws in a couple of cheesy one liners like &amp;#34; whad you puddin dat sammich&amp;#34; and it brings the experience alive.</li>
            <li> Love the design and cuts great. However, just after cutting 5 minutes with them brand new the blade gets so hot that it will burn your clients.</li>
            <li> Would be a five star but we can&#x27;t cut my hair without having to stop and wait for the clippers to cool off. The head gets extremely hot but they do cut very good</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Work very well for buzz clipping hair.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best. I love how the blades are interchangeable. It makes cutting hair easier. Of course, the blades are a bit pricey but its worth it. As long as you keep it oiled, these clippers seem like they will last forever. You can never go wrong with Oster.</li>
            <li> This machine is very powerful.  It would do very well for horse hair, but it gets so hot that it will burn skin. I would not recommend it for humans or dogs.</li>
            <li> Best deal for the price... Run a little hot on your scalp but I actually like the heat, reminds me of old barbershop cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Never use the high speed setting, the normal settings seems more than enough for what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended these clippers to 2 other guys I know, neither had any complaints either.</li>
            <li> Less power than what I thought&lt;br /&gt;But strong and solid clippers&lt;br /&gt;I am still glad it&#x27;s the brand I trust</li>
            <li> This thing gets hot faster than the cheaper ones... It cuts great, but practically burns your neck after just a few minutes of use.  I oil it every time, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clipper.  I purchased a Wahl&#x27;s 5 star clipper initially and returned it a few days after receiving it. The Wahls clipper combs were cheap plastic and the motor was weak, even though it was the fastest motor advertised. After that experience, this Oster Outlaw is heavenly. Excellent felt case to protect the clipper, with straps to keep the equipment in place. The clipper itself is heavy, but built to last and clearly the highest quality. The motor purrs gently and has two modes: regular and turbo. Blades came sharp and ready; cut my hair (which is moderately thick and straight) fast and to my desired length. I bought the set of 10 universal combs to go along with this purchase and I was also impressed with the quality of those - compared to the Wahl&#x27;s combs, these Oster combs were really wonderful. They even have metal springs in them to keep the comb secured tightly on the clipper head (a big concern when combs can easily pop off during cutting). I have nothing but good things to say about this Oster so far...I&#x27;ll write back if I have problems cutting with it, but it seem clear to me that this is the best hair cutting tool on the market. Don&#x27;t hesitate to invest, if you cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> Garbage. The cord fell apart. The motor stopped working. Get a regular 76. Not even 90 days of function. Oster is a great company. This clipper doesn&#x27;t belong in their line up. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my hard earned dollars on this.</li>
