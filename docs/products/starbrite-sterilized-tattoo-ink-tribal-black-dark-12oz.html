            <li> This was my first time using the Starbrite Tribal Black</li>
            <li> Solid and seems not to fade to bad after one week like most other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> everything i expected it to be arrived on time as always</li>
            <li> Gave 4 stars cause it had some odd bleeding and definitely can&#x27;t water down for shading but all in all I dig it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this ink yet just because I still have some black I&#x27;m using up, but the bottle size is hard to judge by the picture I thought it was a lot larger!</li>
            <li> it works so kno this tribal (shading) black will work</li>
            <li> have used starbrite then again not got dark green</li>
            <li> As specified, very black.</li>
            <li> Slow delivery</li>
    </ol>
