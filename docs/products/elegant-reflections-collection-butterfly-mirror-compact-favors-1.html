            <li>Super cute and perfect for my handbag!</li>
            <li>For some kind of favors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the design is nice too.</li>
            <li>The reflection is kind of gigantic.</li>
            <li>I can see my whole face in both mirrors, but it&#x27;s perfect for more cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>If one is ok with the quality then this compact may work as mirrors inserted are not bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took two days to receive and it comes in a lovely package.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Lovely, and well made</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Stuck this in my gym bag and it perfect for those times when I need to pluck a stray eyebrow hair or see the back of my head when doing my hair in the locker room.</li>
            <li>Cheap piece of junk; it fell apart in no time.</li>
            <li>I love the black with the beautiful butterfly.</li>
            <li>The magnifying feature on this is excellent for that and after the first night of having this I was able to find the problem that was irritating my eye.  </li>
            <li>It has a smaller mirror on top and a more focused mirror on bottom.</li>
            <li># Took pretty good pressure to open</li>
            <li>Basic but cute!</li>
            <li>It fits right into my handbag.</li>
            <li>Great item for little money!</li>
            <li>no issues with thei itms coming quickly, but not worth the cost for sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I expected, compact, cute and</li>
            <li>Small but sturdy, and very cute.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad product</li>
            <li>This DOES come in a clear plastic box type of package which is nice, but not necessarily worth the extra $3 unless you are looking specifically for the butterfly theme.  </li>
            <li>The little jewel at the point to open it is nice, too, though.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one and another one that was almost exactly like it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>then you can might want to check out the other designs that are similar to this style and are significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I got one to have a smaller than normal compact to fit into a small shoulder purse I have.</li>
            <li>Small circular mirror, one side is a greater magnified level than the other.  </li>
            <li>The item I received was cute but came straight out of the box scuffed, dirty, and cracked.</li>
            <li>After 7 years of long usage of my Claire&#x27;s compact mirror, I decided to buy another one as my old mirror&#x27;s glue got loosen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> After 7 years of long usage of my Claire&#x27;s compact mirror, I decided to buy another one as my old mirror&#x27;s glue got loosen.&lt;br /&gt;I looked &amp; searched on Amazon for purse compacts.Then I happen to like the picture of this compact. But it showed only one side that had butterfly printed on it, anyways I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received it I saw &amp; felt following problem with this compact mirror immediately :-&lt;br /&gt;# The back side of the mirror case has very low quality plastic which is coloured in silver. To me it isn&#x27;t something I could go with.&lt;br /&gt;# Mirrors are bit small.&lt;br /&gt;# Took pretty good pressure to open it.&lt;br /&gt;# It just the picture that looked good.&lt;br /&gt;# Quality is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To some this may work well if used only :-&lt;br /&gt;# For some kind of favors.&lt;br /&gt;# If one is ok with the quality then this compact may work as mirrors inserted are not bad.&lt;br /&gt;# The price is considered.&lt;br /&gt;# Seller sell it in various quantity which may help bulk buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it so I wont be having this for my personal use. Beautiful Butterfly though..</li>
            <li> Pros:  What an adorable mirror! It fits right into my handbag. I love the black with the beautiful butterfly. I had to order one for my best friend. Wonderful price and makes a great stocking stuffer. It took two days to receive and it comes in a lovely package. Cons: I cannot find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The item I received was cute but came straight out of the box scuffed, dirty, and cracked.</li>
            <li> no issues with thei itms coming quickly, but not worth the cost for sure. these ended up costing me  close to $20 each by the time i got them ,only to be highly  disappointed that they were cheap  plastic</li>
            <li> These did not meet my expectations costing what they did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected, compact, cute and I like butterflies so the design is nice too. I got one to have a smaller than normal compact to fit into a small shoulder purse I have.</li>
            <li> Bought these as gift and my people loved them.</li>
            <li> Just ok. No issues. Does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Probably my least favorite Amazon purchase. Not impressed.....</li>
            <li> The reflection is kind of gigantic. Fair warning, this might scare you. It gets every detail.</li>
            <li> This is so cute! It has a smaller mirror on top and a more focused mirror on bottom. I can see my whole face in both mirrors, but it&#x27;s perfect for more cosmetic purposes. It came faster then expected, and was packaged with care. Great item for little money!</li>
            <li> Small circular mirror, one side is a greater magnified level than the other.  Basic but cute!</li>
            <li> Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift and it looks amazing, perfect size and it&#x27;s just sleek</li>
            <li> big hit at the tea party everyone like them, they were the gift at my table</li>
            <li> Super cute and perfect for my handbag!</li>
            <li> Perfect and pretty and does what it is suppose to which is allow me to look at my beautiful self!</li>
            <li> Lovely, and well made</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror and did not know it was plastic at the time because it was  not posted as such. Cheap piece of junk; it fell apart in no time.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and another one that was almost exactly like it at the same time.  They were both great.  I don&#x27;t know how well they work for applying makeup... but I got this to keep in my bathroom to help me find whatever keeps ending up in my eye at night.  The magnifying feature on this is excellent for that and after the first night of having this I was able to find the problem that was irritating my eye.  It is very hard to see something tiny like that in a regular mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about the butterfly design then you can might want to check out the other designs that are similar to this style and are significantly cheaper.  This DOES come in a clear plastic box type of package which is nice, but not necessarily worth the extra $3 unless you are looking specifically for the butterfly theme.  The little jewel at the point to open it is nice, too, though.  Overall, not a bad product but if you are on a budget look at the other ones!  For reference, the price when I purchased was around $5.50 before any taxes.</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Plastic (inside and out) .  Mine arrived scuffed and looked like they may have been used before.</li>
            <li> i love it. use it almost everyday for makeup. definitely recommend buying it</li>
            <li> simply beautiful and the right size to carry it everywhere in your bag !!</li>
            <li> Stuck this in my gym bag and it perfect for those times when I need to pluck a stray eyebrow hair or see the back of my head when doing my hair in the locker room. Small but sturdy, and very cute.</li>
            <li> Convenient. Great quality. Great price.</li>
