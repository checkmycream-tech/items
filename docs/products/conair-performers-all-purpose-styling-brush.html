            <li>Wonderful brush!!!</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t fall apart soon, I&#x27;ll be very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>I know from being in AVON for 11 years, that boar&#x27;s hair bristle brushes are the best for your hair &amp; scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks awesome after I brush it.</li>
            <li>Great hair brush!  </li>
            <li>Best brush on planet earth, started using it in &#x27;08 and have never purchased another brush.</li>
            <li>A really wonderful hairbrush.</li>
            <li>The handle is anti-slip and the design is beautiful.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>but unfortunately....it&#x27;s the wood that makes the brush attractive.</li>
            <li>Great product..</li>
            <li>when I go to get my ends trimmed, I bring my own boars hair brush!  </li>
            <li>Good brush inside my expectations</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush and it was so good</li>
            <li>These are not detanglers and you should not expect them to be good at detangling.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with the product,  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect to need a new one anytime soon, but am very happy with the ones I already own!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find one in Rochester, glad to find it online!</li>
            <li>I despise all of the plastic/rubber tipped (yank my hair out) style of hair brushes that are so popular.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice grip.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I had no idea</li>
            <li>This brush is the perfect size, looks good, but should be used as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; brush only.  </li>
            <li>It naturally distributes the oils to your ends, for healthy, beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair brush.</li>
            <li>One of the better brushes I&#x27;ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li>I never used these types, and wanted to try, but now am trying those Tangle Tamer Brush to see if that is better for me.</li>
            <li>We all have a favorite hair brush we use all the time at home.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re supposed to redistribute oil from the scalp to the ends of the hair, where it&#x27;s needed, or spread healthy styling oil (like Jojoba) evenly through the hair.</li>
            <li>MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are authentic boars hair bristles</li>
            <li>At any rate, this may not be best as your ONLY brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this brush; however, I have found that it promotes static</li>
            <li>after comparing the 100% Boar Bristle Brushes against each other, this one had the best price.</li>
            <li>has a nice \\&quot;firm\\&quot; grip on it, and if you&#x27;re gentle, you can get every tangle out.</li>
            <li>even (i.e., all of it is smooth instead of just some parts).</li>
            <li>I like to do a good soft 100 stroke brushing at night.</li>
            <li>this brush is extremely good at is distributing natural oils evenly through the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting 2 more today, so I have them in my purse, the bathroom, and right by my bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush is gentle to use, too, and does not pull out or remove many hairs from my head.</li>
            <li>It is pretty cool looking as well!~</li>
            <li>use a fine toothed comb to take the hair out of the brush; then turn on the water faucet to really hot</li>
            <li>I also ordered a satin pillow case, so it would be great if the brush and pillow case combo slowed down the split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>so I have to use Static Guard while flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>really helps keep the texture of my hair</li>
            <li>This Conair Boar Bristle brush gently removes tangles and seems to fluff my hair, making it look like I have even more.  </li>
            <li>Had one, nice to buy another several years later.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t judge if it is breaking my hair, or just catching all the loose ones (I have very long hair), compared to the regular wired brushes, even though these particular brushes claim to be better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>The BBB distributed the Jojoba MUCH better than the plastic brushes did, and my thick spirals looked very nice brushed into loose waves with evenly distributed sheen</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>Completely made of boar bristle and not so soft that the bristles bend before reaching the scalp like so many I&#x27;ve tried (or they are reinforced with plastic bristle so they are really only 50/50).</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was about ready to give up on natural bristle brushes and then I realized I was using them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be SO nice not to be forced into a pony or updo once my spirals need brushing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to hold and the construction of the whole brush seems sturdy (the same is true for other, similar Conair brushes).</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that I usually wear up and this brush makes my hair smooth and shiny like nothing else.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not firm, and not soft, but just right for smoothing.</li>
            <li>I ordered another and threw my old one away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t frequently go to a salon, because of the chemical laden shampoos and conditioners they use, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, hubby has a sensitive scalp, and likes how the Boar Bristle Brushes doesn&#x27;t hurt his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 65, and have hair that is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So far, no bristles have come out.</li>
            <li>They should just name this &amp;#34;Brush&amp;#34; because it is everything you&#x27;d want from a natural boar brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other boar hair bristle brushes, and this one did seem pricey, but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I have to use a detangling brush first when my hair is wet</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t go through my thick hair at all, which is fine, since I knew it probably wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tender-headed &amp; need a soft brush, but this doesn&#x27;t go all the way through my hair - only the outer part.</li>
            <li>After each time I swish it through the water, I gently knock the brush, bristle side down, on a folder up</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This brush feels good, not too soft, not too hard as one of the 3 bears would say &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  I have thin hair, and have to be careful with bristles that are too hard, they damage your hair, too soft no impact.</li>
            <li> Just bought a new one a few days ago.</li>
            <li> What I do is apply the argan oil to dry hair using only my hands, then use this brush to distribute the oil.</li>
            <li> It has soft yet firm brissels.</li>
            <li> As long as there&#x27;s no update from me, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart ^_^</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, as I said I&#x27;ve used it since 08</li>
            <li> Bristles could be a little more stiff to actually brush through the hair, and I did find broken off bristles in the sink, so I guess eventually I would end up with a brush with no bristles.  </li>
            <li> do this several times, and then allow the brush to dry bristle side down, thoroughly, on a dry</li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t soak the bristles or the brush...but rather run it under the water, careful not to let the water stay on the wood surface too long.</li>
            <li> Then after all my hair was oiled, I smoothed it all back down into loose waves.</li>
            <li> It is easy, and far less painful, to have long hair because of this brush!!  </li>
            <li> Not too hard and not too soft....</li>
            <li> have long, dyed hair, and I finger comb my towel dried hair, and then wait until it&#x27;s completely dry before brushing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I use this brush at all other times.</li>
            <li> and I would never use those horrible plastic bristle brushes that are so popular, especially in salons.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It invigorates your scalp and distributes oil down to the end of your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> the wood tends to turn black from the water and will eventually start to peal.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use conditioner in my hair because it weighs the hair down and leaves it flat, but this brush makes conditioning unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Instead, I did small sections, from scalp to ends, to spread the oil.</li>
            <li> If you have hair that&#x27;s somewhat thick, the bristles probably won&#x27;t even reach all the way through.</li>
            <li> My hair must be too thick for it to penetrate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wood is cracked and when I hand remove just a few hairs, bristles come out with the hair.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are weird as they don&#x27;t seem to want to go through my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> (I could be wrong).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read bad reviews of Boar Bristle Brushes because the brush didn&#x27;t go through people&#x27;s hair.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this hair brush. It has soft yet firm brissels. One of the better brushes I&#x27;ve seen on the market. It is pretty cool looking as well!~</li>
            <li> I despise all of the plastic/rubber tipped (yank my hair out) style of hair brushes that are so popular.  This Conair Boar Bristle brush gently removes tangles and seems to fluff my hair, making it look like I have even more.  It is easy, and far less painful, to have long hair because of this brush!!

            <li> Good brush inside my expectations</li>

I never used these types, and wanted to try, but now am trying those Tangle Tamer Brush to see if that is better for me.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product,  Have used conair in the past,,,,recommend</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wood is cracked and when I hand remove just a few hairs, bristles come out with the hair.  Would not recommend this brush.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Completely made of boar bristle and not so soft that the bristles bend before reaching the scalp like so many I&#x27;ve tried (or they are reinforced with plastic bristle so they are really only 50/50). Plastic bristles hurt the hair shaft. Bought several; for home, travel bag, gym, and RV.</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect size, looks good, but should be used as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; brush only.  Wetting the bristles is asking for a short life span for the brush....the wood tends to turn black from the water and will eventually start to peal.  An improvement for this would be to make it plastic rather than wood...but unfortunately....it&#x27;s the wood that makes the brush attractive.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Fast shipping. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> We all have a favorite hair brush we use all the time at home. I needed a hair brush to leave at my second home. I purchased this brush and it was so good I ordered another and threw my old one away. Nice product.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I have been using for years.  I have very long, fine hair and I would never use those horrible plastic bristle brushes that are so popular, especially in salons.  I don&#x27;t frequently go to a salon, because of the chemical laden shampoos and conditioners they use, but when I go to get my ends trimmed, I bring my own boars hair brush!  It naturally distributes the oils to your ends, for healthy, beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> Wish the bristles were longer.  I&#x27;m tender-headed &amp; need a soft brush, but this doesn&#x27;t go all the way through my hair - only the outer part.</li>
            <li> This brush feels good, not too soft, not too hard as one of the 3 bears would say &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  I have thin hair, and have to be careful with bristles that are too hard, they damage your hair, too soft no impact.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush!!! Definitely my go to!!!</li>
            <li> Since deciding to embrace my silvers, I&#x27;ve been studying how to grow hair faster - that&#x27;s how I learned about Boar Bristle Brushes. I&#x27;ve read bad reviews of Boar Bristle Brushes because the brush didn&#x27;t go through people&#x27;s hair. Well from my recent research on them, they&#x27;re not supposed to go through, or detangle hair. They&#x27;re supposed to redistribute oil from the scalp to the ends of the hair, where it&#x27;s needed, or spread healthy styling oil (like Jojoba) evenly through the hair. I used a plastic brush to spread out the Jojoba oil, but they left obvious oiled areas. The BBB distributed the Jojoba MUCH better than the plastic brushes did, and my thick spirals looked very nice brushed into loose waves with evenly distributed sheen my hair doesn&#x27;t have without oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t go through my thick hair at all, which is fine, since I knew it probably wouldn&#x27;t. Instead, I did small sections, from scalp to ends, to spread the oil. Then after all my hair was oiled, I smoothed it all back down into loose waves. It&#x27;ll be SO nice not to be forced into a pony or updo once my spirals need brushing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boar Bristle Brushes are also supposed to help prevent split ends, but it&#x27;s too soon for me to tell. I also ordered a satin pillow case, so it would be great if the brush and pillow case combo slowed down the split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, hubby has a sensitive scalp, and likes how the Boar Bristle Brushes doesn&#x27;t hurt his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after comparing the 100% Boar Bristle Brushes against each other, this one had the best price. If it doesn&#x27;t fall apart soon, I&#x27;ll be very happy with this brush. As long as there&#x27;s no update from me, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart ^_^</li>
            <li> I know from being in AVON for 11 years, that boar&#x27;s hair bristle brushes are the best for your hair &amp; scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It invigorates your scalp and distributes oil down to the end of your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice \\&quot;firm\\&quot; grip on it, and if you&#x27;re gentle, you can get every tangle out. Remember never to pull at your hair with ANY brush, it stretches your hair, causing it to split &amp; break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, dyed hair, and I finger comb my towel dried hair, and then wait until it&#x27;s completely dry before brushing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 65, and have hair that is soft and silky. No split ends. I like to do a good soft 100 stroke brushing at night. That&#x27;s like giving your hair an instant conditioning &amp; strengthens it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other boar hair bristle brushes, and this one did seem pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a fine toothed comb to take the hair out of the brush; then turn on the water faucet to really hot; I don&#x27;t soak the bristles or the brush...but rather run it under the water, careful not to let the water stay on the wood surface too long. After each time I swish it through the water, I gently knock the brush, bristle side down, on a folder up towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this several times, and then allow the brush to dry bristle side down, thoroughly, on a dry towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Conair for about 8 years now, and am \\&quot;just\\&quot; starting to see tiny hair cracks on the wood surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR? I&#x27;m getting 2 more today, so I have them in my purse, the bathroom, and right by my bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, CONAIR!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are weird as they don&#x27;t seem to want to go through my thin hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice any benefits to using this as I had to use my paddle brush as a follow up.  I don&#x27;t think these are authentic boars hair bristles (I could be wrong).</li>
            <li> I was about ready to give up on natural bristle brushes and then I realized I was using them (I have this boar one and several others from Conair in various shapes and sizes) incorrectly. These are not detanglers and you should not expect them to be good at detangling. If you have hair that&#x27;s somewhat thick, the bristles probably won&#x27;t even reach all the way through. At any rate, this may not be best as your ONLY brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this brush is extremely good at is distributing natural oils evenly through the hair. I am currently using the brush in conjunction with an argan oil treatment. What I do is apply the argan oil to dry hair using only my hands, then use this brush to distribute the oil. Uniform application of the oil really helps keep the texture of my hair even (i.e., all of it is smooth instead of just some parts). I just brush over the surface, but I do think this brush helps the oil penetrate through to the deeper layers of my hair, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is gentle to use, too, and does not pull out or remove many hairs from my head. So far, no bristles have come out. The handle is comfortable to hold and the construction of the whole brush seems sturdy (the same is true for other, similar Conair brushes). I don&#x27;t expect to need a new one anytime soon, but am very happy with the ones I already own!</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush. It doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair like plastic brushes. The handle has a nice grip. The only thing I wish it did well was massage my scalp. My hair must be too thick for it to penetrate. Other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this brush through Amazon but at a local drug store as a total impulse buy. I have long fine hair that I usually wear up and this brush makes my hair smooth and shiny like nothing else. I can&#x27;t use conditioner in my hair because it weighs the hair down and leaves it flat, but this brush makes conditioning unnecessary. My hair looks awesome after I brush it. Honestly, I had no idea boars bristles would make such a difference. Wish I had known years ago. I have to use a detangling brush first when my hair is wet but I use this brush at all other times. Think I&#x27;ll get another for my purse.</li>
            <li> Great hair brush!  Had one, nice to buy another several years later.  Couldn&#x27;t find one in Rochester, glad to find it online!</li>
            <li> Best brush on planet earth, started using it in &#x27;08 and have never purchased another brush. Just bought a new one a few days ago. The bristles are not firm, and not soft, but just right for smoothing. The handle is anti-slip and the design is beautiful. Lasts a long time, as I said I&#x27;ve used it since 08 and I&#x27;ve only ever owned two! They should just name this &amp;#34;Brush&amp;#34; because it is everything you&#x27;d want from a natural boar brush.</li>
            <li> A really wonderful hairbrush. Not too hard and not too soft....Just right for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I like this brush; however, I have found that it promotes static so I have to use Static Guard while flat ironing my hair.  This could definitely cause problems for someone with oily hair!</li>
