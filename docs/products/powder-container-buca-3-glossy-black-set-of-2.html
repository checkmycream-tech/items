            <li>This is definitely a great buy and great container for my mineral makeup!</li>
            <li>Plus the price was great....</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>I wanted a powder holder I could use with my own rush and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>They have nice size and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love them!!</li>
            <li>The good things is that I received 2 jars, so I will split it between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>But it is good.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>When i&#x27;d open the jar, powder would fly everywhere!</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!</li>
            <li>Bought Buca 3 because it was 40ml, hence i thoght it should be able to accommodate this volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did many searches to come across this container.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>but I still am able to use it f</li>
            <li>Preparing for shipping took a couple of days but the shipment arrived quick!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t fit a powder puff in the container.</li>
            <li>they are very useful.</li>
            <li>I needed some sifter jars for powder in my makeup kit, since the powder&#x27;s original packaging kept spilling product everywhere.</li>
            <li>These jars are really high quality and made with a durable plastic, with a sifter top that feels secure-</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy more of these..</li>
            <li>Wish it came with a flip cap top and was slightly larger but great to pack loose powder for travel.  </li>
            <li>I think it was worth the purchased</li>
            <li>I had a container of loose powder that came with its own brush applicator that could never be cleaned.</li>
            <li>perhaps having an item sitting next to the product would show size better</li>
            <li>I really like the powder containers a lot!  </li>
            <li>Anything more, look for one of the larger Buca jars.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The size is small and perfect for my week or less trips.  </li>
            <li>They also look really sleek with the shiny black top.</li>
            <li>if you are a makeup artist or lover, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had one whole MAC Studio Fix (barely used but cracked) and one halfway done Studio Fix.</li>
            <li>For reference, this container is the size of a Bare Minerals powder foundation.</li>

            <li> I use mineral makeup and always found the containers bothersome to bring with me for touch-ups or when traveling. When i&#x27;d open the jar, powder would fly everywhere! This container works perfectly in storing my mineral foundation. The locking mechanism is perfect for keeping the powder where it&#x27;s supposed to be. I&#x27;ve already purchased a second one!</li>
            <li> I love these! Plus the price was great....I like to make gifts for my friends and these containers are peefect.</li>
            <li> they are very useful. ill like to use them for more than just powder. I think it was worth the purchased</li>
            <li> This is such a great product! I needed some sifter jars for powder in my makeup kit, since the powder&#x27;s original packaging kept spilling product everywhere. These jars are really high quality and made with a durable plastic, with a sifter top that feels secure- I even held it upside down and shook it a bit, and no product came out. They also look really sleek with the shiny black top. if you are a makeup artist or lover, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> much smaller than expected.....perhaps having an item sitting next to the product would show size better</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was exactly as described. I use it to mix two shades of my powder foundation. For reference, this container is the size of a Bare Minerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li> These are great.They do what they&#x27;re supposed to. Haven&#x27;t let me down so far.</li>
            <li> These were just as listed. I used them to make dusting powder.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and it seemed like like there was some confusion on if the quantity of 1 order had 2 powder containers or 1 powder container.  I ended up ordering 3 and each order came with 2 powder containers.  I really like the powder containers a lot!  They are great for all my makeup powders!  I would not suggest these for eye shadow containers, but that is my personal preference.  This is definitely a great buy and great container for my mineral makeup!</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in my broken pressed powders. I had one whole MAC Studio Fix (barely used but cracked) and one halfway done Studio Fix. Thought I would combine the two (15g + app 7.5g) and use as loose powder. Bought Buca 3 because it was 40ml, hence i thoght it should be able to accommodate this volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it looks like the volume is 40ml without the sifter. If you place the sifter, then its only half this volume!! The good things is that I received 2 jars, so I will split it between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for that. If you are looking to pour 15-20 g of product, buy this. Anything more, look for one of the larger Buca jars.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Solid product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was a divider in the middle. But it is good.</li>
            <li> I travel often and needed a way to carry my ben nye loose powders.  I did many searches to come across this container. The price is excellent.  The size is small and perfect for my week or less trips.  It could even last a month.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The sifter thingy on the inside closes and opens so spilling is reduced or eliminated.  You get 2 containers for the price  - not one. Preparing for shipping took a couple of days but the shipment arrived quick!</li>
            <li> I had a container of loose powder that came with its own brush applicator that could never be cleaned. I wanted a powder holder I could use with my own rush and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased them because my loosing powder container was broken. They have nice size and excellent quality. Absolutely love them!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry it around in your purse. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This was almost what I was looking for but it works. It was a tad smaller but I still am able to use it f</li>
            <li> Had some solid powder in a compact- the compact fell and I didn&#x27;t want to waste the powder- This container is perfect for this reason.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a flip cap top and was slightly larger but great to pack loose powder for travel.  Has a lock mechanism so powder won&#x27;t come out.  I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for told a friend about them too.. I will most likely buy more of these..</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described.  I did&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because it is a bit smaller than anticipated.  You can&#x27;t fit a powder puff in the container.</li>
            <li> Not to bad but it leaps : /.</li>
