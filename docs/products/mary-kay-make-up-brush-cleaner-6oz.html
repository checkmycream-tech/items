            <li> I have used Clinque&#x27;s brush cleaner in the past and bought this to try since is wasn&#x27;t quite as expensive. Waste of money! Clinique&#x27;s brush cleaner works WAY better!</li>
            <li> I loved this makeup remover, it works great with out the bad odor and chemicals that many brush cleaners have. Plus it way more affordable than anything else I seen in the market.</li>
            <li> Love it made my makeup brushes very soft and clean</li>
            <li> This is the most worthless brush cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t clean your brushed at all. Not even a little. I was hoping to find a more affordable option for a daily brush cleaner and this is not it. Spend the extra cash on the Cinema Secret brush cleaner and you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is pure alchoho and perfume. It hurts my chest to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. My brushes started to shed and have been ruined. I now need to replace the brushes this cleaner destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and do not even consider this brush cleaner. Turn back now!!!</li>
            <li> This bottle is very big. I think it will last me about 3 months. It does very well cleaning the brushes. I don&#x27;t have that many but with my dark makeup it has been removing that really well and also my foundation brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean out my brushes and it leaves them clean and nice I have Mary Kay brushes so using this product will keep your brushes nice and clean. I didn&#x27;t order mine here I got mine from my mom because she sells marykay so I got mine for free((: You should give it try !</li>
            <li> So far so good... love the smell of the brushes after they dry :-)</li>
            <li> This came packaged as if someone had refilled the bottle. I don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;s contents either and would not recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> works just as expected</li>
            <li> wonderful. Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I like it and it was affordable.</li>
            <li> When I use it, I can really see the makeup come out but I do have to apply it a couple times to really clean it.</li>
            <li> It is very gently on your brushes and your skin. It does not leave your brushes stiff, and it leaves a nice discreet scent.</li>
            <li> Came open and leaked out a bit.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and cleans makeup brushes well.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush cleaner  cheap but very good product the size is ok I buy again  very good</li>
            <li> Doesnt work well for a day to day brush cleansing.  I was hoping to find something similar to the MAC cleanser for day to day wipes,in between my full washes.  This product barely works and is not worth the money</li>
            <li> Great Product! Came on time. I use it everyday. It def. cleans my makeup brushes. It has a great smell as well.</li>
            <li> well it certainly cleans</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really clean brushes well</li>
