            <li>and i love it too.</li>
            <li>This was something I had gotten for the wife in Hawaii many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this in many years, it&#x27;s just as I remembered it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a very special aunt that enjoyed a trip to Hawaii some time ago.</li>
            <li>my first bottle of Wicked Wahine was bought in Oahu 1969 and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since but have not bought any since then</li>
            <li>The vendor provided GREAT service in delivering my product within 3 days from Hawaii and reuniting me with an old love, Wicked Wahini.  </li>
            <li>It was a lovely floral with a gentle musky undertone, and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great I gave to my 90year old neighbor.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, I had received my first bottle as a gift many years ago, and used it sparingly as I wasn&#x27;t sure I could ever get anymore.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped out very quickly too.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought my mom and sister each a bottle.  </li>
            <li>So happy to see it back</li>
            <li>Fantastic company to deal with.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fruity smell, then this is not the perfume, but if you want a genuine Hawaiian made perfume, then this is it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still the original product.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased in a Oahu.</li>
            <li>When I discovered it on Amazon, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>had an idea it would be floral or sweet, super strong as well</li>
            <li>Amazing scent and brings back many memories of the Islands~~~</li>
            <li>I am complemented nearly every time I go out with it on, and  I highly recommend this product and am delighted to be able to now order it on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Easy order, quick deliver, exactly as stated and included a handwritten thank you note, written with Aloha!</li>
            <li>Special Aloha\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>If this is truly the original formula, then the batch from which my husband bought the scent for me years ago must have been a lucky aberration.</li>
            <li>Wicked Wahini is a delightful scent that stays on me (I have trouble with perfume \\&quot;wearing off\\&quot;) and is an absolute trigger for my husband.</li>
            <li>Production of the original was stopped and then brought back by popular demand.  </li>
            <li>I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD SMELL LIKE A FRESH BREEZE SANDY BEACH SUNSHINE OCEAN</li>
            <li>Looked it up just for fun</li>
            <li>,I HOPE THEY READ THIS AND MAKE IT RIGHT.</li>
            <li>I was elated to see it offered on Amazon, and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered Wicked Wahine while living just off Waikiki Beach.  </li>
            <li>First purchased it in Hawaii in 1971.  </li>
            <li>First time using this scent; it is entrancing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of an odd smell at first, but then I realized it gives my wife a breezy, fresh smell that feels somewhat like we&#x27;re at the beach (not tropical, just rather the smell of the ocean).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to find, but every bit as good as it ever was.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased six bottles of Wicked Wahine every year for over thirty years from Royal Hawaiian Perfumes and it has become my signature scent, an absolute part of me.  </li>
            <li>I am sure alot of people will like it ,it just isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>Got it fast...</li>
            <li>And, the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>it would be lovely on an older woman, or if you like scents similar to White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor...</li>
            <li>This is definitely a genuine Hawaiian perfume that a true islander would recognize from the past.  </li>
            <li>I always keep a supply of this particular fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have used this prufum since I was in Jr. High 24 years.  </li>
            <li>I expected this fragrance to be light and tropical with floral a fruity notes</li>
            <li>we used up live there</li>
            <li>This is a scent that never fails to bring back thoughts of Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Its really heavy with StroNG musk and jasmine notes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again, not just for her but certainly also for myself.</li>
            <li>and such a reasonable price from \\&quot;A</li>
            <li>BY FAR</li>
            <li>I have loved this perfume since I was a teenager (50 years ago) and have had a difficult time finding it in the East.  </li>
            <li>It is mild yet sensuous and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I will wear no other!</li>
            <li>I received Wicked Wahini as a present for my high school graduation in 1970, and have worn no other perfume since.</li>
            <li>No other fragrance is quite like it, and long lasting.</li>

            <li> No other fragrance is quite like it, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my aunt, she just loves the fragrance and it is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> it smells more like an old fragrance called Royal Secret, or Alfred Sung to me, not light but heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have spent allot trying other scents, even having a French perfumer concoct a personal scent for me.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands and the bottle is a little heavy and large.</li>
            <li> I sadly finally used the last of it a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> very subtle, smells like the fresh air subtlety scented with the flowers of Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Put on only a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Instead of a subtle hint of musk, it now has a heavy musky scent that completely overwhelms any other attribute, and lingers oppressively.</li>
            <li> previously bought it in Maui.....</li>
            <li> Stays on for a few hours</li>
            <li> It arrives at my door within a few days and I am never without it.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for the past 25 years</li>
            <li> Nothing in the least bit tropical or flowery about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SORRY</li>
            <li> HATE TO WASTE MONEY</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not only disappointed in the product, I&#x27;m appalled.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>

            <li> previously bought it in Maui..... love love love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who loves all scents Hawaiian. She says it is lovely!</li>
            <li> Ordered on a Sunday and delivered on Thursday.  Perfect</li>
            <li> The vendor provided GREAT service in delivering my product within 3 days from Hawaii and reuniting me with an old love, Wicked Wahini.  I will use this vendor again!  Love the service!</li>
            <li> I first discovered Wicked Wahine while living just off Waikiki Beach.  I liked it so much I bought my mom and sister each a bottle.  It is mild yet sensuous and long lasting.  It activates the olfactoy in men that they turn and follow their noses to that sexy aroma.  This is a must for every woman.  Men love it.  The best price I have found is at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I received Wicked Wahini as a present for my high school graduation in 1970, and have worn no other perfume since. I was devastated when they stopped production.  So happy to see it back and such a reasonable price from \\&quot;A Special Aloha\\&quot;.  I received my perfume in record time.  Fantastic company to deal with.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for many years, after having lived in Hawaii.  It&#x27;s still the original product.</li>
            <li> I discovered Wicked Wahine when I was in Hawaii in 88 and have loved it ever since.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have spent allot trying other scents, even having a French perfumer concoct a personal scent for me.  I have purchased six bottles of Wicked Wahine every year for over thirty years from Royal Hawaiian Perfumes and it has become my signature scent, an absolute part of me.  I am complemented nearly every time I go out with it on, and  I highly recommend this product and am delighted to be able to now order it on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Easy order, quick deliver, exactly as stated and included a handwritten thank you note, written with Aloha! Personal touch....</li>
            <li> I expected this fragrance to be light and tropical with floral a fruity notes -(maybe a bit of coconut) but I dont get a tropical feel from it at all. Its really heavy with StroNG musk and jasmine notes...it would be lovely on an older woman, or if you like scents similar to White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor...its just not my cup &#x27;o&#x27; tea.</li>
            <li> Great product for that price point.  Excellent service from the vendor.  Purchased this as a gift for my aunt, she just loves the fragrance and it is long lasting.  I also tried the fragrance and thought it was nice.  Since it was a perfume, it lasted all day.  A good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a genuine Hawaiian perfume that a true islander would recognize from the past.  My wife&#x27;s mother instantly recognized the perfume.  If you&#x27;re looking for a fruity smell, then this is not the perfume, but if you want a genuine Hawaiian made perfume, then this is it.  The smell is somewhat a mixture between talcum(baby powder) and seabreeze.  It&#x27;s kind of an odd smell at first, but then I realized it gives my wife a breezy, fresh smell that feels somewhat like we&#x27;re at the beach (not tropical, just rather the smell of the ocean).</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I was under the impression it would be smelling like Hawaiian flowers but that isn&#x27;t the fragrance at all it smells more like an old fragrance called Royal Secret, or Alfred Sung to me, not light but heavy.  I am sure alot of people will like it ,it just isn&#x27;t what I expected. I was looking for something that smelled more like Plumeria.</li>
            <li> The scent is earthy and spicey. When I wear it, it reminds me of my vacation to Hawaii. Put on only a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Its great I gave to my 90year old neighbor.She said it brought back some wonderful memories.And they were some good storys.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for my wife for better than 20 years. Originally purchased in a Oahu. Now able to buy it through Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> smells like linen.........  had an idea it would be floral or sweet, super strong as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SORRY BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST SENT I HAVE EVER SMELLED.THIS IS NOT FOR A WOMEN.I GOT A HEADACHE LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE..I ALSO DON&#x27;T LIKE THE FACT IT CAN&#x27;T BE RETURNED.I HATE TO WASTE MONEY I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD SMELL LIKE A FRESH BREEZE SANDY BEACH SUNSHINE OCEAN INSTEAD I GOT SLAMMED WITH A SMELL I CAN&#x27;T DESCRIBE.I GUESS IT WILL GO IN THE DRAW WITH THE REST OF THE JUNK I ORDER THE GOOD THING IS IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY NICE COMPANY THE SENT A NICE NOTE WITH THE PERFUME,I HOPE THEY READ THIS AND MAKE IT RIGHT.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  We lived in Hawaii in the 60&#x27;s where I was introduced to Wicked Wahine.  My husband was stationed on Oahu in the Navy.  I was happy to receive this in the mail, very well packaged, too.  Thank you.  Aloha!!</li>
            <li> This is not at all the same perfume I got back in the day. I tried 4 different times contacting the seller and never got a reply. This perfume smells like babypowder and your grannys hair after church on Sunday. Nothing in the least bit tropical or flowery about this.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, I had received my first bottle as a gift many years ago, and used it sparingly as I wasn&#x27;t sure I could ever get anymore.  I sadly finally used the last of it a few years ago.  I was elated to see it offered on Amazon, and ordered it right away.  I received my package quickly and it is as wonderful as I remembered.  I will order again, as I&#x27;m not using it sparingly anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as a gift for Christmas. She had been using this decades ago until it went out of production. It has a beautiful scent that smells very very feminine. To this day mom loves this, and I love it too. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again, not just for her but certainly also for myself.</li>
            <li> Great... Love it... Got it fast... Nice note!!</li>
            <li> My Mom was ecstatic !  affordable and authentic. we used up live there and it&#x27;s her favorite! xxxx xxxxx xxxx</li>
            <li> This has been my perfume for 40 years.  I will wear no other!</li>
            <li> Got it in Hawaii 40yrs ago on my honeymoon and love it since then, sooooo happy to find it on line</li>
            <li> every time i wear it , every time..., my husband tells me i smell good. and i love it too. very subtle, smells like the fresh air subtlety scented with the flowers of Hawaii. And it lasts until you wash it off, but it is never ever overpowering!</li>
            <li> Lover this scent, reminds me of when I was a teenager and I used to wear it then.  Was shipped out very quickly too.</li>
            <li> This was something I had gotten for the wife in Hawaii many years ago.  Looked it up just for fun and there it was.  Was one of the best stocking stuffers I ever came up with.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a few hours</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!  I have been wearing it for the past 25 years and I still get compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  First purchased it in Hawaii in 1971.  When I discovered it on Amazon, I was so excited.  It is as I remember it and am happy to be able to purchase it again.  And, the price is reasonable.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> First time using this scent; it is entrancing.</li>
            <li> Production of the original was stopped and then brought back by popular demand.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to find, but every bit as good as it ever was.  It&#x27;s a unique fragrance and a very good value.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very special aunt that enjoyed a trip to Hawaii some time ago. She wanted to remember her wonderful time there by wearing the fragrance. .</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since I was a teenager (50 years ago) and have had a difficult time finding it in the East.  Now, I just go online and order it from Amazon.  It arrives at my door within a few days and I am never without it.  I don&#x27;t have to save it for a special occasion anymore!!</li>
            <li> I received this fragrance when I was 16 from my boyfriend who bought it on his vacation in Hawaii.  I hoped this would be the same, but it wasn&#x27;t. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> my favorite store bought perfume great value</li>
            <li> This is a scent that never fails to bring back thoughts of Hawaii. I always keep a supply of this particular fragrance. I just wish it was possible to get a smaller size cologne spray. I have arthritic hands and the bottle is a little heavy and large. Still, I would never stop buying it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne when I lived in Florida years ago.  I have also purchased this in Hawaii.  Love it and am happy I found it online.  No other fragrance is quite like it, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in many years, it&#x27;s just as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> Wicked Wahine fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great reminder of Hawaii in 1981.....love it</li>
            <li> I had to have this perfume.....my first bottle of Wicked Wahine was bought in Oahu 1969 and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since but have not bought any since then so I was happy when I saw it on Amazon!  Amazing scent and brings back many memories of the Islands~~~</li>
            <li> Wicked Wahini is a delightful scent that stays on me (I have trouble with perfume \\&quot;wearing off\\&quot;) and is an absolute trigger for my husband. Grab this stuff. It&#x27;s great perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> I have used this prufum since I was in Jr. High 24 years.  Used to come in a cream form. It&#x27;s the best and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Forty years ago my husband and I honeymooned in Hawaii, and one of the gifts he gave to me from the islands was an enchanting perfume: Wicked Wahine. It was a lovely floral with a gentle musky undertone, and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been many years now since we have been able to return to the beautiful Aloha State, so when I saw Wicked Wahine available online, I took the opportunity to buy it as a reminder of happy days gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not only disappointed in the product, I&#x27;m appalled. Instead of a subtle hint of musk, it now has a heavy musky scent that completely overwhelms any other attribute, and lingers oppressively. If this is truly the original formula, then the batch from which my husband bought the scent for me years ago must have been a lucky aberration.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as coconut smelling as I hoped it was okay but would have liked a stronger perfume than it was</li>
