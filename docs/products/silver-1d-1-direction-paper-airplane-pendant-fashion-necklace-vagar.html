            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it! The plane is pretty strong, the chain however is a little on the fragile side but was expected for the price. Over all I give it a 4 star. They lose a star for the weakness in the chain. But for the price I&#x27;ll give them a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Very cute and is on a nice long chain also. I wish it had different links to make the necklace shorter or longer depending on what shirt I&#x27;m wearing but other than that it is a great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Fit good not  to lose not to tight</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> Absolutly  love it!! Its small, simple, and beautiful!</li>
            <li> was shorter than I anticipated and took a while. Still a great price and would recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> Cheaply  made, this necklace  has broken  multiple  times .</li>

            <li> Came fast &amp; will be given as a gift to my best friend, I think she will love it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my niece for Christmas. It arrived earlier than expected, but I must say that it looked so much better online than in person. The quality is lacking. It is bumpy and quite frankly looks as if it came from a quarter gumball machine. I did give it 3 stars because despite it&#x27;s shoddy appearance my niece loved it.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s really pretty and arrived earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great my boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> I just got it today and it looks the same as it did in the add this was a good choice and did live up to my expectation</li>
            <li> It could have been longer</li>
            <li> It is nicely made and super cute. I get a lot of complements when I where it. It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> It is starting to discolor a little now, but the person I gave it to wears it everyday, so I think that is to be expected. She loves it.</li>
            <li> its a bit smaller than i thought it would be but its perfect.</li>
            <li> awesome the chain is pretty good quality ijust wish i could get another one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as it shows and says. The chain is good and it&#x27;s an easy one to clasp. I would recommend this to anybody who is thinking about buying this. It looks just like Harry&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, as expected but I love this necklace so much i wear it all the time. Looks good and has great quality!</li>
            <li> Arrived on predicted date. The product is exactly as it was described, and completely intact and brand new. Very happy with my purchase and everything seems to be just fine. I am not sure when it will tarnish, but I have seen other reviews saying to coat it in clear nail polish to keep it from tarnishing. Overall great service.</li>
