            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first decorative hair stick.</li>
            <li>This hair stick is pretty, sturdy,  &amp;  holds my hair up.  </li>
            <li>overall really pleased</li>
            <li>The stones are pretty and they&#x27;re all intact.</li>
            <li>Mine looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Higher quality than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t show just how pretty this hair accessory is.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure it isn&#x27;t too tight and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>This item is very pretty however it is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>I love it ,but it took long time to deliver.</li>
            <li>I have long, tightly coiled natural hair and these work perfectly to hold up buns, bunned twists or rolled ponytails.</li>
            <li>In the add it should say that it is shipped from China , I certainly would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, all the gems are intact and they don&#x27;t look like those cheap plastic gems, they actually look like polished stones.</li>
            <li>The stones are glued in but seem to be staying in place really well.</li>
            <li>Does not look anything like pictured, did not receive it for Christmas , was very dissappointed,</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these and am very pleases with them.  </li>
            <li>For this price, I&#x27;m surprised at how much of a quality product this is!</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and it works really well in her hair.</li>
            <li>These are really nice hair picks, solidly put together without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>The larger stones are the same color and placement on both, however, the rhinestones are the four primary</li>
            <li>Lovvvve this and exaclent quality holds my hair in place and I have long thick fine hair so not an easy task</li>
            <li>Pretty, feels well constructed, very solid.</li>
            <li>But the little dangle thing (which is a fine chain) got all tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I do think, if your hair is thick or fine, it may not hold really well.</li>
            <li>It holds my waist length hair with no other help.</li>

            <li> My hair is just getting long enough to hold up with one and</li>
            <li> Was a little behind schedule,  but It was worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> Same as the other hair clip</li>
            <li> Item arrived before sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy but stays in my hair, I have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> No missing stones and nothing is broken.</li>
            <li> colors(red, yellow, blue and green) and pink, purple and turqouise rhinestones randomly dispersed.  </li>
            <li> I like the design, but I have lost the dangling beads after two time wearing it, not very strong, but what does one expect from a product made in China.  </li>
            <li> Its slightly  bulky but the hair stick surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> The stem is slightly textured which I think helps keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I usually put up in a plain claw clip, this adds a bit of dazzle without spending a lot of time fooling with it.</li>
            <li> It should be easy for her to push the stem thru the base of the tail.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the topper decoration is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> It was really heavy too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty enough I guess, but I received the wrong color which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to stay in your hair.</li>

            <li> Item arrived before sooner than expected. This item exceeds my expectations because it is GORGEOUS. No missing stones and nothing is broken. The colors are so vibrant. Looks awesome in your up-dos. Love it so much. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very cute and well made. Super price. It is a little heavy but stays in my hair, I have long curly hair. The stones are glued in but seem to be staying in place really well.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought a stick type hair pin before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. But I&#x27;m pleased to say it is quite sturdy and can hold up my thick, long and heavy hair. And it seems like the metal will hold up over time. I do think, if your hair is thick or fine, it may not hold really well.</li>
            <li> Does not look anything like pictured, did not receive it for Christmas , was very dissappointed, In the add it should say that it is shipped from China , I certainly would not have ordered it.</li>

            <li> I have long hair and I am very pleased with a different way to style my hair because I have a colorful personality, I love these</li>
            <li> This is my first decorative hair stick. My hair is just getting long enough to hold up with one and this stays in nicely. Colors are really nice too.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good timing. i would recommend to a friend. the product looks just as photoed. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This hair stick is pretty, sturdy,  &amp;  holds my hair up.  But the little dangle thing (which is a fine chain) got all tangled in my hair.  Ouch! And how uncool walking around thinking my hair looks good when the thing is all tangled up.  Lost some hair getting that stick out.  Part of the reason I bought it was for the dangle but I took it off.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do this piece justice and for the price it is a steal! I wore it to work and in the first hour, I received many compliments. I am going to order a couple more to give out as gifts.</li>
            <li> Makes any hairdo all the more elegant.... I have bought a few of these and I will keep on buying I love them</li>

            <li> The hairpiece looks as amazing as shown in the picture and works really good even with holding all of my long hair  (: overall really pleased</li>
            <li> just love this in my hair! colors are just beautiful and looks great with the sparkling colors dotting my hair!</li>
            <li> I like the design, but I have lost the dangling beads after two time wearing it, not very strong, but what does one expect from a product made in China.  Cost reflects the cheapness.</li>
            <li> These are really nice hair picks, solidly put together without being too heavy. The stones are pretty and they&#x27;re all intact. The stem is slightly textured which I think helps keep it in place. I have long hair that I usually put up in a plain claw clip, this adds a bit of dazzle without spending a lot of time fooling with it. I ordered two, one to keep and one I&#x27;ll be happy to give as a gift to a young woman who frequently has her hair in a pony tail. It should be easy for her to push the stem thru the base of the tail.</li>
            <li> Although it took a while to get here, i absolutely loved it(Gave it to my sister as a present as she liked it too much:) The details are very nice(no missing stones or anything) and looks like an antique hair pin. I have bought another hair clip from this seller and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite hair pin, and I always receive complements on it.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Mine looks exactly as pictured. the stones are neatly put in place and its heavy but not too much to where you wouldnt want to wear it. i really like it.</li>
            <li> Was a little behind schedule,  but It was worth the wait!! So beautiful and exquisite!!! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely beautiful and of a high quality.I can&#x27;t believe the quality based on the price.The crystals are bright and there is a real harmony of colorIt is a beautiful, heavy piece of jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;Looks much nicer than I expected.Get complements on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Pretty, feels well constructed, very solid. A nice hair decoration, but very dressy. Looks like a much more expensive item.</li>
            <li> Higher quality than I thought it would be.  Definitely seems to be sturdy enough to last.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the topper decoration is a bit heavy.  It can cause your bun to loosen over several hours.  The stick is 4.5&amp;#34; not including the topper and with the topper it is 6.25&amp;#34; long.  Very pretty and more &amp;#34;blingy&amp;#34; than the picture depicts.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and am very pleases with them.  The larger stones are the same color and placement on both, however, the rhinestones are the four primary colors(red, yellow, blue and green) and pink, purple and turqouise rhinestones randomly dispersed.  I like these sticks alot.  I have been trying to find similar hair sticks for several years.  I wore them as a child when my family was stationed in Japan for several years and after returning to the U.S.  These are heavier than the children&#x27;s version I had years ago, but they are well made, especially for this price!</li>
            <li> This is beautiful!  It was really heavy too.  Matches perfectly with the bracelet, bobbie pins, and big hair clip.  Nice accent</li>
            <li> The item was just like in the pic.</li>
            <li> The accessory is unique and has several accent gems in different colors that can be a beautiful hair piece anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t show just how pretty this hair accessory is.  You can&#x27;t see how it sparkles in the light, or how intricate the details are.  VERY satisfied here.</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully made accessory for any woman&#x27;s hair and I have gotten so many compliments on it. I have long, tightly coiled natural hair and these work perfectly to hold up buns, bunned twists or rolled ponytails. Just make sure it isn&#x27;t too tight and you&#x27;ll be fine. I am thinking of purchasing another just to have a set.</li>
            <li> I had purchased two of these and my best friend and I love them! They were beautiful and look amazing in our hair</li>
            <li> This item is very pretty however it is kind of heavy so it is hard to stay in your hair. Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my sister and she loved it. It is not heavy and it works really well in her hair.</li>
            <li> this hair clip was very very very beautiful. I love it ,but it took long time to deliver. I get comments from every one when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair piece. It is the perfect length stick, a great color, strong, and beautiful. It holds my waist length hair with no other help.</li>
            <li> this is adorable and the quality far exceeds the price!</li>
