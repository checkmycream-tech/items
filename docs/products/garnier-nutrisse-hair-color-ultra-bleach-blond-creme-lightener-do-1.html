            <li>best ive ever used ive been trying to go platinum</li>
            <li>This brand was very good and did an excellent job of lightning</li>
            <li>This is a very very good store bought bleach system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might not be happy with this if you want to get super-duper blond just because, though.</li>
            <li>Shiseido is great.</li>
            <li>great product in fact</li>
            <li>I received good results from this product.</li>
            <li>Good thing they give you two packets.</li>
            <li>am very impressed with this bleach, very gentle on the hair(even with bleaching 3 times &amp; moist).</li>
            <li>Keep it healthy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this kind of hair coloring before.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I love this hair color.  </li>
            <li>, I still had to buy more toner.</li>
            <li>I got the T-28, much better now.</li>
            <li>On any brass the longer the better.</li>
            <li>Tones and bleach are much better for your hair</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair bleaches I&#x27;ve ever used,my hair was med brown on top(natural hair color) and went into a red color(dyed)normally I&#x27;d have to use two bottles of bleach to get the dyed part of my hair any where close to what my roots dye out to</li>
            <li>Use that after with 20 developer and DO keep it on 30 minutes, roots first, then run thru depending time wise on color of hair, mine being lighted 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Natural brown hair has orange undertones, that&#x27;s what makes the hair a beautiful brunette color.</li>
            <li>Followed up with revlon ultra light ash blonde dye for an awesome look...</li>
            <li>Bright orange hair with much, much lighter orange roots.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you are looking for good at-home bleach, don&#x27;t hesitate other brands since I tried most of them and this is my best at-home bleach, although I recommend professional bleach over this.</li>
            <li>Product was easy to use.</li>
            <li>really easy to set up just like any box dye.</li>
            <li>its so blonde and beautiful</li>
            <li>but I was kind of surprise of the lift it delivered with the first go.</li>
            <li>easy #102 Light Ash Blonde&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all it&#x27;s a great product for cheap, easy mixed at home lifts.</li>
            <li>i say if u want your hair light buy this</li>
            <li>Anyway, I knew I needed something more powerful.</li>
            <li>As far as box bleach this is really good beach.  </li>
            <li>Gentle brushing, your hair once very light is now like fine clothes.</li>
            <li>omg turned my hair bright blonde just like i wanted it</li>
            <li>For a simple bleach for medium brown or lighter its good.</li>
            <li>My dark blonde hair turns BRIGHT and gorgeous white and is extremely soft and smells awesome!</li>
            <li>I shampooed it out too quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair went from light brown to the exact color I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>this brand is for anyone who&#x27;s a first timer for doing this!</li>
            <li>It was my first time bleaching hair and found it easy to work with; I almost achieved the exact color I wanted.</li>
            <li>was so bright and blonde but a little to bright</li>
            <li>thank you very it works makes here light but its like bleach for lighting your hair.thank you.yes</li>
            <li>light copper very orange blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected this to do the same, but I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping third time&#x27;s the charm, but honestly I would go with another company.</li>
            <li>This product has a bleach-free lightening technology that transforms my medium-light brown hair into a warm blonde.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>Better than other box lighteners, but I still recommend having a fresh out of college girl do your hair for cheap!</li>
            <li>you get it right</li>
            <li>This is great and this really does take the black off your hair and turns it blondish.</li>
            <li>I only need to lighten my hair to dye over it with bright colors, so I don&#x27;t have an issue with it if it doesn&#x27;t get my hair platinum, just light enough to color over.</li>
            <li>Other than that I was very satisfied with this color and brand.</li>
            <li>Works really fast!</li>
            <li>this was my first time trying this product</li>
            <li>so when I first tryed this I was schocked my hair</li>
            <li>but with one bottle of this they&#x27;re pretty close</li>
            <li>it looked yellow but within a week it had toned down to a very pretty blonde and ended up very happy with results!!</li>
            <li>Still a good deal, maybe my hair is just stupid lol.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still a bleachy smell and you need to open a window or have good ventilation, but my eyes weren&#x27;t burning like they did the last time I bleached my hair.</li>
            <li>i had pretty light blonde hair</li>
            <li>It would be understandable if I had dark hair, but I had blonde plus I havent dyed my hair in over a year, so my hair should be fairly susceptible, right?</li>
            <li>used only one box for my waist length fine hair, (thought i would need 2 boxes).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this really helped.</li>
            <li>but it was so gentle on my hair and it didn&#x27;t hurt it so if your hair already blond go ahead and buy it üòç</li>
            <li>This hair color is very drying and can be damaging.</li>
            <li>It seems (toner) too light for brass or whiter blonde</li>
            <li>I get very depressed otherwise.</li>
            <li>This hair color is for blondes and light browned brunnetes ONLY</li>
            <li>This really lightened it but it doesn&#x27;t look like the color on the box.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting it to burn.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lift my medium brown hair nearly as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better, I&#x27;ve used worse but this will get the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the way your natural hair works, it can only turn so many shades at one time.</li>
            <li>Stripped a good deal of pink dye from my hair and turned my dark brown roots super light blonde.</li>
            <li>Garnier has a line that is specially made for brunettes trying to turn their hair blonde without brassiness, so try that not this.</li>
            <li>BUT luckily it was gentle enough on my hair that I did 2 lifts in one night then</li>
            <li>The conditioner it comes with really helps lock in the stands moisture, but if you feel like you may need a little more moisture, I would use any variety of oils.</li>
            <li>I still achieved a realistic color and will use this product again.</li>
            <li>gentle on my hair, my hair is still shiny &amp; soft, no damage at all.</li>
            <li>i tried it out there was more then enough for my hair because my hair is long</li>
            <li>I love looking at it everyday xD</li>
            <li>Medium Golden Blonde.</li>
            <li>After I colored my hair with this color I had to go out and buy a darker color to dye my hair darker and in a normal looking color again.</li>
            <li>while the bleach did not lighten as much as I would of liked, it looks very natural and left little to no damage.</li>
            <li>very moist, not dry at all, the smell is not bad at all, (just have a window open or a fan</li>
            <li>It comes with an oil that you put right into the developer bottle with the bleaching powder and a conditioning type cream (separate fro the actual conditioner that you use after you rinse it out).</li>
            <li>It says leave new growth hour, agreed.</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s b leached pale yellow first.</li>
            <li>did not take a long time, fast, came exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>For bleach leaves hair very soft .</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My ultimate goal was to bleach it, use toner, and then attempt to even the color out enough that I would eventually be able to go back to a normal, natural color.</li>
            <li>It came out the exact color no red or brass colors.</li>
            <li>I suggest also buying Wella T-18 for a whiter blonde, or T-28 for a light natural looking blonde.</li>
            <li>I use the LB3 and the tone is beautiful and far less damaging, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li>I did bleach my hair once before with Splat hair dye and it completely fried my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is still as soft and shiny as it was before I dyed it.</li>
            <li>for sensitive scalps</li>
            <li>so i could dye my hair blue thanks</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown hair</li>
            <li>I fixed it with some darker stuff from the store, but it don&#x27;t recommend this stuff unless you already have darker blond hair</li>
            <li>You have to understand the way natural hair colors work.</li>
            <li>I have naturally auburn hair</li>
            <li>Even with naturally orange hues in my hair this never leaves my hair brassy or off colored.</li>
            <li>Back then I would touch up my roots with Garnier Extra Light Platinum Blonde (111), but when I did a strand test, it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I used this product to bleach dark brown human hair weave to match my original color.</li>
            <li>My hair always was just a normal blonde.</li>
            <li>Of course, It might just be because I&#x27;m use to having an orange type tint to my hair as I&#x27;ve always had natural red highlights in my natural brunette hair.</li>
            <li>It got really messy really quick.</li>
            <li>Excellence Creme CC1 SOFT MEDIUM ASH BLONDE</li>
            <li>are so pale and not ugly yellow</li>
            <li>If your hair is too dark get quick blue or equivalent bleach and 30 maybe 40 peroxide, same toner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and delicate since my scalp is very sensitive...</li>
            <li>medium copper Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;(the dark brown dye is very stubborn)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very surprised about the lift but other than that, nothing really WOW me, since it smelt as strong as other bleach and deliver just as little less damage as professional bleach would.</li>

            <li> I did bleach my hair once before with Splat hair dye and it completely fried my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is still as soft and shiny as it was before I dyed it.</li>
            <li> for sensitive scalps</li>
            <li> so i could dye my hair blue thanks</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair</li>
            <li> I fixed it with some darker stuff from the store, but it don&#x27;t recommend this stuff unless you already have darker blond hair</li>
            <li> You have to understand the way natural hair colors work.</li>
            <li> I have naturally auburn hair</li>
            <li> Even with naturally orange hues in my hair this never leaves my hair brassy or off colored.</li>
            <li> Back then I would touch up my roots with Garnier Extra Light Platinum Blonde (111), but when I did a strand test, it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I used this product to bleach dark brown human hair weave to match my original color.</li>
            <li> My hair always was just a normal blonde.</li>
            <li> Of course, It might just be because I&#x27;m use to having an orange type tint to my hair as I&#x27;ve always had natural red highlights in my natural brunette hair.</li>
            <li> It got really messy really quick.</li>
            <li> Excellence Creme CC1 SOFT MEDIUM ASH BLONDE</li>
            <li> are so pale and not ugly yellow</li>
            <li> If your hair is too dark get quick blue or equivalent bleach and 30 maybe 40 peroxide, same toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and delicate since my scalp is very sensitive...</li>
            <li> medium copper Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;(the dark brown dye is very stubborn)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very surprised about the lift but other than that, nothing really WOW me, since it smelt as strong as other bleach and deliver just as little less damage as professional bleach would.</li>
            <li> So I had to dye my hair twice so far, double the time the instructions said, and there&#x27;s still slight yellow in my hair.</li>
            <li> Coconut, macadamia, argan, moroccan, or even simple olive oil can help replenish dry strand and especially the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a African American with dark brown hair,  this color kit will turn your hair blonde if you&#x27;re looking for a blonde color.  </li>
            <li> the no drop bottle was satisfying and the texture was soft light and fluffy , the smell wasn&#x27;t awful either like some bleach kit dyes</li>
            <li> Other kits would turn my hair red not blonde.  </li>
            <li> started on my lower half head of hair, then did the upper half, didn&#x27;t go near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took several more colorings with various ash blonde colors to get to the color I still hate, but can show without covering my head with a hat.</li>
            <li> Turned my hair brassy orange yellow because it doesn&#x27;t have a purple toner like other products.</li>
            <li> but this hair dye just made my hair turn yellow and not pretty at all.</li>
            <li> I started out with dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I still suggest using a toner (Wella T11 and 20 volume developer) afterwards to tone it down a bit as you definitely will have the brassiness.</li>
            <li> I used two boxes (my hair is down to my waist) and still had some left.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE should use this ESPECIALLY if you have dark hair!</li>
            <li> Its a little brassy but still very blonde.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> so i was curious</li>
            <li> I recommend to bleach hair first , Sadly my hair now orange, even when I used tuner üò¢</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t damage my hair too bad though and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> dark hair</li>
            <li> * dark copper brown 4 weeks ago</li>
            <li> Used this to lift a dyed dark brown colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used Color Fix Color remover before using this product, but it didn&#x27;t get all the semi-permanent dark brown hair dye</li>
            <li> /&gt;Result: It toned down the brightness of the orange.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> I have black hair medium length.</li>
            <li> but in reality its less damaging</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time using this product, I was afraid to leave it on for the stated lenght of time.</li>
            <li> I use to use Garnier all the time when I use to dye my hair every other month a couple of years ago, so idk if things changed over time or what happened, but im really not happy and if me dying it for the third time doesnt change anything, I&#x27;ll have to find something else, hopefully a product that does what it says its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I ust tried to lighten my hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> you have very dark hair like mine</li>
            <li> I use this instead of harsh bleach before dying my hair.</li>
            <li> Have bought a few times and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> No more orange</li>
            <li> I just had a hard time getting all the powder into the bottle.</li>
            <li> my hair[did cover the roots which are usually the hardest to cover!]</li>
            <li> There is the obvious brassiness associated with bleaching, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all with this product</li>
            <li> TO ALL YOU BRUNETTES OUT THERE, do not try to bleach your hair in one step using this, it will turn orange and it&#x27;s not because the product is bad, garnier&#x27;s products moisturize and make your hair stronger</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t that awful.</li>
            <li> on hair with no roots, and 30 min on all of hair including roots), and it turned out horrible.</li>

            <li> I decided to go back to blonde from a brunetteish red (my hair was probably 8 different shades and colors). My ultimate goal was to bleach it, use toner, and then attempt to even the color out enough that I would eventually be able to go back to a normal, natural color. I&#x27;ve never used this kind of hair coloring before. I typically purchase L&#x27;Oreal products. Surprisingly enough, this was on par with what I&#x27;m use to. I did bleach my hair once before with Splat hair dye and it completely fried my hair. I expected this to do the same, but I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with the results. It comes with an oil that you put right into the developer bottle with the bleaching powder and a conditioning type cream (separate fro the actual conditioner that you use after you rinse it out). I think this really helped. My hair is still as soft and shiny as it was before I dyed it. There is the obvious brassiness associated with bleaching, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad. Nothing that would make me be in a rush to tart using the toner. Of course, It might just be because I&#x27;m use to having an orange type tint to my hair as I&#x27;ve always had natural red highlights in my natural brunette hair. I still suggest using a toner (Wella T11 and 20 volume developer) afterwards to tone it down a bit as you definitely will have the brassiness. There&#x27;s no way around it. The smell wasn&#x27;t that awful. There&#x27;s still a bleachy smell and you need to open a window or have good ventilation, but my eyes weren&#x27;t burning like they did the last time I bleached my hair. The conditioner it comes with really helps lock in the stands moisture, but if you feel like you may need a little more moisture, I would use any variety of oils. Coconut, macadamia, argan, moroccan, or even simple olive oil can help replenish dry strand and especially the ends.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color.  I&#x27;m a African American with dark brown hair,  this color kit will turn your hair blonde if you&#x27;re looking for a blonde color.  I wear my hair cut very short and blonde.  Other kits would turn my hair red not blonde.  I have purchased this kit every months since 1/14.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Got the colour I wanted! This is perfect! Have bought a few times and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> It worked. Stripped a good deal of pink dye from my hair and turned my dark brown roots super light blonde. Followed up with revlon ultra light ash blonde dye for an awesome look...</li>
            <li> It came out the exact color no red or brass colors. My hair went from light brown to the exact color I wanted.  No fuzzy dryness.</li>
            <li> This is great and this really does take the black off your hair and turns it blondish.</li>
            <li> thank you very it works makes here light but its like bleach for lighting your hair.thank you.yes i say if u want your hair light buy this</li>
            <li> This brand was very good and did an excellent job of lightning my hair[did cover the roots which are usually the hardest to cover!] this brand is for anyone who&#x27;s a first timer for doing this!</li>
            <li> So I had to dye my hair twice so far, double the time the instructions said, and there&#x27;s still slight yellow in my hair. It would be understandable if I had dark hair, but I had blonde plus I havent dyed my hair in over a year, so my hair should be fairly susceptible, right? Not really. I&#x27;m hoping third time&#x27;s the charm, but honestly I would go with another company. I use to use Garnier all the time when I use to dye my hair every other month a couple of years ago, so idk if things changed over time or what happened, but im really not happy and if me dying it for the third time doesnt change anything, I&#x27;ll have to find something else, hopefully a product that does what it says its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I recommend to bleach hair first , Sadly my hair now orange, even when I used tuner üò¢ but it was so gentle on my hair and it didn&#x27;t hurt it so if your hair already blond go ahead and buy it üòç</li>
            <li> Perfect product! Works really fast! For bleach leaves hair very soft . Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Turned my hair brassy orange yellow because it doesn&#x27;t have a purple toner like other products. Really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I received good results from this product. Product was easy to use. Will use it again. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> while the bleach did not lighten as much as I would of liked, it looks very natural and left little to no damage. I would suggest buying two and doing two bleaches (with a week or two between)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair that color but it hasnt been happening. I thought that this might do it but it did not, I still had to buy more toner. it bleaches but not as well as I thought. did not take a long time, fast, came exactly as it says. really easy to set up just like any box dye. follow the instructions. Still a good deal, maybe my hair is just stupid lol.</li>
            <li> This is a very very good store bought bleach system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to mix up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great for sensitive scalps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lifts dark hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fairly cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Strong smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cap clogs so doesn&#x27;t always apply evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you have very dark hair like mine was you will need to do it 2-3 times BUT luckily it was gentle enough on my hair that I did 2 lifts in one night then another 3 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wi probably after about 2 weeks have to go over this with an ash blonde. That&#x27;s what I plan to do at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great product for cheap, easy mixed at home lifts.</li>
            <li> My hair was already blonde to begin with, but I wanted to lighten it. This ultra bleach blonde shade just made my hair yellow!! You MUST buy toner with this product!! It lightens well but to get it the color on the box I suggest also buying Wella T-18 for a whiter blonde, or T-28 for a light natural looking blonde. I got the T-28, much better now.</li>
            <li> This hair color is very drying and can be damaging. I had to use a beige toner after I used this product so that my hair wasn&#x27;t brassy. Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about lightening your hair, I would actually recommend a different product by Garnier. It&#x27;s the Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color (LB3). This product has a bleach-free lightening technology that transforms my medium-light brown hair into a warm blonde. I use the LB3 and the tone is beautiful and far less damaging, at least in my experience. Here&#x27;s the link to the product on Amazon, although it runs for about 7 dollars at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BEWWAKG Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Blonde]]</li>
            <li> work perfect to lighten my hair so i could dye my hair blue thanks</li>
            <li> I have black hair medium length. Will this bleach my hair lighter</li>
            <li> this was my first time trying this product so i was curious&lt;br /&gt;when i tried it out there was more then enough for my hair because my hair is long&lt;br /&gt;and the no drop bottle was satisfying and the texture was soft light and fluffy , the smell wasn&#x27;t awful either like some bleach kit dyes&lt;br /&gt;but yea it was Great thx!</li>
            <li> My hair is medium brown , I used &amp;#34;Revlon colorsilk buttercream , neutral blonde&amp;#34; and it made my hair a lighter brown so I bought this and omg yes &amp;#60;3 its so blonde and beautiful I love looking at it everyday xD</li>
            <li> As far as box bleach this is really good beach.  It is one of the more difficult ones to mix though. I shook it forever and it still managed to clog the tip and mid bleach job I had to resort to taking the cap off and doing it that way. It got really messy really quick.</li>
            <li> Orange hair. That is all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better, I&#x27;ve used worse but this will get the job done for the most part. I only need to lighten my hair to dye over it with bright colors, so I don&#x27;t have an issue with it if it doesn&#x27;t get my hair platinum, just light enough to color over. You might not be happy with this if you want to get super-duper blond just because, though.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because the last 6 months I dyed my hair the lightest blonde color and just didn&#x27;t lighten it enough I have naturally medium brown hair so when I first tryed this I was schocked my hair was so bright and blonde but a little to bright I thought my hair was ruined it looked yellow but within a week it had toned down to a very pretty blonde and ended up very happy with results!!üôå</li>
            <li> For a simple bleach for medium brown or lighter its good. I used as I would always to get the white look, wella toner t18. It seems (toner) too light for brass or whiter blonde but it i s not. Use that after with 20 developer and DO keep it on 30 minutes, roots first, then run thru depending time wise on color of hair, mine being lighted 10 minutes. On any brass the longer the better. Make sure it&#x27;s b leached pale yellow first. If your hair is too dark get quick blue or equivalent bleach and 30 maybe 40 peroxide, same toner. There is a YouTube Garnier video to help. It says leave new growth hour, agreed. The price? Condition all the time with best affordable. L&#x27;oreal Kerastatse when money is no matter. Shiseido is great. Your hair will also have to be touched up 2-4 weeks. I&#x27;m in the two week catagory. Pro&#x27;s you get it right &amp; nothing is sexier. Keep it healthy! Gentle brushing, your hair once very light is now like fine clothes. Is it worth it? If you are a blonde at heart, yes! I get very depressed otherwise.</li>
            <li> I was trying to go blonde last week in Japan and Japanese bleach does not work. I came back home from Japan and realized that I have purchased this bleach from Amazon and well, I gave it a try. My hair was *dyed* dark copper brown 4 weeks ago and I thought any bleach wouldn&#x27;t work (maybe paranoid?) but I was kind of surprise of the lift it delivered with the first go. Very surprised about the lift but other than that, nothing really WOW me, since it smelt as strong as other bleach and deliver just as little less damage as professional bleach would. It did not itch my scalp at all... It&#x27;s very gentle and delicate since my scalp is very sensitive... Anyway, if you are looking for good at-home bleach, don&#x27;t hesitate other brands since I tried most of them and this is my best at-home bleach, although I recommend professional bleach over this.</li>
            <li> IT WORKEDDDD SOOOOOOOOO WEELLLLL . omg turned my hair bright blonde just like i wanted it so i could dye my hair bluee! lovee it EVERYONE should use this ESPECIALLY if you have dark hair!</li>
            <li> Used this to lift a dyed dark brown colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Color Fix Color remover before using this product, but it didn&#x27;t get all the semi-permanent dark brown hair dye out.&lt;br /&gt;So i decided to use this Garnier Nutrisse Blonde Bleach D+ creme.&lt;br /&gt;I started on my lower half head of hair, then did the upper half, didn&#x27;t go near the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lifted my hair about 2-3 levels only.(dark copper blonde was the result)&lt;br /&gt;BUT, i timed it 60 minutes from starting to apply the bleach. So if i left it on longer, it would have lifted more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moist, not dry at all, the smell is not bad at all, (just have a window open or a fan on).&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle on my hair, my hair is still shiny &amp; soft, no damage at all. The conditioner is great.&lt;br /&gt;I used only one box for my waist length fine hair, (thought i would need 2 boxes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later I used this product for a 2nd time, to lift my hair lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Result: medium copper Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;(the dark brown dye is very stubborn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later i used this product for a 3rd time, to lift my hair lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Result: light copper very orange blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 days later i used:&lt;br /&gt;Nice&#x27;n easy #102 Light Ash Blonde&lt;br /&gt;Result: It toned down the brightness of the orange. But it was still orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 days later i used:&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Creme CC1 SOFT MEDIUM ASH BLONDE&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Creme C1 MEDIUM ASH BLONDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULT: Medium Golden Blonde. No more orange hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will ash it out with purple shampoo such as Shimmer Lights etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this bleach, very gentle on the hair(even with bleaching 3 times &amp; moist).</li>
            <li> I used this product to bleach dark brown human hair weave to match my original color. It was my first time bleaching hair and found it easy to work with; I almost achieved the exact color I wanted. Since it was my first time using this product, I was afraid to leave it on for the stated lenght of time. I shampooed it out too quickly. I still achieved a realistic color and will use this product again.</li>
            <li> Better than other box lighteners, but I still recommend having a fresh out of college girl do your hair for cheap! Tones and bleach are much better for your hair and they don&#x27;t contain metal!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair bleaches I&#x27;ve ever used,my hair was med brown on top(natural hair color) and went into a red color(dyed)normally I&#x27;d have to use two bottles of bleach to get the dyed part of my hair any where close to what my roots dye out to but with one bottle of this they&#x27;re pretty close and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Um. It&#x27;s bleach. I have overly processed brown hair, and this lightening kit made my hair pay the price. I fixed it with some darker stuff from the store, but it don&#x27;t recommend this stuff unless you already have darker blond hair you&#x27;re just trying to get lighter.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one of every bleach out there and this definitely gets your hair the lightest while avoiding the orange.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of harsh bleach before dying my hair. My dark blonde hair turns BRIGHT and gorgeous white and is extremely soft and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> TO ALL YOU BRUNETTES OUT THERE, do not try to bleach your hair in one step using this, it will turn orange and it&#x27;s not because the product is bad, garnier&#x27;s products moisturize and make your hair stronger it&#x27;s just the way your natural hair works, it can only turn so many shades at one time. Natural brown hair has orange undertones, that&#x27;s what makes the hair a beautiful brunette color. You have to understand the way natural hair colors work. Garnier has a line that is specially made for brunettes trying to turn their hair blonde without brassiness, so try that not this. This hair color is for blondes and light browned brunnetes ONLY</li>
            <li> I started out with dark blonde hair. This really lightened it but it doesn&#x27;t look like the color on the box. Its a little brassy but still very blonde. I was really expecting it to burn. I have very sensitive skin. No burn at all. I just had a hard time getting all the powder into the bottle. Good thing they give you two packets. I have medium length hair and the conditioner provided wasn&#x27;t quite enough. Other than that I was very satisfied with this color and brand.</li>
            <li> I have naturally auburn hair and I use this to lighten my hair to a strawberry blonde. Even with naturally orange hues in my hair this never leaves my hair brassy or off colored. I use it on sections of my hair for about 10 minutes, and then pour the rest over all of my hair, and leave it for another 30. This creates perfect highlights every time.</li>
            <li> My hair always was just a normal blonde. Every color worked until now but this hair dye just made my hair turn yellow and not pretty at all. I ust tried to lighten my hair a little bit. It already was really blonde before. After I colored my hair with this color I had to go out and buy a darker color to dye my hair darker and in a normal looking color again. I&#x27;m not happy at all with this product</li>
            <li> I ordered this bleach to go back to blonde hair I used to have several years ago. Back then I would touch up my roots with Garnier Extra Light Platinum Blonde (111), but when I did a strand test, it didn&#x27;t work as well. It didn&#x27;t lift my medium brown hair nearly as much as it used to. I don&#x27;t know if it changed, or if the heat from my head made such a big difference (since I only did the roots back then). Anyway, I knew I needed something more powerful. I used the bleach as directed (30 min. on hair with no roots, and 30 min on all of hair including roots), and it turned out horrible. Bright orange hair with much, much lighter orange roots. Took several more colorings with various ash blonde colors to get to the color I still hate, but can show without covering my head with a hat. It didn&#x27;t damage my hair too bad though and was easy to use. The box also has plenty of stuff. I used two boxes (my hair is down to my waist) and still had some left.</li>
            <li> great product in fact best ive ever used ive been trying to go platinum i had pretty light blonde hair and it took forever toners never seemed to work i was sketched out when i saw bleach in it but in reality its less damaging and it gets the job done my roots are so pale and not ugly yellow also all my hair is platinum now deff gonna use again .</li>
