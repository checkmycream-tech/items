            <li>This is absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>This was a good buy!</li>
            <li>so this is a great way for me to try one.  </li>
            <li>Grandaughter loved this.</li>
            <li>Very light and summery!</li>
            <li>Love the perfume though.</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of my newest favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I love this summery scent.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a sample to see if I would love it, I did, so</li>
            <li>I wish they would have put more in the bottle .</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a lovely perfume</li>
            <li>However very quick shipping also.</li>
            <li>Despite that, it is still wonderfully scented and convenient to carry in this small container.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I purchased the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described, delivered in time for Christmas!</li>
            <li>Very light and feminine without being too strong and peppery.</li>
            <li>I then ordered the large bottle.</li>
            <li>so this small size is perfect for me to try a nice expensive perfume that I normally would not buy</li>
            <li>I know I could probably get this at a large upscale department store for free, but I live in a rural area and don&#x27;t get to a city often</li>
            <li>Light and slightly sweet, but not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but I actually was not trying to order this particular fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I can usually get these samples free at a department store.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle as it is and to be half full is like being ripped off .</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> if high end expensive.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day with just a little bit used.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed at the size of this tube for 10.00 - it is a free sample size</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed.</li>

            <li> The shipping was double the amount of the Mini Spray Vials.  The Mini Spray Vials were actually the sample size sprays that upscale department stores give away.  Love the perfume though.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, delivered in time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> very disappointed at the size of this tube for 10.00 - it is a free sample size</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance. Saving for a trip to Caribbean. I like to change my fragrances often so this small size is perfect for me to try a nice expensive perfume that I normally would not buy if high end expensive.</li>

            <li> It does come as described but please note that the size in comparison is not much larger than a sample.  However very quick shipping also.</li>
