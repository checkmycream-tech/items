            <li>Great razor!  </li>
            <li>It is a great razor!</li>
            <li>Power razors are the best, razor vibration while shaving is a must for me.</li>

            <li>Works incredibly</li>
            <li>It was a close shave without irritation and he loved it!</li>
            <li>My wife loved what this razor has done to my face that she has decided to &#x27;borrow&#x27; it to shave her legs with it!  </li>
            <li>My husband tried this razor through a Bzz campaign and absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this is a good shaving razor!  </li>
            <li>In a nutshell: Great razor design, if you can get it at a good price, buy it!</li>
            <li>The pricing was good, the package came on time, it was in excellent condition, and it still works great.</li>
            <li>I thought, you know, since I have plenty of space and curves to shave, this razor would be great.</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor is great.</li>
            <li>The feather blades are cheaper, so I wish they would win, but they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>After using the Proglide I wrote Gillette telling them what a great product they had.</li>
            <li>Great product, would recommend</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>

            <li>I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>its a great razor, like any of the five blade products from Gillette.</li>
            <li>They are great products both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, it is truely a great razor.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how happy this makes me.</li>
            <li>However I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide, courtesy of Gillette, and I can honestly say this is an excellent disposable razor.</li>
            <li>happy with the shave this razor provides.</li>
            <li>I got a great shave with this razor.</li>

            <li>The Razor worked out great.</li>
            <li>I also used this shaver to do my head and the flexability was great for this.  </li>
            <li>Great job, Gillette.</li>
            <li>Gotta keep my lady happy.</li>
            <li>I could have been asleep with this GFPGSTPR (lol)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is a great way to shave, if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>The Flexball was a great addition.</li>
            <li>this works great.</li>
            <li>well built, sturdy and durable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that great</li>
            <li>My roommates even bought one as well because of how great I thought it was.</li>
            <li>It is still a great product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who already owns a Fusion.</li>
            <li>I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great it is.</li>
            <li>I am happy to try this Razor.</li>
            <li>This is a Great razor.</li>

            <li>This is honestly the best razor i have ever used!</li>
            <li>I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>I have not been this happy with a razor since the release of the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how effective the flexball is.</li>
            <li>GREAT IDEA,</li>
            <li>is another great one from Gillette in the ProGlide series.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>

            <li>Very nice.</li>

            <li>▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li>Even when shaving against the grain of my beard, it gave a very smooth shave, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had fom a manual razor.</li>
            <li>Love it best razor out there</li>
            <li>handle is great, good weight, texture.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the way this razor performs!!  </li>
            <li>I was actually MORE impressed with it</li>
            <li>Most razors made for men work just as wonderful for women</li>
            <li>best and most convenient shave money can buy and in my opinion you found it.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding upgrade to what was an excellent shaving product.</li>
            <li>so it gives you a better shave is just awesome!</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette Fusion razors before and have a great opinion of them as they always gave me an awesomely close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>When I removed it from the box it was pleasantly weighty, and require no pressure when I began to shave.</li>
            <li>Great close shave and clean look great product!</li>
            <li>great product gets every hair love it!</li>
            <li>Whoop, Gillette always puts out great products and they just got even better!</li>
            <li>Speaking for all the men out there, including myself this is one of the best, most top notch razor ever!  </li>
            <li>With a DE razor, there&#x27;s a fine line between an awesome shave and blood, you&#x27;re skating the edge</li>
            <li>I get about 2-3 good shaves from one cartridge.</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING</li>
            <li>and I dont have to worry about replacing batteries and its equally good shave.</li>
            <li>That said, my wife said that the Turbo side was superior in terms of stubble.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it from Gillette to sample and review, so I&#x27;ve put it to the test and here&#x27;s my fair review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All 5-6 times I got a good shave and did not notice bleeding once.</li>
            <li>However at 30 dollars for a box of refills I cannot in good conscience recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>It really is a good product</li>
            <li>Good, as always.</li>
            <li>if you want a close shave at a good price this is the one to try.</li>
            <li>I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review and I was delighted by the look and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li>To reiterate - it is a good shave &amp; so, four stars.    </li>
            <li>I LOVED the shave from the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Silvertouch Power Razor, and you will too.</li>
            <li>I can say something good is</li>
            <li>There is good spacing between each of the blades.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide from Gillette itself did a good job.</li>
            <li>and I look good after I shave with it.  </li>
            <li>When I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silver touch manual razor found it to be a good razor.</li>
            <li>and I think the improvement is marginal but good.  </li>
            <li>My wife has stolen it because she loves how good it works on her legs.</li>
            <li>I loved the metal handle on the flexball razor.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews and thought I would check out what all the hype was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Awesome product, a must buy razor if your looking for a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Its&#x27; a good razor.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the non-Proglide blades for it, because they were on sale, and it&#x27;s still fairly decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone that received for a christmas gift loved it.  </li>
            <li>An awesome improvement to the original.</li>
            <li>So overall I am very impressed with this awesome razor!</li>
            <li>It IS a great razor though, as are most Gillette products.</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette products for many years and have been extremely happy with them.</li>
            <li>I will me more than happy to share my experience about gillette fusion proglide  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, which is why i gave it 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Others here are happy with it, so it might just work better for some than others.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I was able to try this razor out.</li>
            <li>This razor is another great step in Gillette&#x27;s innovative product line.</li>
            <li>:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good razor, the flexball is an amazing feature, dealing with all contours the body can throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con :</li>
            <li>It feels nice in the hand and has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>I had a nice stubble on m face, so i needed a good shave.</li>
            <li>The Silvertouch cut right through and did an excellent job on just one shave.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Gillette razors but this one is just pure awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to my husband, as most Gillette’s products, this one is good – close shave, good mobility, whatever else you’ve come to expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great close shave and clean cut look!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I will for sure stick with this razor!</li>
            <li>and I love the shave!</li>
            <li>You have to love the ball!</li>
            <li>I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silverglode and I must say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li>I still enjoyed it tho!</li>
            <li>It does a nice job on the sides of your face, but in the chin area it gets very more marks.</li>
            <li>I received the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor from Gillete and I was able to shave with it once or twice before it disappeared!</li>
            <li>I love that it flows nicely around all the curves in my neck and face!  </li>
            <li>It 100 times better than disposable razors!</li>
            <li>love the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Great shave, super comfy!</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexiball technology to try for free from Gillette and it is great.</li>
            <li>They shave absolutely amazingly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Chrome looks amazing</li>
            <li>razor gives a real smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball that I received from Gillette was amazing.</li>
            <li>The blades are great and accurate, as it has been always my experience with Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its truly amazing how great this product works and how smooth my face is after a shave.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Real comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I am happy that i received this product for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>Gelette sent me this product free of charge and it is a great razor, gives a nice close shave, the flex ball works well.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>I got my Razor from Gillette, and I think it&#x27;s amazing that Gillette has come up with a razor with a flexable handle.</li>
            <li>They are definitely smooth, and great quality razors that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I did, and got a nice cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the improvements in the blade are also quite nice.  </li>
            <li>and I want to give it an honest review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)</li>
            <li>but what I&#x27;m really loving is the engineering of the heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice, hefty metal feel (although I think it is chrome plated plastic).</li>
            <li>For the sake of Gillette I decided to give this razor an honest chance.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many good things about Gillette</li>
            <li>I honestly was amazed.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades work well together to provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>pivoting head is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The blades work very well and I am always impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>Gets in all the nooks and crannies nicely with the pivoting ball.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, I loved the way it shaved.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally, I use an electric razor in the morning to trim and use this as a means to get a really nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>Now, if you have problems with your razor not adhering to the contours of your face, then this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;However, at the end of the day, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, have been successful in avoiding any cuts, and appreciate the smooth, close shave, but I can get that from any Gillette product.</li>
            <li>It handles nicely around the neck line and face.  </li>
            <li>You get a nice close shave every time.</li>
            <li>and she said it gives her a nice close shave</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice quality razor.</li>
            <li>I  was able to get close to two weeks of shaves out of one cartridge, and that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>First thoughts, the weight of the razor, in combination with good technique, feels great against the skin.</li>
            <li>I believe that razor does great job keeping my face clean shaved</li>
            <li>I truly love this comfortable, smooth, great shaving razor!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many razors before and I am certain this one is one of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This new Flexball version is the best yet!</li>
            <li>Like most razors these days, the Gilette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology gives a great smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>However, if your goal is to be able to get a close shave without having to focus too much, then this is the best bet.</li>
            <li>It was a good razor, but it definitely was not the best.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is by far the best razor I have used in my life.  </li>
            <li>It just follows the contours of my head very easy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t, but I can very easily imagine what it feels like to do so.</li>
            <li>Very easy to move around your face and get all those stubborn stops.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth shave that adjusted nicely around my chin...</li>
            <li>I used to own a power proglide but to my surprise the manual one is better than the power.</li>
            <li>This razor is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I would like to let you know that this razor is so far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Most amazing piece of technology for men on the market.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best razor i have used</li>
            <li>i recieved this razor from Gillette and it is by far the best razor that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>4 stars, easily recommend it!</li>
            <li>The good thing is you can use the fusion proglide razors to replace the original one.</li>
            <li>I, like most people rarely write a manufacturer about a great product, but I will immediately write if the product is garbage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for shaping the Goat, making precise straight cuts in between and along the edges.</li>
            <li>&quot; This razor has a great metal design, and, in my opinion, very eye catching.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Gillette Fusion Proglide since it does good job keeping my face clean shaved.</li>
            <li>Out of every major brand and the feather razors sold here, this gives me the best shave.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for this price and my husband really like it  :):):):):):</li>
            <li>It seemed like a really great idea at first.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if Gillette could improve the Fusion ProGlide Razor, I had been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Way to go Gillette on another fine product!</li>
            <li>This razor is made genuinely fine!</li>
            <li>Very smooth razor.</li>
            <li>It was very smooth to the skin, and the shaving was very precise.</li>
            <li>The result was a very smooth face with no razor</li>
            <li>This razor has very comfortable blades that do not tug on the skin.</li>
            <li>it was amazing flexible and easy to shave</li>
            <li>The lubricated strip is a nice touch, so it makes it easy to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Works good but wears out too quick.</li>
            <li>She loved how close the shave was and how the lubricating strips made shaving her legs easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would use it more often if I needed to because it provides a very comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I love how it shaves my beard off very smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to many more years of shaving with Gillette&#x27;s fine razors!  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box, the razor has a very attractive design, is very sturdy/durable and feels very comfortable when held.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this razor!</li>
            <li>I was aaaall set to absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for like two weeks to find out what &#x27;I must be doing wrong&#x27; to not have this awesome razor be awesome.</li>
            <li>The strip of &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; stuff chips off, even while using, and just seems to do more drying out than moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be keeping this.</li>
            <li>Not so many missed patches any more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I think I might have to upgrade. :)</li>
            <li>The grip is better</li>
            <li>Most of the weight is located at the top of the handle (in the flexball itself).</li>
            <li>Like the Gillette best for the following reasons:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette sent me a Fusion Proglide razor with Flexball handle to use, and overall I was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design.</li>
            <li>I have been a Fusion Proglide user since it was introduced and could not imagine a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I found I was able to shave with fewer strokes because I didnt miss as many hairs requiring me to go over those areas again.</li>
            <li>and I must say that the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor is pretty AMAZING!</li>
            <li>When you are done with your shave, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design of the product.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li>and it got most of it in one pass.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to go two days between shaves.    </li>
            <li>i love shaving with</li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed with the overall design and feel of hte razor.</li>
            <li>▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li>I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall from Gillette to try and it is a razor with an interesting spin.  </li>
            <li>Upon trying it though, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Even after many uses the blade has yet to tug or cause razor burn.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor!</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>love this razor.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am usually very picky on products for shaving so for me to say this is a great shaver....</li>
            <li>just seem to work better for my face.</li>
            <li>The razor allowed me to get one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get with a manual razor.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>How many Gillette razors are there?</li>
            <li>My most recent type was the Fusion ProGlide, which for my purposes, has been the best shave I have gotten from a Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years and just when I thought the brand could not innovate their razors anymore</li>
            <li>Arrived safely.  </li>
            <li>The swivel handle helped with being able to shave without pulling and stretching my face.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is the best razor I have used to date</li>
            <li>elaborate</li>
            <li>I love the pivoting head on this razor.</li>
            <li>Once again, GREAT product, just marketed very badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This latest variation puts a pivot on the end of the razor handle.</li>
            <li>The pivot lets the razor follow the skin even more closely for an even eaiser, better shave.</li>
            <li>As a follow-up, why offer so many options anyway?</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette for years and have always enjoyed them as they work as desired.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and no issues here!</li>
            <li>The Flexball system was phenomenal, as it guided the blades around my imperfectly shaped head and face</li>
            <li>Well, this morning, my face and head felt like I just shaved this morning, both are still nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>feature more blade to trim sideburns and so on.</li>
            <li>The flexball handle allows me to tilt the head of the razor from side to side which gives a position to shave better.</li>
            <li>):)</li>
            <li>:):):):):)</li>
            <li>After having seen advertising for the product I thought that the FlexBall handle was just a gimmick, but the shave is a bit better with it.</li>
            <li>Over time, I came to prefer them, and although its the refills rather than the razors that strike at the checkout stand, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with \\&quot;Version 1\\&quot; of the Fusion handle since I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great razor if having the newest is a must, if not then getting another Gillette won&#x27;t be too much of a difference</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>May be better for men&#x27;s faces than a woman&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li>I received this razor from Gillette to try, and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is awesome</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way you can get a nice close cut, leaving you with a smooth shave face.</li>
            <li>I am able to reach all the nooks on my faceg</li>
            <li>and you better be paying attention.</li>
            <li>and I would have woken up with a nice stubble free shave.</li>
            <li>With the grain, across the grain, against the grain, refreshing your lather each time.</li>
            <li>, I am glad I tried this thing?</li>
            <li>Chances are most people reading this have more wiggle room in their budget than I do for performance grooming.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a basketball player, you&#x27;ll love this thing, it looks like one of your shoes.</li>
            <li>I received a free product from Gillette for my review, All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li>I was sure I would love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor because of it&#x27;s 5 Blades and battery operated push button vibration and a flexball head.</li>
            <li>, you would think the product would be top notch.</li>
            <li>ive used dollar shave club and this blad is waaaay better.</li>
            <li>I used this razor with my Gillette shaving cream for even better results.</li>
            <li>The way the razor moves around the jawbone and Adams apple is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Fusion that I have for a number of years and have really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>By being able to contour, it provides a close shave that virtually gets every hair because of the maximum contact of the blade and your skin.</li>
            <li>All these shavers are goofy - 50 million blades, lubricating, bends, curves, turns, flexes,</li>
            <li>My husband loved the razor and it was easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Most guys I know have kids to feed and bills to pay.  </li>
            <li>The swivel handle helped with being able to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face shaved evenly.</li>
            <li>but I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li>It gives me a close, nice shave and my wife tells me that I have a smooth face</li>
            <li>Overall it is an awesome razor.</li>
            <li>I TRIED THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li>I have never had a better shave than with this product.</li>
            <li>, I received this for free from Gillette and am reviewing this product for them!  </li>
            <li>ll version and costs quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Gillette Fussion and when I was offered a free Proglide Silvertouch to try I jumped on the chance!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t knock any stars off of the review, as I&#x27;m sure without the oil, it would be a non-issue.    </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my relationship with shaving has turned into love/love, as opposed to love</li>
            <li>While this is not marketed to the female demographic, it is also a great buy for the ladies!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best Men&#x27;s razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Mach 3 for a decade or more.</li>
            <li>that this razor has a very sturdy feel to it with great grip on the handle.</li>
            <li>Simply the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, electric or manual.</li>
            <li>It allows for me to get a better shave and it curves to my face.</li>
            <li>How many blades does a razor need?</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the razor head can move with the contour of my face.  </li>
            <li>I was thoroughly impressed with the overall.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done way better than the ones I used to buy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The swivel handle helped with being able to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face shaved evenly.</li>
            <li>but I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li>I have tried many razors in my time here on earth</li>
            <li>but I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li>have no idea if this razor works so well because of the &amp;#34;flexball,&amp;#34; which causes the top of the razor to pivot.</li>
            <li>look up &amp;#34;razor forearm trick&amp;#34; for more information).</li>
            <li>After trying out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor for a couple of weeks, I must say It is better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Significantly better?  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor I received free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday, I got this razor from Gillette with the Flexball handle and more Proglide blades, and I got to try it out this morning.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to help me shave any better or more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I used this razor once, and it was an okay razor.</li>
            <li>It may be a better choice for the chilled jawline over the chubby cheeks.</li>
            <li>I do my research, shop around, and buy smaller packs to determine the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept track and the blade lasted 53 shaves and was still much better than the disposable razor after its 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>Simply the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Bzzagent packaging was nice and got a free catridge as well</li>
            <li>This being said if I were to be a regular razor user I would be very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li>Simply the best shave you can get at the moment.  </li>
            <li>Even the packaging is better than most products that come in plastic.  </li>
            <li>No blade clogging, smooth shave and no nicks!</li>
            <li>They both love it.</li>
            <li>Close shave and love the flexball handle.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally purchased this item instead of the Gillette Mach3 razor (which i love) and i was left with so many razor bumps!!!</li>
            <li>I received this razor from Gillette for free to try and review - and with good reason I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Gillette razor and blades, they provide a smooth, clean, close shave every time.</li>
            <li>however this razor has a very unique feature in the FlexBall.  </li>
            <li>I am very excited about it</li>
            <li>This Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball razor glides along with your faces ridges and curves and gives you a nice clean shave without the burn or irritation</li>
            <li>I tend to find that most every razor I get gives me a pretty good shave, despite how &amp;#34;Sci-Fi&amp;#34; the razor looks, and how fancy the name sounds.</li>
            <li>The Flexball makes it very easy to maneuver for smooth curves for any design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for a great razor.  </li>
            <li>The beard is very clean.</li>
            <li>for the shaving that this blade provides, it is what you would (and should) expect, a good consistent shave that does not slice your face off.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li>I liked the 5 fine Blades and the shaving was smooth.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try this!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor that I have seen in a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li>Most razors caused breakouts or itching after shaving, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide is great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily get into the grooves along my jawline.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I could probably get away with twice a week, considering how quickly my neck beard grows.</li>
            <li>Gillete always makes good razors, the proglide pivot works good in following the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth and nick free.</li>
            <li>great thing with this is that it&#x27;s a regular razor till you turn it on, so you can get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Compared to many other brands Gillette just is the best.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, and really does a nice job on my Noggin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given my skin sensitivity and my desire for the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable and worry-free!</li>
            <li>Wish coupons were more readily available though.</li>
            <li>So far I have to say its a great blade</li>
            <li>product is also great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me this product to try for free and I am glad they did.</li>
            <li>The flexball doesn&#x27;t do anything to make my shaving any more smooth.</li>
            <li>Edging a goatee or sideburns has never been easier or more precise than this.</li>
            <li>This razor does a incredible job of working around my neck to reduce redness and cuts by following the contours on my neck and face.</li>
            <li>I recieved this from Gillette and love it, this razor is soo smooth it literally glides across my face and skull since I shave my head as well as</li>
            <li>This razor allows me to shave a lot quicker since i am able to move smoothly around edges.</li>
            <li>its the most comfortable razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I get this Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor for FREE from Gillette and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I received the Fusion Pro Glide with FlexBall Handle Technology free from Gillette as part of a promotion and really love it.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a smoother, closer or more comfortable razor.  </li>
            <li>Got a free sample from Gillette and will continue to use it as my primary shaving device!  </li>
            <li>This razor really does live up to the hype, and I&#x27;m very happy with the decision to get it.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, this razor is still treating me right, and is as great a shave as the first time.</li>
            <li>I am loving the smooth, super close shave that this razor provides.</li>
            <li>so a close and clean shave is important and the FlexBall ensures that I get the best results, especially around the jawline area.</li>
            <li>Super easy to get out of the package as you know how blister packs can be!</li>
            <li>Speaking of sharp, these blades are awesome!</li>
            <li>When I tried the ProGlide with FlexBall I immediately noticed a better shave -- even from the original ProGlide.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Handle is ergonomic and easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;-Blade</li>
            <li>It easily shaved around my face with ease without nicking the skin and causing me irritation.</li>
            <li>Overall, the razor is thoughtfully designed and provides an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li>It easily shaved around the curvature of my face and neck easily.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle moved the shaving cream out of the area of the blade and easily washed off.</li>
            <li>am very picky about shaving and any old razor will not do, but this was wonderful and works so well, i ve  told all my friends and family to go get one.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed!</li>

            <li>Its basically a more comfortable, efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Still like the feel of the Hydra, but the Proglide is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to get out of the package and znc</li>
            <li>It easily shaved around the curvature of my face with ease.</li>
            <li>I have beard and it was easy to shave where I needed to shave.</li>
            <li>It is easier to shave with the contour of all body parts when the head of the razor moves easily.  </li>
            <li>and I found the pivot head extremely easy to control and easier to move about my face.</li>
            <li>The lubricant strip makes the razor glide so easily and the 3 blades get all of the hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>I go through to get a close, clean or safe shave and got that close shave quicker, easier and faster with this razor.</li>

            <li>I also have a scar on the tip of my chin which can easily be nicked.</li>
            <li>It easily shaved around the curves of my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor the ball actually will follow my face so i don&#x27;t have make so many faces to get the close shave I desire.</li>
            <li>This system has an unobstructed backside which allows me to easily wash the blades out, and keeps me shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Taking the razor out was easy and I did not need wire cutters to get though the packaging.  </li>
            <li>While I loved my old razor this one is simply better.</li>
            <li>I have been a strong user and supporter of the Schick Hydra until I saw this and had to try it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>good product, but refills are high priced.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this new product and will buy it for sure.</li>
            <li>When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design right off the bat.</li>
            <li>When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design right off the bat.</li>
            <li>I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>The Flexball is pretty handy too.</li>
            <li>I save way more money going through a 10 back of those in 2-3 weeks (which do the job excellently well; it just takes longer), than having to shell out that much moolah.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample from Gillette and I was super happy with this new razor.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants their face to look nice and clean!</li>
            <li>Since I am comparing this razor to a disposable one, I can&#x27;t be sure that it is a great deal better than more similar competitors, but I certainly have no complaints.</li>
            <li>The razor glides smoothly over every contour and easily cuts through even the toughest whiskers.</li>
            <li>If you are a woman looking to buy a present for a man in your life, they would be VERY GLAD to own this</li>
            <li>I like this razor just fine.</li>
            <li>With 5 strong, durable blades the tug and pull on hair while shaving no longer occurs while the blade smoothly goes over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So thanks Gillette you now have 2 people in my house that love this razor!</li>
            <li>I feel that the flex ball,combined with the t blades, allowed me to shave along all the many contours of my head and face and allowed me to get a super close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color.</li>
            <li>This was a huge bonus, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would say out of all the razors I have tried thus far, this razor is the best of everything thus far.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the closeness of my shave, however, I did see that the hair took longer to grow in again - no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>So smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free in the mail</li>
            <li>If it is possible to take some weight out of the handle it would greatly improve this product.</li>
            <li>Well, I got a free Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette for product review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was really smoothly shaved with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks now (after getting this product given to me my Gilette to test), I am not all that impressed.  </li>
            <li>This one cuts smoothly but isn&#x27;t for getting close to your side burns.</li>
            <li>This razor has a nice looking and it feels very sturdy when I hold it.</li>
            <li>Got one free to try.  </li>
            <li>It allows for a smooth transition from the chin to the neck area.</li>
            <li>i was get it free from bzzagent</li>
            <li>After using this for about a month, not only was it a great shave, but it was also still working at a month.  </li>
            <li>I just got this razor to test for free</li>
            <li>Before using using this razor, which I got for free from Gillette, I was using a Gillette fusion without the flexball technology.</li>
            <li>I got this razor from Gillette for free to test.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li>and comfortable grip handle which helps prevent slippage in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Five</li>
            <li>The ball followed the contours of my face precisely.</li>
            <li>Of course there IS the razor burn factor with the cheap razors.</li>
            <li>I will never use cheap disposable razors again.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ Shaves close to the skin and leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample from bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt this smooth.</li>
            <li>But since I received a free razor from Gillette to try, I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>done shaving smooth and close.</li>
            <li>friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free, to try and review, from Gillette, so I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>It feels as if my facial hair takes longer to grow in too which feels great</li>
            <li>: I received this product for free as per a Gilette promotional program.</li>
            <li>I received this for free to try out</li>

            <li>After receiving this razor free from Gillette to try and review, the Dollar Shave Club membership is out the window</li>
            <li>I got this razor through Bzzagent to try out for free.</li>
            <li>It contours to your face and gives a smooth have.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s hiney, just the way I like it.  </li>
            <li>every year, we come up with a razor refill that doesn&#x27;t make me cringe and want to try to slit my wrists with one of the cheap ones?</li>
            <li>so slippppery smooth.</li>
            <li>I used to rely on disposables or cheap drug store brand razors</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball technology is a reliable razor that provides a consistently smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to shave, faster, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not now it&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li>done shaves smooth and close</li>
            <li>(Below review is done by my Husband):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor from the company.</li>
            <li>The design is sleek and comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>So much easier to shave with honestly...</li>
            <li>Got a free sample of this razor from Gilette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin and lasts for longer.</li>
            <li>Smooth, close shave, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda cheap when it comes to razor replacements and this may move me away from using disposables.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this represents engineering excellence in effortless, precise shaving.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>done shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li>I like how close the shave is and how smooth my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whoever, I did enjoy the smooth shave I received from this razor.  </li>
            <li>It glides quite smoothly across your face.  </li>
            <li>I am a bzz agent and I received the product free to try from the brand company.</li>
            <li>done shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li>It was comfortable to hold too.</li>
            <li>I received this razor courtesy of Gillette, free to try.</li>
            <li>When I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle for free from Gillette to review</li>
            <li>done shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li>I felt like the handle was comfortable to grip and its five blades and flexing head</li>
            <li>I just received a free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR from Gillette to test out.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, no nicks or cuts, and</li>
            <li>I have used the cheap Gillette razors with two blades for years.</li>
            <li>Now I received this razor free to review</li>
            <li>the experienced shaver need to pay the extra money for it?  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Gillette did a promo</li>
            <li>I find when I go a couple of days without shaving, the vibration helps me get a closer one - and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Got this free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>amazingly smooth and doesn&#x27;t even need a lathering cream for using this.</li>
            <li>It works great over different contours and just seemed well designed all the way around.</li>
            <li>My face was smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It shaves smooth and does in fact pivot like it advertises.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gets more of your hair and leaves it feeling really good.</li>
            <li>I loved this razor than the old one that i am using.</li>
            <li>flexball handle also surprised me, in a good sense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those guys who has to shave nearly every day, my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up before lunch, so a good, precise razor is a must.  </li>
            <li>I got to try it, thanks to BuzzAgent and by all means it was one of the best Gillette company has ever made, Never going back.</li>
            <li>This is not only good for men, I love it to shave my legs with.  </li>
            <li>You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first try with this new product was great.</li>
            <li>(Make sure it&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li>A close shave, straight clean lines, and just an nice looking, almost high-tech manual razor.</li>
            <li>When I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with the Flexball handle, from Bzzagent I was excited.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited when I was selected to review the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free by Gillette!&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of, the shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It was a very pleasant experience and had me second guessing my straight razor.</li>
            <li>A lot of times, I simply \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my facial hair rather than shave it all, and this razor has been great at giving my neck a clean shave alone.</li>
            <li>I was smooth and clean when I got finished shaving.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an effective manual razor.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, this razor looks awesome and high tech and has a very sturdy, high quality feel.</li>
            <li>It has worked great at getting a close shave, as you would expect from Gillette products, but I&#x27;ve found that the new Flexball technology really isn&#x27;t anything to call home about.</li>
            <li>The best part though, is that with this new razor, I don&#x27;t get any breakouts related to razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy to get out of the package and I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.</li>
            <li>Great for people like me who have an oddly contoured face to help cut more hair in one pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice clean shave with no hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This is definitely an investment for the better and one you will be pleased about!</li>
            <li>and i have to say i am not disappointed one bit in the results it gave me.</li>
            <li>But once I got past the longer growth, I was actually impressed.</li>
            <li>I have long been a fan of Gillette razors and have used them with great results</li>
            <li>I was certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant to use the razor because I normally use an electric razor.</li>
            <li>When I tested out this version, I kept to my original routine.  </li>
            <li>This product is an improvement to the original pro glide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original for about a month now</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>being said, Gillette provided me this razor as part of a try-it-before-you-buy-it review program and although it may cost bit more than some alternatives, it is also higher quality.</li>
            <li>I am able to get consistent clean shave</li>
            <li>Iv  have tried ever razor out there and this is by far the best the flex ball moves around my face leavening a close shave that I haven&#x27;t been able to get from other razors</li>
            <li>Its sleek and clean design.</li>
            <li>As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They also give you a clean shave as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep my wife away from using this razor because she says it makes her legs feel super smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best manual razor I have found, and I suspect others would think the same.</li>
            <li>It was a smooth shave and was quick.</li>
            <li>It was nice and comfortable, the blades dulled pretty fast but other than that it was good!</li>
            <li>This is the one to buy, and instead of buying a ton of razors and throwing them all away, a great part about this razor is that you can just buy more heads and replace them every few weeks.</li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>It did give a very smooth shave, But I really did not care for this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the new handle, and I expect to be purchasing more of the Proglide blades next time I need refills.</li>
            <li>The Blades are great, smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>For those who have been loyal to a specific razor for years, they would probably not be a good fit for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have to shave over my face many times before, not with this razor as it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face leaving me with no irritation.</li>
            <li>However, the one thing I will say is that there&#x27;s nothing special about this razor.</li>
            <li>I was right!</li>
            <li>The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>The razor provides a good and clean shave, I had no problems with irritation and would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Luckily the blades are identical to the original Fusion</li>
            <li>I was cursed with a bright red rash whenever I shaved until I was given this razor by my wife.  </li>
            <li>Better than the cheap throwaways I normally use.  </li>
            <li>Just be weary of the latest advancements and if they really have an effect.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t think its significantly better than the regular Gillette Fusion Proglide, I still think it provides one of the most comfortable shaves out there.</li>
            <li>I say so far I&#x27;m loving the blade.</li>
            <li>I am on my second razor cartridge and have been get a consistently good shave.  </li>
            <li>, I can honestly see it in action when shaving my head.</li>
            <li>Day 1, I tell my straight razor everything will be OK and that I am just trying this out for a friend.</li>
            <li>Overall a good experience.</li>
            <li>This razor offers a sleek design that fits nicely by my sink.  </li>
            <li>Does it really cost that much more to add the FlexBall to the razor - why not just give it</li>
            <li>All of this was true until I found the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants the latest technology with their shave.</li>
            <li>I had the good fortune to try the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Silvertouch Power Razor recently when Gillette sent me one to review, (hereafter referred to as the GFPGSTPR - Fire</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is in need of a good razor.</li>
            <li>Good razor for the money and a product that only Gillette could deliver.  </li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Razor with Flexball Technology to try free, complimentary of Gillette.</li>
            <li>I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.</li>
            <li>Overall a good razor and experience.</li>
            <li>I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how flexible the handle is thanks to the flexball technology.</li>
            <li>I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how nice of a shave the Fusion Proglide razor</li>
            <li>have had a full beard since I was 13 and shaving has always been a thorn in my side.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was surprised with how much I liked this.</li>
            <li>I love the way it contours to your face and curves, the razor is really sharp but the lubricating strip wears out fast idk if its cause my wife uses it for her legs but the razor still works great without the strip.</li>
            <li>So much better than a normal razor!</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette Proglides in the past and the flexibility ball is by far my favorite nice smooth shave and superior design</li>
            <li>The mechanism that allows for greater movement is kind of loose and doesn&#x27;t allow you to get under the nose as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past month and it has given me a great, nick free, smooth shave every time.  </li>
            <li>It got every single hair very easily and was very smooth.</li>
            <li>so was excited to get a chance to try out this new one with the pivoting head which promised an even better shave that  </li>
            <li>...sooner or later, your going to decide what works best for you on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a reluctant user of Fusion blades when the Gillette Excel variety I&#x27;d been satisfied with for many years started becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li>It took only a two or three passovers to accomplish a shave that took many more with either of my electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple razors ranging from the electric shavers that are upwards of $150 to the downright cheap disposable kind</li>
            <li>The Proglide is such a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>the super close shave my wife loves so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick hint.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job of going around corners of the jaw than the older razor.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the Flexball cartridge works on the Styler.</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion for free from Gillette to review but the above opinions are my own and in now</li>
            <li>Super razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been a loyal Gillette consumer ever since.  </li>
            <li>I had quit using disposables about a year ago in favor of a safety razor, but I still use Gillette disposables and electric razors for those times when I need a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was quite excited to try it out right away.</li>
            <li>But for Gillette, if they will be making tons of $$ selling cartridges over the years, in my opinion it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for them to use better quality materials on the razor, so it lasts as long as possible and more than just feel, also LOOK good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provided a pretty good shave, however, I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from what their older shavers, the ones that just provided flexibility up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>always thought that this multiple blade idea was complete nonsense until I used the Proglide, this is absolutely the best razor I ever used.  </li>
            <li>First, I should advise that I received a free sample of this razor from Gilette to try out.    </li>
            <li>have since shaved three or four more times using the same blade, and each time I get the same great shave.</li>
            <li>I have also been using the previous generation fusion razor which is also very good, and I wouldn&#x27;t say that this razor is a large improvement if any improvement at all.  </li>
            <li>Surely, the flex-y part will help, the new stuff on the blades will help with moisturizing, it&#x27;ll cut close, and hey, three bucks off...</li>
            <li>With this new product, I am able to shave my mustache a bit smoother.</li>
            <li>i love the way the razor pivots to go with the curves of my face and will be switching to this as my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li>Yay, love my new razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexable Handle Technology.</li>
            <li>But their new Flexiball design is over the top.  </li>
            <li>someone who is new to shaving or finds themselves in a hurry most of the time, the  flexball technology assists with shaving without having to meticulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flexball gave a very close shave and stayed smooth for a full 48 hours before I noticed any stubble.</li>
            <li>The flexball is a neat feature in that it follows the contours of my face easily without much manual correction.</li>
            <li>While using this product my skin was nearly never irritated which makes Gillette Fusion Proglide better than most razors on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I made a mistake when I told my wife how much I liked how smooth my face was, how it followed the contours of my face really well and did a good job of getting to the harder to reach areas without having to completely contort my face.</li>
            <li>pretty regularly, I need a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found this razor easily follows your face contours very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll agree!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try to try  the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology provided by Gillette products.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this razor does so much of the work for you makes it easy for me to get a great, close shave over all the contours of my face while in a rush and paying little attention.</li>
            <li>This time they have a package that is stylish yet easy to open and somewhat eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology for anyone who is looking for a clean, smooth shave without any effort.  </li>
            <li>handle is easy to grip, especially when wet, and has an ideal weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time will tell how many good shaves you get before it gets dull.</li>
            <li>four to five shaves with one cartridge, before I have to really start working for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;The five blades make for a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I definitely have to thank Gillette for sending me this razor and for stealing me toward this amazing product that will stay in my shave kit for a while.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>This razor makes the morning much easier with the smooth shave provided by the razor and rollerball working together.</li>
            <li>The swivel ball head helps conform to the curves of my face and really helps in getting a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This product accomplishes this goal far better than my double-edged razor.</li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to send me one to try out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured that it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to send me a sample</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that cuts nice straight edges like my old 2 blade razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints, it is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I just tried this razor for the first time last week and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The swivel action of the flexball allows me to shave around my jawline without having to re-do spots to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any of the books and crannies,</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li>Even with most 4-5 bladed razors, my sensitive skin would often become irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s just pretty cool to look at.</li>
            <li>I love this razor (even with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Gilette would further explain the benefits of the power</li>
            <li>, I think it looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth checking out for yourself.</li>
            <li>The first time out of the box, it was promptly pitted against a full beard.</li>
            <li>Nice doesn&#x27;t have the vibration like the former model</li>
            <li>yeah, was fun</li>
            <li>Honestly, the only thing that bothered me was the color scheme...</li>
            <li>If this razor is designed to prevent nicking and doesn&#x27;t cut you up at all, why would you need an any more sensitive razor?</li>
            <li>I also love that I can use my old Fusion cartridges on this</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny, and then some.</li>
            <li>They make be pricey, but the quality is just far better than anything else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, you can use any &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34; razor blade on this razor, yet the blades that were supplied in this pack were by far the smoothest and most efficient</li>
            <li>Worth the price?  </li>
            <li>Claims he can use it for a month and amortized over the length of time the blade lasts figures the additional cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades and lubristrip are more comfortable, than earlier versions.</li>
            <li>Love the pivot action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Gilette&#x27;s razor&#x27;s, and the Silvertouch is actually supplanting a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Proglide.</li>
            <li>I had the pleasure of trying the Gillette Fusion FREE of cost, directly from Gilette (Thank You!!!).</li>
            <li>Overall, this new razor was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li>When I first received this I wasn&#x27;t to sure what to think about the new flexball technology.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that you only have to go over your face once with this razor and it will give a nice clean shave without having to go over and over the same areas.</li>
            <li>It is just as good and reliable as all the other razors from Gillette that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it took it right off.</li>
            <li>Another step in the right direction for the Fusion line.  </li>
            <li>It does the job right.</li>
            <li>The way I shave is by putting my index finger right where the flex head is located.  </li>
            <li>Right?  </li>
            <li>And then you can return the razor to it&#x27;s handy holder, which offers a way to store extra blades (which snap easily into place, BTW) on the underside.</li>
            <li>This worked well for me much better than disposables a lot less cuts and smooth shave, plus free refills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this redesign seems to have improved the product enough that I would be willing to purchase it; however, I will still be shopping for the best deal and would consider other products as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since, I wanted to really test it out, I let my beard grow for a full week before shaving.  </li>
            <li>(For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, so I got this razor in the mail for free to review and was already put off since it is a cartridge razor (I use a straight blade as my daily driver).</li>
            <li>I honestly have no idea why they only market this razor to men&#x27;s faces when they could sell double as many of them by also marketing this product to women who need to shave body hair.</li>
            <li>i generally get bumps from most razors this one i did not get any bumps from.</li>
            <li>had the opportunity to try one of these razors and it does a nice job, but in the end it&#x27;s not enough better that I will use it daily.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave and the flexball is cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be very interested in how many shaves I can get from the initial blade.</li>
            <li>This newly engineered razor literally glides right onto your face and shave desired area smoothly.</li>
            <li>: the battery is tricky to put it, so be sure to look at the little slip that comes with the handle or you&#x27;ll be perplexed like I was!</li>
            <li>Now those blades are very sharp, but unfortunately don&#x27;t do a good job with my neck beard.</li>
            <li>but mostly it provides a sharp, nice, clean shave without all the extra irritated skin!  </li>
            <li>In reality, what they seem to be doing is coming up with one exciting new option a year, so each year you have to buy a new razor anyway to keep up with the latest options.</li>
            <li>I had gone my typical week plus, and needed a good shave.</li>
            <li>We liked it so much my wife now uses it instead of her last razors.  </li>
            <li>Received this as a trial from Gillette, so far I have only good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I figured this was just another gimmicky update, but it actually is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend theFusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology to anyone looking for a comfortable close shave!</li>
            <li>Once I got past the learning curve, I was able to get a nice close shave without much irritation.  </li>
            <li>Though I do use other Gillette razors and was very pleased with their performance.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the Flexball also makes a difference, in that to get that smooth shave, I only had to spend about two thirds as long shaving as without it, and in fewer passes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only way to know for sure is to go to the store myself and try to pick out the exact right product with the exact right options.</li>
            <li>The handle is tiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li>SUCH A VERY SMOOTH AND THROUGH SHAVE.</li>
            <li>have slightly sensitive skin, and it worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>the price of the razor and two refill  blades that ship with it (which will work just fine with the old Fusion handle)</li>
            <li>I really liked the fact that the razor contained a lubricated strip because I think it helped glide the razor over my stubble, which all easily came off without me having to go back over the same area again.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try my new razor.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was very easy to open, and the razor was very well presented.</li>
            <li>It had a very easy open package and the razor itself was very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It works great, with one swipe across the face and hard to reach areas under the nose and by my ears.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a woman.</li>
            <li>Now, my neck beard might extend further south than most, but I still expect to shave without leaving permanent scarring as a result.</li>
            <li>it is expensive, but I want the best a man can get.</li>
            <li>Love that the cartridges are on subscribe and save total bonus!</li>
            <li>IMO the regular proglide is better than this one and shaves closer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it regularly, but it seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>I decided that I would have to try these razors within the same week three times and then let my wife would tell me which would work better and made my face smoother.  </li>
            <li>I like the blades to go exactly where I intend them</li>
            <li>i would go for the electric on this only because it provides a slightly better shave.</li>
            <li>I recently used this razor, and must say I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I recently received this from Gillette to review and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li>I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li>There are so many different types of razors out on the market</li>
            <li>First, the razor comes with things you expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>I have facial hair most of the time and this razor curves and bends around it with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li>that said, I REALLY like this razor!</li>
            <li>I was interested to try this one out when I received it free from Gillette, and I was completely surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The FlexBall technology allows the razor to move and shift to every contour smoothly and seamlessly getting a close and quality</li>
            <li>Overall design is visually appealing</li>
            <li>It looks funny but has me intrigued.</li>
            <li>That could be because of the razor, but most likely is caused by my face...</li>
            <li>Ever since I first started shaving, I have used some type of razor manufactured by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head allowed the razor to better contour to my face, enabling a closer shave which left my face baby smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It uses the same 5 bladed Pro Glide cartridges that I have grown to love.</li>
            <li>My first razor was the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li>With the advent of the Gillette Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball, I can only say, &amp;#34;it can&#x27;t get any better than this.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This razor is not any better than the regular Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>The Flexball concept was uninteresting to me, and I noticed no difference during the first shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various Gillette razors for 30+ years, and they do keep getting better.</li>
            <li>My recommendation - if you haven&#x27;t tried Gillette&#x27;s latest Fusion Proglide razor, definitely do!</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide offers a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was pleased with the close shave that it provided.  </li>
            <li>this one does the job - very well!  </li>
            <li>The smoothness of the shave that you get out of this razor is above and beyond what most razors can even dream of accomplishing these days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found most of the &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; to be worthwhile (despite my cynicism towards marketing), especially the battery-powered microvibrations.</li>
            <li>This is my first review, so bear with me.    </li>
            <li>However, I do remember my first impression of the razor, and I have to say, \\&quot;Wow!\\</li>
            <li>More on this later.    </li>
            <li>With the flexball head, however, Ihad no problems getting the hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I also like the Lubrastrip which is infused with mineral oil and leaves me feeling soft and smooth without nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and the lubricating strip is still working pretty well without getting gooey.</li>
            <li>The system looks interesting and definitely helps men have a smoother shave experience.</li>
            <li>I have thiick course hairs and this is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used that cuts all of the hairs all of the way on the first pass.</li>
            <li>The flex technology makes shaving so much more simple...</li>
            <li>It is such a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>I used to think that three was more than enough and have been a Mach 3 user since they came out.</li>
            <li>The idea of what the razor is supposed to do was better then the actual feel of the razor although it definitely was somewhat better shaving around the corners of my jaw.</li>
            <li>(Harry&#x27;s has a subpar quality razor blades in the first place in my opinion).</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this product Gillette!</li>
            <li>I did an unboxing and first shave test for those interested</li>
            <li>I wife thanks me, as I no longer need to use her Gillette Fusion razor!</li>
            <li>It would glide smoothly at first, but once that strip wore out about 3/4 through, which resulted in a lot of tugging.</li>
            <li>Each seemed marginally better than the last.  </li>
            <li>The four and five blade razors clog more rapidly and don&#x27;t last any longer than my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>However, when is used the proglide flexball the first time i immediately could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>razor provides a close shave on the first</li>
            <li>My face feels like it did when I was 12, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love the way the swivel handle allows you to maneuver around different areas of the face with ease.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the closest and smoothest shave of my life with this blade not just the first time, but multiple times.</li>
            <li>The shaver did exactly what i was expecting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Handle has good weight to it but is by no means heavy.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I mean the product looks like it would work great with it&#x27;s flexball head and vibration</li>
            <li>Is it better than the original, or a old fashioned double edged safety razor?  </li>
            <li>Flexball is a cool new technology that allows the razor to contour to your face.</li>
            <li>I was very intrigued with the look if it right away.</li>
            <li>it left my face very smooth and the shave was very close.</li>
            <li>I was far happier with the original Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this an improvement over my other fusion razors.</li>
            <li>When shaving most strokes are vertical, some horizontal, but nothing that would require a flexball IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Adding a vibrating handle and spacing out the blades slightly would significantly improve shaving results with this product.</li>
            <li>Mornings are hard enough, let this razor make you look your best.</li>
            <li>Great shaves are not that difficult to achieve and there are great quality blades out there for much less money.</li>
            <li>but the key here is the blade cartridge, which really does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>For me this is great as my chin area is my hardest area to shave as I have very course thick stubble there.  </li>
            <li>In essence the shave was the same good quality I have known from my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>Gillette has come through again using technology and innovation to provide a quick, clean, and simple shave!</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that would have made this razor better for me would have been of it was a power razor as I really like the vibrating that the power razors have.  </li>
            <li>Love Gillette, but I was surprised that this was not to far off from all the others.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is handling the thing: The metal handle is too heavy, and the handle has to many smooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li>Razors are expensive, but I think this has a good price point and top notch blade.</li>
            <li>And the sheer range of motion to the pivoting head made the razor hug the contours better, and I got a closer shave with much fewer passes than I have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a great smooth shave without missing a single hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for sensitive, easy to nick face like mine.</li>
            <li>Great product, very precise cut and no hair left behind.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that the handle was very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The first shave went very well.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time shaving with a straight edge razor (I use an electric razor)</li>
            <li>Other than that, a wonderful razor for everyday use.</li>
            <li>How could they improve upon the razor I already had and loved for the past couple of years?  </li>
            <li>It gives me the closest and cleanest shave I can get and is very easy to handle due to the flexball handle technology.</li>
            <li>I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the blades dry for longer life.</li>
            <li>I used this razor for the first time last night and was amazed at how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li>A fantastic shaver and this is coming from a guy who pays entirely too much for shaving products at The Art of Shaving!</li>
            <li>I usually use some type of electrical shaver to make sure I get smooth cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to conform to your hand and shaving is simple with this razor!</li>
            <li>I have previously used the Mach 3 razor, so having lots of blades is nice.</li>
            <li>It gave a close shave and left my skin pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used a single cartridge to shave my head and face for over 2 weeks, and still get better results than my shave club razor.</li>
            <li>It took care of most of my face with a single pass</li>
            <li>The balljoint did not come into play well shaving my face but on my neck was certainly grateful for it.</li>
            <li>size of the flexball is rather large and bulky for a razor</li>
            <li>I received my first one free from Gillette, but I will absolutely be purchasing this razor again in the future.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave very quickly, and the flexball really allowed me to get those hard to reach spots around my chin, nose, and under my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of these add-ons that razor companies have now are just gimmicks to get people to try them or switch over when there is really no end gain or value and that is exactly what the FlexBall is for this Gillette Fusion ProGlide - another gimmick that really doesn&#x27;t help the end goal of shaving a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>---you had more control that way and got a closer shave - these razors with all these dumb features are getting goofy already and a hassle and just gimmicks.    </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars unfortunately I do not have the burliest of beards and cannot say that this would be pristine for something more dense due to its pivoting nature</li>
            <li>I am very happy with how these work compared to other past razors I have used.</li>
            <li>A decent shaving experience - Thanks!</li>
            <li>I think it is mainly because the blades are a higher quality than the Fusion Manual.</li>
            <li>I found it from 11.50 to 15.00 and that seems very high for a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>As far as the blades go, they were of top level precision that I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette over the years, including the single blade on the back side which made touching up sideburns a breeze.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit worried the handle would be too heavy, but it was very easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>had!&lt;br /&gt;The blades clean up easily as well....and my  little &amp;#34;audible&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li>While the blades are just as good, the flex head is hard for me to get used to.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the touch-up blade on the back for getting precise strokes on my beard outline.</li>
            <li>It gets very close and gives you an extra smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Huge improvement over my prior Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice the swivel-y part while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>and I find that I have so much an easier time with this Razor.</li>
            <li>Too much of hassle to go through the process of refund and replacement.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Gillette mach 3 turbo for about a decade and recently got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor to try in my home and then review the item.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the Fusion did not irritate under my neck as much as I am used to.  </li>
            <li>, this is the razor for me and one that I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not enough O&#x27;s in the word smooth to describe it.</li>
            <li>seems to hug the face for a very close shave; it also has an edge</li>
            <li>I knew I would let the performance be the real test.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sold that the flexball technology drastically helps out that much though.  </li>
            <li>My shave was so close that my face was still smooth the next day!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a go!</li>
            <li>It worked out really well for me</li>
            <li>I shave my whole face</li>
            <li>They give me a really close shave without much irritation at all</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>It worked better than I expected to help the razor to contour my face.</li>
            <li>It is well built and has a very durable design.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve a closer, smoother shave with minimal abrasions.</li>
            <li>The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li>This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed any real negatives</li>
            <li>What I feel really worked was the flexball.</li>
            <li>And it was a really close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, he doesn’t like this version of Gillette Fusion as much as the one with vibrating handle.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>, I shave once every 7-10 days, much to my wife&#x27;s displeasure.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you pick one up today!</li>
            <li>once I found out it wasn&#x27;t really a ball, because it means the razor doesn&#x27;t flop all over your face, it just gently pivots, so I still feel I&#x27;m in control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the power version before and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me...</li>
            <li>No pulling or tugging to cut the hair and left my face smooth after one stroke.</li>
            <li>The grip is comfortable during the entire shave.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t pull as much</li>
            <li>this newest version shaved really well.</li>
            <li>It did take some getting used to this much flexability in a razor.  </li>
            <li>and I am left with a smooth and youthful sensation after each shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think I could have cut myself on it if I tried.</li>
            <li>, really really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and no try to go the different directions as you shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Straight out of the box</li>
            <li>It shifts the razor when going over those areas, so it provides a close and even shave without much hassle.  </li>
            <li>No nics or cuts the flexball handle is no gimmick it really helped with the shave and the curvature of my face and neck.</li>
            <li>The Flexball Technology really sets this blade apart because it allows the blade to closely hug the skin no matter where you are shaving.</li>
            <li>The lubrastrip keeps everything smooth so you get the closest shave possible.</li>
            <li>and I have gotten very spoiled with those.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like the improvements with this razor.</li>
            <li>The precision razor does just that, gets you real close where you need it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for an unbeatable close shave!</li>
            <li>The handle feels durable and over a very durable product.</li>
            <li>I think the ball is a gimmick because there really isn&#x27;t any side pressure given to a razor unless you are slicing your face.  </li>
            <li>I have a very angular face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of a hefty razor, and I thoroughly enjoy the weight of this one in my hand.</li>
            <li>I would say that the head really did contour for maximum contact.</li>
            <li>It also gave a very close shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I received this razor as a trial from Gillette and have been very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think Gillette really scored an improvement here instead of just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li>Things I do like about Gillette Fusion Proglide is its portability and always ready for use as compared to electric shavers that do need recharge and the expense of cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this razor for very close shaves</li>
            <li>flexball really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for sending me a sample handle and razor blade to try out.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t find that much utility in five blades either.</li>
            <li>It performed comfortably and without draw backs, but i didnt feel any difference to signify the need for a different style or type of razor.  </li>
            <li>Easier and faster to shave and much increased maneuverability with regard to the blade.</li>
            <li>Really my mistake for not noticing also Amazon does not do returns on these items.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite aspects of this particular razor is the single grooming blade on the backside.</li>
            <li>and it gets the job done shaves very smooth and extremely close.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time yesterday and it provided a close shave without any burn since I was able to use less strokes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the previous version of this Proglide and that was the first razor that made my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m not sure a post-shave measurement would show any differences between this and its Version 1 predecessor, overall I feel more confident that the contact with my face is steady and consistent during shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then take the first stroke with this new technology.</li>
            <li>a man with sensitive skin, this product wins hands down, but the fact that my wife liked the closeness better is only a bigger plus.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide works amazing , I used it to shave my head which is not a easy task</li>
            <li>But they really didn&#x27;t make anything significant for me personally.</li>
            <li>super sharp blades which cuts hair cleanly in one pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as the glide strip is moistened with warm water for a few minutes, you will get a fantastic shave, even without shave cream... and</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re used to sharp razors, I feel like this one is even more so.</li>
            <li>Same great razor, not a huge difference from the normal one</li>
            <li>After using it two times over a two weeks times span, since my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast, it&#x27;s given me a great shave without having to look over twice to make sure I got every hair like I usually do with my other razors.</li>
            <li>The flex ball is a unique feature that took a short amount of time to get used too</li>
            <li>Red bumps on neck have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>My upper lip has not seen so clean a shave in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that you are buying a low end razor and shouldn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I have used many razors as I am prior military so shaving and finding a good razor that can continually get the job done and get it done right is hard.</li>
            <li>The handle itself is sturdy and not hard on the eyes at all!</li>
            <li>I am getting- virtually every single hair is easily eliminated.  </li>
            <li>In terms of angle chin shaving, the Proglide does a better job without any Knicks or cuts: the blade is as smooth as with the regular Fusion ; it is a cleaner shave overall and somewhat quicker than with the regular Fusion.</li>
            <li>technology would make it more difficult to shave around the lines of my beard, but the razor really does not move all that much - in fact it requires more force than you would think to make the razor pivot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flexball technology really helps increase flexibility and coverage to get that smooth, clean shave without missing hairs which is always embarrassing!  </li>
            <li>I bring this up because this has been a huge pain point for me with other blades getting clogged quickly, always right in the middle of the length of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given that this was a free item and it seemed new and different</li>
            <li>I assumed that it would swivel around loosely and almost uncontrollably however  allow the razor to easily respond to contours of the face while maintaining sturdiness where desired.</li>
            <li>As good as the previous Fusion shaving systems were, I could always feel some pulling, get the occasional nick and feel some stubble.</li>
            <li>I have been using cheap disposable razors for a long time.</li>
            <li>I also was able to shave in record time, and the extra blade on the back allowed me to keep my side burns straight.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Merkur safety razor to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>My neck is pretty sensitive, but I need to basically shave in every direction to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>My neck is pretty sensitive when it comes to shaving, but I had no issues here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not pay for the razor, because it&#x27;s not worth it for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Gilette vet from the early 90&#x27;s, when I first started shaving.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this new razor if you have more sensitive skin to cuts and are looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>and I have never been satisfied, until I tried this razor and unsurpassed, hands down</li>
            <li>When I first tried it I was surprised to see that the hard to reach places of my face and neck were smooth, the razor moved effortlessly as I shaved, almost as if it was made to custom fit my face.</li>
            <li>I will say that it does add some weight to the razor and might be a little challenging to get a straight line for your beard.</li>
            <li>Looks like I found my new razor!</li>
            <li>I have found my new razor of choice!</li>
            <li>But I also have a very sharp face, so maybe guys with a rounder face would benefit from this technology better.  </li>
            <li>The new flex ball doesn&#x27;t really do anything...</li>
            <li>But, much to my surprise, the new ProGlide thankfully did not pull at all.</li>
            <li>But I got the chance to try the razor with Flexball handle thanks to Gillette, but of course I almost always try new technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, it gives a very close and comfortable shave, with minimal tugging.  </li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t just say that unless I really love something.  </li>
            <li>This thing left my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first razor since the Mach 3 that actually reminds me of the shave I got from my first experience.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have any wet shaver yet, it would be a nice buy, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch from my regular shaver just to get this one.</li>
            <li>Gillette has been the only razor brand I&#x27;ve used and by far it shave in dept, leaving my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>As always, Gillette delivers a decent product.  </li>
            <li>No nicks, not even razor burn, not on my most sensitive bits, and really no effort whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Most guys don&#x27;t know this nowadays, but to get the closest possible shave you are supposed to do it three times in three different directions.</li>
            <li>this is decent razor</li>
            <li>I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not usually someone who uses modern cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t decide if there was anything specifically better about the Flexball and blade redesign, but I did feel like it made the shave a lot smoother, made washing the hair off the blades easier, and my skin seemed less irritated than normal</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonder shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving product reviews are highly subjective.  </li>
            <li>A High Quality Razor For Sure!&lt;br</li>
            <li>…results may vary but I high recommend this razor for a men</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I received one a sample razor from Gillette to try and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recomment</li>
            <li>The precision razor on the back is the same as I&#x27;ve experienced with previous Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>With this one I find that I have to take less passes to get a complete shave which is nice as I have sensitive skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li>make sure to completely dry the blades before you put the razor away and the cartridge will last a much longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this new razor makes it very simple &amp; quick to get a close shave</li>
            <li>The flex ball does help maneuver through my face a little better.</li>
            <li>a little more info:&lt;br</li>
            <li>it might miss some of the places that need  a little bit more pressure.    </li>
            <li>The subtle give from the flexball makes a huge difference in how smooth the shave feels.</li>
            <li>Nice razor, hits those hard to reach places...</li>
            <li>The new flex ball handle will be my new go to razor!  </li>
            <li>The handle stays secure in your hand while shaving even when it is wet.</li>
            <li>but it was definitely a smooth guide and works very well on my coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>would say that I have a fairly normal face as far as hills and valleys go, but this razor handled each curve very well and without accidental cuts.  </li>
            <li>&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li>The handle itself is pretty basic, but what really caught my attention was the &amp;#34;flexball.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I shave my head and normally it takes a couple of times to get all of the hair</li>
            <li>Normally my wife detests my razors because they break out her legs.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, and I&#x27;m not sure how much we really need so many blades.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting over the regular proglides, you will notice the difference which translates into ease of use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different razors in the past from some of the more basic Gillette&#x27;s to Shick and everything else</li>
            <li>I normally buy their razors and product however</li>
            <li>First of all, I wanted to say that I received this product a few weeks ago for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>This is exciting for me, as normally my skin gets irritated with multiple passes</li>
            <li>One of the neat things I did not break out it is truely for sensitive skin that is a Big plus for me.</li>
            <li>My wife had a big smile when I asked her if she&#x27;d seen my Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle.</li>
            <li>Usually, I use disposable 3 blade plastic razor which have a much thinner and more square handle.  </li>
            <li>Works good, not great.</li>
            <li>The way the Flexball allows the razor to not only pivot the head up and down as it has in the past, but also now side-to-side is awesome!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an extremely well made razor that I would highly recommend for shavers of all types and a good enough buy for the price, especially on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a closer shave and its easy to use without going over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li>pack opened easily and included the razor with two cartridges, one that was already connected and an extra one in the rack found on the back of the razor holder where you can place that can hold up to five cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how Gillette razors tend to last so much longer then other brands.</li>
            <li>Knowing how Gillette is, this thing probably has titanium blades that will last way longer than most other solutions too, so you don&#x27;t really end up replacing them as often.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite part of it, though, was the single trimming blade on the back of the cartridge.</li>
            <li>As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li>It looks like they have the razor backing right next to the blades</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The orange Flexball pivots from left to right.</li>
            <li>Actually, they got one thing right.</li>
            <li>The new ProGlide came with a replacement blade that I&#x27;ll install after my next shave with the current one, but I feel it&#x27;s a good value as I can get several shaves with the same blade, without sacrificing the close shave I come to expect from Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a solid product at a decent price that performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth like the sharp blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor with the flexball</li>
            <li>I also use cheap disposable razors, and with neither disposable nor other Gillette razors</li>
            <li>After trying the Proglide I gave all of my new Sensor blades away.  </li>
            <li>I was chosen to take the new Fusion Proglide Flexball razor for a test drive compliments of Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Flexball is what got my attention as a new feature.</li>
            <li>The new Flex Ball in the handle allowed the blades to move with the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette, I thought the flex ball part would just be another gimmick  to get people to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every year a new one?</li>
            <li>I shaved using this new contraption and saw NO difference from my Gillette Pro Glide razor.</li>
            <li>I recieved this New Fusion with Flexball technology as a promotional gift from Bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li>I was offered by Gillette to try this new shaver for free,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>It might be the new rotating head or the redesigned blades.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item if you are looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>Although this is just my take on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought a new razor in years</li>
            <li>The new flexball technology blew my mind.</li>
            <li>so I knew quality would not be in question, but this new functionality might.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an edge on the reverse side for squaring off sideburns which I feel didn&#x27;t live up to</li>
            <li>When a new one came out, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>Gillette sent me a new Fusion Proglide to test out.  </li>
            <li>Gillette gave me an opportunity to try their new Fusion Proglide with Flexiball Technology Razor.  </li>
            <li>my new go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although almost never an early adopter w consumer goods (i.e., new blade refills always cost a premium!)</li>
            <li>Seriously, how about instead of coming out with a new kind of &#x27;handle&#x27;</li>
            <li>The Proglide with Flexball easily maneuvers around the contours of my face and makes shaving each morning less of a hassle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely consider making this my primary razor in the future.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows the Gilette Fusion is already a great razor: It cuts hair very well without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li>so I usually shave pretty quickly without much thought.</li>
            <li>It shaved me smooth with minimal after-effect, and I decided to switch to using it instead of my old style razor.</li>
            <li>In the past I used the earlier versions of the fusion razors and was very satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this razor in the future to keep my face cut and hair free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin because it glides just like</li>
            <li>burn(I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my neck, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a &amp;#34;pay for the best&amp;#34; type of guy--I balance price and value, and typically lean towards &amp;#34;good enough for the right price&amp;#34;--my wife calls it being cheap.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for years, the new features plus the consistent performance keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next day with NO razor burn and still pretty smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first shave I was totally sold.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Fusion since it only had 3 blades, and I thought, &amp;#34;It can&#x27;t get any better than this.&amp;#34; Now, several generations later, the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball has wowed me again.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Especially if you have narcolepsy, or are visually impaired or looking for something to complement your current shaving method for the more tender haireas.</li>
            <li>but wow the flexball fusion changed my mind!</li>
            <li>Better than anything I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>The pivot thing is a bit of a gimmick, but I will say the area under my lip and above my chin was cut closer on the first swipe than what I experience</li>
            <li>Normally if I wait too long, I&#x27;ll have to buzz it with an electric razor first or make two or three passes with my normal razor.</li>
            <li>i would buy this product in the future if the cost made it a better value than other options.</li>
            <li>However, with previous products - even new blades out of the box - the other razors ALWAYS pulled on the stubble on my upper lip, which clearly doesn&#x27;t feel great.</li>
            <li>It had an extremely comfortable weight, feeling light enough to control and heavy enough to maintain sturdiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different type/brands of razors including other models from Gillette but by far the Gillette Fusion Proglide with FlexBall Handle is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, it is nice that they left the razor cartridges the same as other Gillette Fusion products.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quick my shave went (likely because of the multiple sharp blades) and how close and smooth it was after I</li>
            <li>Easy with my psoriasis, very limited to none red bumps on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Venus handles/blades (cheap handle, light-weight plastic, alternating blades...) for about a year and a half, since I lost my Gillette Mach 3</li>
            <li>I get a close, comfortable shave, the blades last twice as long as the others razors that I have.</li>
            <li>I got the usual GREAT shave but the gimmicky ball had NOTHING to do with it.</li>
            <li>I typically just use the cheap, disposable razors to shave, so I was pumped to receive this Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball to review from Gillette.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream, just wash my face and leave it wet, and this razor does a super job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the closeness of the shave from the regular Proglide razors that I normally use.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time shaving and I am always looking for something new or better to help me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find razors that are dependable and consistent in quality, but Gillette has always been a major player in the razor-game and can easily be relied upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Between the articulation and the new blades, they really did improve on their regular ProGlide razor.  </li>
            <li>have found that the flexball technology does contour to your face, though an experience everyday shaver who shaves 365+ times a year knows the contours of their face and doesn&#x27;t need a new technology to get a close smooth</li>
            <li>Although it is not much different from the previous razor from gillette, it is a bit better.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor was previously the regular Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>I passed it on to my father and he also likes it, thinks it&#x27;s marginally better than the previous version, but not enough to justify the cost of the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver especially for people who do designs or any type of artistic stuff with their facial hair.</li>
            <li>They last nearly twice as long though, and definitely shave better</li>
            <li>Back in the day I had one of the original vibrating razors and it was a bit odd to use, so I was skeptical - but the new blade configuration works great with the vibration.</li>
            <li>A little while ago Gilette let me try the Fusion Proglide for free.</li>
            <li>Just clean metal to run up and down my face.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this razor didn&#x27;t tug at it, I shaved nicely.</li>
            <li>The razor might cost a little more, but you only have to buy it once.</li>
            <li>The four blades provide for a close and quick shave, and the blades themselves provided a closer shave than any other four bladed razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>: As with all Gillette shaving products, the cost is very high (especially blades) compared to competitors.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the new flex ball technology with this razor because a trouble with me is around my jawline.</li>
            <li>Although the swivel action from the Flexball takes a little getting used to, I think overall it is an innovative feature.</li>
            <li>With dull razors, people with sensitive skin are much more prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Great blades, that don&#x27;t last and are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li>Didnt give me a rash with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I am fairly surprised about the quality of this model.</li>
            <li>I received this razor from Gillette to test and have been pleased to say the least.</li>
            <li>And I also notice that I miss strips or sections, have to go over the areas again, and that gives my sensitive skin razor burn.  </li>
            <li>That was my biggest surprise, because it really did last.  </li>
            <li>And as someone with sensitive skin I recommend the Fusion Proglide razor.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.</li>
            <li>I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette about two weeks ago and have used it so far about 5-6 times.</li>
            <li>Of course, I don&#x27;t really give it a second though</li>
            <li>nearly 3 times the price of the shave club ones.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gillette products for years and this ranks up there with my old Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>The FlexBall technology allows me to shave the contours of my face without nicking my chin as I used to do on a frequent basis.  </li>
            <li>but the swivel action is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the ultimate test I could think of.</li>
            <li>I really just can&#x27;t afford to buy these things on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>flexball handle is heavy, but well-balanced to the point where it&#x27;s extremely comfortable to hold and shave with.</li>
            <li>The strips add so much to a shave, that you only really notice when they start to wear off or when you use a razor that simply doesn&#x27;t provide them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before trying this product, I used Gillette Proglide razors frequently.  </li>
            <li>And since this manual razor does not have the vibrations, I find the shave to be far inferior to what I get from my Gillette Proglide Styler.</li>
            <li>and it got nearly all of it.</li>
            <li>stuck with their 5+1 blade cartridge that routinely last 3+ months, making it very affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Side to side flexing action</li>
            <li>I tried several of the cheap alternatives and finally came back to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>and it got nearly all of it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used this razor within two days of receiving and I was so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Proglide Flexball has so far eliminated any razor burn.</li>
            <li>Having used the cheaper blades for a few months, I&#x27;m surprised at how much better the Proglide actually is.</li>
            <li>The Flexball allows for a complete stroke from chin to neck without losing contact with your skin .  </li>
            <li>The only downside would be that it dues clog but what razor,  besides straight, doesn&#x27;t?  </li>
            <li>Glides effortlessly along my face and neck, never missing a hair.  </li>
            <li>but this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off to give you an idea of what kind of shaver I am, I maintain a beard while using the razor to keep the thick brush that constantly grows on my neck at bay.</li>
            <li>That sometimes happens to me when razors dull quickly after first 3 uses, but thankfully was not the case</li>
            <li>sure the flexball provided a little more movement, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be a dramatic change.</li>
            <li>While I did find that this razor followed the contours on my jaw line and throat much better than most every other razor I have used, I was not impressed with the blades.  </li>
            <li>I will probably purchase more of these cartridges as well as look for a cheaper alternative in the mean time.</li>
            <li>It is close, comfortable, and so far hasn&#x27;t dulled, although that could be because I sharpen it on my forearm before I shave every morning (run it opposite way on your forearm five times - it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it keeps the blades sharp...</li>
            <li>I always rinse it in hot water and dry it before putting it away.  </li>
            <li>Like the weight of the Razor is light and handle technology was different from other</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside of the flexball technology, the fact that the razor has 5 blades, I found that the cartridge last longer than my three bladed cartridge and the precision trimmer on the back is very helpful to get those orphan hairs that the main blades do not</li>
            <li>When doing a full shave, my face is noticeably smoother and less cut up, nicked, and bumped.</li>
            <li>The next few uses were more everyday type shaves, and I paid special attention to the way it slid across the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>I really like how you can buy replacement blades instead of having to buy a whole new razor every time, it reduces waste.</li>
            <li>I typically shave my head bold every few days and keep clean face</li>
            <li>It does a fine job, but I&#x27;m not sure I find an advantage to the Flexball feature.</li>
            <li>It does provide a decent shave with standard irritation expectations</li>
            <li>This version does glide over my face very well, but no better (IMO) than a fresh Proglide cartridge.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is how much the razor gets clogged, other than that the shave is a really nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>was skeptical that it was simply a gimmick to add some dazzle to their product line, but I was in for a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; seems to be engineered about right -- flexible enough to follow contours effortlessly but stiff enough for precise trimming around facial</li>
            <li>I got the Razor from Gillette and I was expecting a huge difference from their previous line ( the one with the same head that vibrates),</li>
            <li>The lubricating strip and slightly sharper blades make a HUGE difference that I&#x27;ll remember next time</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not down with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box i received in the mail, my reaction was &amp;#34;woah.&amp;#34; The new design caught me off guard because it really is pretty different from what I&#x27;ve seen in the past.</li>
            <li>I am a razor fanatic and have tried many razors from Battery Powered razors to regular old school 2 blade disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>price may be a little higher than one would like to spend, however the durability of the blades outlasts normal disposables.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get hardly any cuts &amp; it is maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m one of those guys that has to pull my skin a little or make funny faces to shave.</li>
            <li>Most likely will purchase again because of flexball to get to those hard to reach sections on my face.#gotitforfree</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know if it is actually the blades, or if they are placed at a different angle than they are on other products, but I did not find this razor giving me a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used safety razors in the past, and when using a safety razor, you want a light touch and loose grip so as not to put much pressure on the skin, which results in nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>I also thought that the new razor, the turbo gave me about the same shave in terms of closeness.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology definitely brings some new ideas to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>For the shave alone  I would give it five (5) stars, but for the new handle I can only give it two (2) stars.</li>
            <li>The new flexball design truly outshines the prior products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this new Gillette Fusion razor for about a month now and wanted to compare it to multiple razors before reviewing.  </li>
            <li>and I received the Proglide razor with the new flexball technology from Gillette to try recently.</li>
            <li>I have been using the proglide power prior to trying this new razor.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Mach 3 for years and this is the razor that finally convinced me to upgrade to a new razor style.  </li>
            <li>To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle that I received from Gilette really has me considering a switch back to a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>Since i started to shave, i always had a problem, my skin would always be red and very irritated, even with multiple kinds and brands of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I gave this razor a solid two weeks of use and don&#x27;t find the extra pivoting to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>If it was less rigid with it&#x27;s side motion it might be useful</li>
            <li>At first I was a little puzzled with my new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with Flexball handle.</li>
            <li>You can now not have to only make straight &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; down your face, but now you can &amp;#34;juke&amp;#34; left or right</li>
            <li>I am a daily shaver who needs a close-to-skin tight shave, and I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>It shaves the hair of my skin right down to my chinny chin chin.  </li>
            <li>so I usually buy a significant qty.</li>
            <li>Sounded like I was in for some major cuts.</li>
            <li>When I first decided to shave with the Fusion ProGlide - FlexBall Handle, I will admit, I just assumed that this would be like any other razor that I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>It contours to your face like no other razor and it gets every hair with ease.</li>
            <li>WOULDNT TRADE IT FOR NO OTHER.</li>
            <li>The new flexball technology that has been added to the handle makes it extremely flexible and allows you to easily get to a few of those harder-to-reach</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving your head everyday can be tiresome and most of the times all I wanted to do is to get it done as soon as possible so many times</li>
            <li>It is a very smooth shave along with some shave secret oil I use.</li>
            <li>I was always frustrated with not being able to shave underneath-the-chin area, and this has significantly helped me mitigate that issue.</li>
            <li>Their razors are lightweight and even though the replacement cartridges can be a little pricey, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide has the new Flexball technology which helps keep all 5 of the razors flat against your skin, regardless of the angle.  </li>
            <li>I personally had no use for this particular ball flex technology, however I admit that others may have a different experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the pivotal systems and all having had little or no success.</li>
            <li>No longer do I have to suffer with breakouts caused by dull or cheap razors.</li>
            <li>I got this razor as a part of a free trial from Gillette and I was a bit skeptical of the premise at first.</li>
            <li>Depending on your facial profile I think you&#x27;ll know if you need this razor, clearly, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Usually I get rough stubs after I shave, But using this Razor I can rub forwards or backwards and its baby smooth!</li>
            <li>This is Night and day above my old Schick Razor.</li>
            <li>I could go either way with the whole battery thing, which makes it a bit heavier, but it is not really that bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and only shave once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s to be expected of any razor really.</li>
            <li>Seamlessly shaves over contours such as the jaw and neck&lt;</li>
            <li>I am surprised by the longevity of this razor and would give it 6 stars if it was possible.</li>
            <li>I made the switch some time ago to the old school Double Edge Safety Razor style of shaver because of the lower cost.</li>
            <li>With the flex ball handle it truly does go with the contour of your face which really helps in getting every hair minus the cuts.</li>
            <li>It glided effortlessly over the contours of my face and left my skin feeling soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>,  the blades wear about average, and&lt;br /&gt;a weekend&#x27;s worth of stubble takes a bit of extra work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of sad that I am almost 34 years old, yet can not grow substantial facial hair...</li>
            <li>Normally I do cut myself several times during each shave, and after using the Fusion Proglide with Flexball on 6 different occasions, I have yet to cut myself even once.  </li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The FlexBall Handle Technology is crazy good.  </li>
            <li>but they have solved the problem by placing additional super tiny little gap fillers between each razor so that 1.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say the new blades are better but the actual razor itself is overkill and unnecessary if you already have a fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>By me doing this, it takes away any advantage of the new tech, and changing my shaving habits has shown to be more difficult than you would think.  </li>
            <li>Even with flexball and five blades, I have to shave about as much with a two blade fixed razor and less with a three blade.  </li>
            <li>The blade is easily replaceable  and seems to last me at least 3 weeks</li>
            <li>so of course I expected the newest razor to be nothing less than fabulous.</li>
            <li>When I tested it I knew right away this razor was above and beyond every other razor I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I figured it would be hard to improve on something that already delivered such fine results.  </li>
            <li>first impression was that this wasn&#x27;t that much different than any other disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I applaud the concept of the roller ball, but cannot really recommend this as opposed to some other razors that I have used.</li>
            <li>All these features are actually making it harder to get a REAL close shave.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if there is a single negative to report back.</li>
            <li>I have to buy new, gimmicky things, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li>Tried many other different brands in the past and nothing compares to quality and durability of Gillette brand of razors.</li>
            <li>The swivel head let me reach spots I&#x27;ve always found hard to get a clean shave using a regular disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ball technology didnt make much of a difference to me though, it worked the same as any other gillete refillable razor, which is well when paired with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have sensitive skin, so only going over each area of my face only once, helps me out quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised at how long the blade has lasted.</li>
            <li>short, Gilette needs to come up with a far simpler product name and maybe only 2 or 3 variations, and that&#x27;s it - keep it simple.</li>
            <li>ON the surface, it&#x27;s so simple, the head is on a swivel that pivots a little left or right based on the angle.</li>
            <li>The cut is clean and the flexball seems to solve my lifelong problem of an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li>While the movement of the ball, at least for me, is more subtle, as you actually shave, I found myself avoiding many of the usual movements and contortions</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you already have a Gillette razor, there really is no need to rush out to the store to pick up this shiny new one.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly around those hard to reach spots!</li>
            <li>This feels much sturdier than a typical razor, and you can tell that they wanted to put this in another class.</li>
            <li>shave my head as well as my face, and the razor performed very well, despite the fact that I&#x27;d waited longer than usual to polish the old dome.</li>
            <li>I firmly believe that the FlexBall Handle allows the razor to touch every corner of your face on the first shave... not the second or third.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I used this to shave for the first few couple of times, I noticed a really big difference from the disposable Gillette razors that I used to buy.</li>
            <li>it really conforms to your face so you are less likely to get cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the Lubrastrips that are installed on the head of the razor blades provide an extremely smooth shave, whereas cheaper, disposable razors usually leave you with razor burn and stubble due to a lack of lubrication that shaving cream just doesn&#x27;t cover.</li>
            <li>I usually shave every other day and with this blade my face always felt smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used previous shave-tech forward Gillette products prior to shaving with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball and while they have been satisfactory, this new product BY FAR crushes their previous models.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette sent me one of these recently, and I&#x27;ve got to say (without having comparison priced it against any other new razor products)</li>
            <li>Yes they may be a little more expensive but really, you are shaving</li>
            <li>And as always with Gillette&#x27;s quality razors, I did not suffer from razor burn on my very sensitive skin as I do with other razors.  </li>
            <li>Good or bad</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 shaved fairly close when I tried it years ago, but as bad as my skin felt afterward, I eventually gave up and switched to a double-edged safety razor.</li>

            <li> Anyhow, this is a good shaving razor!  </li>
            <li> In a nutshell: Great razor design, if you can get it at a good price, buy it!</li>
            <li> The pricing was good, the package came on time, it was in excellent condition, and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I thought, you know, since I have plenty of space and curves to shave, this razor would be great.</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor is great.</li>
            <li> The feather blades are cheaper, so I wish they would win, but they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After using the Proglide I wrote Gillette telling them what a great product they had.</li>

            <li> That being said, it is truely a great razor.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how happy this makes me.</li>
            <li> However I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide, courtesy of Gillette, and I can honestly say this is an excellent disposable razor.</li>

            <li> It feels great on your skin.</li>

            <li> this works great.</li>
            <li> well built, sturdy and durable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that great</li>
            <li> My roommates even bought one as well because of how great I thought it was.</li>
            <li> It is still a great product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who already owns a Fusion.</li>
            <li> I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great it is.</li>
            <li> I am happy to try this Razor.</li>
            <li> This is a Great razor.</li>
            <li> The lubrication strip was great, however did not have the life span of the blades.  </li>
            <li> this razor has been great for me..</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best razor i have ever used!</li>
            <li> I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I have not been this happy with a razor since the release of the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how effective the flexball is.</li>

            <li> ▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li> Even when shaving against the grain of my beard, it gave a very smooth shave, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had fom a manual razor.</li>
            <li> Love it best razor out there</li>
            <li> handle is great, good weight, texture.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the way this razor performs!!  </li>
            <li> I was actually MORE impressed with it</li>
            <li> Most razors made for men work just as wonderful for women</li>
            <li> best and most convenient shave money can buy and in my opinion you found it.</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding upgrade to what was an excellent shaving product.</li>
            <li> so it gives you a better shave is just awesome!</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette Fusion razors before and have a great opinion of them as they always gave me an awesomely close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> When I removed it from the box it was pleasantly weighty, and require no pressure when I began to shave.</li>
            <li> Great close shave and clean look great product!</li>
            <li> great product gets every hair love it!</li>
            <li> Whoop, Gillette always puts out great products and they just got even better!</li>
            <li> Speaking for all the men out there, including myself this is one of the best, most top notch razor ever!  </li>
            <li> With a DE razor, there&#x27;s a fine line between an awesome shave and blood, you&#x27;re skating the edge</li>
            <li> I get about 2-3 good shaves from one cartridge.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING</li>
            <li> and I dont have to worry about replacing batteries and its equally good shave.</li>
            <li> That said, my wife said that the Turbo side was superior in terms of stubble.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it from Gillette to sample and review, so I&#x27;ve put it to the test and here&#x27;s my fair review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All 5-6 times I got a good shave and did not notice bleeding once.</li>
            <li> However at 30 dollars for a box of refills I cannot in good conscience recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> It really is a good product</li>
            <li> Good, as always.</li>
            <li> if you want a close shave at a good price this is the one to try.</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review and I was delighted by the look and feel of the razor.</li>
            <li> To reiterate - it is a good shave &amp; so, four stars.    </li>
            <li> I LOVED the shave from the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Silvertouch Power Razor, and you will too.</li>
            <li> I can say something good is</li>
            <li> There is good spacing between each of the blades.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide from Gillette itself did a good job.</li>
            <li> and I look good after I shave with it.  </li>
            <li> When I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silver touch manual razor found it to be a good razor.</li>
            <li> and I think the improvement is marginal but good.  </li>
            <li> My wife has stolen it because she loves how good it works on her legs.</li>
            <li> I loved the metal handle on the flexball razor.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews and thought I would check out what all the hype was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Awesome product, a must buy razor if your looking for a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Its&#x27; a good razor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the non-Proglide blades for it, because they were on sale, and it&#x27;s still fairly decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone that received for a christmas gift loved it.  </li>
            <li> An awesome improvement to the original.</li>
            <li> So overall I am very impressed with this awesome razor!</li>
            <li> It IS a great razor though, as are most Gillette products.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette products for many years and have been extremely happy with them.</li>
            <li> I will me more than happy to share my experience about gillette fusion proglide  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, which is why i gave it 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Others here are happy with it, so it might just work better for some than others.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy I was able to try this razor out.</li>
            <li> This razor is another great step in Gillette&#x27;s innovative product line.</li>
            <li> :&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good razor, the flexball is an amazing feature, dealing with all contours the body can throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con :</li>
            <li> It feels nice in the hand and has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> I had a nice stubble on m face, so i needed a good shave.</li>
            <li> The Silvertouch cut right through and did an excellent job on just one shave.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Gillette razors but this one is just pure awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to my husband, as most Gillette’s products, this one is good – close shave, good mobility, whatever else you’ve come to expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great close shave and clean cut look!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I will for sure stick with this razor!</li>
            <li> and I love the shave!</li>
            <li> You have to love the ball!</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silverglode and I must say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
            <li> I still enjoyed it tho!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job on the sides of your face, but in the chin area it gets very more marks.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor from Gillete and I was able to shave with it once or twice before it disappeared!</li>
            <li> I love that it flows nicely around all the curves in my neck and face!  </li>
            <li> It 100 times better than disposable razors!</li>
            <li> love the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great shave, super comfy!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexiball technology to try for free from Gillette and it is great.</li>
            <li> They shave absolutely amazingly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Chrome looks amazing</li>
            <li> razor gives a real smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball that I received from Gillette was amazing.</li>
            <li> The blades are great and accurate, as it has been always my experience with Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its truly amazing how great this product works and how smooth my face is after a shave.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Real comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I am happy that i received this product for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Gelette sent me this product free of charge and it is a great razor, gives a nice close shave, the flex ball works well.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> I got my Razor from Gillette, and I think it&#x27;s amazing that Gillette has come up with a razor with a flexable handle.</li>
            <li> They are definitely smooth, and great quality razors that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I did, and got a nice cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the improvements in the blade are also quite nice.  </li>
            <li> and I want to give it an honest review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)</li>
            <li> but what I&#x27;m really loving is the engineering of the heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice, hefty metal feel (although I think it is chrome plated plastic).</li>
            <li> For the sake of Gillette I decided to give this razor an honest chance.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about Gillette</li>
            <li> I honestly was amazed.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades work well together to provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> pivoting head is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The blades work very well and I am always impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> Gets in all the nooks and crannies nicely with the pivoting ball.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, I loved the way it shaved.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, I use an electric razor in the morning to trim and use this as a means to get a really nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> Now, if you have problems with your razor not adhering to the contours of your face, then this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;However, at the end of the day, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, have been successful in avoiding any cuts, and appreciate the smooth, close shave, but I can get that from any Gillette product.</li>
            <li> It handles nicely around the neck line and face.  </li>
            <li> You get a nice close shave every time.</li>
            <li> and she said it gives her a nice close shave</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice quality razor.</li>
            <li> I  was able to get close to two weeks of shaves out of one cartridge, and that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> First thoughts, the weight of the razor, in combination with good technique, feels great against the skin.</li>
            <li> I believe that razor does great job keeping my face clean shaved</li>
            <li> I truly love this comfortable, smooth, great shaving razor!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors before and I am certain this one is one of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This new Flexball version is the best yet!</li>
            <li> Like most razors these days, the Gilette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology gives a great smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> However, if your goal is to be able to get a close shave without having to focus too much, then this is the best bet.</li>
            <li> It was a good razor, but it definitely was not the best.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is by far the best razor I have used in my life.  </li>
            <li> It just follows the contours of my head very easy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t, but I can very easily imagine what it feels like to do so.</li>
            <li> Very easy to move around your face and get all those stubborn stops.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth shave that adjusted nicely around my chin...</li>
            <li> I used to own a power proglide but to my surprise the manual one is better than the power.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I would like to let you know that this razor is so far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Most amazing piece of technology for men on the market.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best razor i have used</li>
            <li> i recieved this razor from Gillette and it is by far the best razor that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> 4 stars, easily recommend it!</li>
            <li> The good thing is you can use the fusion proglide razors to replace the original one.</li>
            <li> I, like most people rarely write a manufacturer about a great product, but I will immediately write if the product is garbage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for shaping the Goat, making precise straight cuts in between and along the edges.</li>
            <li> &quot; This razor has a great metal design, and, in my opinion, very eye catching.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Gillette Fusion Proglide since it does good job keeping my face clean shaved.</li>
            <li> Out of every major brand and the feather razors sold here, this gives me the best shave.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for this price and my husband really like it  :):):):):):</li>
            <li> It seemed like a really great idea at first.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if Gillette could improve the Fusion ProGlide Razor, I had been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Way to go Gillette on another fine product!</li>
            <li> This razor is made genuinely fine!</li>
            <li> Very smooth razor.</li>
            <li> It was very smooth to the skin, and the shaving was very precise.</li>
            <li> The result was a very smooth face with no razor</li>
            <li> This razor has very comfortable blades that do not tug on the skin.</li>
            <li> it was amazing flexible and easy to shave</li>
            <li> The lubricated strip is a nice touch, so it makes it easy to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Works good but wears out too quick.</li>
            <li> She loved how close the shave was and how the lubricating strips made shaving her legs easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would use it more often if I needed to because it provides a very comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I love how it shaves my beard off very smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to many more years of shaving with Gillette&#x27;s fine razors!  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, the razor has a very attractive design, is very sturdy/durable and feels very comfortable when held.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this razor!</li>
            <li> I was aaaall set to absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for like two weeks to find out what &#x27;I must be doing wrong&#x27; to not have this awesome razor be awesome.</li>
            <li> The strip of &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; stuff chips off, even while using, and just seems to do more drying out than moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I will for sure be keeping this.</li>
            <li> Not so many missed patches any more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I think I might have to upgrade. :)</li>
            <li> The grip is better</li>
            <li> Most of the weight is located at the top of the handle (in the flexball itself).</li>
            <li> Like the Gillette best for the following reasons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette sent me a Fusion Proglide razor with Flexball handle to use, and overall I was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design.</li>
            <li> I have been a Fusion Proglide user since it was introduced and could not imagine a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I found I was able to shave with fewer strokes because I didnt miss as many hairs requiring me to go over those areas again.</li>
            <li> and I must say that the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor is pretty AMAZING!</li>
            <li> When you are done with your shave, you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design of the product.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li> and it got most of it in one pass.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be able to go two days between shaves.    </li>
            <li> i love shaving with</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed with the overall design and feel of hte razor.</li>
            <li> ▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall from Gillette to try and it is a razor with an interesting spin.  </li>
            <li> Upon trying it though, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Even after many uses the blade has yet to tug or cause razor burn.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor!</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> love this razor.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am usually very picky on products for shaving so for me to say this is a great shaver....</li>
            <li> just seem to work better for my face.</li>
            <li> The razor allowed me to get one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get with a manual razor.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> How many Gillette razors are there?</li>
            <li> My most recent type was the Fusion ProGlide, which for my purposes, has been the best shave I have gotten from a Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years and just when I thought the brand could not innovate their razors anymore</li>
            <li> Arrived safely.  </li>
            <li> The swivel handle helped with being able to shave without pulling and stretching my face.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is the best razor I have used to date</li>
            <li> elaborate</li>
            <li> I love the pivoting head on this razor.</li>
            <li> Once again, GREAT product, just marketed very badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This latest variation puts a pivot on the end of the razor handle.</li>
            <li> The pivot lets the razor follow the skin even more closely for an even eaiser, better shave.</li>
            <li> As a follow-up, why offer so many options anyway?</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette for years and have always enjoyed them as they work as desired.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and no issues here!</li>
            <li> The Flexball system was phenomenal, as it guided the blades around my imperfectly shaped head and face</li>
            <li> Well, this morning, my face and head felt like I just shaved this morning, both are still nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> feature more blade to trim sideburns and so on.</li>
            <li> The flexball handle allows me to tilt the head of the razor from side to side which gives a position to shave better.</li>
            <li> ):)</li>
            <li> :):):):):)</li>
            <li> After having seen advertising for the product I thought that the FlexBall handle was just a gimmick, but the shave is a bit better with it.</li>
            <li> Over time, I came to prefer them, and although its the refills rather than the razors that strike at the checkout stand, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with \\&quot;Version 1\\&quot; of the Fusion handle since I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great razor if having the newest is a must, if not then getting another Gillette won&#x27;t be too much of a difference</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> May be better for men&#x27;s faces than a woman&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try, and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is awesome</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way you can get a nice close cut, leaving you with a smooth shave face.</li>
            <li> I am able to reach all the nooks on my faceg</li>
            <li> and you better be paying attention.</li>
            <li> and I would have woken up with a nice stubble free shave.</li>
            <li> With the grain, across the grain, against the grain, refreshing your lather each time.</li>
            <li> , I am glad I tried this thing?</li>
            <li> Chances are most people reading this have more wiggle room in their budget than I do for performance grooming.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a basketball player, you&#x27;ll love this thing, it looks like one of your shoes.</li>
            <li> I received a free product from Gillette for my review, All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I was sure I would love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor because of it&#x27;s 5 Blades and battery operated push button vibration and a flexball head.</li>
            <li> , you would think the product would be top notch.</li>
            <li> ive used dollar shave club and this blad is waaaay better.</li>
            <li> I used this razor with my Gillette shaving cream for even better results.</li>
            <li> The way the razor moves around the jawbone and Adams apple is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Fusion that I have for a number of years and have really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> By being able to contour, it provides a close shave that virtually gets every hair because of the maximum contact of the blade and your skin.</li>
            <li> All these shavers are goofy - 50 million blades, lubricating, bends, curves, turns, flexes,</li>
            <li> My husband loved the razor and it was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Most guys I know have kids to feed and bills to pay.  </li>
            <li> The swivel handle helped with being able to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face shaved evenly.</li>
            <li> but I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li> It gives me a close, nice shave and my wife tells me that I have a smooth face</li>
            <li> Overall it is an awesome razor.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I have never had a better shave than with this product.</li>
            <li> , I received this for free from Gillette and am reviewing this product for them!  </li>
            <li> ll version and costs quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Gillette Fussion and when I was offered a free Proglide Silvertouch to try I jumped on the chance!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t knock any stars off of the review, as I&#x27;m sure without the oil, it would be a non-issue.    </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my relationship with shaving has turned into love/love, as opposed to love</li>
            <li> While this is not marketed to the female demographic, it is also a great buy for the ladies!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best Men&#x27;s razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mach 3 for a decade or more.</li>
            <li> that this razor has a very sturdy feel to it with great grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Simply the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, electric or manual.</li>
            <li> It allows for me to get a better shave and it curves to my face.</li>
            <li> How many blades does a razor need?</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the razor head can move with the contour of my face.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed with the overall.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done way better than the ones I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The swivel handle helped with being able to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face shaved evenly.</li>
            <li> but I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors in my time here on earth</li>
            <li> but I was able to shave over just once</li>
            <li> have no idea if this razor works so well because of the &amp;#34;flexball,&amp;#34; which causes the top of the razor to pivot.</li>
            <li> look up &amp;#34;razor forearm trick&amp;#34; for more information).</li>
            <li> After trying out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor for a couple of weeks, I must say It is better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Significantly better?  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor I received free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday, I got this razor from Gillette with the Flexball handle and more Proglide blades, and I got to try it out this morning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to help me shave any better or more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I used this razor once, and it was an okay razor.</li>
            <li> It may be a better choice for the chilled jawline over the chubby cheeks.</li>
            <li> I do my research, shop around, and buy smaller packs to determine the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept track and the blade lasted 53 shaves and was still much better than the disposable razor after its 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Simply the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Bzzagent packaging was nice and got a free catridge as well</li>
            <li> This being said if I were to be a regular razor user I would be very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Simply the best shave you can get at the moment.  </li>
            <li> Even the packaging is better than most products that come in plastic.  </li>
            <li> No blade clogging, smooth shave and no nicks!</li>
            <li> They both love it.</li>
            <li> Close shave and love the flexball handle.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this item instead of the Gillette Mach3 razor (which i love) and i was left with so many razor bumps!!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette for free to try and review - and with good reason I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Gillette razor and blades, they provide a smooth, clean, close shave every time.</li>
            <li> however this razor has a very unique feature in the FlexBall.  </li>
            <li> I am very excited about it</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball razor glides along with your faces ridges and curves and gives you a nice clean shave without the burn or irritation</li>
            <li> I tend to find that most every razor I get gives me a pretty good shave, despite how &amp;#34;Sci-Fi&amp;#34; the razor looks, and how fancy the name sounds.</li>
            <li> The Flexball makes it very easy to maneuver for smooth curves for any design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for a great razor.  </li>
            <li> The beard is very clean.</li>
            <li> for the shaving that this blade provides, it is what you would (and should) expect, a good consistent shave that does not slice your face off.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li> I liked the 5 fine Blades and the shaving was smooth.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try this!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor that I have seen in a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li> Most razors caused breakouts or itching after shaving, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide is great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily get into the grooves along my jawline.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I could probably get away with twice a week, considering how quickly my neck beard grows.</li>
            <li> Gillete always makes good razors, the proglide pivot works good in following the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth and nick free.</li>
            <li> great thing with this is that it&#x27;s a regular razor till you turn it on, so you can get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Compared to many other brands Gillette just is the best.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, and really does a nice job on my Noggin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given my skin sensitivity and my desire for the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable and worry-free!</li>
            <li> Wish coupons were more readily available though.</li>
            <li> So far I have to say its a great blade</li>
            <li> product is also great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me this product to try for free and I am glad they did.</li>
            <li> The flexball doesn&#x27;t do anything to make my shaving any more smooth.</li>
            <li> Edging a goatee or sideburns has never been easier or more precise than this.</li>
            <li> This razor does a incredible job of working around my neck to reduce redness and cuts by following the contours on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> I recieved this from Gillette and love it, this razor is soo smooth it literally glides across my face and skull since I shave my head as well as</li>
            <li> This razor allows me to shave a lot quicker since i am able to move smoothly around edges.</li>
            <li> its the most comfortable razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I get this Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor for FREE from Gillette and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Pro Glide with FlexBall Handle Technology free from Gillette as part of a promotion and really love it.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a smoother, closer or more comfortable razor.  </li>
            <li> Got a free sample from Gillette and will continue to use it as my primary shaving device!  </li>
            <li> This razor really does live up to the hype, and I&#x27;m very happy with the decision to get it.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, this razor is still treating me right, and is as great a shave as the first time.</li>
            <li> I am loving the smooth, super close shave that this razor provides.</li>
            <li> so a close and clean shave is important and the FlexBall ensures that I get the best results, especially around the jawline area.</li>
            <li> Super easy to get out of the package as you know how blister packs can be!</li>
            <li> Speaking of sharp, these blades are awesome!</li>
            <li> When I tried the ProGlide with FlexBall I immediately noticed a better shave -- even from the original ProGlide.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Handle is ergonomic and easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;-Blade</li>
            <li> It easily shaved around my face with ease without nicking the skin and causing me irritation.</li>
            <li> Overall, the razor is thoughtfully designed and provides an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li> It easily shaved around the curvature of my face and neck easily.</li>
            <li> The design of the handle moved the shaving cream out of the area of the blade and easily washed off.</li>
            <li> am very picky about shaving and any old razor will not do, but this was wonderful and works so well, i ve  told all my friends and family to go get one.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> It easily shaved around the curvature of my face.</li>
            <li> I used the Gilette Fusion before so I can easily compare the 2 products.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to use and glides well.</li>
            <li> #gotitfree Glides easily over my face.</li>
            <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Shaves very smoothly!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth</li>
            <li> Its basically a more comfortable, efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Still like the feel of the Hydra, but the Proglide is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to get out of the package and znc</li>
            <li> It easily shaved around the curvature of my face with ease.</li>
            <li> I have beard and it was easy to shave where I needed to shave.</li>
            <li> It is easier to shave with the contour of all body parts when the head of the razor moves easily.  </li>
            <li> and I found the pivot head extremely easy to control and easier to move about my face.</li>
            <li> The lubricant strip makes the razor glide so easily and the 3 blades get all of the hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> I go through to get a close, clean or safe shave and got that close shave quicker, easier and faster with this razor.</li>
            <li> It was easy to get out of the package.</li>

            <li> The flexball handle is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I also have a scar on the tip of my chin which can easily be nicked.</li>
            <li> It easily shaved around the curves of my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor the ball actually will follow my face so i don&#x27;t have make so many faces to get the close shave I desire.</li>
            <li> This system has an unobstructed backside which allows me to easily wash the blades out, and keeps me shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Taking the razor out was easy and I did not need wire cutters to get though the packaging.  </li>
            <li> While I loved my old razor this one is simply better.</li>
            <li> I have been a strong user and supporter of the Schick Hydra until I saw this and had to try it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> good product, but refills are high priced.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this new product and will buy it for sure.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design right off the bat.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design right off the bat.</li>
            <li> I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> The Flexball is pretty handy too.</li>
            <li> I save way more money going through a 10 back of those in 2-3 weeks (which do the job excellently well; it just takes longer), than having to shell out that much moolah.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample from Gillette and I was super happy with this new razor.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants their face to look nice and clean!</li>
            <li> Since I am comparing this razor to a disposable one, I can&#x27;t be sure that it is a great deal better than more similar competitors, but I certainly have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The razor glides smoothly over every contour and easily cuts through even the toughest whiskers.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman looking to buy a present for a man in your life, they would be VERY GLAD to own this</li>
            <li> I like this razor just fine.</li>
            <li> With 5 strong, durable blades the tug and pull on hair while shaving no longer occurs while the blade smoothly goes over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So thanks Gillette you now have 2 people in my house that love this razor!</li>
            <li> I feel that the flex ball,combined with the t blades, allowed me to shave along all the many contours of my head and face and allowed me to get a super close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color.</li>
            <li> This was a huge bonus, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would say out of all the razors I have tried thus far, this razor is the best of everything thus far.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the closeness of my shave, however, I did see that the hair took longer to grow in again - no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> So smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free in the mail</li>
            <li> If it is possible to take some weight out of the handle it would greatly improve this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I got a free Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette for product review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was really smoothly shaved with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks now (after getting this product given to me my Gilette to test), I am not all that impressed.  </li>
            <li> This one cuts smoothly but isn&#x27;t for getting close to your side burns.</li>
            <li> This razor has a nice looking and it feels very sturdy when I hold it.</li>
            <li> Got one free to try.  </li>
            <li> It allows for a smooth transition from the chin to the neck area.</li>
            <li> i was get it free from bzzagent</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month, not only was it a great shave, but it was also still working at a month.  </li>
            <li> I just got this razor to test for free</li>
            <li> Before using using this razor, which I got for free from Gillette, I was using a Gillette fusion without the flexball technology.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from Gillette for free to test.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li> and comfortable grip handle which helps prevent slippage in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Five</li>
            <li> The ball followed the contours of my face precisely.</li>
            <li> Of course there IS the razor burn factor with the cheap razors.</li>
            <li> I will never use cheap disposable razors again.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ Shaves close to the skin and leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this smooth.</li>
            <li> But since I received a free razor from Gillette to try, I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> done shaving smooth and close.</li>
            <li> friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free, to try and review, from Gillette, so I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> It feels as if my facial hair takes longer to grow in too which feels great</li>

            <li> I received this for free to try out</li>
            <li> really a smooth close shave</li>
            <li> After receiving this razor free from Gillette to try and review, the Dollar Shave Club membership is out the window</li>
            <li> I got this razor through Bzzagent to try out for free.</li>
            <li> It contours to your face and gives a smooth have.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s hiney, just the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> every year, we come up with a razor refill that doesn&#x27;t make me cringe and want to try to slit my wrists with one of the cheap ones?</li>
            <li> so slippppery smooth.</li>
            <li> I used to rely on disposables or cheap drug store brand razors</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball technology is a reliable razor that provides a consistently smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to shave, faster, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not now it&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li> done shaves smooth and close</li>
            <li> (Below review is done by my Husband):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor from the company.</li>

            <li> Smooth skin and lasts for longer.</li>
            <li> Smooth, close shave, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda cheap when it comes to razor replacements and this may move me away from using disposables.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this represents engineering excellence in effortless, precise shaving.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> done shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li> I like how close the shave is and how smooth my skin feels afterwards.</li>

            <li> When I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle for free from Gillette to review</li>
            <li> done shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li> I felt like the handle was comfortable to grip and its five blades and flexing head</li>
            <li> I just received a free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR from Gillette to test out.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, no nicks or cuts, and</li>
            <li> I have used the cheap Gillette razors with two blades for years.</li>
            <li> Now I received this razor free to review</li>
            <li> the experienced shaver need to pay the extra money for it?  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Gillette did a promo</li>
            <li> I find when I go a couple of days without shaving, the vibration helps me get a closer one - and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Got this free from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> amazingly smooth and doesn&#x27;t even need a lathering cream for using this.</li>
            <li> It works great over different contours and just seemed well designed all the way around.</li>
            <li> My face was smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> It shaves smooth and does in fact pivot like it advertises.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gets more of your hair and leaves it feeling really good.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor than the old one that i am using.</li>
            <li> flexball handle also surprised me, in a good sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who has to shave nearly every day, my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up before lunch, so a good, precise razor is a must.  </li>
            <li> I got to try it, thanks to BuzzAgent and by all means it was one of the best Gillette company has ever made, Never going back.</li>
            <li> This is not only good for men, I love it to shave my legs with.  </li>
            <li> You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first try with this new product was great.</li>
            <li> (Make sure it&#x27;s the right</li>
            <li> A close shave, straight clean lines, and just an nice looking, almost high-tech manual razor.</li>
            <li> When I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with the Flexball handle, from Bzzagent I was excited.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited when I was selected to review the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free by Gillette!&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of, the shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li> It was a very pleasant experience and had me second guessing my straight razor.</li>
            <li> A lot of times, I simply \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my facial hair rather than shave it all, and this razor has been great at giving my neck a clean shave alone.</li>
            <li> I was smooth and clean when I got finished shaving.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an effective manual razor.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, this razor looks awesome and high tech and has a very sturdy, high quality feel.</li>
            <li> It has worked great at getting a close shave, as you would expect from Gillette products, but I&#x27;ve found that the new Flexball technology really isn&#x27;t anything to call home about.</li>
            <li> The best part though, is that with this new razor, I don&#x27;t get any breakouts related to razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy to get out of the package and I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.</li>
            <li> Great for people like me who have an oddly contoured face to help cut more hair in one pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice clean shave with no hassle whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is definitely an investment for the better and one you will be pleased about!</li>
            <li> and i have to say i am not disappointed one bit in the results it gave me.</li>
            <li> But once I got past the longer growth, I was actually impressed.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Gillette razors and have used them with great results</li>
            <li> I was certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant to use the razor because I normally use an electric razor.</li>
            <li> When I tested out this version, I kept to my original routine.  </li>
            <li> This product is an improvement to the original pro glide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original for about a month now</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> being said, Gillette provided me this razor as part of a try-it-before-you-buy-it review program and although it may cost bit more than some alternatives, it is also higher quality.</li>
            <li> I am able to get consistent clean shave</li>
            <li> Iv  have tried ever razor out there and this is by far the best the flex ball moves around my face leavening a close shave that I haven&#x27;t been able to get from other razors</li>
            <li> Its sleek and clean design.</li>
            <li> As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> They also give you a clean shave as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my wife away from using this razor because she says it makes her legs feel super smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best manual razor I have found, and I suspect others would think the same.</li>
            <li> It was a smooth shave and was quick.</li>
            <li> It was nice and comfortable, the blades dulled pretty fast but other than that it was good!</li>
            <li> This is the one to buy, and instead of buying a ton of razors and throwing them all away, a great part about this razor is that you can just buy more heads and replace them every few weeks.</li>
            <li> My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li> My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li> It did give a very smooth shave, But I really did not care for this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the new handle, and I expect to be purchasing more of the Proglide blades next time I need refills.</li>
            <li> The Blades are great, smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> For those who have been loyal to a specific razor for years, they would probably not be a good fit for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have to shave over my face many times before, not with this razor as it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face leaving me with no irritation.</li>
            <li> However, the one thing I will say is that there&#x27;s nothing special about this razor.</li>
            <li> I was right!</li>
            <li> The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> The razor provides a good and clean shave, I had no problems with irritation and would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Luckily the blades are identical to the original Fusion</li>
            <li> I was cursed with a bright red rash whenever I shaved until I was given this razor by my wife.  </li>
            <li> Better than the cheap throwaways I normally use.  </li>
            <li> Just be weary of the latest advancements and if they really have an effect.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t think its significantly better than the regular Gillette Fusion Proglide, I still think it provides one of the most comfortable shaves out there.</li>
            <li> I say so far I&#x27;m loving the blade.</li>
            <li> I am on my second razor cartridge and have been get a consistently good shave.  </li>
            <li> , I can honestly see it in action when shaving my head.</li>
            <li> Day 1, I tell my straight razor everything will be OK and that I am just trying this out for a friend.</li>
            <li> Overall a good experience.</li>
            <li> This razor offers a sleek design that fits nicely by my sink.  </li>
            <li> Does it really cost that much more to add the FlexBall to the razor - why not just give it</li>
            <li> All of this was true until I found the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants the latest technology with their shave.</li>
            <li> I had the good fortune to try the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Silvertouch Power Razor recently when Gillette sent me one to review, (hereafter referred to as the GFPGSTPR - Fire</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is in need of a good razor.</li>
            <li> Good razor for the money and a product that only Gillette could deliver.  </li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Razor with Flexball Technology to try free, complimentary of Gillette.</li>
            <li> I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.</li>
            <li> Overall a good razor and experience.</li>
            <li> I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how flexible the handle is thanks to the flexball technology.</li>
            <li> I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how nice of a shave the Fusion Proglide razor</li>
            <li> have had a full beard since I was 13 and shaving has always been a thorn in my side.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was surprised with how much I liked this.</li>
            <li> I love the way it contours to your face and curves, the razor is really sharp but the lubricating strip wears out fast idk if its cause my wife uses it for her legs but the razor still works great without the strip.</li>
            <li> So much better than a normal razor!</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette Proglides in the past and the flexibility ball is by far my favorite nice smooth shave and superior design</li>
            <li> The mechanism that allows for greater movement is kind of loose and doesn&#x27;t allow you to get under the nose as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past month and it has given me a great, nick free, smooth shave every time.  </li>
            <li> It got every single hair very easily and was very smooth.</li>
            <li> so was excited to get a chance to try out this new one with the pivoting head which promised an even better shave that  </li>
            <li> ...sooner or later, your going to decide what works best for you on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a reluctant user of Fusion blades when the Gillette Excel variety I&#x27;d been satisfied with for many years started becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li> It took only a two or three passovers to accomplish a shave that took many more with either of my electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple razors ranging from the electric shavers that are upwards of $150 to the downright cheap disposable kind</li>
            <li> The Proglide is such a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> the super close shave my wife loves so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A quick hint.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job of going around corners of the jaw than the older razor.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the Flexball cartridge works on the Styler.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion for free from Gillette to review but the above opinions are my own and in now</li>
            <li> Super razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been a loyal Gillette consumer ever since.  </li>
            <li> I had quit using disposables about a year ago in favor of a safety razor, but I still use Gillette disposables and electric razors for those times when I need a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was quite excited to try it out right away.</li>
            <li> But for Gillette, if they will be making tons of $$ selling cartridges over the years, in my opinion it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for them to use better quality materials on the razor, so it lasts as long as possible and more than just feel, also LOOK good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provided a pretty good shave, however, I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from what their older shavers, the ones that just provided flexibility up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> always thought that this multiple blade idea was complete nonsense until I used the Proglide, this is absolutely the best razor I ever used.  </li>
            <li> First, I should advise that I received a free sample of this razor from Gilette to try out.    </li>
            <li> have since shaved three or four more times using the same blade, and each time I get the same great shave.</li>
            <li> I have also been using the previous generation fusion razor which is also very good, and I wouldn&#x27;t say that this razor is a large improvement if any improvement at all.  </li>
            <li> Surely, the flex-y part will help, the new stuff on the blades will help with moisturizing, it&#x27;ll cut close, and hey, three bucks off...</li>
            <li> With this new product, I am able to shave my mustache a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> i love the way the razor pivots to go with the curves of my face and will be switching to this as my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li> Yay, love my new razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexable Handle Technology.</li>
            <li> But their new Flexiball design is over the top.  </li>
            <li> someone who is new to shaving or finds themselves in a hurry most of the time, the  flexball technology assists with shaving without having to meticulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flexball gave a very close shave and stayed smooth for a full 48 hours before I noticed any stubble.</li>
            <li> The flexball is a neat feature in that it follows the contours of my face easily without much manual correction.</li>
            <li> While using this product my skin was nearly never irritated which makes Gillette Fusion Proglide better than most razors on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I made a mistake when I told my wife how much I liked how smooth my face was, how it followed the contours of my face really well and did a good job of getting to the harder to reach areas without having to completely contort my face.</li>
            <li> pretty regularly, I need a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found this razor easily follows your face contours very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll agree!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try to try  the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology provided by Gillette products.  </li>
            <li> The fact that this razor does so much of the work for you makes it easy for me to get a great, close shave over all the contours of my face while in a rush and paying little attention.</li>
            <li> This time they have a package that is stylish yet easy to open and somewhat eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology for anyone who is looking for a clean, smooth shave without any effort.  </li>
            <li> handle is easy to grip, especially when wet, and has an ideal weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time will tell how many good shaves you get before it gets dull.</li>
            <li> four to five shaves with one cartridge, before I have to really start working for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;The five blades make for a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I definitely have to thank Gillette for sending me this razor and for stealing me toward this amazing product that will stay in my shave kit for a while.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and smooth.</li>
            <li> This razor makes the morning much easier with the smooth shave provided by the razor and rollerball working together.</li>
            <li> The swivel ball head helps conform to the curves of my face and really helps in getting a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This product accomplishes this goal far better than my double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me one to try out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured that it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me a sample</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that cuts nice straight edges like my old 2 blade razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints, it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> I just tried this razor for the first time last week and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> The swivel action of the flexball allows me to shave around my jawline without having to re-do spots to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any of the books and crannies,</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li> Even with most 4-5 bladed razors, my sensitive skin would often become irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li> ; It&#x27;s just pretty cool to look at.</li>
            <li> I love this razor (even with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Gilette would further explain the benefits of the power</li>
            <li> , I think it looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth checking out for yourself.</li>
            <li> The first time out of the box, it was promptly pitted against a full beard.</li>
            <li> Nice doesn&#x27;t have the vibration like the former model</li>
            <li> yeah, was fun</li>
            <li> Honestly, the only thing that bothered me was the color scheme...</li>
            <li> If this razor is designed to prevent nicking and doesn&#x27;t cut you up at all, why would you need an any more sensitive razor?</li>
            <li> I also love that I can use my old Fusion cartridges on this</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny, and then some.</li>
            <li> They make be pricey, but the quality is just far better than anything else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, you can use any &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34; razor blade on this razor, yet the blades that were supplied in this pack were by far the smoothest and most efficient</li>
            <li> Worth the price?  </li>
            <li> Claims he can use it for a month and amortized over the length of time the blade lasts figures the additional cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades and lubristrip are more comfortable, than earlier versions.</li>
            <li> Love the pivot action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Gilette&#x27;s razor&#x27;s, and the Silvertouch is actually supplanting a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Proglide.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of trying the Gillette Fusion FREE of cost, directly from Gilette (Thank You!!!).</li>
            <li> Overall, this new razor was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li> When I first received this I wasn&#x27;t to sure what to think about the new flexball technology.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that you only have to go over your face once with this razor and it will give a nice clean shave without having to go over and over the same areas.</li>
            <li> It is just as good and reliable as all the other razors from Gillette that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took it right off.</li>
            <li> Another step in the right direction for the Fusion line.  </li>
            <li> It does the job right.</li>
            <li> The way I shave is by putting my index finger right where the flex head is located.  </li>
            <li> Right?  </li>
            <li> And then you can return the razor to it&#x27;s handy holder, which offers a way to store extra blades (which snap easily into place, BTW) on the underside.</li>
            <li> This worked well for me much better than disposables a lot less cuts and smooth shave, plus free refills.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this redesign seems to have improved the product enough that I would be willing to purchase it; however, I will still be shopping for the best deal and would consider other products as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since, I wanted to really test it out, I let my beard grow for a full week before shaving.  </li>
            <li> (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, so I got this razor in the mail for free to review and was already put off since it is a cartridge razor (I use a straight blade as my daily driver).</li>
            <li> I honestly have no idea why they only market this razor to men&#x27;s faces when they could sell double as many of them by also marketing this product to women who need to shave body hair.</li>
            <li> i generally get bumps from most razors this one i did not get any bumps from.</li>
            <li> had the opportunity to try one of these razors and it does a nice job, but in the end it&#x27;s not enough better that I will use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and the flexball is cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be very interested in how many shaves I can get from the initial blade.</li>
            <li> This newly engineered razor literally glides right onto your face and shave desired area smoothly.</li>
            <li> : the battery is tricky to put it, so be sure to look at the little slip that comes with the handle or you&#x27;ll be perplexed like I was!</li>
            <li> Now those blades are very sharp, but unfortunately don&#x27;t do a good job with my neck beard.</li>
            <li> but mostly it provides a sharp, nice, clean shave without all the extra irritated skin!  </li>
            <li> In reality, what they seem to be doing is coming up with one exciting new option a year, so each year you have to buy a new razor anyway to keep up with the latest options.</li>
            <li> I had gone my typical week plus, and needed a good shave.</li>
            <li> We liked it so much my wife now uses it instead of her last razors.  </li>
            <li> Received this as a trial from Gillette, so far I have only good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I figured this was just another gimmicky update, but it actually is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend theFusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology to anyone looking for a comfortable close shave!</li>
            <li> Once I got past the learning curve, I was able to get a nice close shave without much irritation.  </li>
            <li> Though I do use other Gillette razors and was very pleased with their performance.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the Flexball also makes a difference, in that to get that smooth shave, I only had to spend about two thirds as long shaving as without it, and in fewer passes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only way to know for sure is to go to the store myself and try to pick out the exact right product with the exact right options.</li>
            <li> The handle is tiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li> SUCH A VERY SMOOTH AND THROUGH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> have slightly sensitive skin, and it worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> the price of the razor and two refill  blades that ship with it (which will work just fine with the old Fusion handle)</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that the razor contained a lubricated strip because I think it helped glide the razor over my stubble, which all easily came off without me having to go back over the same area again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try my new razor.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was very easy to open, and the razor was very well presented.</li>
            <li> It had a very easy open package and the razor itself was very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It works great, with one swipe across the face and hard to reach areas under the nose and by my ears.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a woman.</li>
            <li> Now, my neck beard might extend further south than most, but I still expect to shave without leaving permanent scarring as a result.</li>
            <li> it is expensive, but I want the best a man can get.</li>
            <li> Love that the cartridges are on subscribe and save total bonus!</li>
            <li> IMO the regular proglide is better than this one and shaves closer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it regularly, but it seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> I decided that I would have to try these razors within the same week three times and then let my wife would tell me which would work better and made my face smoother.  </li>
            <li> I like the blades to go exactly where I intend them</li>
            <li> i would go for the electric on this only because it provides a slightly better shave.</li>
            <li> I recently used this razor, and must say I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I recently received this from Gillette to review and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li> I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li> There are so many different types of razors out on the market</li>
            <li> First, the razor comes with things you expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> I have facial hair most of the time and this razor curves and bends around it with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li> that said, I REALLY like this razor!</li>
            <li> I was interested to try this one out when I received it free from Gillette, and I was completely surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The FlexBall technology allows the razor to move and shift to every contour smoothly and seamlessly getting a close and quality</li>
            <li> Overall design is visually appealing</li>
            <li> It looks funny but has me intrigued.</li>
            <li> That could be because of the razor, but most likely is caused by my face...</li>
            <li> Ever since I first started shaving, I have used some type of razor manufactured by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head allowed the razor to better contour to my face, enabling a closer shave which left my face baby smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It uses the same 5 bladed Pro Glide cartridges that I have grown to love.</li>
            <li> My first razor was the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> With the advent of the Gillette Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball, I can only say, &amp;#34;it can&#x27;t get any better than this.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This razor is not any better than the regular Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> The Flexball concept was uninteresting to me, and I noticed no difference during the first shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various Gillette razors for 30+ years, and they do keep getting better.</li>
            <li> My recommendation - if you haven&#x27;t tried Gillette&#x27;s latest Fusion Proglide razor, definitely do!</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide offers a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was pleased with the close shave that it provided.  </li>
            <li> this one does the job - very well!  </li>
            <li> The smoothness of the shave that you get out of this razor is above and beyond what most razors can even dream of accomplishing these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found most of the &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; to be worthwhile (despite my cynicism towards marketing), especially the battery-powered microvibrations.</li>
            <li> This is my first review, so bear with me.    </li>
            <li> However, I do remember my first impression of the razor, and I have to say, \\&quot;Wow!\\</li>
            <li> More on this later.    </li>
            <li> With the flexball head, however, Ihad no problems getting the hair on the first pass.</li>
            <li> I also like the Lubrastrip which is infused with mineral oil and leaves me feeling soft and smooth without nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and the lubricating strip is still working pretty well without getting gooey.</li>
            <li> The system looks interesting and definitely helps men have a smoother shave experience.</li>
            <li> I have thiick course hairs and this is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used that cuts all of the hairs all of the way on the first pass.</li>
            <li> The flex technology makes shaving so much more simple...</li>
            <li> It is such a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I used to think that three was more than enough and have been a Mach 3 user since they came out.</li>
            <li> The idea of what the razor is supposed to do was better then the actual feel of the razor although it definitely was somewhat better shaving around the corners of my jaw.</li>
            <li> (Harry&#x27;s has a subpar quality razor blades in the first place in my opinion).</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this product Gillette!</li>
            <li> I did an unboxing and first shave test for those interested</li>
            <li> I wife thanks me, as I no longer need to use her Gillette Fusion razor!</li>
            <li> It would glide smoothly at first, but once that strip wore out about 3/4 through, which resulted in a lot of tugging.</li>
            <li> Each seemed marginally better than the last.  </li>
            <li> The four and five blade razors clog more rapidly and don&#x27;t last any longer than my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> However, when is used the proglide flexball the first time i immediately could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> razor provides a close shave on the first</li>
            <li> My face feels like it did when I was 12, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love the way the swivel handle allows you to maneuver around different areas of the face with ease.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the closest and smoothest shave of my life with this blade not just the first time, but multiple times.</li>
            <li> The shaver did exactly what i was expecting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Handle has good weight to it but is by no means heavy.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I mean the product looks like it would work great with it&#x27;s flexball head and vibration</li>
            <li> Is it better than the original, or a old fashioned double edged safety razor?  </li>
            <li> Flexball is a cool new technology that allows the razor to contour to your face.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued with the look if it right away.</li>
            <li> it left my face very smooth and the shave was very close.</li>
            <li> I was far happier with the original Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this an improvement over my other fusion razors.</li>
            <li> When shaving most strokes are vertical, some horizontal, but nothing that would require a flexball IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Adding a vibrating handle and spacing out the blades slightly would significantly improve shaving results with this product.</li>
            <li> Mornings are hard enough, let this razor make you look your best.</li>
            <li> Great shaves are not that difficult to achieve and there are great quality blades out there for much less money.</li>
            <li> but the key here is the blade cartridge, which really does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> For me this is great as my chin area is my hardest area to shave as I have very course thick stubble there.  </li>
            <li> In essence the shave was the same good quality I have known from my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> Gillette has come through again using technology and innovation to provide a quick, clean, and simple shave!</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that would have made this razor better for me would have been of it was a power razor as I really like the vibrating that the power razors have.  </li>
            <li> Love Gillette, but I was surprised that this was not to far off from all the others.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is handling the thing: The metal handle is too heavy, and the handle has to many smooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li> Razors are expensive, but I think this has a good price point and top notch blade.</li>
            <li> And the sheer range of motion to the pivoting head made the razor hug the contours better, and I got a closer shave with much fewer passes than I have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a great smooth shave without missing a single hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for sensitive, easy to nick face like mine.</li>
            <li> Great product, very precise cut and no hair left behind.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that the handle was very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The first shave went very well.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time shaving with a straight edge razor (I use an electric razor)</li>
            <li> Other than that, a wonderful razor for everyday use.</li>
            <li> How could they improve upon the razor I already had and loved for the past couple of years?  </li>
            <li> It gives me the closest and cleanest shave I can get and is very easy to handle due to the flexball handle technology.</li>
            <li> I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the blades dry for longer life.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for the first time last night and was amazed at how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li> A fantastic shaver and this is coming from a guy who pays entirely too much for shaving products at The Art of Shaving!</li>
            <li> I usually use some type of electrical shaver to make sure I get smooth cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to conform to your hand and shaving is simple with this razor!</li>
            <li> I have previously used the Mach 3 razor, so having lots of blades is nice.</li>
            <li> It gave a close shave and left my skin pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used a single cartridge to shave my head and face for over 2 weeks, and still get better results than my shave club razor.</li>
            <li> It took care of most of my face with a single pass</li>
            <li> The balljoint did not come into play well shaving my face but on my neck was certainly grateful for it.</li>
            <li> size of the flexball is rather large and bulky for a razor</li>
            <li> I received my first one free from Gillette, but I will absolutely be purchasing this razor again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave very quickly, and the flexball really allowed me to get those hard to reach spots around my chin, nose, and under my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of these add-ons that razor companies have now are just gimmicks to get people to try them or switch over when there is really no end gain or value and that is exactly what the FlexBall is for this Gillette Fusion ProGlide - another gimmick that really doesn&#x27;t help the end goal of shaving a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> ---you had more control that way and got a closer shave - these razors with all these dumb features are getting goofy already and a hassle and just gimmicks.    </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars unfortunately I do not have the burliest of beards and cannot say that this would be pristine for something more dense due to its pivoting nature</li>
            <li> I am very happy with how these work compared to other past razors I have used.</li>
            <li> A decent shaving experience - Thanks!</li>
            <li> I think it is mainly because the blades are a higher quality than the Fusion Manual.</li>
            <li> I found it from 11.50 to 15.00 and that seems very high for a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> As far as the blades go, they were of top level precision that I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette over the years, including the single blade on the back side which made touching up sideburns a breeze.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit worried the handle would be too heavy, but it was very easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> had!&lt;br /&gt;The blades clean up easily as well....and my  little &amp;#34;audible&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> While the blades are just as good, the flex head is hard for me to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the touch-up blade on the back for getting precise strokes on my beard outline.</li>
            <li> It gets very close and gives you an extra smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Huge improvement over my prior Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice the swivel-y part while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> and I find that I have so much an easier time with this Razor.</li>
            <li> Too much of hassle to go through the process of refund and replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Gillette mach 3 turbo for about a decade and recently got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor to try in my home and then review the item.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the Fusion did not irritate under my neck as much as I am used to.  </li>
            <li> , this is the razor for me and one that I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not enough O&#x27;s in the word smooth to describe it.</li>
            <li> seems to hug the face for a very close shave; it also has an edge</li>
            <li> I knew I would let the performance be the real test.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not 100% sold that the flexball technology drastically helps out that much though.  </li>
            <li> My shave was so close that my face was still smooth the next day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a go!</li>
            <li> It worked out really well for me</li>
            <li> I shave my whole face</li>
            <li> They give me a really close shave without much irritation at all</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> It worked better than I expected to help the razor to contour my face.</li>
            <li> It is well built and has a very durable design.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve a closer, smoother shave with minimal abrasions.</li>
            <li> The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li> This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any real negatives</li>
            <li> What I feel really worked was the flexball.</li>
            <li> And it was a really close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, he doesn’t like this version of Gillette Fusion as much as the one with vibrating handle.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> , I shave once every 7-10 days, much to my wife&#x27;s displeasure.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you pick one up today!</li>
            <li> once I found out it wasn&#x27;t really a ball, because it means the razor doesn&#x27;t flop all over your face, it just gently pivots, so I still feel I&#x27;m in control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the power version before and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me...</li>
            <li> No pulling or tugging to cut the hair and left my face smooth after one stroke.</li>
            <li> The grip is comfortable during the entire shave.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t pull as much</li>
            <li> this newest version shaved really well.</li>
            <li> It did take some getting used to this much flexability in a razor.  </li>
            <li> and I am left with a smooth and youthful sensation after each shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think I could have cut myself on it if I tried.</li>
            <li> , really really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and no try to go the different directions as you shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Straight out of the box</li>
            <li> It shifts the razor when going over those areas, so it provides a close and even shave without much hassle.  </li>
            <li> No nics or cuts the flexball handle is no gimmick it really helped with the shave and the curvature of my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The Flexball Technology really sets this blade apart because it allows the blade to closely hug the skin no matter where you are shaving.</li>
            <li> The lubrastrip keeps everything smooth so you get the closest shave possible.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten very spoiled with those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like the improvements with this razor.</li>
            <li> The precision razor does just that, gets you real close where you need it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for an unbeatable close shave!</li>
            <li> The handle feels durable and over a very durable product.</li>
            <li> I think the ball is a gimmick because there really isn&#x27;t any side pressure given to a razor unless you are slicing your face.  </li>
            <li> I have a very angular face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of a hefty razor, and I thoroughly enjoy the weight of this one in my hand.</li>
            <li> I would say that the head really did contour for maximum contact.</li>
            <li> It also gave a very close shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a trial from Gillette and have been very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think Gillette really scored an improvement here instead of just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li> Things I do like about Gillette Fusion Proglide is its portability and always ready for use as compared to electric shavers that do need recharge and the expense of cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this razor for very close shaves</li>
            <li> flexball really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for sending me a sample handle and razor blade to try out.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t find that much utility in five blades either.</li>
            <li> It performed comfortably and without draw backs, but i didnt feel any difference to signify the need for a different style or type of razor.  </li>
            <li> Easier and faster to shave and much increased maneuverability with regard to the blade.</li>
            <li> Really my mistake for not noticing also Amazon does not do returns on these items.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite aspects of this particular razor is the single grooming blade on the backside.</li>
            <li> and it gets the job done shaves very smooth and extremely close.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time yesterday and it provided a close shave without any burn since I was able to use less strokes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the previous version of this Proglide and that was the first razor that made my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m not sure a post-shave measurement would show any differences between this and its Version 1 predecessor, overall I feel more confident that the contact with my face is steady and consistent during shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then take the first stroke with this new technology.</li>
            <li> a man with sensitive skin, this product wins hands down, but the fact that my wife liked the closeness better is only a bigger plus.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide works amazing , I used it to shave my head which is not a easy task</li>
            <li> But they really didn&#x27;t make anything significant for me personally.</li>
            <li> super sharp blades which cuts hair cleanly in one pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as the glide strip is moistened with warm water for a few minutes, you will get a fantastic shave, even without shave cream... and</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re used to sharp razors, I feel like this one is even more so.</li>
            <li> Same great razor, not a huge difference from the normal one</li>
            <li> After using it two times over a two weeks times span, since my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast, it&#x27;s given me a great shave without having to look over twice to make sure I got every hair like I usually do with my other razors.</li>
            <li> The flex ball is a unique feature that took a short amount of time to get used too</li>
            <li> Red bumps on neck have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> My upper lip has not seen so clean a shave in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that you are buying a low end razor and shouldn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I have used many razors as I am prior military so shaving and finding a good razor that can continually get the job done and get it done right is hard.</li>
            <li> The handle itself is sturdy and not hard on the eyes at all!</li>
            <li> I am getting- virtually every single hair is easily eliminated.  </li>
            <li> In terms of angle chin shaving, the Proglide does a better job without any Knicks or cuts: the blade is as smooth as with the regular Fusion ; it is a cleaner shave overall and somewhat quicker than with the regular Fusion.</li>
            <li> technology would make it more difficult to shave around the lines of my beard, but the razor really does not move all that much - in fact it requires more force than you would think to make the razor pivot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flexball technology really helps increase flexibility and coverage to get that smooth, clean shave without missing hairs which is always embarrassing!  </li>
            <li> I bring this up because this has been a huge pain point for me with other blades getting clogged quickly, always right in the middle of the length of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given that this was a free item and it seemed new and different</li>
            <li> I assumed that it would swivel around loosely and almost uncontrollably however  allow the razor to easily respond to contours of the face while maintaining sturdiness where desired.</li>
            <li> As good as the previous Fusion shaving systems were, I could always feel some pulling, get the occasional nick and feel some stubble.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap disposable razors for a long time.</li>
            <li> I also was able to shave in record time, and the extra blade on the back allowed me to keep my side burns straight.</li>
            <li> and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Merkur safety razor to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> My neck is pretty sensitive, but I need to basically shave in every direction to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> My neck is pretty sensitive when it comes to shaving, but I had no issues here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not pay for the razor, because it&#x27;s not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Gilette vet from the early 90&#x27;s, when I first started shaving.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this new razor if you have more sensitive skin to cuts and are looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> and I have never been satisfied, until I tried this razor and unsurpassed, hands down</li>
            <li> When I first tried it I was surprised to see that the hard to reach places of my face and neck were smooth, the razor moved effortlessly as I shaved, almost as if it was made to custom fit my face.</li>
            <li> I will say that it does add some weight to the razor and might be a little challenging to get a straight line for your beard.</li>
            <li> Looks like I found my new razor!</li>
            <li> I have found my new razor of choice!</li>
            <li> But I also have a very sharp face, so maybe guys with a rounder face would benefit from this technology better.  </li>
            <li> The new flex ball doesn&#x27;t really do anything...</li>
            <li> But, much to my surprise, the new ProGlide thankfully did not pull at all.</li>
            <li> But I got the chance to try the razor with Flexball handle thanks to Gillette, but of course I almost always try new technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, it gives a very close and comfortable shave, with minimal tugging.  </li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t just say that unless I really love something.  </li>
            <li> This thing left my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor since the Mach 3 that actually reminds me of the shave I got from my first experience.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have any wet shaver yet, it would be a nice buy, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch from my regular shaver just to get this one.</li>
            <li> Gillette has been the only razor brand I&#x27;ve used and by far it shave in dept, leaving my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> As always, Gillette delivers a decent product.  </li>
            <li> No nicks, not even razor burn, not on my most sensitive bits, and really no effort whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Most guys don&#x27;t know this nowadays, but to get the closest possible shave you are supposed to do it three times in three different directions.</li>
            <li> this is decent razor</li>
            <li> I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually someone who uses modern cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide if there was anything specifically better about the Flexball and blade redesign, but I did feel like it made the shave a lot smoother, made washing the hair off the blades easier, and my skin seemed less irritated than normal</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonder shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving product reviews are highly subjective.  </li>
            <li> A High Quality Razor For Sure!&lt;br</li>
            <li> …results may vary but I high recommend this razor for a men</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received one a sample razor from Gillette to try and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recomment</li>
            <li> The precision razor on the back is the same as I&#x27;ve experienced with previous Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> With this one I find that I have to take less passes to get a complete shave which is nice as I have sensitive skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li> make sure to completely dry the blades before you put the razor away and the cartridge will last a much longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this new razor makes it very simple &amp; quick to get a close shave</li>
            <li> The flex ball does help maneuver through my face a little better.</li>
            <li> a little more info:&lt;br</li>
            <li> it might miss some of the places that need  a little bit more pressure.    </li>
            <li> The subtle give from the flexball makes a huge difference in how smooth the shave feels.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, hits those hard to reach places...</li>
            <li> The new flex ball handle will be my new go to razor!  </li>
            <li> The handle stays secure in your hand while shaving even when it is wet.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely a smooth guide and works very well on my coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> would say that I have a fairly normal face as far as hills and valleys go, but this razor handled each curve very well and without accidental cuts.  </li>
            <li> &gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li> The handle itself is pretty basic, but what really caught my attention was the &amp;#34;flexball.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I shave my head and normally it takes a couple of times to get all of the hair</li>
            <li> Normally my wife detests my razors because they break out her legs.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, and I&#x27;m not sure how much we really need so many blades.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth getting over the regular proglides, you will notice the difference which translates into ease of use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors in the past from some of the more basic Gillette&#x27;s to Shick and everything else</li>
            <li> I normally buy their razors and product however</li>
            <li> First of all, I wanted to say that I received this product a few weeks ago for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> This is exciting for me, as normally my skin gets irritated with multiple passes</li>
            <li> One of the neat things I did not break out it is truely for sensitive skin that is a Big plus for me.</li>
            <li> My wife had a big smile when I asked her if she&#x27;d seen my Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle.</li>
            <li> Usually, I use disposable 3 blade plastic razor which have a much thinner and more square handle.  </li>
            <li> Works good, not great.</li>
            <li> The way the Flexball allows the razor to not only pivot the head up and down as it has in the past, but also now side-to-side is awesome!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an extremely well made razor that I would highly recommend for shavers of all types and a good enough buy for the price, especially on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a closer shave and its easy to use without going over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li> pack opened easily and included the razor with two cartridges, one that was already connected and an extra one in the rack found on the back of the razor holder where you can place that can hold up to five cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how Gillette razors tend to last so much longer then other brands.</li>
            <li> Knowing how Gillette is, this thing probably has titanium blades that will last way longer than most other solutions too, so you don&#x27;t really end up replacing them as often.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite part of it, though, was the single trimming blade on the back of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li> It looks like they have the razor backing right next to the blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The orange Flexball pivots from left to right.</li>
            <li> Actually, they got one thing right.</li>
            <li> The new ProGlide came with a replacement blade that I&#x27;ll install after my next shave with the current one, but I feel it&#x27;s a good value as I can get several shaves with the same blade, without sacrificing the close shave I come to expect from Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a solid product at a decent price that performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth like the sharp blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor with the flexball</li>
            <li> I also use cheap disposable razors, and with neither disposable nor other Gillette razors</li>
            <li> After trying the Proglide I gave all of my new Sensor blades away.  </li>
            <li> I was chosen to take the new Fusion Proglide Flexball razor for a test drive compliments of Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Flexball is what got my attention as a new feature.</li>
            <li> The new Flex Ball in the handle allowed the blades to move with the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette, I thought the flex ball part would just be another gimmick  to get people to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every year a new one?</li>
            <li> I shaved using this new contraption and saw NO difference from my Gillette Pro Glide razor.</li>
            <li> I recieved this New Fusion with Flexball technology as a promotional gift from Bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li> I was offered by Gillette to try this new shaver for free,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> It might be the new rotating head or the redesigned blades.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item if you are looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> Although this is just my take on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new razor in years</li>
            <li> The new flexball technology blew my mind.</li>
            <li> so I knew quality would not be in question, but this new functionality might.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an edge on the reverse side for squaring off sideburns which I feel didn&#x27;t live up to</li>
            <li> When a new one came out, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a new Fusion Proglide to test out.  </li>
            <li> Gillette gave me an opportunity to try their new Fusion Proglide with Flexiball Technology Razor.  </li>
            <li> my new go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although almost never an early adopter w consumer goods (i.e., new blade refills always cost a premium!)</li>
            <li> Seriously, how about instead of coming out with a new kind of &#x27;handle&#x27;</li>
            <li> The Proglide with Flexball easily maneuvers around the contours of my face and makes shaving each morning less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely consider making this my primary razor in the future.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows the Gilette Fusion is already a great razor: It cuts hair very well without cutting the skin.</li>
            <li> so I usually shave pretty quickly without much thought.</li>
            <li> It shaved me smooth with minimal after-effect, and I decided to switch to using it instead of my old style razor.</li>
            <li> In the past I used the earlier versions of the fusion razors and was very satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this razor in the future to keep my face cut and hair free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin because it glides just like</li>
            <li> burn(I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my neck, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a &amp;#34;pay for the best&amp;#34; type of guy--I balance price and value, and typically lean towards &amp;#34;good enough for the right price&amp;#34;--my wife calls it being cheap.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for years, the new features plus the consistent performance keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next day with NO razor burn and still pretty smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first shave I was totally sold.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Fusion since it only had 3 blades, and I thought, &amp;#34;It can&#x27;t get any better than this.&amp;#34; Now, several generations later, the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball has wowed me again.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Especially if you have narcolepsy, or are visually impaired or looking for something to complement your current shaving method for the more tender haireas.</li>
            <li> but wow the flexball fusion changed my mind!</li>
            <li> Better than anything I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The pivot thing is a bit of a gimmick, but I will say the area under my lip and above my chin was cut closer on the first swipe than what I experience</li>
            <li> Normally if I wait too long, I&#x27;ll have to buzz it with an electric razor first or make two or three passes with my normal razor.</li>
            <li> i would buy this product in the future if the cost made it a better value than other options.</li>
            <li> However, with previous products - even new blades out of the box - the other razors ALWAYS pulled on the stubble on my upper lip, which clearly doesn&#x27;t feel great.</li>
            <li> It had an extremely comfortable weight, feeling light enough to control and heavy enough to maintain sturdiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different type/brands of razors including other models from Gillette but by far the Gillette Fusion Proglide with FlexBall Handle is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, it is nice that they left the razor cartridges the same as other Gillette Fusion products.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quick my shave went (likely because of the multiple sharp blades) and how close and smooth it was after I</li>
            <li> Easy with my psoriasis, very limited to none red bumps on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus handles/blades (cheap handle, light-weight plastic, alternating blades...) for about a year and a half, since I lost my Gillette Mach 3</li>
            <li> I get a close, comfortable shave, the blades last twice as long as the others razors that I have.</li>
            <li> I got the usual GREAT shave but the gimmicky ball had NOTHING to do with it.</li>
            <li> I typically just use the cheap, disposable razors to shave, so I was pumped to receive this Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball to review from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream, just wash my face and leave it wet, and this razor does a super job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the closeness of the shave from the regular Proglide razors that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time shaving and I am always looking for something new or better to help me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find razors that are dependable and consistent in quality, but Gillette has always been a major player in the razor-game and can easily be relied upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Between the articulation and the new blades, they really did improve on their regular ProGlide razor.  </li>
            <li> have found that the flexball technology does contour to your face, though an experience everyday shaver who shaves 365+ times a year knows the contours of their face and doesn&#x27;t need a new technology to get a close smooth</li>
            <li> Although it is not much different from the previous razor from gillette, it is a bit better.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor was previously the regular Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I passed it on to my father and he also likes it, thinks it&#x27;s marginally better than the previous version, but not enough to justify the cost of the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver especially for people who do designs or any type of artistic stuff with their facial hair.</li>
            <li> They last nearly twice as long though, and definitely shave better</li>
            <li> Back in the day I had one of the original vibrating razors and it was a bit odd to use, so I was skeptical - but the new blade configuration works great with the vibration.</li>
            <li> A little while ago Gilette let me try the Fusion Proglide for free.</li>
            <li> Just clean metal to run up and down my face.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this razor didn&#x27;t tug at it, I shaved nicely.</li>
            <li> The razor might cost a little more, but you only have to buy it once.</li>
            <li> The four blades provide for a close and quick shave, and the blades themselves provided a closer shave than any other four bladed razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> : As with all Gillette shaving products, the cost is very high (especially blades) compared to competitors.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the new flex ball technology with this razor because a trouble with me is around my jawline.</li>
            <li> Although the swivel action from the Flexball takes a little getting used to, I think overall it is an innovative feature.</li>
            <li> With dull razors, people with sensitive skin are much more prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great blades, that don&#x27;t last and are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> Didnt give me a rash with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I am fairly surprised about the quality of this model.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to test and have been pleased to say the least.</li>
            <li> And I also notice that I miss strips or sections, have to go over the areas again, and that gives my sensitive skin razor burn.  </li>
            <li> That was my biggest surprise, because it really did last.  </li>
            <li> And as someone with sensitive skin I recommend the Fusion Proglide razor.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette about two weeks ago and have used it so far about 5-6 times.</li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t really give it a second though</li>
            <li> nearly 3 times the price of the shave club ones.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette products for years and this ranks up there with my old Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> The FlexBall technology allows me to shave the contours of my face without nicking my chin as I used to do on a frequent basis.  </li>
            <li> but the swivel action is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the ultimate test I could think of.</li>
            <li> I really just can&#x27;t afford to buy these things on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> flexball handle is heavy, but well-balanced to the point where it&#x27;s extremely comfortable to hold and shave with.</li>
            <li> The strips add so much to a shave, that you only really notice when they start to wear off or when you use a razor that simply doesn&#x27;t provide them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I used Gillette Proglide razors frequently.  </li>
            <li> And since this manual razor does not have the vibrations, I find the shave to be far inferior to what I get from my Gillette Proglide Styler.</li>
            <li> and it got nearly all of it.</li>
            <li> stuck with their 5+1 blade cartridge that routinely last 3+ months, making it very affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Side to side flexing action</li>
            <li> I tried several of the cheap alternatives and finally came back to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> and it got nearly all of it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I used this razor within two days of receiving and I was so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Proglide Flexball has so far eliminated any razor burn.</li>
            <li> Having used the cheaper blades for a few months, I&#x27;m surprised at how much better the Proglide actually is.</li>
            <li> The Flexball allows for a complete stroke from chin to neck without losing contact with your skin .  </li>
            <li> The only downside would be that it dues clog but what razor,  besides straight, doesn&#x27;t?  </li>
            <li> Glides effortlessly along my face and neck, never missing a hair.  </li>
            <li> but this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off to give you an idea of what kind of shaver I am, I maintain a beard while using the razor to keep the thick brush that constantly grows on my neck at bay.</li>
            <li> That sometimes happens to me when razors dull quickly after first 3 uses, but thankfully was not the case</li>
            <li> sure the flexball provided a little more movement, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> While I did find that this razor followed the contours on my jaw line and throat much better than most every other razor I have used, I was not impressed with the blades.  </li>
            <li> I will probably purchase more of these cartridges as well as look for a cheaper alternative in the mean time.</li>
            <li> It is close, comfortable, and so far hasn&#x27;t dulled, although that could be because I sharpen it on my forearm before I shave every morning (run it opposite way on your forearm five times - it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it keeps the blades sharp...</li>
            <li> I always rinse it in hot water and dry it before putting it away.  </li>
            <li> Like the weight of the Razor is light and handle technology was different from other</li>
            <li> /&gt;Outside of the flexball technology, the fact that the razor has 5 blades, I found that the cartridge last longer than my three bladed cartridge and the precision trimmer on the back is very helpful to get those orphan hairs that the main blades do not</li>
            <li> When doing a full shave, my face is noticeably smoother and less cut up, nicked, and bumped.</li>
            <li> The next few uses were more everyday type shaves, and I paid special attention to the way it slid across the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> I really like how you can buy replacement blades instead of having to buy a whole new razor every time, it reduces waste.</li>
            <li> I typically shave my head bold every few days and keep clean face</li>
            <li> It does a fine job, but I&#x27;m not sure I find an advantage to the Flexball feature.</li>
            <li> It does provide a decent shave with standard irritation expectations</li>
            <li> This version does glide over my face very well, but no better (IMO) than a fresh Proglide cartridge.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how much the razor gets clogged, other than that the shave is a really nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> was skeptical that it was simply a gimmick to add some dazzle to their product line, but I was in for a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; seems to be engineered about right -- flexible enough to follow contours effortlessly but stiff enough for precise trimming around facial</li>
            <li> I got the Razor from Gillette and I was expecting a huge difference from their previous line ( the one with the same head that vibrates),</li>
            <li> The lubricating strip and slightly sharper blades make a HUGE difference that I&#x27;ll remember next time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not down with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box i received in the mail, my reaction was &amp;#34;woah.&amp;#34; The new design caught me off guard because it really is pretty different from what I&#x27;ve seen in the past.</li>
            <li> I am a razor fanatic and have tried many razors from Battery Powered razors to regular old school 2 blade disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> price may be a little higher than one would like to spend, however the durability of the blades outlasts normal disposables.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get hardly any cuts &amp; it is maneuvers easily.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m one of those guys that has to pull my skin a little or make funny faces to shave.</li>
            <li> Most likely will purchase again because of flexball to get to those hard to reach sections on my face.#gotitforfree</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know if it is actually the blades, or if they are placed at a different angle than they are on other products, but I did not find this razor giving me a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used safety razors in the past, and when using a safety razor, you want a light touch and loose grip so as not to put much pressure on the skin, which results in nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I also thought that the new razor, the turbo gave me about the same shave in terms of closeness.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology definitely brings some new ideas to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> For the shave alone  I would give it five (5) stars, but for the new handle I can only give it two (2) stars.</li>
            <li> The new flexball design truly outshines the prior products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new Gillette Fusion razor for about a month now and wanted to compare it to multiple razors before reviewing.  </li>
            <li> and I received the Proglide razor with the new flexball technology from Gillette to try recently.</li>
            <li> I have been using the proglide power prior to trying this new razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mach 3 for years and this is the razor that finally convinced me to upgrade to a new razor style.  </li>
            <li> To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle that I received from Gilette really has me considering a switch back to a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> Since i started to shave, i always had a problem, my skin would always be red and very irritated, even with multiple kinds and brands of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor a solid two weeks of use and don&#x27;t find the extra pivoting to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> If it was less rigid with it&#x27;s side motion it might be useful</li>
            <li> At first I was a little puzzled with my new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with Flexball handle.</li>
            <li> You can now not have to only make straight &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; down your face, but now you can &amp;#34;juke&amp;#34; left or right</li>
            <li> I am a daily shaver who needs a close-to-skin tight shave, and I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> It shaves the hair of my skin right down to my chinny chin chin.  </li>
            <li> so I usually buy a significant qty.</li>
            <li> Sounded like I was in for some major cuts.</li>
            <li> When I first decided to shave with the Fusion ProGlide - FlexBall Handle, I will admit, I just assumed that this would be like any other razor that I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> It contours to your face like no other razor and it gets every hair with ease.</li>
            <li> WOULDNT TRADE IT FOR NO OTHER.</li>
            <li> The new flexball technology that has been added to the handle makes it extremely flexible and allows you to easily get to a few of those harder-to-reach</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving your head everyday can be tiresome and most of the times all I wanted to do is to get it done as soon as possible so many times</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth shave along with some shave secret oil I use.</li>
            <li> I was always frustrated with not being able to shave underneath-the-chin area, and this has significantly helped me mitigate that issue.</li>
            <li> Their razors are lightweight and even though the replacement cartridges can be a little pricey, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide has the new Flexball technology which helps keep all 5 of the razors flat against your skin, regardless of the angle.  </li>
            <li> I personally had no use for this particular ball flex technology, however I admit that others may have a different experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pivotal systems and all having had little or no success.</li>
            <li> No longer do I have to suffer with breakouts caused by dull or cheap razors.</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a part of a free trial from Gillette and I was a bit skeptical of the premise at first.</li>
            <li> Depending on your facial profile I think you&#x27;ll know if you need this razor, clearly, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Usually I get rough stubs after I shave, But using this Razor I can rub forwards or backwards and its baby smooth!</li>
            <li> This is Night and day above my old Schick Razor.</li>
            <li> I could go either way with the whole battery thing, which makes it a bit heavier, but it is not really that bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and only shave once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to be expected of any razor really.</li>
            <li> Seamlessly shaves over contours such as the jaw and neck&lt;</li>
            <li> I am surprised by the longevity of this razor and would give it 6 stars if it was possible.</li>
            <li> I made the switch some time ago to the old school Double Edge Safety Razor style of shaver because of the lower cost.</li>
            <li> With the flex ball handle it truly does go with the contour of your face which really helps in getting every hair minus the cuts.</li>
            <li> It glided effortlessly over the contours of my face and left my skin feeling soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> ,  the blades wear about average, and&lt;br /&gt;a weekend&#x27;s worth of stubble takes a bit of extra work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of sad that I am almost 34 years old, yet can not grow substantial facial hair...</li>
            <li> Normally I do cut myself several times during each shave, and after using the Fusion Proglide with Flexball on 6 different occasions, I have yet to cut myself even once.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The FlexBall Handle Technology is crazy good.  </li>
            <li> but they have solved the problem by placing additional super tiny little gap fillers between each razor so that 1.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say the new blades are better but the actual razor itself is overkill and unnecessary if you already have a fusion razor.  </li>
            <li> By me doing this, it takes away any advantage of the new tech, and changing my shaving habits has shown to be more difficult than you would think.  </li>
            <li> Even with flexball and five blades, I have to shave about as much with a two blade fixed razor and less with a three blade.  </li>
            <li> The blade is easily replaceable  and seems to last me at least 3 weeks</li>
            <li> so of course I expected the newest razor to be nothing less than fabulous.</li>
            <li> When I tested it I knew right away this razor was above and beyond every other razor I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I figured it would be hard to improve on something that already delivered such fine results.  </li>
            <li> first impression was that this wasn&#x27;t that much different than any other disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I applaud the concept of the roller ball, but cannot really recommend this as opposed to some other razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> All these features are actually making it harder to get a REAL close shave.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if there is a single negative to report back.</li>
            <li> I have to buy new, gimmicky things, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li> Tried many other different brands in the past and nothing compares to quality and durability of Gillette brand of razors.</li>
            <li> The swivel head let me reach spots I&#x27;ve always found hard to get a clean shave using a regular disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ball technology didnt make much of a difference to me though, it worked the same as any other gillete refillable razor, which is well when paired with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have sensitive skin, so only going over each area of my face only once, helps me out quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised at how long the blade has lasted.</li>
            <li> short, Gilette needs to come up with a far simpler product name and maybe only 2 or 3 variations, and that&#x27;s it - keep it simple.</li>
            <li> ON the surface, it&#x27;s so simple, the head is on a swivel that pivots a little left or right based on the angle.</li>
            <li> The cut is clean and the flexball seems to solve my lifelong problem of an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> While the movement of the ball, at least for me, is more subtle, as you actually shave, I found myself avoiding many of the usual movements and contortions</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you already have a Gillette razor, there really is no need to rush out to the store to pick up this shiny new one.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly around those hard to reach spots!</li>
            <li> This feels much sturdier than a typical razor, and you can tell that they wanted to put this in another class.</li>
            <li> shave my head as well as my face, and the razor performed very well, despite the fact that I&#x27;d waited longer than usual to polish the old dome.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe that the FlexBall Handle allows the razor to touch every corner of your face on the first shave... not the second or third.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used this to shave for the first few couple of times, I noticed a really big difference from the disposable Gillette razors that I used to buy.</li>
            <li> it really conforms to your face so you are less likely to get cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the Lubrastrips that are installed on the head of the razor blades provide an extremely smooth shave, whereas cheaper, disposable razors usually leave you with razor burn and stubble due to a lack of lubrication that shaving cream just doesn&#x27;t cover.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every other day and with this blade my face always felt smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used previous shave-tech forward Gillette products prior to shaving with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball and while they have been satisfactory, this new product BY FAR crushes their previous models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me one of these recently, and I&#x27;ve got to say (without having comparison priced it against any other new razor products)</li>
            <li> Yes they may be a little more expensive but really, you are shaving</li>
            <li> And as always with Gillette&#x27;s quality razors, I did not suffer from razor burn on my very sensitive skin as I do with other razors.  </li>
            <li> Good or bad</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 shaved fairly close when I tried it years ago, but as bad as my skin felt afterward, I eventually gave up and switched to a double-edged safety razor.</li>
            <li> Trying to shave your chin with the large head design is not easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better, or closer, than the others and, possibly a bit worse, actually, than other razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 5 blades are definitely a plus and reduces pull and tug that I would normally have from a razor with less blades.</li>
            <li> Prior to receiving this razor directly from Gillette, I was excited to try it out because I have hair that grows at weird angles on my throat area.  </li>
            <li> I had a few days of stubble and it knocked it down quickly with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, from the first  &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; I could tell I was going to get the closest shave ever!  </li>
            <li> If you have large hands, be aware that it can be difficult to use this razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually I have to shave over my face several times before it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face</li>
            <li> Usually I have to shave over my face several times before it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face</li>
            <li> Love the new flex ball technology it helps a lot going from face to neck an chin and cuts way down on razor burn and really helps with cutting down on cuts an nicks</li>
            <li> But since I don&#x27;t shower and shave out in public for all to see (at least not often), I&#x27;m not too worried about people gocking at the sight of my big orange blade ;)</li>
            <li> My chin area is shaved far cleaner than other Gillette or Harry&#x27;s razors I used to use</li>
            <li> This new razor has an extra pivoting action that allows the razor to get into the hard to reach corners while shaving.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the size of the head makes it a little tougher to get right up under my nose.</li>
            <li> it worth while for a new shaver or the everyday running late shaver?  </li>
            <li> Usually I have to shave over my face a few times before I get my face totally smooth</li>
            <li> I guess I will keep using the Proglide to see how long the blades last (until I start getting pulling or razor burn) before I make a final decision.</li>
            <li> As for the flexball head, I normally have issues around my jawline, and have to make a few passes to get a proper shave.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the price, because I ended up paying a little less than in store.</li>
            <li> It made it very easy to shave the tricky parts of my face without having to twist my hand in all crazy directions when I am trying to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for those who shave everyday.</li>
            <li> The handle is the same balanced, contoured won&#x27;t slip grip EXCEPT for this engineered slightly movable &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; near the blades.</li>
            <li> For that reason alone, I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to try something different but don&#x27;t completely give up on previous iterations of Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> Flat out wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Flexball also allowed the blades to lay flat on my face and neck, again attaining</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little skepical when I got my new Flexball razor from Gillette to try out.</li>
            <li> had a hard time working with such a large handle.  </li>
            <li> The new formulation of the razors seems to be what the Fusion was missing.</li>
            <li> It provides my shave experience with a natural motion and contours to areas of my face that I previously had challenges with.</li>
            <li> The Flex Ball technology made this razor easy to move around the face even on the chin area where it can sometimes be difficult.</li>
            <li> The ball mounted head is a total gimmick, no real benefit over the standard fusion proglide</li>
            <li> The FlexBall Technology allows for maximum contact, while the super thin blades literally glide over my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually try not to spend very much on razors or any other products for that matter.</li>
            <li> I also used the various blades from the single edge, double edge, injector, sensor and several other types that I no longer remember.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only down side for the Flexball is if you do try to steer it, it&#x27;s hard to hold on to the ball on the right side since the support arm gets in the way.</li>
            <li> My facial hair typically grows back the same day.</li>
            <li> When you remove it from your face, it snaps back flat - really not a deal breaker though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately from looking at the other reviews, MANY have been convinced.</li>
            <li> There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far.</li>
            <li> My only available method to clean the razor is the weak spray that is my sad little shower head, or risk dulling the blades by brushing them with my hand.</li>
            <li> kind of makes it ugly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This razor is above and beyond what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have long been a user of Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the blades in constant contact with your skin with minimal effort from me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Benjamin Bogedain&lt;br /&gt;Bzzagent, Father, and Long time head shaver, since 2006.</li>
            <li> Name: WAY TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve always had trouble with razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razors really boil down to how sharp the blades are, how long do they stay sharp, how close the shave is without irritation and cuts and how long does it take me to shave.  </li>
            <li> Those are very much less expensive for a better shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not lucky enough to only have to shave once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> My job requires that I shave daily, which often leads to rough dry skin.  </li>
            <li> However, this time, with the new Gillette ProGlide featuring five blades, I didn&#x27;t have to make as many passes - cutting down on the irritation typically associated with shaving.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m shaving my face, especially in the corners of my mouth and nose, I do not want sharp blades moving around.</li>
            <li> and I am only shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or burns due to the blue lubastrip.</li>
            <li> I have used other Gillette brand razors, but this razor definitely felt like a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t much different than the other comparable razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide are as sharp as ever, and this is key to avoiding razor burn.</li>
            <li> When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get a clean line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clever way to keep consumers buying, but not nice on the pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I shave my head on a regular basis and I like a close shave in as few licks as possible...</li>
            <li> This being said, I did not really notice that it felt different as compared to the non pivot style as i expected it to.  </li>
            <li> This is just like any other razor where the blade is pretty sharp but after a month of use it gets dull.</li>
            <li> Much closer than my expensive German Merkur razor with supposedly super-sharp Japanese Feather blades.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to get used to it, just the first time.</li>
            <li> The only down side I found was the price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no greater feeling in the morning shower than having shaven your face meticulously without certain areas unshaved or unevenly shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the flexball allowing me to shave in one pass, or because of the new moisturizer strip on the razor, but whatever it is works</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor, I implore you to at least give this Proglide a shot.</li>
            <li> I have been using the fusion series for quite some time and have rarely complained, but this new design seems to improve on some of the issues I had.</li>
            <li> Users should not expect an enormous change from the earlier version Gillette Fusion razor, but it is a small step up.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide really does glide across your face, The one thing that I was concerned about that I usually get from razors are RAZOR BUMPS and that did not happen with the ProGlide Silvertouch, even after a few days of not shaving.</li>
            <li> It definitely gave me a closer shave than my previous Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> It could actually now reach the areas with ease that I previously had to compensate for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be using this on a daily basis, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep it in the medicine cabinet for those times when I&#x27;m in a hurry or traveling.</li>
            <li> I thought that the 5 blades would clog up immediately, but as long as I washed it every other pass, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The blades stayed sharp for a really long time and over all</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical at first to try a new Gillette razor</li>
            <li> Who knew something so little could make such a difference.</li>
            <li> That little extra weight feels like it is doing the work for me.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to others, especially if you have used other Gillette razors in the past.</li>
            <li> Also, as I mentioned above, the razor takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with fixed blade razors getting along my jawline.</li>
            <li> i must notate that i have used most all types, and brands or shavers and this brand has never made a bad product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball is worth every penny and is a must have for anyone who suffers from irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> Delicate on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> at least not beyond the point of looking like a 13 year old boy who is going through puberty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t make notes of the packaging prior to throwing it away, so there&#x27;s nothing I can really write about in that regard.</li>
            <li> When I forst received it, I thought the FlexBall technology was going to be gimmicky, but in truth it does actually help contour to the face when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it swivels and allows me to get those harder to reach places.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any soap or creams, I just \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; in the shower.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips are big and provide a firm grip, even in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ 5 blades for minimal pulling of hair</li>
            <li> Usually I have to shave over adam&#x27;s apple carefully not to nick it</li>
            <li> I did even though I abandoned wet shavers a while ago for electric ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even waited a few days and did the ultimate test dryshaving with 3 day growth not irritation what so ever!</li>
            <li> For a Gillette brand razo this one is what it is expected to be.</li>
            <li> the swivel handle allowed me to get to some of the harder contours of my face.</li>
            <li> I saw this razor being advertised heavily throughout different stores</li>
            <li> For a travel razor it should work as expected but keep in mind</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anybody, especially people with thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Typically razors are just the same in my opinion; however, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide slightly exceeds its competition.  </li>
            <li> As the razor became wet it was extra slick.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t usually shave very often, I received this razor in the mail from Gillette and lately it&#x27;s been getting warmer around here</li>
            <li> The way the blade contours to your face seems to decrease overall shaving time as well since you are less likely to miss a spot as is common on other razors.</li>
            <li> While I still hate doing it, the GIllette Fusion Proglide made it a very easy process.</li>
            <li> Not a single trace of razor burn or any irritating red marks at all.</li>
            <li> I am not a hairy guy, I have very little facial hair even without shaving for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> I shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with my other Gilette razor from now on.</li>
            <li> Sharp Blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing I was extremely please about was how they designed the blades.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide is a revolutionary razor and out performs any other razor.</li>
            <li> Especially in the spots I usually miss.</li>
            <li> When shaving in a hurry I noticed with other razors that I would miss sections around my neck and jaw but with 1 stroke with the FlexBall</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are sharp resulting in no tug or pull and the trimming edge is a plus.  </li>
            <li> With this little gizmo the blades DO pivot front to back and side to side ---- a little.</li>
            <li> I do not have the 5 o&#x27;clock I was getting with other razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly sure about the flexball adding anything extra</li>
            <li> Overall I would say that this razor is a small improvement over its predecessor.</li>
            <li> This razor shaved well, but not quite as close as other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I actually got a closer shave on my neck than usual too.</li>
            <li> On my neck, in the middle, the hair grain grows out to the sides, toward my shoulders, and usually if I try shaving that with my DE</li>
            <li> But could I tell a difference between it and the other razors I&#x27;ve used?  </li>
            <li> Other razors that I have used had blades that were way too close together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for the past ten years, and have seen the gradual evolution of the Fusion line.</li>
            <li> No real complaints!</li>
            <li> As well it out performed my other razor that I received from Gillette just a year ago</li>
            <li> I extremely recommend it to my family and peers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors as they came out</li>
            <li> I got a close shave the side to side pivot was a bit weird at first but got use to it.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other razor since trying this one.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave without all the pulling of hairs like I&#x27;ve had from other razors.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m used to using a razor that doesn&#x27;t pivot side to side when I approached my chin the blade shifted one way and the razor went the other.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between Schick and Gillette usually, but I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for my dad and the other for my fiancé.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but still worth the price for a quality razor.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck and have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> I never really was one that got a lot of cuts while shaving, but I&#x27;ve noticed that with the shaving head on this razor swiveling and moving to the curves of my face, it happens much less</li>
            <li> No more cuts and toilet paper on the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to quantify how necessary the flexball system is, but there&#x27;s nothing to complain about here.</li>
            <li> but I guess I was not pressing hard enough on it.</li>
            <li> Last year I reviewed the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Styler and complained about the packaging.</li>
            <li> I think that is a neat concept, but not really worth the hype.</li>
            <li> This is one of my biggest issues with using razor blades to shave, you usually end up with a gunky buildup in between the blades, especially if you wait a few days to shave and have some longer hairs to contend with.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much to help in that respect.</li>
            <li> I have thick heavy facial hair and this product performed as i expected.  </li>
            <li> because of the thin blades they will need ro be switched frequently.</li>
            <li> The flex ball in the handle allowed the blades to curve around my chin and down my neck with fewer</li>
            <li> This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck.</li>
            <li> You use your thumb to hold it in place or just let it do its thing as it goes down your neck.</li>
            <li> It helps cut down shave time and cuts close.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades also cuts down the time it takes to shave with 3 blade razors (</li>
            <li> Like they are talking down to you/us.  </li>
            <li> like the all silver color, I think it makes it look sharp!</li>
            <li> I mean, how big if a difference can a ball on a razor make??</li>
            <li> /&gt;Traditional razors are horribly hard to use for hard to reach contours near the jaw and neck, but not with the Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve dealt with razor burn for my entire post-puberty life and there has never really been a way for me to avoid at least a small breakout...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ball does seem to help follow the contours of my face, but the movement is nowhere near dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Tried quite a few different products as of late.</li>
            <li> I like this razor less each time I use</li>
            <li> Before, manual shavers required me to adjust my face to the razor, but now, Gillette has made a shaver that adjusts to my face, leading to an easier shave with less chances of cuts.</li>
            <li> By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz.</li>
            <li> The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It clogs less (a surprise for a 5-bladed razor) and cuts closer in each pass.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I do grow stubble (and a fierce neck beard) and need to shave, just not as often as some of my less follicly challenged</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed less shaving sores and definitely less pain while shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the flexball really does help to get around those difficult spots that I always seem to have trouble with.  </li>
            <li> As difficult as times are, there isn&#x27;t a lot of extra cash left over for razor blades.  </li>
            <li> This makes shaving even less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> The blades do seem to pull less than the fusion however</li>
            <li> As a result, it takes less strokes to get the results I want.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor was also a Gillette product</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin: I have to shave downwards and unless I want irritation I cannot shave upwards to get that really close shave (which is annoying).</li>
            <li> Therefore, your unused blades from your previous Gillette Razor will work with this razor as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Previously when shaving it was a bit like yoga or gymnastics.</li>
            <li> Because the blade moves, it feels softer on my face when shaving, and causes a little less irritation.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have found my new razor (and I wasn&#x27;t even looking).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end up with cuts, its just plain unwieldy and not worth it</li>
            <li> The handle on the Flexball handle is 2 to 3 times as heavy as previous razors that I have owned.</li>
            <li> With my two-three day neck growth I have not had a clog up yet that my shower spray could not clean out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard from others that the swivel can make it a little tricky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor is a little heavier than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> When I was given the opportunity from Gillette to try the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology, I was a little hesitant.  </li>
            <li> and I have used other razors in the past and have stuck with the disposable as they seem to keep an edge longer on the blades.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about trying this razor but Gillette sent me a trial I put it through it&#x27;s paces and even went sideways and against the grain and no problems it shifted to every contour of my face</li>
            <li> It also helps prevent cuts since it makes the razors give a little instead of applying all the pressure onto your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They probably shave a little closer, but not significantly so and</li>
            <li> I thought this might make things a little easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, even though I have several packs of shave club razors I can still use, and I hate the thought of giving Gillette money to help fund their stadium sponsorship of the New England Patriots (whom I hate), I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting.</li>
            <li> I do not have a really heavy beard</li>
            <li> I tried a few others, but  none gave me this close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save your face and neck the trouble and get yourself a quality razor like this one.</li>
            <li> The flexball allows the razor to glide over my skin for a smooth finish without all of the annoying nicks and scrapes.</li>
            <li> After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a few passes to get through the jungle my face thinks is a beard.</li>
            <li> At first, I was very skeptical of another groundbreaking razor by Gillette.</li>
            <li> have been using Gillette&#x27;s manual razors along with a few electric razors.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves, I did notice that it seemed to give a smoother shave than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Would have given it a five stars, but the  blades have not advanced.  </li>
            <li> I’m a heavy razor user because I shave my head.</li>
            <li> So after a few minutes I adjusted to the head as it swayed as needed.</li>
            <li> I sometime don&#x27;t shave everyday...</li>
            <li> You can go around the jawline and under the chin without missing any hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After shaving I waited a few hours to write this review.</li>
            <li> There are a few things that make this Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology</li>
            <li> Received this razor from Gilette a few days ago, and just used it over the weekend.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as my travel razor, got tired of only have 1 razor and saw commercials for this one and thought I had to have one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the razor.</li>
            <li> There are worse things in life than having to redesign some facial hair or going without for a few days.  </li>
            <li> &gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the razors are getting a little ridiculous on the cost side</li>
            <li> Since it adjusted to my face as I shaved I found myself having to readjust the way I was holding the razor much less than usual.</li>
            <li> but I think it is useless other than marketing with the current design.</li>
            <li> I have been a bzzagent for a few years and have tested a few razors in the past</li>
            <li> , it tilts, it pivots and keeps on point, cutting the time, effort and pain of my shave down considerably.  </li>
            <li> and I would be pretty shocked if this was not the case.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like it was bending much in the mirror, but I didn&#x27;t have to stretch, pull, contort and twist me face to get awkward, hard to shave areas like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line: If you are the type of person who likes to be on the cutting edge of new products and are willing to be patient with the razor I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to shave daily.  </li>
            <li> I usually get nicks and razor burn from shaving but</li>
            <li> There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place.</li>
            <li> I followed up with my usual face rinse and isopropyl alcohol as an astringent.</li>
            <li> we men are used to getting from past razors.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t usually prefer manual razors, electric razors</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m usually lazy and go longer in between</li>
            <li> This razor is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more bumps aftershave.</li>
            <li> Especially those, who like me, are forced to shave everyday and who have jaw lines that make reaching every spot difficult.</li>
            <li> so I usually skip it.</li>
            <li> Slick as butter</li>
            <li> I usually always struggle with my neck region and this razor</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on stupid women&#x27;s razors like I foolishly did for so long before being recommended a men&#x27;s razor by a friend.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tempted to go back to a foil razor again to see if I can save some money on expensive cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have been cut by razors in the past..</li>
            <li> My initial reaction once I started shaving was that I was doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I could be doing something wrong that I&#x27;ve been doing the same way for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, I was also using Gillette shaving foam, not sure if that played a part.  </li>
            <li> based n my past experience.</li>
            <li> My old man used one of those safety razors, but the thing butchered my face something awful; so my mom bought me a Gillette Sensor Excel (which was brand new at that time)</li>
            <li> It just felt a little different cutting while not vibrating.</li>
            <li> But by the third use the blades were dull and the glide strip was useless.  </li>
            <li> Hidden behind all this mess is a terrific product; it&#x27;s a shame that their marketing department has to make it so complicated!</li>
            <li> I have to shave at least twice a week for my job, but not more because of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With past razors, especially the disposable ones, I would always end up cutting myself when shaving.</li>
            <li> This strip ensures I get a LESS IRRITATING shave</li>
            <li> It gets to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I did not cut myself at all even in those hard to shave places on my neck and lips</li>
            <li> This razor gave me the closest and quickest shave, although it has one design issue which was annoying for me and could be a problem for anyone with large hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly heavy and tough beard.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and if I go more than a day, shaving can be a little painful but not with this bad boy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one negative is in the design of the handle.</li>
            <li> My thinking is that the Marketing Department stayed up late to come up with this idea.</li>
            <li> Or at least that is what Gilette would want you to believe.</li>
            <li> This would result in hairs getting jammed in between blades, which would render the razor useless until I used tweezers to remove them.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the handle is just crazy with rubber nubs and stubs and whirls, and it&#x27;s definitely well designed and</li>
            <li> I mean, who cares if it pivots?</li>
            <li> I have used power razors before and I am still not sure if the vibrating function of powered razor make a lot of difference, but who cares, the star of this game is the Flexball handle technology.  </li>
            <li> The subtle lateral movements of the Flexball were unnoticeable until I looked for it -- and it was glorious.</li>
            <li> I hated doing it growing up while attending private school which required us to be clean shaven, and I hate it now being in the Army.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the flex ball..</li>
            <li> If you are a lady who shaves leg, arm, or any body hair, just look past the stupid marketing and buy this razor as well as a couple of razor heads, because you are not going to look back once you buy this.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d try to avoid as it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the ones that do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super disappointed in this purchase, but it still wasn&#x27;t bad to get it for...</li>
            <li> , at least it won&#x27;t cost you and arm and leg like some of the electric razors out there!</li>
            <li> Being a fan of an electric razor it was a tough switch, I like the simplicity of grab, shave and go, skipping the need for shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Thankfully they have been in the game for quite a while</li>
            <li> in all, no complaints, but no great reason to go buy it over anything else, either.</li>
            <li> 15 dollars for a four pack of blades is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> me tell you, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> it is extremely difficult to keep track of</li>
            <li> I realized I have been shaving all wrong.</li>
            <li> (Sorry, I can’t even figure out now what is the name of that blade, there are so many!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys, I ain&#x27;t buying it.</li>
            <li> If I wrote &amp;#34;Gilette Fusion&amp;#34; on a shopping list for someone else to buy, I probably would end up with the wrong thing - there&#x27;s lots of Gilette Fusions now.</li>
            <li> No, I will not, and that makes me kinda sad.</li>
            <li> However, given the price of the blades, it was an expensive shave.  </li>
            <li> Well it wasn&#x27;t that I was wrong</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with gillette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit it, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> When I received the Gillette fusion proglide silvertouch to review I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit skeptical when I was asked to try out the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> Damn was I wrong...  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because I prefer the Gillette power razors and this razor didn&#x27;t fail to disappoint.  </li>
            <li> This can make shaving awkward at times.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t worry about cutting myself once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like cutting through butter.</li>
            <li> Blades moving sideways across skin tends to be dangerous.</li>
            <li> The pivot ball seemed awkward</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Gillette!</li>
            <li> Sorry Mach, you&#x27;ve been replaced!</li>
            <li> It is virtually impossible to cut yourself with this razor.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> : BAD name for the pivoting end.</li>
            <li> However, the quality of the product disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to make stupid faces to get a closer shave...</li>
            <li> I hate to run out of things</li>
            <li> HATE this razor.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I usually hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I Hate to shave</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette shaving gel and put this bad boy to the test and boy did it deliver!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First off, I am a woman. With legs and lady-bits to shave. I&#x27;ve been using Venus handles/blades (cheap handle, light-weight plastic, alternating blades...) for about a year and a half, since I lost my Gillette Mach 3 set in the move. Just never got around to buying another typical-guy razor until this one. I thought, you know, since I have plenty of space and curves to shave, this razor would be great. I was aaaall set to absolutely love this thing. Surely, the flex-y part will help, the new stuff on the blades will help with moisturizing, it&#x27;ll cut close, and hey, three bucks off... Nope. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t throw away my Venus razor. I&#x27;ve been trying for like two weeks to find out what &#x27;I must be doing wrong&#x27; to not have this awesome razor be awesome. I even &#x27;borrowed&#x27; my boyfriend&#x27;s Fusion Proglide with the matching blades just to compare the two. The weight of the razor is great. I don&#x27;t really notice the swivel-y part while I&#x27;m using it. But the blades just suck. The strip of &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; stuff chips off, even while using, and just seems to do more drying out than moisturizing. The ONLY reason that this got a 3-star rating from me is that there&#x27;s hope for my continued use for it whenever I get different blades, since they&#x27;ll take others. I may trade my boyfriend the cartridges that I have and see what he thinks about it, but the ones that come with these just aren&#x27;t doing it for me. I&#x27;m super disappointed in this purchase, but it still wasn&#x27;t bad to get it for... I think it was like $11? There was a coupon on the site that went to that, but still.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after spending some time with the double-edged razors a lot of people have recommended. Now those blades are very sharp, but unfortunately don&#x27;t do a good job with my neck beard. Now, my neck beard might extend further south than most, but I still expect to shave without leaving permanent scarring as a result. This product accomplishes this goal far better than my double-edged razor. Now, if they point is to prove you are manly, then by all means, go that route. Use a Katana if you can wield it. However, if your goal is to be able to get a close shave without having to focus too much, then this is the best bet. My facial hair typically grows back the same day. Out of every major brand and the feather razors sold here, this gives me the best shave. The feather blades are cheaper, so I wish they would win, but they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my defacto shower razor, and I will leave the double-edged razor for weekends and such. it is expensive, but I want the best a man can get.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Husband for Christmas. He loves it</li>
            <li> It was on sale for cheaper than the replacement razors themselves.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in comfort or closeness of shave,</li>
            <li> Nice razor, hits those hard to reach places...but the key here is the blade cartridge, which really does an outstanding job. Much closer than my expensive German Merkur razor with supposedly super-sharp Japanese Feather blades.</li>
            <li> LOVE! So smooth and sleek. Didnt give me a rash with my sensitive skin. Love that the cartridges are on subscribe and save total bonus! I will for sure stick with this razor!</li>
            <li> Great Razor! Gillette was kind enough to send me one to try out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used Gillette products before. This is Night and day above my old Schick Razor. Smooth shave, and really does a nice job on my Noggin! I shave my head daily and I find that I have so much an easier time with this Razor. It just follows the contours of my head very easy. I will for sure be keeping this.</li>
            <li> I also used the various blades from the single edge, double edge, injector, sensor and several other types that I no longer remember.  I received this razor free in the mail, I think they got my name and address from Sam&#x27;s since I am a member and I always purchased  my Sensor blades there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought that this multiple blade idea was complete nonsense until I used the Proglide, this is absolutely the best razor I ever used.  I hate to run out of things so I usually buy a significant qty. of an item when I purchase them.  After trying the Proglide I gave all of my new Sensor blades away.  It is virtually impossible to cut yourself with this razor.  I do not have a really heavy beard and I only shave once a day consequently I get about a month of shaves from each blade.  I always rinse it in hot water and dry it before putting it away.  I, like most people rarely write a manufacturer about a great product, but I will immediately write if the product is garbage.  After using the Proglide I wrote Gillette telling them what a great product they had.</li>
            <li> I was far happier with the original Gillette Fusion. The mechanism that allows for greater movement is kind of loose and doesn&#x27;t allow you to get under the nose as well. Luckily the blades are identical to the original Fusion so I just swapped out the handle.</li>
            <li> Great product, would recommend</li>
            <li> I can remember when they gave away Gillette razors just to sell the blades. I have already trashed it</li>
            <li> The new flex ball doesn&#x27;t really do anything... IMO the regular proglide is better than this one and shaves closer.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Happy face!</li>
            <li> Not needed!  Even with flexball and five blades, I have to shave about as much with a two blade fixed razor and less with a three blade.  Those are very much less expensive for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth razor. Didn&#x27;t realize I needed a Flexball untill I got it. Very nice. Can definitly tell a difference in how even the shaving is. Not so many missed patches any more.</li>
            <li> Love it best razor out there</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this before</li>
            <li> It says in the description that it comes with 2 razor blade refills but it only came with one. Too much of hassle to go through the process of refund and replacement.</li>
            <li> good product, but refills are high priced.  I get about 2-3 good shaves from one cartridge. Each cartridge is about $3-$4, depending where you buy them from.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING, WE RECOMENT ALLWAYS, FIVE STARS +++++A+A+A+A+A+A+A</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was mislead by the description of this product. When it said 1 razor and 2 cartridges I thought that meant I would get a total of 3 razor heads. One on the razor and 2 refills. Unfortunately I only got one refill...</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had, in my 68 y/o life. A great experience! Highly recommend for sensitive, easy to nick face like mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it regularly, but it seems to work ok. It probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up well if you&#x27;re using it daily though. And the blade replacements are overpriced. Customer gouging+++</li>
            <li> Did some reason I was under the impression that this razor was also one that vibrates. It is not. It IS a great razor though, as are most Gillette products. It was also an enticing deal for 10 bucks, plus a $3 off instant coupon at check out, &amp; it came with 2 cartridges.</li>
            <li> Been using the regular Mach 3 razors for years. Tried this out with the pivot head and I love it. It&#x27;s a closer shave and its easy to use without going over the same spot multiple times. I think I might have to upgrade. :)</li>
            <li> I was actually going for the power proglide but accidently bought the manual one. I used to own a power proglide but to my surprise the manual one is better than the power. The grip is better and I dont have to worry about replacing batteries and its equally good shave. I like the silver colour. Its sleek and clean design.</li>
            <li> When I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with the Flexball handle, from Bzzagent I was excited. I have used Gillette products for many years and have been extremely happy with them. Once again I am extremely happy with the shave that I receive from the Proglide razor. I get a close, comfortable shave, the blades last twice as long as the others razors that I have. In fact the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the razor is the weight of the handle. The handle on the Flexball handle is 2 to 3 times as heavy as previous razors that I have owned. Most of the weight is located at the top of the handle (in the flexball itself). This can make shaving awkward at times. If it is possible to take some weight out of the handle it would greatly improve this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Gillette mach 3 turbo for about a decade and recently got a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor to try in my home and then review the item.  Given that this was a free item and it seemed new and different I figured that it would be worth a try.  I must say I am skeptical, especially since I have tried the Fusion and didn&#x27;t find that I got a better shave from the four rather than five blades.  I decided that I would have to try these razors within the same week three times and then let my wife would tell me which would work better and made my face smoother.  I shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion. I will say that the Fusion did not irritate under my neck as much as I am used to.  In fact I did not have any bumps or nicks, something that happens with frequency with the Mach 3 Turbo.  I also thought that the new razor, the turbo gave me about the same shave in terms of closeness. That said, my wife said that the Turbo side was superior in terms of stubble.  I repeated three times that week and all 3 times, my wife preferred Turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man with sensitive skin, this product wins hands down, but the fact that my wife liked the closeness better is only a bigger plus.  I could go either way with the whole battery thing, which makes it a bit heavier, but it is not really that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my skin sensitivity and my desire for the most comfortable shave, this is the razor for me and one that I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexiball technology to try for free from Gillette and it is great. Not enough O&#x27;s in the word smooth to describe it. I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin because it glides just like it&#x27;s name all over your face. The handle stays secure in your hand while shaving even when it is wet. So try the Gillette Fusion shaver today.</li>
            <li> If you are tried of getting cut because of the way your face curves this is the product for you! Gillette was kind enough to send me a sample and I must say that I am fairly surprised about the quality of this model. It is a very smooth shave along with some shave secret oil I use. The way it leaves my face with no cuts or anything after is nothing but simply a marvel on the skin. If you are someone who has tried everything and you have no hope left, then gillette will be the one that grants that hope back to you.</li>
            <li> I am a regular electric razor user because of the sensitivity I have to regular razors. I received this razor from Gillette to test and have been pleased to say the least. The flexball technology is not a fad; it works. The razor glides smoothly over every contour and easily cuts through even the toughest whiskers. As long as the glide strip is moistened with warm water for a few minutes, you will get a fantastic shave, even without shave cream... and no razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may be a little higher than one would like to spend, however the durability of the blades outlasts normal disposables. This is definitely an investment for the better and one you will be pleased about!</li>
            <li> I tried a few others, but  none gave me this close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning - don&#x27;t touch the blade with finger tips - I did, and got a nice cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades glide on face and NO nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The beard is very clean.</li>
            <li> Tried quite a few different products as of late. Like the Gillette best for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-Handle is ergonomic and easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;-Blade seems to hug the face for a very close shave; it also has an edge trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-Get four to five shaves with one cartridge, before I have to really start working for a smooth shave. Competitors product doesn&#x27;t match durability of blade nor ergonomics of handle; also no edge trimmer.</li>
            <li> Well, I got a free Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette for product review.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the handle was very sturdy.  The Flexball allowed a lot of pivoting movement of the head, but I was not overly impressed.  I knew I would let the performance be the real test.&lt;br /&gt;Since, I wanted to really test it out, I let my beard grow for a full week before shaving.  The first shave went very well.  My skin was really smoothly shaved with no nicks or cuts.  The second shave went well also.  But by the third use the blades were dull and the glide strip was useless.  So, overall, I felt the performance to be about 3.5 stars out of 5.  I would consider using this razor again.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual as part of a promotion from Gillette awhile back.  I have been using it for the past month and it has given me a great, nick free, smooth shave every time.  I am not 100% sold that the flexball technology drastically helps out that much though.  I only wish is that it had been the motorized version.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me the closest and quickest shave, although it has one design issue which was annoying for me and could be a problem for anyone with large hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positives. The four blades provide for a close and quick shave, and the blades themselves provided a closer shave than any other four bladed razor I&#x27;ve used. My shave was so close that my face was still smooth the next day! I also was able to shave in record time, and the extra blade on the back allowed me to keep my side burns straight. The flex ball in the handle allowed the blades to curve around my chin and down my neck with fewer passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is in the design of the handle. The handle is tiny and very smooth. I have big, but not giant hands and I fumbled with the razor a bit. As the razor became wet it was extra slick. If you have large hands, be aware that it can be difficult to use this razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette sent me a Fusion Proglide razor with Flexball handle to use, and overall I was very impressed with this product. I will definitely be switching to this razor.</li>
            <li> I love the way it contours to your face and curves, the razor is really sharp but the lubricating strip wears out fast idk if its cause my wife uses it for her legs but the razor still works great without the strip. I would reccomend this item to a friend or as a gift.</li>
            <li> For the last three years, I have used various electric razors every weekday for convenience.  Good or bad, I have always put a premium on the speed of electric razors over the quality of shave.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle that I received from Gilette really has me considering a switch back to a traditional razor.  I was surprised at how quick my shave went (likely because of the multiple sharp blades) and how close and smooth it was after I finished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I have a fairly normal face as far as hills and valleys go, but this razor handled each curve very well and without accidental cuts.  It took only a two or three passovers to accomplish a shave that took many more with either of my electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely consider making this my primary razor in the future.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks now (after getting this product given to me my Gilette to test), I am not all that impressed.  I feel like the ball handle sort of leaves me out of control of my face and the razor itself.  I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really close shave.  And I also notice that I miss strips or sections, have to go over the areas again, and that gives my sensitive skin razor burn.  It seemed like a really great idea at first.  But I also have a very sharp face, so maybe guys with a rounder face would benefit from this technology better.  I will be sticking with my other Gilette razor from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the razor. I was looking for something that cuts nice straight edges like my old 2 blade razor. This one cuts smoothly but isn&#x27;t for getting close to your side burns.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design. It was easy to get out of the package and I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials. It easily shaved around my face with ease without nicking the skin and causing me irritation. I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor. The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li> its a great razor, like any of the five blade products from Gillette. They shave absolutely amazingly. But they really didn&#x27;t make anything significant for me personally. I got the Razor from Gillette and I was expecting a huge difference from their previous line ( the one with the same head that vibrates), but I did not find one. They are great products both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-Heavy design&lt;br /&gt;-Chrome looks amazing&lt;br /&gt;-great Sharp Blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-hard to find a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Id like to think there was a difference with the swiveling head, but my facial structure did not find it. After all a razor is still a razor. BUT defiantly I would recommend anything pro glide by Gillette to anyone. Just be weary of the latest advancements and if they really have an effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the FlexBall Fusion ProGlide razor for a couple of weeks now I got from Gillette through Bzzagent have to say that I&#x27;m impressed.  When I forst received it, I thought the FlexBall technology was going to be gimmicky, but in truth it does actually help contour to the face when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives a real smooth shave.  I think the improvements in the blade are also quite nice.  Between the articulation and the new blades, they really did improve on their regular ProGlide razor.  With this one I find that I have to take less passes to get a complete shave which is nice as I have sensitive skin on my neck.  Overall, this new razor was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li> I was chosen to take the new Fusion Proglide Flexball razor for a test drive compliments of Gillette.  I have used Gillette Fusion razors before and have a great opinion of them as they always gave me an awesomely close, smooth shave.  I figured it would be hard to improve on something that already delivered such fine results.  But guess what...they did!&lt;br /&gt;Now I have used power razors before and I am still not sure if the vibrating function of powered razor make a lot of difference, but who cares, the star of this game is the Flexball handle technology.  Seriously, from the first  &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; I could tell I was going to get the closest shave ever!  The way the Flexball allows the razor to not only pivot the head up and down as it has in the past, but also now side-to-side is awesome!  You can now not have to only make straight &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; down your face, but now you can &amp;#34;juke&amp;#34; left or right and the blade follows in constant contact to &amp;#34;the playing field&amp;#34;!  For me this is great as my chin area is my hardest area to shave as I have very course thick stubble there.  Now when I &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; over that area I didn&#x27;t have to go back and replay that area over and over like before.  Like I said before after I finished I had the closet shave  I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;The blades clean up easily as well....and my  little &amp;#34;audible&amp;#34;.....make sure to completely dry the blades before you put the razor away and the cartridge will last a much longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final verdict. &#x3D;. TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of curiosity.  I have been a Fusion Proglide user since it was introduced and could not imagine a better shave.  After shaving with the Flexball I found I was able to shave with fewer strokes because I didnt miss as many hairs requiring me to go over those areas again.</li>
            <li> Speaking for all the men out there, including myself this is one of the best, most top notch razor ever!  I typically don&#x27;t just say that unless I really love something.  This razor does it all but mostly it provides a sharp, nice, clean shave without all the extra irritated skin!  I have tried multiple razors ranging from the electric shavers that are upwards of $150 to the downright cheap disposable kind and I must say this goes above and beyond either one.  Why not give it a try, at least it won&#x27;t cost you and arm and leg like some of the electric razors out there!</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of trying the Gillette Fusion FREE of cost, directly from Gilette (Thank You!!!). This was my first time shaving with a straight edge razor (I use an electric razor) and I must say that the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Razor is pretty AMAZING! Right out of the box, the razor has a very attractive design, is very sturdy/durable and feels very comfortable when held. As for the actual shaving motion? The name &#x27;ProGlide&#x27; says it all. Smooth, comfortable and worry-free! I didn&#x27;t worry about cutting myself once. When you are done with your shave, you will be pleased. And then you can return the razor to it&#x27;s handy holder, which offers a way to store extra blades (which snap easily into place, BTW) on the underside. Overall, the razor is thoughtfully designed and provides an incredibly close shave. I highly recommend giving this a go!</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a part of a free trial from Gillette and I was a bit skeptical of the premise at first. A blade that swivels across my face? Sounded like I was in for some major cuts. When I first tried it I was surprised to see that the hard to reach places of my face and neck were smooth, the razor moved effortlessly as I shaved, almost as if it was made to custom fit my face. I have very thick hair and this razor didn&#x27;t tug at it, I shaved nicely. This razor has a nice looking and it feels very sturdy when I hold it. I would recommend this razor to anybody, especially people with thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I like this razor less each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it from Gillette to sample and review, so I&#x27;ve put it to the test and here&#x27;s my fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great, good weight, texture. The Blades are great, smooth and sharp. The problem is the FlexBall. When I&#x27;m shaving my face, especially in the corners of my mouth and nose, I do not want sharp blades moving around. I like the blades to go exactly where I intend them to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a product marketed for leg shavers.</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design of the product. Super easy to get out of the package as you know how blister packs can be! I felt that it was made out of very good components. It easily shaved around the curvature of my face and neck easily. No cuts or discomfort when shaving using this razor. The swivel handle helped to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face and neck for a close even shave. I used to have to shave over my face many times before, not with this razor as it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face leaving me with no irritation. I was able to shave over just once and it got most of it in one pass. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about two weeks and it gets the job done shaves very smooth and extremely close.</li>
            <li> Got one free to try.  It shaves the hair of my skin right down to my chinny chin chin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> i would go for the electric on this only because it provides a slightly better shave. I was given this razor by gillette and i have to say i am not disappointed one bit in the results it gave me. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonder shave.</li>
            <li> I personally had no use for this particular ball flex technology, however I admit that others may have a different experience.  Shaving product reviews are highly subjective.  I give 3 because the gillette razor blades shave quite well.  Depending on your facial profile I think you&#x27;ll know if you need this razor, clearly, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide from Gillette seems to me like the best manual shaver that I have ever used. Before, manual shavers required me to adjust my face to the razor, but now, Gillette has made a shaver that adjusts to my face, leading to an easier shave with less chances of cuts. Flexball technology should have been introduced ages ago and should have been a norm. Gillette has now introduced it, now we should accept it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor....I know it is for men but I am a woman and I love the shave!</li>
            <li> When I first decided to shave with the Fusion ProGlide - FlexBall Handle, I will admit, I just assumed that this would be like any other razor that I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I was wrong.  Flat out wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I absolutely love this razor.  I firmly believe that the FlexBall Handle allows the razor to touch every corner of your face on the first shave... not the second or third.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds corny, but this actually helps out quite a bit.  Unfortunately, I have to shave daily.  I&#x27;m not lucky enough to only have to shave once or twice a week.  Personally, I have sensitive skin, so only going over each area of my face only once, helps me out quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like the Fusion ProGlide Razor with the FelxBall Handle is the way to go.  It worked out really well for me and I plan on keep using this razor in the future!</li>
            <li> Great product! An awesome improvement to the original. The razor contoured to all the curves on my face and neck with ease. i will be using this in the future. Wish coupons were more readily available though.</li>
            <li> this is probaly  one of the smoothest shaves i have ever got and the ball thing is incredible it just so close its unreal i believe this product is a must buy</li>
            <li> First, I should advise that I received a free sample of this razor from Gilette to try out.    That being said, it is truely a great razor.  I tried it for the first time yesterday and it provided a close shave without any burn since I was able to use less strokes.  I was going to use it again today, but I don&#x27;t think I will need to because of how close it shaved.  I think I&#x27;ll be able to go two days between shaves.    Update: I&#x27;ve been using this Fusion Proglide for around a month now and I am only shaving every other day.  I would use it more often if I needed to because it provides a very comfortable shave but I simply don&#x27;t need to because it gets that close.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and only shave once or twice a week. Disposable razors occasionally leave me with razor burn and red marks. The Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball that I received from Gillette was amazing. Not a single trace of razor burn or any irritating red marks at all. A High Quality Razor For Sure!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;The five blades make for a very close and smooth shave. Nothing compares to the five blade Gillette razors. One of my favorite aspects of this particular razor is the single grooming blade on the backside. It&#x27;s perfect for shaping the Goat, making precise straight cuts in between and along the edges. The Flexball is pretty handy too. It allows for a smooth transition from the chin to the neck area. You can shave at any angle with this Flexball razor. Also, the blades last for several shaves and it comes with an extra replacement blade. Overall, this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball is worth every penny and is a must have for anyone who suffers from irritation after shaving. Save your face and neck the trouble and get yourself a quality razor like this one.</li>
            <li> I got this razor to try out from gillette and I want to give it an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball is a cool new technology that allows the razor to contour to your face. I like that it swivels and allows me to get those harder to reach places. I will say that it does add some weight to the razor and might be a little challenging to get a straight line for your beard. I shave my whole face but I&#x27;ve heard from others that the swivel can make it a little tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the all silver color, I think it makes it look sharp! Speaking of sharp, these blades are awesome! They give me a really close shave without much irritation at all and I have pretty sensitive skin. The weight of the razor seems to help balance the blades on my face. I don&#x27;t know how to put it eloquently but you&#x27;ll have to try it out and see what you think. It&#x27;s just a well balanced, close shaving, sleek looking machine of a razor!  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will me more than happy to share my experience about gillette fusion proglide  i was get it free from bzzagent i try it it was amazing flexible and easy to shave i love shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to every one to buy it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this was as close a shave as everyone says.  After using this for about a month, not only was it a great shave, but it was also still working at a month.  That was my biggest surprise, because it really did last.  I am def going to recommend this razor to anyone who asks</li>
            <li> I just got this razor to test for free and I was quite excited to try it out right away. First of, the shave is very smooth. I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or burns due to the blue lubastrip. The design of the handle moved the shaving cream out of the area of the blade and easily washed off. In essence the shave was the same good quality I have known from my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide. However, the one thing I will say is that there&#x27;s nothing special about this razor. I don&#x27;t even know if the rotating ball head even turned while I was shaving. Although I don&#x27;t think its significantly better than the regular Gillette Fusion Proglide, I still think it provides one of the most comfortable shaves out there.</li>
            <li> This razor is above and beyond what I expected. The flexball allows the razor to glide over my skin for a smooth finish without all of the annoying nicks and scrapes. Who knew something so little could make such a difference. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a sample from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball is what got my attention as a new feature. It worked better than I expected to help the razor to contour my face. It was a little hard to get used to it, just the first time. The blades are great and accurate, as it has been always my experience with Gilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly sensitive skin, and it worked perfectly fine for me. I am very pleased with this new product and will buy it for sure.</li>
            <li> Iv  have tried ever razor out there and this is by far the best the flex ball moves around my face leavening a close shave that I haven&#x27;t been able to get from other razors</li>
            <li> I recently used this razor, and must say I am pleased with the results. It was very smooth to the skin, and the shaving was very precise. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice clean shave with no hassle whatsoever. I am very pleased with this product, which is why i gave it 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I recently received this from Gillette to review and I&#x27;m glad I did. I was immediately impressed with the overall design and feel of hte razor. It feels nice in the hand and has a good weight to it. It is well built and has a very durable design. I&#x27;ve been using the product every morning for the last week and I am thoroughly impressed by it. It contours to your face like no other razor and it gets every hair with ease. It gives you a close shave without any tug or pull. I have never cut myself with it or had any problems. It really is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I don&#x27;t have any complaints, it is worth every penny and i would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just tried this razor for the first time last week and was very pleased with the results.  I had been using the Shick and was very happy with the Gillette, I will we be using this razor from now on.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Fusion user.  This new Flexball version is the best yet!</li>
            <li> Before using using this razor, which I got for free from Gillette, I was using a Gillette fusion without the flexball technology. While I loved my old razor this one is simply better. The swivel action of the flexball allows me to shave around my jawline without having to re-do spots to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any of the books and crannies, haha. I can&#x27;t imagine anything that could be done to improve it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> works great!&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about shaving and any old razor will not do, but this was wonderful and works so well, i ve  told all my friends and family to go get one.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette for free to try and review - and with good reason I was excited to try it out. The new Flex Ball in the handle allowed the blades to move with the contours of my face. I was able to achieve a closer, smoother shave with minimal abrasions. I usually get nicks and razor burn from shaving but the Gillette Fusion Proglide delivered on its promise for low resistance. I&#x27;m a convert. And as someone with sensitive skin I recommend the Fusion Proglide razor. I&#x27;ll be using the Proglide from now on.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from Gillette for free to test. Gillete always makes good razors, the proglide pivot works good in following the contours of your face. You don&#x27;t have to stretch your face trying to get everywhere. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette about two weeks ago and have used it so far about 5-6 times. So far I have to say its a great blade but what I&#x27;m really loving is the engineering of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off to give you an idea of what kind of shaver I am, I maintain a beard while using the razor to keep the thick brush that constantly grows on my neck at bay. With my growth rate I HAVE to shave ever two days or I end up looking like a bum. I don&#x27;t use any soap or creams, I just \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; in the shower. My only available method to clean the razor is the weak spray that is my sad little shower head, or risk dulling the blades by brushing them with my hand. I bring this up because this has been a huge pain point for me with other blades getting clogged quickly, always right in the middle of the length of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaving that this blade provides, it is what you would (and should) expect, a good consistent shave that does not slice your face off. Thankfully they have been in the game for quite a while and I would be pretty shocked if this was not the case. All 5-6 times I got a good shave and did not notice bleeding once. That sometimes happens to me when razors dull quickly after first 3 uses, but thankfully was not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I say, in my opinion, you should expect all that. The thing I was extremely please about was how they designed the blades. With my two-three day neck growth I have not had a clog up yet that my shower spray could not clean out. I cannot tell you how happy this makes me. After the 3rd or 4th day I noticed it and was trying to figure out why. It looks like they have the razor backing right next to the blades but they have solved the problem by placing additional super tiny little gap fillers between each razor so that 1. it provides support and 2. its stops the clogging problem while allowing it to still cut evenly. Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I say so far I&#x27;m loving the blade. If I had to nitpick something that I didn&#x27;t like then it would probably be just that its big and the orange ball kind of makes it ugly in my opinion. But since I don&#x27;t shower and shave out in public for all to see (at least not often), I&#x27;m not too worried about people gocking at the sight of my big orange blade ;)</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this razor from Gillette and I have been using it as my daily shaver for over a month now.  I am on my second razor cartridge and have been get a consistently good shave.  The 5 blades shave as close as you would expect a razor in this class too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ball does seem to help follow the contours of my face, but the movement is nowhere near dramatic.  It is noticeable if you are watching closely. Of course, I don&#x27;t really give it a second though anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is well built and feels very solid.  The rubber grips are big and provide a firm grip, even in the shower. I would buy this razor with or without the rotating ball based on build quality alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any real negatives,  the blades wear about average, and&lt;br /&gt;a weekend&#x27;s worth of stubble takes a bit of extra work.  That&#x27;s to be expected of any razor really.</li>
            <li> Does not come with the sensor technology so I&#x27;d try to avoid as it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the ones that do.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall from Gillette to try and it is a razor with an interesting spin.  There are so many different types of razors out on the market it is extremely difficult to keep track of however this razor has a very unique feature in the FlexBall.  It does seem to help get around curves of my face when I use it but at the end of the day a razor is a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors really boil down to how sharp the blades are, how long do they stay sharp, how close the shave is without irritation and cuts and how long does it take me to shave.  Most of these add-ons that razor companies have now are just gimmicks to get people to try them or switch over when there is really no end gain or value and that is exactly what the FlexBall is for this Gillette Fusion ProGlide - another gimmick that really doesn&#x27;t help the end goal of shaving a whole lot.  It does provide a decent shave with standard irritation expectations but I won&#x27;t be dropping my current go-to razor for this one.</li>
            <li> When I received the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette, I thought the flex ball part would just be another gimmick  to get people to buy a new razor. Upon trying it though, I was pleased with the results. I not only shave my fave but my entire head as well. Even with most 4-5 bladed razors, my sensitive skin would often become irritated after shaving. I feel that the flex ball,combined with the t blades, allowed me to shave along all the many contours of my head and face and allowed me to get a super close and comfortable shave. I  was able to get close to two weeks of shaves out of one cartridge, and that&#x27;s pretty impressive. I highly recommend theFusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology to anyone looking for a comfortable close shave!</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample of this razor from Gillette. The flexball is a neat feature in that it follows the contours of my face easily without much manual correction. I have been pleasantly surprised at how long the blade has lasted. I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, but purposefully let it grow out to test how the blade, after being used several times, cut. Even after many uses the blade has yet to tug or cause razor burn. I really enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with Flexball technology definitely brings some new ideas to cartridge razors. First, the razor comes with things you expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy and comfortable grip handle which helps prevent slippage in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Five super sharp blades which cuts hair cleanly in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;-The Lubrastrip which cares for your skin and lubricates your face.&lt;br /&gt;-One blade on the back to help for those stray hairs and to style your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The orange Flexball pivots from left to right. You use your thumb to hold it in place or just let it do its thing as it goes down your neck. Great for people like me who have an oddly contoured face to help cut more hair in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;-Although you&#x27;re used to sharp razors, I feel like this one is even more so. Definitely cuts closer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side for the Flexball is if you do try to steer it, it&#x27;s hard to hold on to the ball on the right side since the support arm gets in the way. Other than that, a wonderful razor for everyday use. It helps cut down shave time and cuts close. Highly recommend this for those who shave everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor! I have facial hair most of the time and this razor curves and bends around it with no problem whatsoever. I received my first one free from Gillette, but I will absolutely be purchasing this razor again in the future.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Merkur safety razor to get a very close shave. However I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide, courtesy of Gillette, and I can honestly say this is an excellent disposable razor. The packaging was very easy to open, and the razor was very well presented. When I removed it from the box it was pleasantly weighty, and require no pressure when I began to shave. The result was a very smooth face with no razor burn(I have very sensitive skin). The balljoint did not come into play well shaving my face but on my neck was certainly grateful for it. However at 30 dollars for a box of refills I cannot in good conscience recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a promotional gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, I am the disposable razor type. Before that, I used a double edge razor that belonged to my grandfather. I have to shave at least twice a week for my job, but not more because of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I REALLY like this razor! It has a nice, hefty metal feel (although I think it is chrome plated plastic). I had 2 day stubble and it took it right off. I thought that the 5 blades would clog up immediately, but as long as I washed it every other pass, it didn&#x27;t. The ball followed the contours of my face precisely. The only thing I sort of didn&#x27;t like was the pivoting head. When you remove it from your face, it snaps back flat - really not a deal breaker though. I followed up with my usual face rinse and isopropyl alcohol as an astringent. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt! I woke up the next day with NO razor burn and still pretty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to Walmart the next day. I checked the price of the refills - $20 for 4! Remember, I am coming from the disposable world @ $1 a pop, and they last about 3 weeks for me! Of course there IS the razor burn factor with the cheap razors. I guess I will keep using the Proglide to see how long the blades last (until I start getting pulling or razor burn) before I make a final decision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a &amp;#34;pay for the best&amp;#34; type of guy--I balance price and value, and typically lean towards &amp;#34;good enough for the right price&amp;#34;--my wife calls it being cheap. I&#x27;ve used a 4-bladed razor from a shave club for over a year, and it definitely falls into the &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; category. I was interested to try this one out when I received it free from Gillette, and I was completely surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor. I have used a single cartridge to shave my head and face for over 2 weeks, and still get better results than my shave club razor. It clogs less (a surprise for a 5-bladed razor) and cuts closer in each pass. And though I thought the pivoting &amp;#34;flex ball technology&amp;#34; head was a gimmick, I can honestly see it in action when shaving my head. It keeps the blades engaged on my head though I may not have the handle perfectly perpendicular. I would have rated it 5 stars, but for the price...nearly 3 times the price of the shave club ones. They last nearly twice as long though, and definitely shave better so it goes back to your personal style of price/value vs. performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though I have several packs of shave club razors I can still use, and I hate the thought of giving Gillette money to help fund their stadium sponsorship of the New England Patriots (whom I hate), I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap disposable razors for a long time. After using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle Technology I realized I have been shaving all wrong. I will never use cheap disposable razors again. The Proglide is such a nice smooth shave. It&#x27;s like cutting through butter. The difference is night and day. The razor is a little heavier than what I&#x27;m used to and I love it. That little extra weight feels like it is doing the work for me. The subtle give from the flexball makes a huge difference in how smooth the shave feels. It&#x27;s awesome. I also really like the touch-up blade on the back for getting precise strokes on my beard outline. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited when I was selected to review the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free by Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a revolutionary razor and out performs any other razor. With 5 strong, durable blades the tug and pull on hair while shaving no longer occurs while the blade smoothly goes over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional razors are horribly hard to use for hard to reach contours near the jaw and neck, but not with the Gillette Fusion Proglide. The FlexBall technology allows the razor to move and shift to every contour smoothly and seamlessly getting a close and quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also great for those with sensitive skin. Most razors caused breakouts or itching after shaving, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide is great on sensitive skin. While using this product my skin was nearly never irritated which makes Gillette Fusion Proglide better than most razors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Recap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Seamlessly shaves over contours such as the jaw and neck&lt;br /&gt;+ 5 blades for minimal pulling of hair&lt;br /&gt;+ Delicate on sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Shaves close to the skin and leaves skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;+ Overall design is visually appealing</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from bzzagent.com The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR has to be the best manual razor I have ever used. It gets to those hard to reach areas. My skin has never felt this smooth. I would reccomend to my friends.-Posted from my wifes acct.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillete Fusion Proglide Silvertouch from Gillete. I am not disapointed. It really is a good product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I got this razor in the mail for free to review and was already put off since it is a cartridge razor (I use a straight blade as my daily driver). For the sake of Gillette I decided to give this razor an honest chance. Day 1, I tell my straight razor everything will be OK and that I am just trying this out for a friend. It understands and I unbox the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology. It looks funny but has me intrigued. I lather up with my brush like always. I then take the first stroke with this new technology. What is this sorcery? I could pivot around my face like Lebron James does on the court. It was a very pleasant experience and had me second guessing my straight razor. 1 up for Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Gillette razors but this one is just pure awesome. I love how Gillette razors tend to last so much longer then other brands. They also give you a clean shave as well. Their razors are lightweight and even though the replacement cartridges can be a little pricey, they are well worth it. Gillette gave me this product to try for free and I am glad they did.</li>
            <li> I have tried many razors before and I am certain this one is one of the best I have ever used. With past razors, especially the disposable ones, I would always end up cutting myself when shaving. This Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball razor glides along with your faces ridges and curves and gives you a nice clean shave without the burn or irritation we men are used to getting from past razors. I am usually very picky on products for shaving so for me to say this is a great shaver.... it means a lot! I also love the fact that you only have to go over your face once with this razor and it will give a nice clean shave without having to go over and over the same areas. I truly love this comfortable, smooth, great shaving razor!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotional program with Gillette. When I first opened the box i received in the mail, my reaction was &amp;#34;woah.&amp;#34; The new design caught me off guard because it really is pretty different from what I&#x27;ve seen in the past. The handle itself is pretty basic, but what really caught my attention was the &amp;#34;flexball.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s just pretty cool to look at. I actually found myself just playing around with it before even shaving, just to get a grasp on how it worked. Now I don&#x27;t usually prefer manual razors, electric razors just seem to work better for my face. With that said, this wasn&#x27;t bad at all. It took a few passes to get through the jungle my face thinks is a beard. But once I got past the longer growth, I was actually impressed. The razor allowed me to get one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get with a manual razor. Now the blades themselves aren&#x27;t too different. I do believe that blades are blades. Just clean metal to run up and down my face. What I feel really worked was the flexball. I was able to easily get into the grooves along my jawline. Especially in the spots I usually miss. And it was a really close shave. Overall a good experience. Now with all of that said. I don&#x27;t see myself converting over from an electric razor. The after affects of a manual razor just suck. Hair regrowth, ingrown hairs, all the gross, itch stuff that comes from using a manual razor are still there. That could be because of the razor, but most likely is caused by my face... Regardless, if you prefer manual razors, give it a try. A close shave, straight clean lines, and just an nice looking, almost high-tech manual razor. 4 out of 5. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> How many Gillette razors are there? Every year a new one? Ten?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my husband, as most Gillette’s products, this one is good – close shave, good mobility, whatever else you’ve come to expect from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, he doesn’t like this version of Gillette Fusion as much as the one with vibrating handle. (Sorry, I can’t even figure out now what is the name of that blade, there are so many!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good, as always. Best for you? Maybe yes, maybe not.</li>
            <li> Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology is the best. Smoothest shave everytime. FlexBall Handle Technology responds to contours for Gillette’s best shave. Its gets to all the hair with a stroke. Maximum contact. Gillet is only brand I use.</li>
            <li> I have long been a user of Gillette razors.  Ever since I first started shaving, I have used some type of razor manufactured by Gillette.  My most recent type was the Fusion ProGlide, which for my purposes, has been the best shave I have gotten from a Gillette razor.  When I was given the opportunity from Gillette to try the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology, I was a little hesitant.  How could they improve upon the razor I already had and loved for the past couple of years?  But since I received a free razor from Gillette to try, I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;  After the first shave I was totally sold.  I had gotten the smoothest shave from this razor.  The FlexBall technology in the handle allowed the razor to move across the contours of my face effortlessly.  Needless to say, I have found my new razor (and I wasn&#x27;t even looking).  I highly recommend the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology for anyone who is looking for a clean, smooth shave without any effort.  Mornings are hard enough, let this razor make you look your best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years and just when I thought the brand could not innovate their razors anymore, I was pleasantly surprised with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall.  When I tried the ProGlide with FlexBall I immediately noticed a better shave -- even from the original ProGlide.  I shave 3-4 times a week so a close and clean shave is important and the FlexBall ensures that I get the best results, especially around the jawline area. When shaving in a hurry I noticed with other razors that I would miss sections around my neck and jaw but with 1 stroke with the FlexBall I am able to get consistent clean shave results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially appreciate the Lubrastrip as I feel this is another piece that separates the ProGlide from the competition.  This strip ensures I get a LESS IRRITATING shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp resulting in no tug or pull and the trimming edge is a plus.  Gillette has come through again using technology and innovation to provide a quick, clean, and simple shave!</li>
            <li> Arrived safely.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thinking what could have improved so. I used the Gillette shaving gel and put this razor to the test and it did deliver! It easily shaved around the curvature of my face. The swivel handle helped with being able to shave without pulling and stretching my face. Usually I have to shave over adam&#x27;s apple carefully not to nick it but this razor cut all the worry out. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several days now and it gets the job done shaving smooth and close. I can honestly say this an improvement over my other fusion razors.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette Proglides in the past and the flexibility ball is by far my favorite nice smooth shave and superior design</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out Gillette&#x27;s newest razor, the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall handle.  I have long been a fan of Gillette razors and have used them with great results so was excited to get a chance to try out this new one with the pivoting head which promised an even better shave that  I was already getting from my Gillette razor.  And I have to say, it delivered.  This razor did not disappoint.  The pivoting head allowed the razor to better contour to my face, enabling a closer shave which left my face baby smooth and soft.  And as always with Gillette&#x27;s quality razors, I did not suffer from razor burn on my very sensitive skin as I do with other razors.  The ONLY thing that would have made this razor better for me would have been of it was a power razor as I really like the vibrating that the power razors have.  But overall, this is the best razor I have used to date and I look forward to many more years of shaving with Gillette&#x27;s fine razors!  The new flex ball handle will be my new go to razor!  Thank you Gillette for allowing me the opportunity to try this incredible razor.</li>
            <li> This razor offers a sleek design that fits nicely by my sink.  I had a few days of stubble and it knocked it down quickly with no nicks.  This thing left my face feeling soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve used Gillette products for years and this ranks up there with my old Mach 3.  Sorry Mach, you&#x27;ve been replaced!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of sad that I am almost 34 years old, yet can not grow substantial facial hair...at least not beyond the point of looking like a 13 year old boy who is going through puberty. Nevertheless, I do grow stubble (and a fierce neck beard) and need to shave, just not as often as some of my less follicly challenged friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free, to try and review, from Gillette, so I figured I would give it a try. I have used previous shave-tech forward Gillette products prior to shaving with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball and while they have been satisfactory, this new product BY FAR crushes their previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To elaborate, I shave once every 7-10 days, much to my wife&#x27;s displeasure. To be honest, I could probably get away with twice a week, considering how quickly my neck beard grows. However, I&#x27;m usually lazy and go longer in between shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first try with this new product was great. I had gone my typical week plus, and needed a good shave. My neck is pretty sensitive, but I need to basically shave in every direction to get a close shave. However, this time, with the new Gillette ProGlide featuring five blades, I didn&#x27;t have to make as many passes - cutting down on the irritation typically associated with shaving. The Flexball also allowed the blades to lay flat on my face and neck, again attaining the super close shave my wife loves so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I always leave my upper lip to shave last. However, with previous products - even new blades out of the box - the other razors ALWAYS pulled on the stubble on my upper lip, which clearly doesn&#x27;t feel great. But, much to my surprise, the new ProGlide thankfully did not pull at all. Like, zero. This was a huge bonus, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since shaved three or four more times using the same blade, and each time I get the same great shave. The new ProGlide came with a replacement blade that I&#x27;ll install after my next shave with the current one, but I feel it&#x27;s a good value as I can get several shaves with the same blade, without sacrificing the close shave I come to expect from Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you pick one up today!</li>
            <li> I recently received a freebie Gillette-Proglide-Silvertouch-Flexball razor from Gillette for testing. It uses the same 5 bladed Pro Glide cartridges that I have grown to love. The handle is the same balanced, contoured won&#x27;t slip grip EXCEPT for this engineered slightly movable &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; near the blades. With this little gizmo the blades DO pivot front to back and side to side ---- a little. I shaved using this new contraption and saw NO difference from my Gillette Pro Glide razor. Repeat - NO difference. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I got the usual GREAT shave but the gimmicky ball had NOTHING to do with it. My thinking is that the Marketing Department stayed up late to come up with this idea. They are trying to convince us that this technology is NECESSARY for shaving because of our &amp;#34;face contours&amp;#34;. Sorry guys, I ain&#x27;t buying it. Unfortunately from looking at the other reviews, MANY have been convinced. For the shave alone  I would give it five (5) stars, but for the new handle I can only give it two (2) stars. A quick hint. Make sure to keep the blades dry for longer life.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. Got it from Gillette. Keeps the blades in constant contact with your skin with minimal effort from me.</li>
            <li> I recieved this New Fusion with Flexball technology as a promotional gift from Bzzagent.com.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the way this razor performs!!  I shave my head and normally it takes a couple of times to get all of the hair but this razor is a time saver because it&#x27;s one and done.  Normally my wife detests my razors because they break out her legs.  I can&#x27;t keep my wife away from using this razor because she says it makes her legs feel super smooth.  I have been a bzzagent for a few years and have tested a few razors in the past but this razor tops the mountain.  #GotItFree, #GotADiscount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe me try it for yourself you will not regret the decision!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benjamin Bogedain&lt;br /&gt;Bzzagent, Father, and Long time head shaver, since 2006.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving since I was 12. My first razor was the Gillette Mach 3. This is the first razor since the Mach 3 that actually reminds me of the shave I got from my first experience. The new formulation of the razors seems to be what the Fusion was missing. My only complaint is how much the razor gets clogged, other than that the shave is a really nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t harm my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very smooth and comfortable shave. No nicks or cuts at all and very simple to use. A little expensive but still worth the price for a quality razor.</li>
            <li> I love this razor (even with sensitive skin it works well). It feels as if my facial hair takes longer to grow in too which feels great…results may vary but I high recommend this razor for a men</li>
            <li> I was offered by Gillette to try this new shaver for free,&lt;br /&gt;so I did even though I abandoned wet shavers a while ago for electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is built in a way that it lets the head tilt from side to side, not just be pushed upwards a bit to follow the contours of your face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provided a pretty good shave, however, I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from what their older shavers, the ones that just provided flexibility up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. if you don&#x27;t have any wet shaver yet, it would be a nice buy, but I wouldn&#x27;t switch from my regular shaver just to get this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if Gillette could improve the Fusion ProGlide Razor, I had been pretty happy with it. But I got the chance to try the razor with Flexball handle thanks to Gillette, but of course I almost always try new technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the shave this razor provides. It does a much better job of going around corners of the jaw than the older razor. I feel I get a closer shave that lasts longer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love the pivoting head on this razor. It&#x27;s follows the contours of my face. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with fixed blade razors getting along my jawline. I got a great shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell: Great razor design, if you can get it at a good price, buy it! (Make sure it&#x27;s the right one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review: Gilette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor with FlexBall Technology: I received this product for free as per a Gilette promotional program. Once again, GREAT product, just marketed very badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor: Everyone knows the Gilette Fusion is already a great razor: It cuts hair very well without cutting the skin. This latest variation puts a pivot on the end of the razor handle. The pivot lets the razor follow the skin even more closely for an even eaiser, better shave. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34; - this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for all the marketing problems - where do I start? Actually, they got one thing right. Last year I reviewed the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Styler and complained about the packaging. This time they have a package that is stylish yet easy to open and somewhat eco-friendly. Now for the problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FlexBall: BAD name for the pivoting end. It&#x27;s not actually a ball, it&#x27;s just a side to side pivot made to look like a ball. I was actually MORE impressed with it once I found out it wasn&#x27;t really a ball, because it means the razor doesn&#x27;t flop all over your face, it just gently pivots, so I still feel I&#x27;m in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SilverTouch: Gilette markets both Silver and non-Silver versions. I went to their website, and I can&#x27;t figure out what the difference is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual: Gilette markets both &amp;#34;Manual&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; versions. The power version has a battery and it vibrates the razor. I&#x27;ve tried the power version before and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me... it&#x27;s not an electric razor, it&#x27;s just a manual razor that vibrates. I don&#x27;t think it cuts any differently. It would be nice if Gilette would further explain the benefits of the power version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Name: WAY TOO LONG. If I wrote &amp;#34;Gilette Fusion&amp;#34; on a shopping list for someone else to buy, I probably would end up with the wrong thing - there&#x27;s lots of Gilette Fusions now. The only way to know for sure is to go to the store myself and try to pick out the exact right product with the exact right options. Why not have a simple name like &amp;#34;Gilette Fusion 5000&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Gilette Fusion 6000&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Options: As a follow-up, why offer so many options anyway? Does it really cost that much more to add the FlexBall to the razor - why not just give it (and ALL of the best options) to everyone? The razor might cost a little more, but you only have to buy it once. Or at least that is what Gilette would want you to believe. In reality, what they seem to be doing is coming up with one exciting new option a year, so each year you have to buy a new razor anyway to keep up with the latest options. Clever way to keep consumers buying, but not nice on the pocketbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Gilette needs to come up with a far simpler product name and maybe only 2 or 3 variations, and that&#x27;s it - keep it simple. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll be staring at a dozen options on the shelf and looking at all the marketing lingo and trying to figure out what I actually need. Hidden behind all this mess is a terrific product; it&#x27;s a shame that their marketing department has to make it so complicated!</li>
            <li> I received this for free to try out and I have used other razors in the past and have stuck with the disposable as they seem to keep an edge longer on the blades. I gave this a try with about 3 day growth. No pulling or tugging to cut the hair and left my face smooth after one stroke. I have been using the same blade now for three weeks and it still cuts like it did on day one. It also cuts so close I do not have the 5 o&#x27;clock I was getting with other razors. I also like the way it will pivot so I do not have to shave in multiple directions to reach the different curves of the face, chin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the short if you want a close shave at a good price this is the one to try.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as Demo from Gilette to try it out. I used the Gilette Fusion before so I can easily compare the 2 products. In terms of angle chin shaving, the Proglide does a better job without any Knicks or cuts: the blade is as smooth as with the regular Fusion ; it is a cleaner shave overall and somewhat quicker than with the regular Fusion. The blade is easily replaceable  and seems to last me at least 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review and I was delighted by the look and feel of the razor. I have used Gillette for years and have always enjoyed them as they work as desired. I&#x27;m not particularly sure about the flexball adding anything extra but it was definitely a smooth guide and works very well on my coarse facial hair. Compared to many other brands Gillette just is the best. Yes they may be a little more expensive but really, you are shaving you are face and everyone see&#x27;s it! You don&#x27;t want to walk around like a giant razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades are definitely a plus and reduces pull and tug that I would normally have from a razor with less blades. The handle is easy to use and glides well. I&#x27;m not quite sure if there is a single negative to report back. My face is smooth and no issues here! Go get yourself one and feel the difference on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/11/2014 This is still working great and I haven&#x27;t replaced the blade. I am surprised by the longevity of this razor and would give it 6 stars if it was possible. I am so happy this company let me try this razor out for testing purposes- I am totally hooked now!</li>
            <li> I think I have tried almost every type of disposable razor there is. I&#x27;ve tried the 3, 4, 5 and 6 blade systems. I&#x27;ve tried the pivotal systems and all having had little or no success. All of this was true until I found the Gillette Fusion. I have been using the Fusion since it only had 3 blades, and I thought, &amp;#34;It can&#x27;t get any better than this.&amp;#34; Now, several generations later, the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball has wowed me again. This razor is unbelievable. I used this razor for the first time last night and was amazed at how smooth my skin felt. The Flexball system was phenomenal, as it guided the blades around my imperfectly shaped head and face (yes, I shave my head too) without pulling or nicking. As good as the previous Fusion shaving systems were, I could always feel some pulling, get the occasional nick and feel some stubble. Granted I couldn&#x27;t see it, I could still feel it. Well, this morning, my face and head felt like I just shaved this morning, both are still nice and smooth. With the advent of the Gillette Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball, I can only say, &amp;#34;it can&#x27;t get any better than this.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00J2APFMW Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 2 Razor Blade Refills]]Smooth glide I was a little leary about trying this razor but Gillette sent me a trial I put it through it&#x27;s paces and even went sideways and against the grain and no problems it shifted to every contour of my face really a smooth close shave and I do like the edge blade trim feature more blade to trim sideburns and so on. I even waited a few days and did the ultimate test dryshaving with 3 day growth not irritation what so ever! Nice smooth and nick free.</li>
            <li> Gillette has been the only razor brand I&#x27;ve used and by far it shave in dept, leaving my skin silky smooth. With this new product, I am able to shave my mustache a bit smoother. The flexball handle allows me to tilt the head of the razor from side to side which gives a position to shave better.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for this price and my husband really like it  :):):):):):):):):):):):)</li>
            <li> I was quite amazed with this razor, it worked just as it says and it was no hassle at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again from gillette in the future</li>
            <li> This razor is not any better than the regular Gillette razor. The flexball doesn&#x27;t do anything to make my shaving any more smooth. When shaving most strokes are vertical, some horizontal, but nothing that would require a flexball IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Adding a vibrating handle and spacing out the blades slightly would significantly improve shaving results with this product.</li>
            <li> A little while ago Gilette let me try the Fusion Proglide for free. Overall I would say that this razor is a small improvement over its predecessor. After having seen advertising for the product I thought that the FlexBall handle was just a gimmick, but the shave is a bit better with it. Because the blade moves, it feels softer on my face when shaving, and causes a little less irritation. I also like the silver handle, I think it looks pretty cool. Users should not expect an enormous change from the earlier version Gillette Fusion razor, but it is a small step up. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> ...sooner or later, your going to decide what works best for you on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a reluctant user of Fusion blades when the Gillette Excel variety I&#x27;d been satisfied with for many years started becoming harder to find. Over time, I came to prefer them, and although its the refills rather than the razors that strike at the checkout stand, I&#x27;ve been satisfied with \\&quot;Version 1\\&quot; of the Fusion handle since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differentiator here is the \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot;, a spherical pivot between handle and blade holder. During your shave, it moves through several degrees based on the contours of the face part is passing over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not sure a post-shave measurement would show any differences between this and its Version 1 predecessor, overall I feel more confident that the contact with my face is steady and consistent during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of the razor and two refill  blades that ship with it (which will work just fine with the old Fusion handle), it&#x27;s worth checking out for yourself.</li>
            <li> At first, I was very skeptical of another groundbreaking razor by Gillette. I&#x27;ve fallen for the Mach III and the Mach III Turbo and eventually wised up and joined Dollar Shave Club for a fraction of the price. After receiving this razor free from Gillette to try and review, the Dollar Shave Club membership is out the window and I am back on the Gillette bandwagon. Its truly amazing how great this product works and how smooth my face is after a shave. The FlexBall technology allows me to shave the contours of my face without nicking my chin as I used to do on a frequent basis.  I definitely give this product a 5 out of 5 stars and will be purchasing replacement blades soon!</li>
            <li> Love the new flex ball technology it helps a lot going from face to neck an chin and cuts way down on razor burn and really helps with cutting down on cuts an nicks</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch in a promotion through Gillette, I put this razor through its paces. The first time out of the box, it was promptly pitted against a full beard. To my surprise, it sliced through the marshland as if there was no hair at all, and within two minutes, I was pristinely clean-shaven. The Flexball concept was uninteresting to me, and I noticed no difference during the first shave. The next few uses were more everyday type shaves, and I paid special attention to the way it slid across the contours of my face. The subtle lateral movements of the Flexball were unnoticeable until I looked for it -- and it was glorious. My upper lip has not seen so clean a shave in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Flexball technology effortlessly adjusts to your skin&lt;br /&gt;2. Lightweight handle&lt;br /&gt;3. Uses standard Gillette blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Blades moving sideways across skin tends to be dangerous. Use the ball carefully!&lt;br /&gt;2. Relatively fragile. There are a lot of open spaces in the design, and pieces could snap off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a solid product at a decent price that performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Please not that I was given this razor for a reviewing purpose from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Gillette&#x27;s manual razors along with a few electric razors. There&#x27;s no greater feeling in the morning shower than having shaven your face meticulously without certain areas unshaved or unevenly shaved. This newly engineered razor literally glides right onto your face and shave desired area smoothly. This is by far the best manual razor I have found, and I suspect others would think the same. I was always frustrated with not being able to shave underneath-the-chin area, and this has significantly helped me mitigate that issue. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an effective manual razor.</li>
            <li> For a Gillette brand razo this one is what it is expected to be. Although it is not much different from the previous razor from gillette, it is a bit better. The shave is very close and leaves the skin feeling smooth. The grip is comfortable during the entire shave. the flex makes the shave feel smoother and the razor flows easier. because of the thin blades they will need ro be switched frequently. This is a great razor if having the newest is a must, if not then getting another Gillette won&#x27;t be too much of a difference</li>
            <li> I got this razor through Bzzagent to try out for free. The Razor worked out great. The flex ball does help maneuver through my face a little better. This razor shaved well, but not quite as close as other razors that I have tried. However, it got the job done. Most likely will purchase again because of flexball to get to those hard to reach sections on my face.#gotitforfree</li>
            <li> Same great razor, not a huge difference from the normal one</li>
            <li> Greatest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  I was cursed with a bright red rash whenever I shaved until I was given this razor by my wife.  This has changed my life!  Thank you, Carl Juban.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will buy it again for my friends and will look for the upgraded one.</li>
            <li> May be better for men&#x27;s faces than a woman&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> Love Gillette, but I was surprised that this was not to far off from all the others. It does give you a closer shave but the swivel action is not what I was expecting. Over all I would recommend this to friends. The flex ball threw my experience. Was spot on with the closer shave vs the flex ball. #GotItFree #Gillette</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me one of these to try so I got a chance to give it a run recently. After a few shaves, I did notice that it seemed to give a smoother shave than the Mach 3. I think my favorite part of it, though, was the single trimming blade on the back of the cartridge. Edging a goatee or sideburns has never been easier or more precise than this. For that reason alone, I&#x27;d recommend it if you want to try something different but don&#x27;t completely give up on previous iterations of Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> Easy with my psoriasis, very limited to none red bumps on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor from Gillette and had to try it out immediately.  I have used other Gillette brand razors, but this razor definitely felt like a closer shave.  It also didn&#x27;t pull as much so it felt a lot smoother as well.  I would definitely recommend to others, especially if you have used other Gillette razors in the past.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try, and I am pleased with the results. I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, and I&#x27;m not sure how much we really need so many blades.  That being said, it gives a very close and comfortable shave, with minimal tugging.  The lubricated strip is a nice touch, so it makes it easy to shave in the shower.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants the latest technology with their shave.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor to give a whirl from the company and I was so happy they sent it to me! I have heard so many good things about Gillette so of course I expected the newest razor to be nothing less than fabulous. I was right! It gets very close and gives you an extra smooth shave. Overall the product is awesome but it isn&#x27;t much different than the other comparable razors. I also dislike that they only cater these to men. Most razors made for men work just as wonderful for women but I understand why for an advertisement reason they have to differentiate between the razors.&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various Gillette razors for 30+ years, and they do keep getting better. Although almost never an early adopter w consumer goods (i.e., new blade refills always cost a premium!) this newest version shaved really well. It might be the new rotating head or the redesigned blades. This version does glide over my face very well, but no better (IMO) than a fresh Proglide cartridge. Others here are happy with it, so it might just work better for some than others. To reiterate - it is a good shave &amp; so, four stars.    Somehow, the marketing &amp; product testing folks @ Gillette sent me one of these recently, and I&#x27;ve got to say (without having comparison priced it against any other new razor products) it&#x27;s a hit for me.    My recommendation - if you haven&#x27;t tried Gillette&#x27;s latest Fusion Proglide razor, definitely do!</li>
            <li> I have used many razors as I am prior military so shaving and finding a good razor that can continually get the job done and get it done right is hard. I think I may have just found one of the best razors with the Gillette fusion proglide. I have a very sensitive neck and have very thick hair. This razor does a incredible job of working around my neck to reduce redness and cuts by following the contours on my neck and face. I can&#x27;t believe no one has thought of this sooner. I definitely have to thank Gillette for sending me this razor and for stealing me toward this amazing product that will stay in my shave kit for a while.</li>
            <li> I typically just use the cheap, disposable razors to shave, so I was pumped to receive this Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball to review from Gillette. When doing a full shave, my face is noticeably smoother and less cut up, nicked, and bumped. I always seem to be in a hurry so I usually shave pretty quickly without much thought. The fact that this razor does so much of the work for you makes it easy for me to get a great, close shave over all the contours of my face while in a rush and paying little attention. A lot of times, I simply \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; my facial hair rather than shave it all, and this razor has been great at giving my neck a clean shave alone. Since I am comparing this razor to a disposable one, I can&#x27;t be sure that it is a great deal better than more similar competitors, but I certainly have no complaints. As a bonus, this razor looks awesome and high tech and has a very sturdy, high quality feel. I think I&#x27;ll have to splurge on replacement heads for this razor from now on and give up on my disposables.</li>
            <li> Received this item from bzzagent. I really enjoyed this product. It was a smooth shave and was quick. I would recommend this item if you are looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> Another step in the right direction for the Fusion line.  Great shave, super comfy!</li>
            <li> great product gets every hair love it!</li>
            <li> Nice doesn&#x27;t have the vibration like the former model but I like the swivel</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide offers a smooth shave.  It contours to your face and gives a smooth have.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I received my Gillette fusion proglide razor to review. I love the way you can get a nice close cut, leaving you with a smooth shave face. No more bumps aftershave. Wow! Best razor I have ever used, and I will continue to use. I would defiantly recommend this Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor! It does the job right.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a test product from the manufacturer.  Overall I was pleased with the close shave that it provided.  It did take some getting used to this much flexability in a razor.  Once I got past the learning curve, I was able to get a nice close shave without much irritation.  I also used this shaver to do my head and the flexability was great for this.  A decent shaving experience - Thanks!</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. #gotitfree Glides easily over my face. i&#x27;ve noticed less shaving sores and definitely less pain while shaving. The Proglide with Flexball easily maneuvers around the contours of my face and makes shaving each morning less of a hassle. i would definitely recommend this razor to everyone. Especially those, who like me, are forced to shave everyday and who have jaw lines that make reaching every spot difficult.</li>
            <li> When I first received this I wasn&#x27;t to sure what to think about the new flexball technology. It definitely takes some time getting used to it but after you get the hang of it. The razor provides a good and clean shave, I had no problems with irritation and would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> As always, Gillette delivers a decent product.  I shave my head on a regular basis and I like a close shave in as few licks as possible...this one does the job - very well!  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s hiney, just the way I like it.  The caveat is this, Gillette...listen closely:  15 dollars for a four pack of blades is ridiculous!  This is what keeps me looking at the cheapo razors - I save way more money going through a 10 back of those in 2-3 weeks (which do the job excellently well; it just takes longer), than having to shell out that much moolah.  Seriously, how about instead of coming out with a new kind of &#x27;handle&#x27; every year, we come up with a razor refill that doesn&#x27;t make me cringe and want to try to slit my wrists with one of the cheap ones?</li>
            <li> You have to love the ball! The new flexball design truly outshines the prior products. You may have seen the add during the WorldCup. Gillette outdid themselves with this one. I am able to reach all the nooks on my faceg and I am left with a smooth and youthful sensation after each shave. Great job, Gillette. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have a beard, but I still do a lot of shaving. I shave my neck, and head, and usually my upper lip about twice a week. Then there&#x27;s the man-scaping...Gotta keep my lady happy. Pits, man-parts, wierd sparse upper arm hair...etc. In the Florida heat a man with jungle pits is a smelly man and I&#x27;m not down with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually someone who uses modern cartridge razors. I made the switch some time ago to the old school Double Edge Safety Razor style of shaver because of the lower cost. I could go on to extoll the virtues of that shaving method but that&#x27;s not why we&#x27;re here. I had the good fortune to try the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Silvertouch Power Razor recently when Gillette sent me one to review, (hereafter referred to as the GFPGSTPR - Fire the guy who named this thing...seriously.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need not have brought practice or skill or attention. I shaved everything I had to offer with it and despite my misgivings it worked absolutely wonderful. No nicks, not even razor burn, not on my most sensitive bits, and really no effort whatsoever. As this thing buzzed away and I removed my fur I honestly was amazed. With a DE razor, there&#x27;s a fine line between an awesome shave and blood, you&#x27;re skating the edge and you better be paying attention. I could have been asleep with this GFPGSTPR (lol) and I would have woken up with a nice stubble free shave. I don&#x27;t really think I could have cut myself on it if I tried. It digested the fuzz on the crown of my head where it grows in a spiral without a problem. I actually got a closer shave on my neck than usual too. Most guys don&#x27;t know this nowadays, but to get the closest possible shave you are supposed to do it three times in three different directions. With the grain, across the grain, against the grain, refreshing your lather each time. On my neck, in the middle, the hair grain grows out to the sides, toward my shoulders, and usually if I try shaving that with my DE I&#x27;ll end up with cuts, its just plain unwieldy and not worth it so I usually skip it. Just for kicks I gave it a spin with the GFPGSTPR. It&#x27;s really the ultimate test I could think of. Slick as butter, really really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am glad I tried this thing? Yes and no. Heck yeah, was fun and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I got the boys so slippppery smooth. Will I buy refills? No, I will not, and that makes me kinda sad. Why won&#x27;t I? Same reason I stopped using cartridge razors to begin with. I have 6 kids, three of them in various lessons, two of them with disabilities, and a wife staying home with the kids and trying to take online classes. I really just can&#x27;t afford to buy these things on a regular basis. However, YOU should buy them. Chances are most people reading this have more wiggle room in their budget than I do for performance grooming. And let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re buying this thing you&#x27;re looking for a premium shaving experience anyway. You&#x27;re looking for the best and most convenient shave money can buy and in my opinion you found it. If you&#x27;re a basketball player, you&#x27;ll love this thing, it looks like one of your shoes. You couldn&#x27;t drop it if you wanted to. You can quote me on that, but I can&#x27;t guarantee it. Seriously, the handle is just crazy with rubber nubs and stubs and whirls, and it&#x27;s definitely well designed and constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a great way to shave, if you can afford it. Especially if you have narcolepsy, or are visually impaired or looking for something to complement your current shaving method for the more tender haireas. Knowing how Gillette is, this thing probably has titanium blades that will last way longer than most other solutions too, so you don&#x27;t really end up replacing them as often. I LOVED the shave from the Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Silvertouch Power Razor, and you will too.</li>
            <li> The I received the Gillette fusion proglide from gillette an i have to say its the best shave I have had since I&#x27;ve been shaveing no cuts the ball moves around my face. Like no others out of 1 to 10 10 +</li>
            <li> Since i started to shave, i always had a problem, my skin would always be red and very irritated, even with multiple kinds and brands of shaving cream. I purchased the previous version of this Proglide and that was the first razor that made my skin feel better. Ever since, i have been using the proglide until i received this version with Flexball from Gillette. It feels great on your skin. The Flexball was a great addition. It definitely gets more of your hair and leaves it feeling really good. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! best razor I have ever owned! I recieved this from Gillette and love it, this razor is soo smooth it literally glides across my face and skull since I shave my head as well as face I havent met a bit of resistance in using it for a week daily I will buy only refills for this for ever I used to rely on disposables or cheap drug store brand razors but wow the flexball fusion changed my mind!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette fusion with flexball to try. This is amazing. Never had a razor shave my face like this one does. It is so smooth and no try to go the different directions as you shave. I would recommend this razor among all of the razors. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Have you ever shaved your face using a stick of butter? I haven&#x27;t, but I can very easily imagine what it feels like to do so. It feels smooth like the sharp blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor with the flexball handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical? I was too. Well, I&#x27;ve dealt with razor burn for my entire post-puberty life and there has never really been a way for me to avoid at least a small breakout... Until now. The smoothness of the shave that you get out of this razor is above and beyond what most razors can even dream of accomplishing these days. The best part though, is that with this new razor, I don&#x27;t get any breakouts related to razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a little more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball handle is heavy, but well-balanced to the point where it&#x27;s extremely comfortable to hold and shave with. The new flexball technology that has been added to the handle makes it extremely flexible and allows you to easily get to a few of those harder-to-reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades of the Gillette Fusion Proglide are as sharp as ever, and this is key to avoiding razor burn. With dull razors, people with sensitive skin are much more prone to breakouts. It&#x27;s hard to find razors that are dependable and consistent in quality, but Gillette has always been a major player in the razor-game and can easily be relied upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the Lubrastrips that are installed on the head of the razor blades provide an extremely smooth shave, whereas cheaper, disposable razors usually leave you with razor burn and stubble due to a lack of lubrication that shaving cream just doesn&#x27;t cover. The strips add so much to a shave, that you only really notice when they start to wear off or when you use a razor that simply doesn&#x27;t provide them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball technology is a reliable razor that provides a consistently smooth shave. No longer do I have to suffer with breakouts caused by dull or cheap razors. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor, I implore you to at least give this Proglide a shot. I was certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received a free product from Gillette for my review, All thoughts are my own. I do not work for, or with, the brand mentioned in this article, nor do I have any official relationship with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was sure I would love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor because of it&#x27;s 5 Blades and battery operated push button vibration and a flexball head. Straight out of the box I was in awe over it&#x27;s shape and features! It did give a very smooth shave, But I really did not care for this product. While I was shaving it felt as if it was pulling at my facial hair, and the blade kept clogging with hair. Though I do use other Gillette razors and was very pleased with their performance. I also use cheap disposable razors, and with neither disposable nor other Gillette razors do I feel my facial hair being pulled nor do they clog with hair. I am not a hairy guy, I have very little facial hair even without shaving for weeks at a time. So for those guys out there who are &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34;, I would feel for you using this product. Although this is just my take on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor. I mean the product looks like it would work great with it&#x27;s flexball head and vibration, you would think the product would be top notch. But in my case I am unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product. It has several blades and makes my skin irritate faster than my standard 3 blade razor. I can say something good is the ball does make the shaving go faster.</li>
            <li> Great blades, that don&#x27;t last and are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> yeah im a baldy and this works great. ive used dollar shave club and this blad is waaaay better.</li>
            <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Shaves very smoothly!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the $$!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Like most razors these days, the Gilette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology gives a great smooth shave.  But could I tell a difference between it and the other razors I&#x27;ve used?  Nope.  I shaved the same as I always do and got the same result.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch in the mail. I had a nice stubble on m face, so i needed a good shave. I was kind of hesitant to use the razor because I normally use an electric razor. The ProGlide really does glide across your face, The one thing that I was concerned about that I usually get from razors are RAZOR BUMPS and that did not happen with the ProGlide Silvertouch, even after a few days of not shaving. I think the five blades had a lit to do with that. I like the way it feels in my hands and the blade on the back to edge up my stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is in need of a good razor.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades work well together to provide a nice, close shave. There is good spacing between each of the blades. Other razors that I have used had blades that were way too close together (e.g. Quattro). This would result in hairs getting jammed in between blades, which would render the razor useless until I used tweezers to remove them. The Fusion doesn&#x27;t have this problem.  The 5 blades also cuts down the time it takes to shave with 3 blade razors (e.g. Mach3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head is also a nice feature. It has two benefits. The flex allows the razor to contour to your face for a closer shave. It also helps prevent cuts since it makes the razors give a little instead of applying all the pressure onto your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle has good weight to it but is by no means heavy. Feels like a well built, sturdy and durable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. Better than anything I have used in the past. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer* Received the product from Gillette to test</li>
            <li> The future of shavers...or maybe close to it. From razor user to razor user I would like to let you know that this razor is so far the best I&#x27;ve used. After using it two times over a two weeks times span, since my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast, it&#x27;s given me a great shave without having to look over twice to make sure I got every hair like I usually do with my other razors. With the flex ball handle it truly does go with the contour of your face which really helps in getting every hair minus the cuts. This is one item I would definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li> this is decent razor and I like the flexball it allows for a closer shave with out any nicks. This razor has very comfortable blades that do not tug on the skin. I would repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this item was sent to me for review purposes</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I used Gillette Proglide razors frequently.  When I tested out this version, I kept to my original routine.  The result?  It is just as good and reliable as all the other razors from Gillette that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the flexball really does help to get around those difficult spots that I always seem to have trouble with.  This includes areas of my jaw and chin.  It shifts the razor when going over those areas, so it provides a close and even shave without much hassle.  The flexball is a feature on the razor that allows the head to pivot depending on the position on your face.  Definitely worth getting over the regular proglides, you will notice the difference which translates into ease of use.  4 stars, easily recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for the past ten years, and have seen the gradual evolution of the Fusion line. I&#x27;ve actually found most of the &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; to be worthwhile (despite my cynicism towards marketing), especially the battery-powered microvibrations. Those vibes definitely give a closer shave for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not so on boars with Flexball. I gave this razor a solid two weeks of use and don&#x27;t find the extra pivoting to make much of a difference. And since this manual razor does not have the vibrations, I find the shave to be far inferior to what I get from my Gillette Proglide Styler. Luckily, the Flexball cartridge works on the Styler.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t usually shave very often, I received this razor in the mail from Gillette and lately it&#x27;s been getting warmer around here so I decided it&#x27;s time to remove the beard. After trimming I grabbed my Gillette fusion proglide razor and went to town. This razor is awesome and the smoothest shave I have ever had. No nics or cuts the flexball handle is no gimmick it really helped with the shave and the curvature of my face and neck. We liked it so much my wife now uses it instead of her last razors.  It&#x27;s that great</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor from Gillette last month and I must say that it is truly the king of razors!  The flexball technology really helps increase flexibility and coverage to get that smooth, clean shave without missing hairs which is always embarrassing!  I usually always struggle with my neck region and this razor did the job!  Honestly, the only thing that bothered me was the color scheme...Orange &amp; Blue??? YUCK! GO VANDALS!</li>
            <li> Received this as a trial from Gillette, so far I have only good things about this product. It makes it easier to shave, faster, and smooth. I would recommend this shaver especially for people who do designs or any type of artistic stuff with their facial hair. The Flexball makes it very easy to maneuver for smooth curves for any design. This razor allows me to shave a lot quicker since i am able to move smoothly around edges. Its basically a more comfortable, efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new razor in years and I am so happy I was able to try this razor out. I got it from the company to try out and I works perfectly. You never miss a spot because of the flex ball and you always get a close shave. So much better than a normal razor! My roommates even bought one as well because of how great I thought it was.</li>
            <li> I received the fusion proglide from Gillette to sample and review. The flexball gave a very close shave and stayed smooth for a full 48 hours before I noticed any stubble. I used this razor with my Gillette shaving cream for even better results. I would definitely recommend this razor to others.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silverglode and I must say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it! I used the Gilletr Proglide razors before but always seemed to miss facial hair.. Not now it&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li> I have been a strong user and supporter of the Schick Hydra until I saw this and had to try it.  The way the razor moves around the jawbone and Adams apple is phenomenal.  No more cuts and toilet paper on the face.  Would have given it a five stars, but the  blades have not advanced.  Still like the feel of the Hydra, but the Proglide is so easy to use.  I will stick with it and hope the blades grow on me.</li>
            <li> I have used the Fusion that I have for a number of years and have really enjoyed it.  The blades work very well and I am always impressed with the results.  So, when I heard of an improvement, I had to try it out.  While the blades are just as good, the flex head is hard for me to get used to.  The way I shave is by putting my index finger right where the flex head is located.  By me doing this, it takes away any advantage of the new tech, and changing my shaving habits has shown to be more difficult than you would think.  It is still a great product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who already owns a Fusion.</li>
            <li> It was nice and comfortable, the blades dulled pretty fast but other than that it was good! No real complaints!</li>
            <li> The best way to shave, Superfast!</li>
            <li> Good razor for the money and a product that only Gillette could deliver.  Tried many other different brands in the past and nothing compares to quality and durability of Gillette brand of razors.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Razor with Flexball Technology to try free, complimentary of Gillette. I am a huge fan of this razor! I&#x27;ve always loved Gillette razor and blades, they provide a smooth, clean, close shave every time. The Flexball Technology really sets this blade apart because it allows the blade to closely hug the skin no matter where you are shaving. By being able to contour, it provides a close shave that virtually gets every hair because of the maximum contact of the blade and your skin. The lubrastrip keeps everything smooth so you get the closest shave possible. It&#x27;s a great razor that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;TS LIKE ANT RAZOR..</li>
            <li> I got it on time and it looks the same way it looks in the pictures!</li>
            <li> I am a woman, and this is the best razor I have ever used in my life to shave body hair. I honestly have no idea why they only market this razor to men&#x27;s faces when they could sell double as many of them by also marketing this product to women who need to shave body hair. DO NOT waste your money on stupid women&#x27;s razors like I foolishly did for so long before being recommended a men&#x27;s razor by a friend. If this razor is designed to prevent nicking and doesn&#x27;t cut you up at all, why would you need an any more sensitive razor? This is the one to buy, and instead of buying a ton of razors and throwing them all away, a great part about this razor is that you can just buy more heads and replace them every few weeks. If you are a lady who shaves leg, arm, or any body hair, just look past the stupid marketing and buy this razor as well as a couple of razor heads, because you are not going to look back once you buy this.</li>
            <li> Is it just me - or does every time Gillette leaves a response - it always seems snarky and condescending?  Like they are talking down to you/us.  All these shavers are goofy - 50 million blades, lubricating, bends, curves, turns, flexes, blah blah blah.    The best shaves were with the simplest razors...MAYBE a double blade, and not all that movement---you had more control that way and got a closer shave - these razors with all these dumb features are getting goofy already and a hassle and just gimmicks.    All these features are actually making it harder to get a REAL close shave.    KEEP IT SIMPLE!</li>
            <li> I was and still am impressed with this razor and how it works. This is definitely worth the price, because I ended up paying a little less than in store. The pricing was good, the package came on time, it was in excellent condition, and it still works great.</li>
            <li> This razor moves well around all the curvatures of your face and chin. Real comfortable shave. Blades are very sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the razor and it was easy to clean. He had been using an electric razor for years now so He was worried it wouldn&#x27;t stand up against what He was used to. It was a close shave without irritation and he loved it!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the design and I have to admit, its the most comfortable razor I have ever used.  It gave me an excellent shave.  However, given the price of the blades, it was an expensive shave.  Most guys I know have kids to feed and bills to pay.  As difficult as times are, there isn&#x27;t a lot of extra cash left over for razor blades.  Great shaves are not that difficult to achieve and there are great quality blades out there for much less money.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide from Gillette itself did a good job. I was smooth and clean when I got finished shaving. I have been using a battery powered razor for years and I have gotten very spoiled with those. It just felt a little different cutting while not vibrating. I still enjoyed it tho!</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design right off the bat. It was easy to get out of the package and znc I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials. I used the Gillette shaving gel and put this bad boy to the test and boy did it deliver! It easily shaved around the curvature of my face with ease. I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor. The swivel handle helped with being able to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face shaved evenly. Usually I have to shave over my face several times before it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face but I was able to shave over just once and it got nearly all of it. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several days now and it gets the job done shaves smooth and close</li>
            <li> (Below review is done by my Husband):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor from the company. My favorite razor was previously the regular Gillette Fusion. This new razor has an extra pivoting action that allows the razor to get into the hard to reach corners while shaving. It definitely gave me a closer shave than my previous Gillette Fusion. The design is sleek and comfortable to hold in your hand. I also love that I can use my old Fusion cartridges on this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the improvements with this razor. I will definitely keep using it and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works good, not great. Still multiple passes to shave. Not as ground breaking as the commercials make out.</li>
            <li> Truly cant give enough stars! I am loving the smooth, super close shave that this razor provides. The handle itself is sturdy and not hard on the eyes at all! The new flexball technology blew my mind. This needs to become a staple on all razors. The precision razor does just that, gets you real close where you need it. No need to go over the same spot, one pass is enough! I plan on making this razor a staple in my bathroom! I did receive this razor from Gillette but this doesn&#x27;t sway me at all. I am truly impressed with this razor and the functionality.</li>
            <li> I get this Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor for FREE from Gillette and I absolutely love it.  It gives me a close, nice shave and my wife tells me that I have a smooth face and I look good after I shave with it.  That&#x27;s the truth!  This is the best razor that I have seen in a VERY long time.  I like how this razor tilts and rides with the contour of your face and jaw bones, etc.  I highly recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for a great razor.  I have tried many different razors in the past from some of the more basic Gillette&#x27;s to Shick and everything else and I have never been satisfied, until I tried this razor and unsurpassed, hands down this is the best razor ever.  My wife loved what this razor has done to my face that she has decided to &#x27;borrow&#x27; it to shave her legs with it!  I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for an unbeatable close shave!</li>
            <li> The flex ball is just not a gimmick it actually does work the way it says it does and I have to say that this is the closest shave I have had in years.  As well it out performed my other razor that I received from Gillette just a year ago and I have to say you can color me impressed.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome Razor, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor about a week ago to try it out! I&#x27;ve used Gillette before and other razors as well, this razor was by far the smoothest yet! Usually I get rough stubs after I shave, But using this Razor I can rub forwards or backwards and its baby smooth! The flex ball is a unique feature that took a short amount of time to get used too but It turned out to be awesome. I had no skin irritation with this Razor at all. Way to go Gillette on another fine product!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good razor. I didn&#x27;t get hardly any cuts &amp; it is maneuvers easily. I can&#x27;t believe how great it is.</li>
            <li> So much easier to shave with honestly...i was waiting for this!!</li>
            <li> Got a free sample of this razor from Gilette. Overall it is an awesome razor. Shaves very close and smooth. It does actually seem to glide over my skin even after 2 days growth. Gets in all the nooks and crannies nicely with the pivoting ball. Sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I don&#x27;t even use shaving cream, just wash my face and leave it wet, and this razor does a super job.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. SUCH A VERY SMOOTH AND THROUGH SHAVE. WOULDNT TRADE IT FOR NO OTHER.</li>
            <li> Most amazing piece of technology for men on the market. It is extremely magnificent. I have never had a better shave than with this product. I extremely recommend it to my family and peers.</li>
            <li> When I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silver touch manual razor found it to be a good razor. I especially liked it when shaving my neck did its job with no cuts. I have beard and it was easy to shave where I needed to shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion has always been my preferred choice in razors and they are constantly improving the design for ease of use.  It is easier to shave with the contour of all body parts when the head of the razor moves easily.  I received the Gillette Fusion for free from Gillette to review but the above opinions are my own and in now way influenced.</li>
            <li> I am happy to try this Razor. I loved this razor than the old one that i am using.I did not cut myself at all even in those hard to shave places on my neck and lips i love the way the razor pivots to go with the curves of my face and will be switching to this as my new razor of choice.I am happy that i received this product for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s move side to side! Whoop, Gillette always puts out great products and they just got even better! I normally buy their razors and product however, I received this for free from Gillette and am reviewing this product for them!  This makes shaving even less of a hassle. It flows so well with each bend. The handle feels durable and over a very durable product. I would have given it 5 stars unfortunately I do not have the burliest of beards and cannot say that this would be pristine for something more dense due to its pivoting nature it might miss some of the places that need  a little bit more pressure.    Would definitely recommend! Buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> Gelette sent me this product free of charge and it is a great razor, gives a nice close shave, the flex ball works well. This product is an improvement to the original pro glide. It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Received this from Gillette for a trial. This is one of the closes shaves I ever had. I used it for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t get any irritation. I usually shave every other day and with this blade my face always felt smooth. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. A big step from the mach 5 razor. Gillette has the future razors. Very good product.</li>
            <li> My husband tried this razor through a Bzz campaign and absolutely loved it! He said even his norelco electric razor didn&#x27;t give such a close shave. Smooth skin and lasts for longer. He doesn&#x27;t have to shave as often with the Gillette Fusion razor. Definitely recommend this razor. Who doesn&#x27;t want to skip a day of shaving?</li>
            <li> Smooth, close shave, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The razor seems to work about as well as the Fusion without the Flexball.  The biggest problem is handling the thing: The metal handle is too heavy, and the handle has to many smooth surfaces.  Both contribute to difficulty using the razor without dropping it.  Until this problem is solved, I will be using the regular Fusion with the plastic handle and rubber surfaces.</li>
            <li> Prior to receiving this razor directly from Gillette, I was excited to try it out because I have hair that grows at weird angles on my throat area.  While I did find that this razor followed the contours on my jaw line and throat much better than most every other razor I have used, I was not impressed with the blades.  Now I don&#x27;t know if it is actually the blades, or if they are placed at a different angle than they are on other products, but I did not find this razor giving me a comfortable shave.  I applaud the concept of the roller ball, but cannot really recommend this as opposed to some other razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new Gillette Fusion razor for about a month now and wanted to compare it to multiple razors before reviewing.  I am a razor fanatic and have tried many razors from Battery Powered razors to regular old school 2 blade disposable razors.  I would say out of all the razors I have tried thus far, this razor is the best of everything thus far.  It shaves effortlessly and minimizes razor bumps noticeably.  It also seems that the lubricating strip is not leaking or just wiping away after a few uses, making it last much longer and provide a smoother shave overall.  I have also been using the previous generation fusion razor which is also very good, and I wouldn&#x27;t say that this razor is a large improvement if any improvement at all.  I think the ball is a gimmick because there really isn&#x27;t any side pressure given to a razor unless you are slicing your face.  If it was less rigid with it&#x27;s side motion it might be useful but I think it is useless other than marketing with the current design. The blades do seem to pull less than the fusion however and I think the improvement is marginal but good.  Overall, I would say the new blades are better but the actual razor itself is overkill and unnecessary if you already have a fusion razor.  My only complaint is the razors are getting a little ridiculous on the cost side and I&#x27;m tempted to go back to a foil razor again to see if I can save some money on expensive cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very good product and an improvement over all the razors before it.  I will probably purchase more of these cartridges as well as look for a cheaper alternative in the mean time.</li>
            <li> This is a Great razor. If you have been cut by razors in the past.. you owe it to yourself to try this razor it really conforms to your face so you are less likely to get cut.</li>
            <li> Save your money. This razor does not work as well as the Trac ll version and costs quite a bit more. Trying to shave your chin with the large head design is not easy. It does a nice job on the sides of your face, but in the chin area it gets very more marks.</li>
            <li> I have a very angular face and I found the pivot head extremely easy to control and easier to move about my face. I have always been a fan of Gillette Fussion and when I was offered a free Proglide Silvertouch to try I jumped on the chance! This is a must have razor for any man with a chin and cheek bones, you do not have to be a contortionist to shave your face anymore.</li>
            <li> This is my first review, so bear with me.    First of all, I wanted to say that I received this product a few weeks ago for free from Gillette. Since I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a couple weeks now, I figured I&#x27;d had enough time under my belt to give it a proper review. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t make notes of the packaging prior to throwing it away, so there&#x27;s nothing I can really write about in that regard. However, I do remember my first impression of the razor, and I have to say, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; This razor has a great metal design, and, in my opinion, very eye catching. I was intrigued by the ball design, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it lived up to the hype. More on this later.    I&#x27;m a big fan of a hefty razor, and I thoroughly enjoy the weight of this one in my hand. This feels much sturdier than a typical razor, and you can tell that they wanted to put this in another class. I&#x27;ve used safety razors in the past, and when using a safety razor, you want a light touch and loose grip so as not to put much pressure on the skin, which results in nicks and cuts. That technique translates quite well with the Proglide Silvertouch.    Now, on to the shave.    I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I use the Art of Shaving lavender pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and badger hair brush. I built up a week of beard growth to give this a proper test. After my pre-shave routine, it was time to unleash this razor and see what it could do. First thoughts, the weight of the razor, in combination with good technique, feels great against the skin. My neck is pretty sensitive when it comes to shaving, but I had no issues here. One thing I noticed, the proglide strip, in combination with my pre-shave oil and shaving cream, was too goopy for my liking. I wouldn&#x27;t knock any stars off of the review, as I&#x27;m sure without the oil, it would be a non-issue.    As for the flexball head, I normally have issues around my jawline, and have to make a few passes to get a proper shave. With the flexball head, however, Ihad no problems getting the hair on the first pass. This is exciting for me, as normally my skin gets irritated with multiple passes and I always dread the jawline. I would say that the head really did contour for maximum contact. Score one for Gillette. The precision razor on the back is the same as I&#x27;ve experienced with previous Gillette razors. No improvement there.    Overall, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the best razor that I&#x27;ve ever used. After two weeks, this razor is still treating me right, and is as great a shave as the first time. Then again, I only shave two times a week. This razor really does live up to the hype, and I&#x27;m very happy with the decision to get it. I&#x27;d say my relationship with shaving has turned into love/love, as opposed to love/hate. Cudos to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Pro Glide with FlexBall Handle Technology free from Gillette as part of a promotion and really love it.  I can&#x27;t believe the close shave I am getting- virtually every single hair is easily eliminated.  The FlexBall Technology allows for maximum contact, while the super thin blades literally glide over my skin. As a result, it takes less strokes to get the results I want.  I also like the Lubrastrip which is infused with mineral oil and leaves me feeling soft and smooth without nicks and cuts. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have to buy new, gimmicky things, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  Works amazingly well.  I cancelled my dollar shave club membership because I can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> This razor is another great step in Gillette&#x27;s innovative product line. It provides my shave experience with a natural motion and contours to areas of my face that I previously had challenges with. I also find that my wife is a big fan of this razor and the quality of shave she gets when shaving her legs. While this is not marketed to the female demographic, it is also a great buy for the ladies! Overall a very good product and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was a good razor, but it definitely was not the best. I dont know if I would spend the money on it.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try from Bzz Agent. At first I was a bit worried the handle would be too heavy, but it was very easy to maneuver. The Flex Ball technology made this razor easy to move around the face even on the chin area where it can sometimes be difficult. It also gave a very close shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and the lubricating strip is still working pretty well without getting gooey. Overall a good razor and experience.</li>
            <li> The system looks interesting and definitely helps men have a smoother shave experience. However, the quality of the product disappointed me. It&#x27;s true that you are buying a low end razor and shouldn&#x27;t expect much. But for Gillette, if they will be making tons of $$ selling cartridges over the years, in my opinion it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for them to use better quality materials on the razor, so it lasts as long as possible and more than just feel, also LOOK good.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try to try  the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology provided by Gillette products.  Like the weight of the Razor is light and handle technology was different from other I tried. I liked the 5 fine Blades and the shaving was smooth. One of the neat things I did not break out it is truely for sensitive skin that is a Big plus for me. I would recommend for others to try it.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Gets the job done.  Definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 2 Razor Blade Refills&lt;br /&gt;It says two refills, but Mine came with one loaded and one refill.  To me, that&#x27;s one refill!  Anyhow, this is a good shaving razor!  Better than the cheap throwaways I normally use.  I&#x27;m kinda cheap when it comes to razor replacements and this may move me away from using disposables.  Nice!</li>
            <li> The  best razor on the planet</li>
            <li> Yay, love my new razor.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd razor in my life. Both have been Gillette.They rock.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best Men&#x27;s razor I have ever used. It gives me the closest and cleanest shave I can get and is very easy to handle due to the flexball handle technology. I would definitely recommend this Gillette product to one and all.</li>
            <li> Works very well. It&#x27;s hard to quantify how necessary the flexball system is, but there&#x27;s nothing to complain about here.</li>
            <li> Best shave you can get.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t they invent this earlier! A fantastic shaver and this is coming from a guy who pays entirely too much for shaving products at The Art of Shaving!</li>
            <li> I have never had a smoother, closer or more comfortable razor.  I now have to shave only twice a week! Yay.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mach 3 for a decade or more. I&#x27;ve tried other razors as they came out but none came close. That is util I tried this razor. I have thiick course hairs and this is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used that cuts all of the hairs all of the way on the first pass. The flex technology makes shaving so much more simple... I&#x27;m going to give these away as Xmas gifts so all of my family/friends can try them .</li>
            <li> This is a very good shave.  Time will tell how many good shaves you get before it gets dull.</li>
            <li> The ball mounted head is a total gimmick, no real benefit over the standard fusion proglide</li>
            <li> Super razor.  Best my husband ever used.</li>
            <li> Gillette provided me with one of these to test for them. It&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that it was simply a gimmick to add some dazzle to their product line, but I was in for a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; seems to be engineered about right -- flexible enough to follow contours effortlessly but stiff enough for precise trimming around facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is easy to grip, especially when wet, and has an ideal weight.&lt;br /&gt;They stuck with their 5+1 blade cartridge that routinely last 3+ months, making it very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this represents engineering excellence in effortless, precise shaving.</li>
            <li> I’m a heavy razor user because I shave my head. I have used many different type/brands of razors including other models from Gillette but by far the Gillette Fusion Proglide with FlexBall Handle is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving your head everyday can be tiresome and most of the times all I wanted to do is to get it done as soon as possible so many times I don’t position the razor correctly and accidentally cuts myself when gliding diagonally. The FlexBall Handle helps to avoid those accidental cuts perfectly.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little puzzled with my new Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with Flexball handle. Side to side flexing action huh?? Well I gave it a try and it made a believer out of me! My previous razor was also a Gillette product so I knew quality would not be in question, but this new functionality might. My initial reaction once I started shaving was that I was doing it wrong. Not sure how I could be doing something wrong that I&#x27;ve been doing the same way for over 20 years. Well it wasn&#x27;t that I was wrong, it&#x27;s that I was not used to the Flexball handle. As it swivels from side to side to follow the contours of your face I kept thinking the razor head was detaching. Quite the opposite in that this razor has a very sturdy feel to it with great grip on the handle. So after a few minutes I adjusted to the head as it swayed as needed. Since it adjusted to my face as I shaved I found myself having to readjust the way I was holding the razor much less than usual. It could actually now reach the areas with ease that I previously had to compensate for. As far as the blades go, they were of top level precision that I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette over the years, including the single blade on the back side which made touching up sideburns a breeze. So I definitely give this razor a 5 out of 5 for form, function, and quality. If you try it I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll agree!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the shave I got with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with fireball. I would recommend it. I got a close shave the side to side pivot was a bit weird at first but got use to it. My wife has stolen it because she loves how good it works on her legs. The only down side I found was the price. I found it from 11.50 to 15.00 and that seems very high for a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Best razor they have ever made</li>
            <li> Simply the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, electric or manual. It conforms perfectly to my face with each stroke. The search for the perfect razor? It&#x27;s officially over. This is worth every penny, and then some.</li>
            <li> HATE this razor. I accidentally purchased this item instead of the Gillette Mach3 razor (which i love) and i was left with so many razor bumps!!! I used it several times and each time i tried different &amp;#34;techniques&amp;#34; to avoid getting bumps but i still ended up with them. i will never buy this one again! I will stick to the mach3</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;The best razor i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I tried several of the cheap alternatives and finally came back to Gillette.  They make be pricey, but the quality is just far better than anything else.</li>
            <li> I was provided this product to try.  My job requires that I shave daily, which often leads to rough dry skin.  The lubrication strip was great, however did not have the life span of the blades.  I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the closeness of my shave, however, I did see that the hair took longer to grow in again - no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test by the Manufacturer. It has been one of the best manual razors I have used in a while. I sometime don&#x27;t shave everyday... even every two days....  this razor has been great for me..</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor from Gillete and I was able to shave with it once or twice before it disappeared! I think I made a mistake when I told my wife how much I liked how smooth my face was, how it followed the contours of my face really well and did a good job of getting to the harder to reach areas without having to completely contort my face. The next time I went to shave the razor was gone! My wife had a big smile when I asked her if she&#x27;d seen my Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle. She said, yes, she had taken it to try it out. Then she told me that I needed to go get myself one because she wasn&#x27;t giving it back to me. She loved how close the shave was and how the lubricating strips made shaving her legs easy and smooth. So thanks Gillette you now have 2 people in my house that love this razor!</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best razor i have ever used! It got every single hair very easily and was very smooth. The flexball is great! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This razor is so awesome!  I love that it flows nicely around all the curves in my neck and face!  It is such a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I love the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexable Handle Technology. I got my Razor from Gillette, and I think it&#x27;s amazing that Gillette has come up with a razor with a flexable handle. It allows for me to get a better shave and it curves to my face. I have a hard time shaving and I am always looking for something new or better to help me. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this razor. I am very excited about it and like how my face feels.</li>
            <li> How many blades does a razor need? I used to think that three was more than enough and have been a Mach 3 user since they came out. I resisted the urge to go the five blade for a while thinking it was overkill. After using the Fusion Proglide, I now can say that five blades is the way to go. The only down side is that the size of the head makes it a little tougher to get right up under my nose. I have a very thick beard and if I go more than a day, shaving can be a little painful but not with this bad boy. Cuts through the beard without any problem and the blades last. I&#x27;ve used the original for about a month now and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette a month ago and have been using it since day 1.  I love the fact that the razor head can move with the contour of my face.  The lubricant strip makes the razor glide so easily and the 3 blades get all of the hairs on my face.  I would recommend this to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> From a blade perspective, this razor is comparable to multi-blade devices.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better, or closer, than the others and, possibly a bit worse, actually, than other razors.  The pivot thing is a bit of a gimmick, but I will say the area under my lip and above my chin was cut closer on the first swipe than what I experience normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, no complaints, but no great reason to go buy it over anything else, either.</li>
            <li> Gillette has always been my go to brand for razors and I received the Proglide razor with the new flexball technology from Gillette to try recently. The idea of what the razor is supposed to do was better then the actual feel of the razor although it definitely was somewhat better shaving around the corners of my jaw. I have been using the proglide power prior to trying this new razor. Overall I would recommend this new razor if you have more sensitive skin to cuts and are looking to try something new. You cant go wrong with gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a trial from Gillette and have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack opened easily and included the razor with two cartridges, one that was already connected and an extra one in the rack found on the back of the razor holder where you can place that can hold up to five cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I lifted the razor I could feel the quality. It had an extremely comfortable weight, feeling light enough to control and heavy enough to maintain sturdiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball handle also surprised me, in a good sense. I assumed that it would swivel around loosely and almost uncontrollably however  allow the razor to easily respond to contours of the face while maintaining sturdiness where desired. It is not flimsy. It is smooth and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, you can use any &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34; razor blade on this razor, yet the blades that were supplied in this pack were by far the smoothest and most efficient I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an extremely well made razor that I would highly recommend for shavers of all types and a good enough buy for the price, especially on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you are a woman looking to buy a present for a man in your life, they would be VERY GLAD to own this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to have helped</li>
            <li> I recently received a freebie Gillette-Proglide-Silvertouch-Flexball razor from Gillette for testing. It uses the same 5 bladed Pro Glide cartridges that are used in my pro fusion.  I loved the metal handle on the flexball razor. More importantly, I loved the way it shaved.  While the movement of the ball, at least for me, is more subtle, as you actually shave, I found myself avoiding many of the usual movements and contortions I go through to get a close, clean or safe shave and got that close shave quicker, easier and faster with this razor. I loved it.  I think Gillette really scored an improvement here instead of just a marketing ploy. I would buy this razor.</li>
            <li> I started using these Gillette razors recently. I am very happy with how these work compared to other past razors I have used. They are definitely smooth, and great quality razors that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette I was thoroughly impressed with the overall. It was easy to get out of the package. I put the razor to the test and boy did it deliver! I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials.  I  did not experience any cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several days now and it gets the job done shaves smooth and close. I would definantely recommend this razor!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it shaves my beard off very smoothly. I am a daily shaver who needs a close-to-skin tight shave, and I was excited to try this out. My chin area is shaved far cleaner than other Gillette or Harry&#x27;s razors I used to use (Harry&#x27;s has a subpar quality razor blades in the first place in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I like how close the shave is and how smooth my skin feels afterwards. Would recommend. Thanks for letting me try this product Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try my new razor.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews and thought I would check out what all the hype was.&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time working with such a large handle.  Usually, I use disposable 3 blade plastic razor which have a much thinner and more square handle.  Maneuvering around with such a clunky handle was awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an edge on the reverse side for squaring off sideburns which I feel didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s potential.  I was unable to get a clean line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever, I did enjoy the smooth shave I received from this razor.  It glides quite smoothly across your face.  The swivel head let me reach spots I&#x27;ve always found hard to get a clean shave using a regular disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be very interested in how many shaves I can get from the initial blade.</li>
            <li> the swivel handle allowed me to get to some of the harder contours of my face. i generally get bumps from most razors this one i did not get any bumps from. it left my face very smooth and the shave was very close. this is by far the best razor i have used</li>
            <li> This worked well for me much better than disposables a lot less cuts and smooth shave, plus free refills. I am a bzz agent and I received the product free to try from the brand company. The ball technology didnt make much of a difference to me though, it worked the same as any other gillete refillable razor, which is well when paired with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, a must buy razor if your looking for a close, smooth shave. I never used this product intel 2 days ago. I really recommend it, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor! I love how flexible the handle is thanks to the flexball technology. It made it very easy to shave the tricky parts of my face without having to twist my hand in all crazy directions when I am trying to get a close shave. I really like how you can buy replacement blades instead of having to buy a whole new razor every time, it reduces waste. This is just like any other razor where the blade is pretty sharp but after a month of use it gets dull. I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> I like this razor just fine. I typically shave my head bold every few days and keep clean face so I have to use a razor on a regular basis. I usually use some type of electrical shaver to make sure I get smooth cut. I believe that razor does great job keeping my face clean shaved but I still prefer my electric shaver system. Things I do like about Gillette Fusion Proglide is its portability and always ready for use as compared to electric shavers that do need recharge and the expense of cleaning solutions. I would recommend Gillette Fusion Proglide since it does good job keeping my face clean shaved. I am buzzagent and received this product as  a trial.</li>
            <li> When I used this to shave for the first few couple of times, I noticed a really big difference from the disposable Gillette razors that I used to buy. It 100 times better than disposable razors! It gets the job done way better than the ones I used to buy. I recommend this to anyone who wants their face to look nice and clean! I love it.</li>
            <li> Great close shave and clean look great product!</li>
            <li> Works good but wears out too quick. Would never purchase one.</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to review I was thoroughly impressed with the overall design right off the bat. It was easy to get out of the package and znc I could feel that it was made out of good solid materials. I used the Gillette shaving gel and put this bad boy to the test and boy did it deliver! It easily shaved around the curvature of my face with ease. I experienced no cuts or discomfort while shaving with this razor. The swivel handle helped with being able to maneuver around and get all the areas of my face shaved evenly. Usually I have to shave over my face several times before it gets the whiskers in certain areas of my face but I was able to shave over just once and it got nearly all of it. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several days now and it gets the job done shaves smooth and close. When I got the razor I did an unboxing and first shave test for those interested it can be viewed here! [...]</li>
            <li> Typically razors are just the same in my opinion; however, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide slightly exceeds its competition.  The Flex Ball is awesome, allowing to shave every curve of my face at ease.  I browsed cartridge prices online, and they are in line with competitor pricing.  I would definitely consider purchasing refill cartridges for this razor.  I wife thanks me, as I no longer need to use her Gillette Fusion razor!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball from Gillette to test.  I can honestly say this is by far the best razor I have used in my life.  I have sensitive skin but this razor cut close without leaving any nicks or razor burn.  It glided effortlessly over the contours of my face and left my skin feeling soft to the touch.  I have not used any other razor since trying this one.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to sample and review. The handle gets 5 stars, but the razor cartridges gets a 1. The flexball handle is easy to maneuver. It was comfortable to hold too. The moisturizing strip doesn&#x27;t last even 1 shave (which for me is face and my entire head). It would glide smoothly at first, but once that strip wore out about 3/4 through, which resulted in a lot of tugging. I&#x27;m glad I did not pay for the razor, because it&#x27;s not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I received this razor courtesy of Gillette, free to try. I thought it was just another gimmick that all the razor companies seem to be doing these days. I have extremely sensitive skin: I have to shave downwards and unless I want irritation I cannot shave upwards to get that really close shave (which is annoying). I also have a scar on the tip of my chin which can easily be nicked. I used this razor within two days of receiving and I was so pleasantly surprised. I didn&#x27;t even HAVE to shave upward to get that close shave. It was one of the better razors that I have tried over the past few years! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The 5 blades get as close as you would expect. When you need a close shave, i recommend Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall. I have tried many razors in my time here on earth and now I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> When I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle for free from Gillette to review I was very intrigued with the look if it right away. It had a very easy open package and the razor itself was very sturdy. When I tested it I knew right away this razor was above and beyond every other razor I&#x27;ve used! It easily shaved around the curves of my face. I had no nicks or burns while shaving with this razor. The swivel handle helped to shave all the areas of my face evenly. Usually I have to shave over my face a few times before I get my face totally smooth but I was able to shave over just once and it got all of it. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several days and it gets the job done shaves smooth and close. So overall I am very impressed with this awesome razor!</li>
            <li> I tend to find that most every razor I get gives me a pretty good shave, despite how &amp;#34;Sci-Fi&amp;#34; the razor looks, and how fancy the name sounds. I was using a Gillette Fusion Manual razor, and the shave didn&#x27;t seem as close as I like it. I was pleasantly surprised how nice of a shave the Fusion Proglide razor I am reviewing here provides. Considering I shave my face, chest, and back (how often depends on the time of year) pretty regularly, I need a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if this razor works so well because of the &amp;#34;flexball,&amp;#34; which causes the top of the razor to pivot. I think it is mainly because the blades are a higher quality than the Fusion Manual. The blades on that razor seemed to be duller from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this shave. It is close, comfortable, and so far hasn&#x27;t dulled, although that could be because I sharpen it on my forearm before I shave every morning (run it opposite way on your forearm five times - it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it keeps the blades sharp...look up &amp;#34;razor forearm trick&amp;#34; for more information).</li>
            <li> After trying out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor for a couple of weeks, I must say It is better than I thought it would be. I was initially worried that the Flexball handle technology would make it more difficult to shave around the lines of my beard, but the razor really does not move all that much - in fact it requires more force than you would think to make the razor pivot.&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I use an electric razor in the morning to trim and use this as a means to get a really nice, close shave. It has worked great at getting a close shave, as you would expect from Gillette products, but I&#x27;ve found that the new Flexball technology really isn&#x27;t anything to call home about. Now, if you have problems with your razor not adhering to the contours of your face, then this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;However, at the end of the day, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, have been successful in avoiding any cuts, and appreciate the smooth, close shave, but I can get that from any Gillette product. Therefore, if you already have a Gillette razor, there really is no need to rush out to the store to pick up this shiny new one.</li>
            <li> I received the razor through a promotion.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The cut is clean and the flexball seems to solve my lifelong problem of an uneven cut.  One cut and done!  I am very happy with this razor!</li>
            <li> Is it better than the original, or a old fashioned double edged safety razor?  Yes.  Significantly better?  Maybe.  Worth the price?  Not for me, but maybe for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a razor junkie.  When a new one came out, I had to try it.  Each seemed marginally better than the last.  Then something happened.  I inherited my grandfather&#x27;s Gillette safety razor.  Figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly heavy and tough beard.  The four and five blade razors clog more rapidly and don&#x27;t last any longer than my safety razor.  They probably shave a little closer, but not significantly so and when I started figuring the cost of the blades, the choice was simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to try one of these razors and it does a nice job, but in the end it&#x27;s not enough better that I will use it daily.  I passed it on to my father and he also likes it, thinks it&#x27;s marginally better than the previous version, but not enough to justify the cost of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend with a lighter beard likes it a lot.  Claims he can use it for a month and amortized over the length of time the blade lasts figures the additional cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict.  Its&#x27; a good razor.  Whether the ongoing cost of the blades is an issue will depend on the individual.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a new Fusion Proglide to test out.  I have not been this happy with a razor since the release of the Mach 3.  The Fusion Proglide has the new Flexball technology which helps keep all 5 of the razors flat against your skin, regardless of the angle.  You can go around the jawline and under the chin without missing any hair.  Normally I do cut myself several times during each shave, and after using the Fusion Proglide with Flexball on 6 different occasions, I have yet to cut myself even once.  I have been using the Mach 3 for years and this is the razor that finally convinced me to upgrade to a new razor style.  This is the cleanest and closest shave I have ever had and I love it. And so does my fiance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Gilette vet from the early 90&#x27;s, when I first started shaving.  My old man used one of those safety razors, but the thing butchered my face something awful; so my mom bought me a Gillette Sensor Excel (which was brand new at that time) and I&#x27;ve been a loyal Gillette consumer ever since.  I graduated to the Mach 3, the Fusion, and now this thing.  This is the closest and easiest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  I&#x27;m one of those guys who has to shave nearly every day, my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up before lunch, so a good, precise razor is a must.  This razor did as advertised for me.  It didn&#x27;t look like it was bending much in the mirror, but I didn&#x27;t have to stretch, pull, contort and twist me face to get awkward, hard to shave areas like I usually do.  It curves, it tilts, it pivots and keeps on point, cutting the time, effort and pain of my shave down considerably.  It took care of most of my face with a single pass and I didn&#x27;t have to pull or twist or stretch at all.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little skepical when I got my new Flexball razor from Gillette to try out. I&#x27;m already a Fusion razor user so that wasn&#x27;t my doubts - I was looking at the Flexball as a gimmick (batteries?, c&#x27;mon), not anything useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit it, I was wrong. I&#x27;m impressed with how effective the flexball is. ON the surface, it&#x27;s so simple, the head is on a swivel that pivots a little left or right based on the angle. Normally I&#x27;m one of those guys that has to pull my skin a little or make funny faces to shave. But this new razor makes it very simple &amp; quick to get a close shave done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that I dont have to change blades, this is fully compatible with the Fusion blades I&#x27;ve already stocked up on.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave that adjusted nicely around my chin...Probably the best shave I have ever had!!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide works amazing , I used it to shave my head which is not a easy task but it worked great ! I will be a repeat customer of this product</li>
            <li> I had switched over from a schick quattro to this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball technology. I noticed the immediate difference as I was shaving. My shaving experience was a lot smoother and I did not experience any knicks or cuts while shaving. I received a sample from Gillette and I was super happy with this new razor. The good thing is you can use the fusion proglide razors to replace the original one. This one came with two extras so that&#x27;s a +. I saw this razor being advertised heavily throughout different stores and I was excited to try this! It&#x27;s easy to conform to your hand and shaving is simple with this razor!</li>
            <li> I really liked the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor I received free from Gillette. I felt like the handle was comfortable to grip and its five blades and flexing head gave me a close shave that never irritated my skin. I really liked the fact that the razor contained a lubricated strip because I think it helped glide the razor over my stubble, which all easily came off without me having to go back over the same area again.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor the ball actually will follow my face so i don&#x27;t have make so many faces to get the close shave I desire. The price is reasonable considering the blades last a few shaves. I found this razor easily follows your face contours very well i would recommend this razor for very close shaves</li>
            <li> When I received the Gillette fusion proglide silvertouch to review I was a bit skeptical. I had quit using disposables about a year ago in favor of a safety razor, but I still use Gillette disposables and electric razors for those times when I need a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that this wasn&#x27;t that much different than any other disposable razor. sure the flexball provided a little more movement, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be a dramatic change. However, when is used the proglide flexball the first time i immediately could tell a difference. I was able to shave very quickly, and the flexball really allowed me to get those hard to reach spots around my chin, nose, and under my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I waited a few hours to write this review. I have very sensitive skin around my neck, and any disposable razor i used before would inevitably cause razor burn. The Gillette Proglide Flexball has so far eliminated any razor burn. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the flexball allowing me to shave in one pass, or because of the new moisturizer strip on the razor, but whatever it is works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Summary:&lt;br /&gt;The razor provides a close shave on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;The flexball really does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be using this on a daily basis, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep it in the medicine cabinet for those times when I&#x27;m in a hurry or traveling.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve always had trouble with razors. The Mach 3 shaved fairly close when I tried it years ago, but as bad as my skin felt afterward, I eventually gave up and switched to a double-edged safety razor. I figured if my skin was going to sting anyway, I might as well only pay 10 cents per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year or so ago, I somehow ended up with a Fusion Proglide. It shaved me smooth with minimal after-effect, and I decided to switch to using it instead of my old style razor. I purchased the non-Proglide blades for it, because they were on sale, and it&#x27;s still fairly decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I got this razor from Gillette with the Flexball handle and more Proglide blades, and I got to try it out this morning. Having used the cheaper blades for a few months, I&#x27;m surprised at how much better the Proglide actually is. The lubricating strip and slightly sharper blades make a HUGE difference that I&#x27;ll remember next time I go blade shopping. Surprisingly, the Flexball also makes a difference, in that to get that smooth shave, I only had to spend about two thirds as long shaving as without it, and in fewer passes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face appreciates the smoother shave and the automatic angling of the blade. I&#x27;m happy with the new handle, and I expect to be purchasing more of the Proglide blades next time I need refills.</li>
            <li> I received Gillette fusion glide from Gillette. I was a little skeptical of the flex ball..I mean, how big if a difference can a ball on a razor make?? Well, it makes a big difference!  It glides smoothly around those hard to reach spots! It gives a close shave without all the pulling of hairs like I&#x27;ve had from other razors.  Looks like I found my new razor!</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever used. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I just received a free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR from Gillette to test out. Let me start by saying I usually hate shaving.  I&#x27;m constantly contorting my face trying to get the closest shave possible and my face still feels like sandpaper.  So I was a bit skeptical when I was asked to try out the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR.  I mean, who cares if it pivots? Right?  Damn was I wrong...  This is the closest smoothest shave I have ever gotten.  My face feels like it did when I was 12, soft and smooth.  I am forever hooked.  Smooth shave, no nicks or cuts, and I don&#x27;t have to make stupid faces to get a closer shave...&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?&lt;br /&gt;I love the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH MANUAL RAZOR, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because I prefer the Gillette power razors and this razor didn&#x27;t fail to disappoint.  It handles nicely around the neck line and face.  It should work well if you don&#x27;t want any facial hair.  However, one thing to watch out for is if you are sporting a goatee.  Since I&#x27;m used to using a razor that doesn&#x27;t pivot side to side when I approached my chin the blade shifted one way and the razor went the other.  There are worse things in life than having to redesign some facial hair or going without for a few days.  However, this product isn&#x27;t going to cut it for me.</li>
            <li> I (her husband) received this product from Gillette. I have previously used the Mach 3 razor, so having lots of blades is nice. It helps to keep from tugging at my chin and mustache area. It does a fine job, but I&#x27;m not sure I find an advantage to the Flexball feature. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help me shave any better or more thoroughly. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair any, just in front and in patches. So I don&#x27;t find it a groundbreaking innovation, but I have no complaints; it does it&#x27;s job and with 5 blades, it does it well.</li>
            <li> i recieved this razor from Gillette and it is by far the best razor that I have ever used. In the past I used the earlier versions of the fusion razors and was very satisfied with them.  The Gusion proflide silvertouch razor with flexball provides the smoothest shave that I can remember having and I have been shaving for over 40 years.  The blades and lubristrip are more comfortable, than earlier versions. This is an outstanding upgrade to what was an excellent shaving product.</li>
            <li> Using my wifes amazon. Great product, very precise cut and no hair left behind. Love the pivot action.</li>
            <li> Great close shave and clean cut look!</li>
            <li> I figured this was just another gimmicky update, but it actually is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This razor is made genuinely fine! The way it flexes so it gives you a better shave is just awesome! I got to try it, thanks to BuzzAgent and by all means it was one of the best Gillette company has ever made, Never going back. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor!!! Love the way the swivel handle allows you to maneuver around different areas of the face with ease.  You get a nice close shave every time. I Would highly recommend this product! My wife also likes it for shaving legs because of the pivot head.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from gillette for a review. I used this razor once, and it was an okay razor. I think that is a neat concept, but not really worth the hype. I did not feel that it improved the comfort of my shave at all. It may be a better choice for the chilled jawline over the chubby cheeks.</li>
            <li> Pros: Excellent razor, probably the best men&#x27;s razor released by Gillette. Although the swivel action from the Flexball takes a little getting used to, I think overall it is an innovative feature. The way the blade contours to your face seems to decrease overall shaving time as well since you are less likely to miss a spot as is common on other razors. Finally, it is nice that they left the razor cartridges the same as other Gillette Fusion products. Therefore, your unused blades from your previous Gillette Razor will work with this razor as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: As with all Gillette shaving products, the cost is very high (especially blades) compared to competitors. Also, as I mentioned above, the razor takes a little getting used to. For those who have been loyal to a specific razor for years, they would probably not be a good fit for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you are the type of person who likes to be on the cutting edge of new products and are willing to be patient with the razor I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Easiest shave ever. This razor makes the morning much easier with the smooth shave provided by the razor and rollerball working together. I received one a sample razor from Gillette to try and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I alternate between Schick and Gillette usually, but I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a while. Very close shave and the flexball is cool.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try out. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the closeness of the shave from the regular Proglide razors that I normally use. The pivot ball seemed awkward but I guess I was not pressing hard enough on it. My wife used it on her legs and she said it gives her a nice close shave and she doesn&#x27;t get cuts on her shins and ankles. The blades stayed sharp for a really long time and over all it&#x27;s a nice quality razor.</li>
            <li> I usually try not to spend very much on razors or any other products for that matter. I do my research, shop around, and buy smaller packs to determine the best value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, Gillette provided me this razor as part of a try-it-before-you-buy-it review program and although it may cost bit more than some alternatives, it is also higher quality. I have been using the fusion series for quite some time and have rarely complained, but this new design seems to improve on some of the issues I had. I couldn&#x27;t decide if there was anything specifically better about the Flexball and blade redesign, but I did feel like it made the shave a lot smoother, made washing the hair off the blades easier, and my skin seemed less irritated than normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this redesign seems to have improved the product enough that I would be willing to purchase it; however, I will still be shopping for the best deal and would consider other products as well.</li>
            <li> I have used the cheap Gillette razors with two blades for years. But Gillette doubled the price on them and I went looking for an alternative. This is the ultimate alternative. The throw-away razor lasted for three shaves. I figured that between 11 and 12 shaves with this blade at its cost would be break-even. I kept track and the blade lasted 53 shaves and was still much better than the disposable razor after its 3 shaves. I&#x27;m convinced. You will be too!</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me an opportunity to try their new Fusion Proglide with Flexiball Technology Razor.  I have used the Gillette Fusion Series for quite some time.  But their new Flexiball design is over the top.  Simply the best razor I have ever used.  The Flexball allows for a complete stroke from chin to neck without losing contact with your skin .  Leaves you with a great smooth shave without missing a single hair.  And uses standard fusion refillable blades a big plus.</li>
            <li> There are a few things that make this Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology my new go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m actually getting fewer cuts on my face. I never really was one that got a lot of cuts while shaving, but I&#x27;ve noticed that with the shaving head on this razor swiveling and moving to the curves of my face, it happens much less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Previously when shaving it was a bit like yoga or gymnastics. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I started using this razor with FlexBall handle technology, but I no longer have to contort my entire arm to get all the nooks and crannies of my face. This makes shaving easier, and saves me a bit of time in my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The FlexBall handle design makes it even easier to wash out the blades from the eventual buildup. This is one of my biggest issues with using razor blades to shave, you usually end up with a gunky buildup in between the blades, especially if you wait a few days to shave and have some longer hairs to contend with. This system has an unobstructed backside which allows me to easily wash the blades out, and keeps me shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology. Thanks to Gillette for sending me a sample handle and razor blade to try out. I will definitely be using this razor in the future to keep my face cut and hair free.</li>
            <li> Now I received this razor free to review and I&#x27;m glad I did. It was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a full beard since I was 13 and shaving has always been a thorn in my side. I hated doing it growing up while attending private school which required us to be clean shaven, and I hate it now being in the Army. While I still hate doing it, the GIllette Fusion Proglide made it a very easy process. I was able to get the closest and smoothest shave of my life with this blade not just the first time, but multiple times.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the new flex ball technology with this razor because a trouble with me is around my jawline. I received this as a sample from Gillette. I thought this might make things a little easier. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much to help in that respect. I also don&#x27;t find that much utility in five blades either. So overall, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the extra money on this razor.</li>
            <li> Do the flexball technology work?  Yes it does...&lt;br /&gt;Does the experienced shaver need to pay the extra money for it?  No&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth while for a new shaver or the everyday running late shaver?  Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the flexball technology does contour to your face, though an experience everyday shaver who shaves 365+ times a year knows the contours of their face and doesn&#x27;t need a new technology to get a close smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who is new to shaving or finds themselves in a hurry most of the time, the  flexball technology assists with shaving without having to meticulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the flexball technology, the fact that the razor has 5 blades, I found that the cartridge last longer than my three bladed cartridge and the precision trimmer on the back is very helpful to get those orphan hairs that the main blades do not</li>
            <li> GREAT IDEA, PRACTICAL?... LETS SEE.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor from Gillette to try out.  This razor is great!  The swivel ball head helps conform to the curves of my face and really helps in getting a close, comfortable shave. Best of all I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Razor.  I have found my new razor of choice!</li>
            <li> The  Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology is another great one from Gillette in the ProGlide series.  The FlexBall makes the difference in handling and ease of use. Very easy to move around your face and get all those stubborn stops.  The only downside would be that it dues clog but what razor,  besides straight, doesn&#x27;t?  Overall,  this razor gets the &amp;#34;baby face approval&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was surprised with how much I liked this. Back in the day I had one of the original vibrating razors and it was a bit odd to use, so I was skeptical - but the new blade configuration works great with the vibration. Fortunately, Gillette did a promo and I got to try this for free.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing with this is that it&#x27;s a regular razor till you turn it on, so you can get a nice close shave. I find when I go a couple of days without shaving, the vibration helps me get a closer one - and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The one problem: the battery is tricky to put it, so be sure to look at the little slip that comes with the handle or you&#x27;ll be perplexed like I was! Just remember to pull and twist!</li>
            <li> One of the best product I have used for shaving. Got this free from Bzzagent. amazingly smooth and doesn&#x27;t even need a lathering cream for using this. Bzzagent packaging was nice and got a free catridge as well</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette, after being a diehard Gillette user for years. It works great, with one swipe across the face and hard to reach areas under the nose and by my ears. Razors are expensive, but I think this has a good price point and top notch blade.</li>
            <li> Received this razor from Gilette a few days ago, and just used it over the weekend. I&#x27;ve always liked Gilette&#x27;s razor&#x27;s, and the Silvertouch is actually supplanting a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Proglide. I&#x27;m no razor expert, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with the couple of shaves I&#x27;ve done with the Silvertouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head as well as my face, and the razor performed very well, despite the fact that I&#x27;d waited longer than usual to polish the old dome. Normally if I wait too long, I&#x27;ll have to buzz it with an electric razor first or make two or three passes with my normal razor. The Silvertouch cut right through and did an excellent job on just one shave. And the sheer range of motion to the pivoting head made the razor hug the contours better, and I got a closer shave with much fewer passes than I have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Proglide Silvertouch is an awesome razor, and it gets an A+ from me.</li>
            <li> Not to shabby (both the razor and my face). It gave a close shave and left my skin pretty smooth. Being a fan of an electric razor it was a tough switch, I like the simplicity of grab, shave and go, skipping the need for shaving cream. This being said if I were to be a regular razor user I would be very happy with this razor. I received no nicks or cuts and it moved well across my face. I would recommend this razor to my traditional shaving cream/razor using friends.</li>
            <li> Simply the best shave you can get at the moment.  Try all of them. This is the best.</li>
            <li> I revived this razor from Gillette as a promotion and am VERY impressed.  Even the packaging is better than most products that come in plastic.  Taking the razor out was easy and I did not need wire cutters to get though the packaging.  I Hate to shave so it had been about a week.  This thing is amazing.  As it turns out, I was also using Gillette shaving foam, not sure if that played a part.  The FlexBall Handle Technology is crazy good.  Glides effortlessly along my face and neck, never missing a hair.  Every bit of the face of the razor that makes contact with my face/neck takes the hair off with just 1 stoke, which prevented razor burn.  It works great over different contours and just seemed well designed all the way around.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  Got a free sample from Gillette and will continue to use it as my primary shaving device!  Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for years, the new features plus the consistent performance keeps me coming back.</li>
            <li> Pro :&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good razor, the flexball is an amazing feature, dealing with all contours the body can throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con :&lt;br /&gt;The size of the flexball is rather large and bulky for a razor</li>
            <li> It is a great razor! There was no tug while going around my jaw. My face was smooth afterwards. It was like using my electric razor, without electricity.</li>
            <li> Upon getting this shaver i tried it once daily, every morning.  The shaver did exactly what i was expecting.  It shaves smooth and does in fact pivot like it advertises.  i think that the razor performs at or above the threshold that the predecessor and competition has held.  This being said, I did not really notice that it felt different as compared to the non pivot style as i expected it to.  It performed comfortably and without draw backs, but i didnt feel any difference to signify the need for a different style or type of razor.  i must notate that i have used most all types, and brands or shavers and this brand has never made a bad product in my opinion.  I have thick heavy facial hair and this product performed as i expected.  i would buy this product in the future if the cost made it a better value than other options.</li>
            <li> Red bumps on neck have been significantly reduced. Easier and faster to shave and much increased maneuverability with regard to the blade. Huge improvement over my prior Mach 3.  Was very skeptical at first to try a new Gillette razor but this one has far exceeded my expectations. Furthermore the blades seem to last longer than prior models.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I have been using a mach iii for over 15 years and have yet to find an option to replace it. No blade clogging, smooth shave and no nicks!</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Gillette and was eager to try this razor. After several shaves with it, I can report that I have not shed a drop of blood yet, which is unheard of using a multi-blade manual razor, based n my past experience. Not one nick or scratch. None. Even when shaving against the grain of my beard, it gave a very smooth shave, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had fom a manual razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as my travel razor, got tired of only have 1 razor and saw commercials for this one and thought I had to have one.  I haven&#x27;t actually tested it out but the reason for the low rating was that I thought I was getting the &amp;#34;powered&amp;#34; version but it&#x27;s actually the  non-powered version.  Really my mistake for not noticing also Amazon does not do returns on these items.  For a travel razor it should work as expected but keep in mind it&#x27;s not powered.  Power razors are the best, razor vibration while shaving is a must for me.</li>
            <li> works well the swivel head is great</li>
            <li> I switch off the Mach 3 and Mach 3 turbo for the fusion. I&#x27;ll probably never go back.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for my dad and the other for my fiancé. They both love it. It comes with two additional blade cartridges as well, which makes it a steal of a deal.</li>
            <li> This is not only good for men, I love it to shave my legs with.  Close shave and love the flexball handle.  Everyone that received for a christmas gift loved it.  Highly recomment</li>
