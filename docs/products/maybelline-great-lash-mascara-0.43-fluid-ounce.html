            <li>Not as good as it used to be...</li>
            <li>I happen to love Maybelline Great Lash Mascara.  </li>
            <li>I like the Great Lash water proof mascara in BRown, however the brown is quite light.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara - relatively cheap and dependable.  </li>
            <li>So for the price it is between a 3 and 4 star because I am a nice person and like to see a business succeed.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Has never caused any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t use mascara much anymore, I know that this works best for me when I do use it.  </li>
            <li>Nice mitt&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a good price, compared to most.</li>
            <li>My daughter is wearing make-up for the first time and this has been a great product for her.  </li>
            <li>Well I have very light eyelashes</li>
            <li>The brush shape isn&#x27;t my favorite either-</li>
            <li>Love this Brown..</li>
            <li>Used this product since the 1970&#x27;s and it remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>do not want to write 12 more words</li>
            <li>I have better things to do.</li>
            <li>I have being using Maybelline mascara for many years.</li>
            <li>The product is just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with this product.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>This is a great, classic mascara.my mom has used it, and so have I.</li>
            <li>It is great for normal day use.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sweet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>i try other mascaras from time-to-time, but this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t catch that this mascara is not waterproof!!&lt;br /&gt;It spread very quickly around my eyes when I was yawning.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>No clumping, goes on smoothly and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>But maybe that&#x27;s the point: the look created by the original brush doesn&#x27;t make your lashes gigantic, or like they&#x27;ve multiplied in your sleep, which goes perfectly with the I&#x27;m-not-really-here Dark Brown mascara color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more years than I&#x27;m willing to admit!</li>
            <li>Having tried mascaras ranging from basic drugstore to ultra-luxury brands, I&#x27;m so happy to report that Maybelline remains tops.</li>
            <li>B00008MOQG Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, Dark Brown]] is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Great Lash in the past, and seemed to provide more lash thickness than it does now.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it is the cheap price that makes it popular.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wipe off the applicator thoroughly, so you don&#x27;t apply too much.  </li>
            <li>Tried and true.</li>
            <li>This one is the best I&#x27;ve found--after trying more expensive department and drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I have short, straight, and sparse lashes that are not visible unless there is mascara on, but this is not the mascara that makes me happy with my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>looks MUCH more natural than a pencil, when applied correctly.  </li>
            <li>Swipe from the middle out, in a kind of upward motion, and use a cotton swab if you make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely give anything the highest rating.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon offers this particular Maybelline mascara as it washes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Glad I went with the dark brown as the light brown is too light.  </li>
            <li>I stick with the brown shades but would love it if a major brand came out with an auburn shade.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been iso a light-weight mascara in brown that has just enough umph to cover the powder that most shadows make on lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful I revisited this one, as I enjoyed it back in the 70s as well.</li>
            <li>Though I have tried many mascaras over the years I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li>My favorite version of this mascara has the larger brush.  </li>
            <li>A pretty color.</li>
            <li>Makes your eyelashes look good, but not super intense.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with no chunks and only have to apply once a day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to  use, very basic.  </li>
            <li>It takes too much work to achieve the look I want, which is full, long lashes that can hold a curl and have a special flare to it.</li>
            <li>A classic!</li>
            <li>I expected more moisture/product on the brush.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>It performs as it should and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>in my 50s, and most mascaras make me look worse instead of better.</li>
            <li>brush is tiny, which is kind of strange at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>(I only wish the Dark Brown color came in more brush styles -- this one is the middle-of-the-road original style brush.)</li>
            <li>I am very fair skin, and black mascara looks so harsh on me.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why this is so wildly popular.</li>
            <li>This is my go to mascara, I&#x27;ve used others that are more expensive and promise longer lashes, but in the end this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I think it lookss more natural than black for daywear.</li>
            <li>This is the only mascara I have used since it first come out.  </li>
            <li>All the same, it comes in brown, which is good for my pale face, and the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Does ok, but hardly thickens lashes at all.</li>
            <li>Well, no mascara that I know of looks totally natural (except one by Shiseido that is no longer made, as far as I can tell).</li>
            <li>mascara is also WAY too sensitive to the smallest particle of water.</li>
            <li>Leaves soft highlights that look natural and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>so I need a mascara that is natural looking yet lengthens and thickens my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different mascaras, mainly for price/availability reasons.</li>
            <li>A very bare touch of the wand, followed by a tissue to spread it across the surface hairs solves the problem for those of us with graying brows that used to be brown.</li>
            <li>And be aware that the Dark Brown color looks *very* different from Maybelline&#x27;s Brownish-Black -- they are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li>The bristles are spread far apart and really don&#x27;t enhance the volume of my lashes like other brushes from other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> This stuff take a while to dry completely, and if I blink before it is dry it often comes off on my cheek.</li>
            <li> My lashes are indistinguishable due to being a natural redhead</li>
            <li> Whenever I try another brand, I usually don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> you just can&#x27;t beat the simplicity and value of this mascara for coverage and long lasting lash color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is in a smaller container then expected.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t end up with shadows or streaks under my eyes after a long day and it washes off with soap and&lt;br /&gt;water</li>
            <li> I have tried other mascaras, but I keep coming back to Maybelline.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t red rather a softer look for mascara than full-on black.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will get brownish black instead of brown.</li>
            <li> I also expected a fuller lash look and did not get that either.  </li>
            <li> Color is as expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t clump (if I&#x27;m careful).  </li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t glop it on heavily, it stays put all day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use black mascara due to my very dark eyes.</li>
            <li> I still would like to find one that deposits even less mascara-stuff on the brush, but it helps if I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product because this mascara was my mom&#x27;s go to when I was little</li>
            <li> One of the few brands that offer brown shades of mascara.  </li>
            <li> use it to add volume to, and tame my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to wash it all off, so I sometimes wake up with shadows under my eyes from the leftover residue.  </li>
            <li> I have to apply at least 3 to 4 coats MINIMUM to get anywhere, and I believe that my lashes are the reason.</li>
            <li> The wand is my biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> i hate the brush in this one, so i kept my old one and washed it in rubbing alcohol and let sit for 24 hours before using it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Maybelline.  </li>

            <li> Another great mascara</li>
            <li> This is a great, classic mascara.my mom has used it, and so have I. It&#x27;s a good example of the phrase, &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mascaras, but I keep coming back to Maybelline.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I wish it was waterproof, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to add volume to, and tame my eyebrows.  I overplucked in the &#x27;90s and now am paying for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks MUCH more natural than a pencil, when applied correctly.  Make sure to wipe off the applicator thoroughly, so you don&#x27;t apply too much.  Swipe from the middle out, in a kind of upward motion, and use a cotton swab if you make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does wear off or sweat off by mid-day sometimes depending on the situation, which is why I wish it were waterproof, so carry it on you for a night out and you can touch it up as needed.</li>
            <li> It is in a smaller container then expected. I expected more moisture/product on the brush. I also expected a fuller lash look and did not get that either.  It is not the best I have used however it will do for now.  This mascara is also not the most expensive either.  So for the price it is between a 3 and 4 star because I am a nice person and like to see a business succeed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Maybelline.  Glad I went with the dark brown as the light brown is too light.  No clumping, goes on smoothly and washes off easily with soap and water. A classic! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> you just can&#x27;t beat the simplicity and value of this mascara for coverage and long lasting lash color.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t end up with shadows or streaks under my eyes after a long day and it washes off with soap and&lt;br /&gt;water in the shower at night.  Simply Perfect!</li>
            <li> Best mascara for swimming or sweating ever.  No runs.  Need oil to get off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of great lash since I started wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> i hate the brush in this one, so i kept my old one and washed it in rubbing alcohol and let sit for 24 hours before using it</li>
            <li> Great product like always. Color is as expected. Easy to apply with no chunks and only have to apply once a day. Has never caused any kind of irritation. I bought this product because this mascara was my mom&#x27;s go to when I was little and she still uses it to this day. I now know why. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Great Lash in the past, and seemed to provide more lash thickness than it does now.  Does ok, but hardly thickens lashes at all.</li>
            <li> Well, no mascara that I know of looks totally natural (except one by Shiseido that is no longer made, as far as I can tell). I&#x27;ve been iso a light-weight mascara in brown that has just enough umph to cover the powder that most shadows make on lashes. This one is the best I&#x27;ve found--after trying more expensive department and drugstore brands. I still would like to find one that deposits even less mascara-stuff on the brush, but it helps if I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50s, and most mascaras make me look worse instead of better. Somehow that mascara-y look is severe and accentuates wrinkles and aging, I think. I&#x27;m thankful I revisited this one, as I enjoyed it back in the 70s as well.</li>
            <li> Have used Great Lash for years!</li>
            <li> Though I have tried many mascaras over the years I always come back to this one.  It works!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t clump (if I&#x27;m careful).  It&#x27;s inexpensive and  lasts all day.  I think it a winner.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have used since it first come out.  I have tried others over the years, wound up throwing them out.  Used maybelline since i WAS 16!!! aM  now retired and still use,love it</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, and it&#x27;s one that I can sometimes find in brown. It is hard to wash it all off, so I sometimes wake up with shadows under my eyes from the leftover residue.  The brush shape isn&#x27;t my favorite either- I&#x27;d rather it was wider rather than narrower at the ends.  All the same, it comes in brown, which is good for my pale face, and the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Been using it for an eternity.  Tried and true.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t catch that this mascara is not waterproof!!&lt;br /&gt;It spread very quickly around my eyes when I was yawning.&lt;br /&gt;But color is good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it used to be...clumbs - gave to my granddaughter to use as I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Love this Brown..it isn&#x27;t red rather a softer look for mascara than full-on black.  I think it lookss more natural than black for daywear. Cheaper on site than the big box stores</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t quite work for me. It takes too much work to achieve the look I want, which is full, long lashes that can hold a curl and have a special flare to it. While this mascara can do the latter two things, it does not achieve the length and volume that I crave. I have to apply at least 3 to 4 coats MINIMUM to get anywhere, and I believe that my lashes are the reason. I have short, straight, and sparse lashes that are not visible unless there is mascara on, but this is not the mascara that makes me happy with my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is also WAY too sensitive to the smallest particle of water. My eyes water sometimes when I yawn, and I can&#x27;t yawn without the risk of this mascara bleeding into my eyes and burning the heck out of them. Also, I can NEVER apply this product without it getting on my eyelids. EVER. I doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase this.</li>
            <li> This works really well. Wish they had it is a lighter brown. I use it for my eyebrows to hide to gray &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;Stays on well an does not clump up</li>
            <li> Great product which blends perfectly with my skin and hair tones.  Leaves soft highlights that look natural and lasts all day.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t use mascara much anymore, I know that this works best for me when I do use it.  It always has been a well-known and reliable product.</li>
            <li> Used this product since the 1970&#x27;s and it remains my favorite.</li>
            <li> My daughter is wearing make-up for the first time and this has been a great product for her.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff since high school. i try other mascaras from time-to-time, but this stuff is the best. ever.</li>
            <li> I rarely give anything the highest rating.  I&#x27;m happy with the price and the color.  I don&#x27;t use black mascara due to my very dark eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my go to mascara, I&#x27;ve used others that are more expensive and promise longer lashes, but in the end this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Having tried mascaras ranging from basic drugstore to ultra-luxury brands, I&#x27;m so happy to report that Maybelline remains tops. (I only wish the Dark Brown color came in more brush styles -- this one is the middle-of-the-road original style brush.) If you&#x27;re aiming for a &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look, search no further. And be aware that the Dark Brown color looks *very* different from Maybelline&#x27;s Brownish-Black -- they are not interchangeable. So, for example, if you want one of tiny triangular brushes for &amp;#34;lots of lashes&amp;#34; you&#x27;re out of luck, Brownish-Black is the lightest-color option there. But maybe that&#x27;s the point: the look created by the original brush doesn&#x27;t make your lashes gigantic, or like they&#x27;ve multiplied in your sleep, which goes perfectly with the I&#x27;m-not-really-here Dark Brown mascara color. It&#x27;s the only mascara I consider non-gaudy for regular errands-around-town daywear.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother and she uses it every day! It makes her lashes not just longer but also fuller</li>
            <li> I try others every once in a while, but this is the mascara I always go back to.  No clumping or flaking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Nice and sweet. Very good seller.</li>
            <li> This mascara has been my choice for quite some time now.  It performs as it should and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I happen to love Maybelline Great Lash Mascara.  It is great for normal day use.  My favorite version of this mascara has the larger brush.  My lashes are indistinguishable due to being a natural redhead so I need a mascara that is natural looking yet lengthens and thickens my lashes.  I stick with the brown shades but would love it if a major brand came out with an auburn shade.</li>
            <li> I like the Great Lash water proof mascara in BRown, however the brown is quite light.  Next time I will get brownish black instead of brown.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008MOQG Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, Dark Brown]] is so easy to use. One of the few brands that offer brown shades of mascara.  I am very fair skin, and black mascara looks so harsh on me.  I am so glad Amazon offers this particular Maybelline mascara as it washes off easily with soap and water.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Maybelline Water Proof Mascara, I recommend Maybelline eye mascara remover.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is so wildly popular. It doesn&#x27;t stay on, runs even with a setting powder. Apparently it is the cheap price that makes it popular.</li>
            <li> Nice mitt&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to write 12 more words I have better things to do. Thanks again. Bye</li>
            <li> This stuff take a while to dry completely, and if I blink before it is dry it often comes off on my cheek. I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I have being using Maybelline mascara for many years. Whenever I try another brand, I usually don&#x27;t like it as much. It is a good price, compared to most.</li>
            <li> The product is just okay. I have semi-oily skin and by mid-afternoon it have a bit of raccoon eyes going on. The wand is my biggest complaint. The bristles are spread far apart and really don&#x27;t enhance the volume of my lashes like other brushes from other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I followed a NYT recommendation and purchased this mascara.  It is easy to  use, very basic.  I would recommend it for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Great mascara - relatively cheap and dependable.  As long as I don&#x27;t glop it on heavily, it stays put all day.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for more years than I&#x27;m willing to admit!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can&#x27;t find my color at my local store so I grabbed this..it&#x27;s the same and convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years to cover gray roots in between colorings. Works great and stays on for days. (until I wash my hair)</li>
            <li> Well I have very light eyelashes and so I tried this one for the price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> A pretty color. But, it kinda clumps. So, I just use one stroke per eye. Or two. I&#x27;m ok with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different mascaras, mainly for price/availability reasons. I&#x27;m returning to this one for a couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all (and I wear contacts).&lt;br /&gt;3. Makes your eyelashes look good, but not super intense. I&#x27;m blonde so I don&#x27;t want to go too crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is tiny, which is kind of strange at first, but you get used to it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is what it is supposed to be. Okay.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow pencils basically color the skin beneath the hair, when it&#x27;s the graying hair that begs to be colored. A very bare touch of the wand, followed by a tissue to spread it across the surface hairs solves the problem for those of us with graying brows that used to be brown.</li>
