            <li>Now I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m no name brand whore, but UD has got me hooked!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
            <li>to me its one of the shadows that would look perfect on everyone regardless of skintone, eye color or age.</li>
            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>It seemed to be perfect!</li>
            <li>Stila, in my opinion, makes the best eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I might not wear it to the office, but for everything else it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>shadow itself is absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>i am not the biggest fan of glitter but thier shimmer colors like vert or acid rain are great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>The color I have is \\&quot;Lounge,\\&quot; which I think is a very nice color.  </li>
            <li>Cowboy\\&quot; which is sparkling and bright.  </li>
            <li>I also hear visine works good for this.</li>
            <li>To get a good description of each color</li>
            <li>The color stays true and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>I started with their awesome lipsticks (Gravity and Revolution) and quickly moved up the ranks to eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>
            <li>I also have the Deluxe in Graffiti and with brown eyes</li>
            <li>and i really liked it, it seemed to blend well and was what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Nice color, but very bold!  </li>

            <li>I have been very impressed with Urban Decay products.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite is asphyxia, a duo tone lavender.</li>
            <li>try it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>I would guess for many skin tones it would work since it is so neutral.</li>
            <li>I love UD eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>My favorite color is SIN.</li>
            <li>These are in my top 5 recommended brands of eye shadow.</li>
            <li>im sure you will like it.</li>
            <li>The actual color is beautiful, but I never wear it because it is so glittery that I look like a stripper!</li>
            <li>This is more appropriate for someone who is going clubbing.</li>
            <li>if you love glitter and eye shadow that is true to its color, buy this!</li>
            <li>It might help to check out the UD website for more accurate color swatches before you</li>
            <li>I would definitely say they are worth more than what you pay for them (compared to everything else on the market) and they are a VERY AWESOME buy!</li>
            <li>get a good eyeshadow primer/base and the glitter wont fall on your face so much.</li>
            <li>the way it&#x27;s supposed to be), and my favorite part about them is how fun they are!</li>
            <li>I recommend you go easy on the application-</li>
            <li>texture, nice color, very intense.</li>
            <li>and there are so many exciting, rich colors!</li>
            <li>I shopped around for weeks to find the perfect glittery black eyeshadow, and I found it:</li>
            <li>I have golden brown eyes and they look bright and pretty with this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s smooth and buildable.</li>
            <li>Love the high pigmentation and it is defenitely more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, and it even looks okay when it dusts a bit on my face.  </li>
            <li>While over-priced, this eye shadow has a good feel and solid pigment.  </li>
            <li>its a very pretty beige with silver glitter.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s instantly my new favorite.</li>
            <li>A lot of them have beautiful glitter (not the cheesy kind) embedded in the shadows</li>
            <li>I love the color choices Urban Decay offers, and the cute packaging!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having trouble keeping the glitter on your eyes instead of your face, here are two great tricks.</li>
            <li>I love nearly all the colors.</li>
            <li>It comes in awesome colors the other brands only dream of.</li>
            <li>I love Urban Decay products and was not disappointed when I purchased the eyeshadow in the color Vert.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of glitter:</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Applying to your eyes, the color is bold and controllable, and ultimately the staying power is ok.</li>
            <li>My friend has green eyes and hers look dazzling as well.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are extremely bold, but many of them work well as long as you blend and use the right colors for your skin tone.</li>
            <li>It blends pretty well too.</li>
            <li>i love urban decay eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>love Urban Decay</li>
            <li>have blue eyes and my favorite look is chopper all over my eyelid, smog or roach in the crease, and blunt under my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest trying out X or vert for the first time.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay definitely has some of the most innovative and hip products out there and their eye shadows are no exception.</li>
            <li>and I have exactly nine of them at the moment.</li>
            <li>Very versatile!</li>
            <li>I love the wide variety of colors, and the packaging is pretty neat-o.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of their palettes and then single shadows in my favorite colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, when I pay a certain amount for my make up, I expect precision.  </li>
            <li>Their colors pack a real punch and makes your eyes go</li>
            <li>If you find that too much \\&quot;dust\\&quot; fall on your face, try powdering the cheek bone a bit before eye color application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very glittery</li>
            <li>It brightens up my whole face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It is a \\&quot;vibrant jade\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Beware:  this is an \\&quot;I&#x27;m going out to party\\&quot; set of eyeshadows... too bold to be worn on a daily basis or to work (unless you work at Studio 54 in New York --</li>
            <li>The color is not that intense on first application compared to other black shadows I own</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bother my contact lenses, they have a fun amount of glitter, they&#x27;re the same color on as in the container, and they don&#x27;t crease on my oily eye lids.  </li>
            <li>they give enough distinct sparkles...not just shimmers.</li>
            <li>Every time i get a new UD eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I was in sephora one day looking for a new brown glittery shade of eye shadow to wear out clubbing that weekend.</li>
            <li>These were my first experience of UD products, and I would purchase another Urban Decay product based on this experience although I wish I had shelled out $34 on one of the box sets they have rather than just two colors.</li>
            <li>It really makes blue eyes pop.</li>
            <li>I have several, they blend very well</li>
            <li>But I still wear it near every day.</li>
            <li>There are many other brands that are more expensive that just can&#x27;t compete with the quality.</li>
            <li>Wear them wet or dry, they also blend easy.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I have with it is that it is a little too strong, and I cannot wear it during the day.   </li>
            <li>Now I took a real chance with Oil Slick (blacker than black baby) and with its fine glitter</li>
            <li>if you use certain shadow bases you can also get the more dramatic look that you would have if you used the shadow wet.</li>
            <li>The amount of shadow in the palettes is less, but it lasts a long time and will allow you to try a lot more shades for less money.  </li>
            <li>MC is a great, super small glittery infused base color.</li>

            <li> MC is a great, super small glittery infused base color.</li>
            <li> I cover my cheek and below my eye with a paper towel during application, which makes it impossible for any glitter to get where it doesn&#x27;t belong, and this works great for a few hours...  </li>
            <li> Enough so that your lids have a subtle sparkle, but not so much that it looks caked on or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can apply a light layer for a smoky look, or you can put it on heavier for an edgy look, which is what I usually do.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that all the glitter makes the shadows gritty.</li>
            <li> The main complaint that people had about it was that the eyeshadow particles would go everywhere when being applied.</li>
            <li> so you can brush it out later with clean brush or try using primer (highly recommended UD Primer Potion) or cream eye shadow as a base for staying power.</li>
            <li> Uzi has larger glitter and a very sheer light silver base.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the shape of my eyes that makes eye shadows harder to stay put, but I&#x27;ve taken to using creme eyeshadows and primers.  </li>
            <li> The palettes usually have 9 colors in them for the same price as two single shadows.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, though I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  :(</li>
            <li> A little truly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They are of the upmost quality, they go on very nicely (a little goes a long way,</li>
            <li> I use the hard candy or the urban decay one and dont have any problems.</li>
            <li> It does tend to fall onto your face, and that can cause smudges of black eyeshadow across your face, but I found that if I applied it very carefully, I avoided getting it anywhere</li>
            <li> and I love the sparkle, but hate the way it ends up everywhere on my face by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the glitter bases, and let me tell you they&#x27;re subtle enough for a 30-year-old like me not to look like a wannabe Lady Goo Goo Gag Gag mall queen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s velvet black with silver \\&quot;dust\\&quot; particles...not</li>
            <li> just as described, it is also just a little shimmery as described.  </li>
            <li> I have been told that wearing green is risky, not so with UD.</li>
            <li> Both have problems \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; to where I put them, not a huge problem</li>
            <li> I bought oil slick, black with silver shimmer.</li>
            <li> Once I started using UD shadows, I hardly ever use other brands.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sure which shade to try, I recommend buying one of their palettes.  </li>
            <li> but I am guessing this is why they push the eyeshadow primer base so much.</li>
            <li> Oil Slick!</li>
            <li> due to all of the glitter and shimmers added to these eyeshadows, they are somewhat crumbly and oftentimes I find the shadow on my cheeks after application - and have a very tough time getting it off after my foundation has set.</li>
            <li> One, eyeshadow primers are bogus (overpriced and useless).</li>
            <li> You know that awful cakey gross foundation you bought that you can&#x27;t wear on your face but haven&#x27;t thrown out?</li>
            <li> If this buyer would&#x27;ve read that description then she wouldn&#x27;t have been disappointed with the produce.</li>
            <li> Even the ones that look like they would be boring</li>

            <li> While over-priced, this eye shadow has a good feel and solid pigment.  I have \\&quot;Midnight Cowboy\\&quot; which is sparkling and bright.  Nice color, but very bold!  Beware:  this is an \\&quot;I&#x27;m going out to party\\&quot; set of eyeshadows... too bold to be worn on a daily basis or to work (unless you work at Studio 54 in New York -- wink).  I really like it, though I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  :(</li>
            <li> The color I have is \\&quot;Lounge,\\&quot; which I think is a very nice color.  The only problem that I have with it is that it is a little too strong, and I cannot wear it during the day.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nice texture, nice color, very intense. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m no name brand whore, but UD has got me hooked! I started with their awesome lipsticks (Gravity and Revolution) and quickly moved up the ranks to eyeshadow. Their colors pack a real punch and makes your eyes go pop. I prefer the glitter bases, and let me tell you they&#x27;re subtle enough for a 30-year-old like me not to look like a wannabe Lady Goo Goo Gag Gag mall queen. I also have the Deluxe in Graffiti and with brown eyes I have been told that wearing green is risky, not so with UD. Now I took a real chance with Oil Slick (blacker than black baby) and with its fine glitter I recommend you go easy on the application- one or two strokes- or you&#x27;ll find yourself with raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with Urban Decay products. This eyeshadow is no exception! A little truly goes a long way. I love the wide variety of colors, and the packaging is pretty neat-o. It blends pretty well too. I love love love it! :) (and no animal testing! yay!)</li>
            <li> i love urban decay eyeshadow.It comes in awesome colors the other brands only dream of. i am not the biggest fan of glitter but thier shimmer colors like vert or acid rain are great. Wear them wet or dry, they also blend easy. My all time favorite is asphyxia, a duo tone lavender. try it you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I bought the colors Uzi and Midnight Cowboy. MC is a great, super small glittery infused base color. I would guess for many skin tones it would work since it is so neutral. Uzi has larger glitter and a very sheer light silver base. Both have problems \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; to where I put them, not a huge problem but I am guessing this is why they push the eyeshadow primer base so much. These were my first experience of UD products, and I would purchase another Urban Decay product based on this experience although I wish I had shelled out $34 on one of the box sets they have rather than just two colors.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for weeks to find the perfect glittery black eyeshadow, and I found it: Oil Slick! I absolutely love this eyeshadow! The main complaint that people had about it was that the eyeshadow particles would go everywhere when being applied. It does tend to fall onto your face, and that can cause smudges of black eyeshadow across your face, but I found that if I applied it very carefully, I avoided getting it anywhere I didn&#x27;t want it. Also, I reccomend obtaining Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion. It helps immensely when using this eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;The shadow itself is absolutely beautiful. You can apply a light layer for a smoky look, or you can put it on heavier for an edgy look, which is what I usually do. It has just the right amount of glitter: Enough so that your lids have a subtle sparkle, but not so much that it looks caked on or overdone.&lt;br /&gt;I love Urban Decay and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>
            <li> I love UD eyeshadows.  They don&#x27;t bother my contact lenses, they have a fun amount of glitter, they&#x27;re the same color on as in the container, and they don&#x27;t crease on my oily eye lids.  I noticed that the shades shown on here look a lot lighter than the actual shadows.  It might help to check out the UD website for more accurate color swatches before you order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sure which shade to try, I recommend buying one of their palettes.  The palettes usually have 9 colors in them for the same price as two single shadows.  The amount of shadow in the palettes is less, but it lasts a long time and will allow you to try a lot more shades for less money.  I have a bunch of their palettes and then single shadows in my favorite colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blue eyes and my favorite look is chopper all over my eyelid, smog or roach in the crease, and blunt under my eyebrow.  I add some UD 24/7 eyeliner in bourbon and fiberwig mascara and I&#x27;m good to go!  Once I started using UD shadows, I hardly ever use other brands.  They&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
            <li> get a good eyeshadow primer/base and the glitter wont fall on your face so much. I also hear visine works good for this. I use the hard candy or the urban decay one and dont have any problems. if you use certain shadow bases you can also get the more dramatic look that you would have if you used the shadow wet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you still have a problem try a shimmer instead.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Somebody said midnight cowboy makes them look like a stripper?! lol. to me its one of the shadows that would look perfect on everyone regardless of skintone, eye color or age. please dont let that review scare you off. its one of the milder shades with glitter. its a very pretty beige with silver glitter. It really makes blue eyes pop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It is great! My favorite color is SIN. It&#x27;s shimmery and it lasts. Love the high pigmentation and it is defenitely more bang for your buck. There are many other brands that are more expensive that just can&#x27;t compete with the quality.</li>
            <li> These are in my top 5 recommended brands of eye shadow. I recommend them to clients, friends, relatives . . . you name it. They are of the upmost quality, they go on very nicely (a little goes a long way, the way it&#x27;s supposed to be), and my favorite part about them is how fun they are! A lot of them have beautiful glitter (not the cheesy kind) embedded in the shadows and there are so many exciting, rich colors! Even the ones that look like they would be boring ar SO not! I would definitely say they are worth more than what you pay for them (compared to everything else on the market) and they are a VERY AWESOME buy!</li>
            <li> I got Midnight Cowboy Rides Again and I love the sparkle, but hate the way it ends up everywhere on my face by the end of the day.  I think it&#x27;s the shape of my eyes that makes eye shadows harder to stay put, but I&#x27;ve taken to using creme eyeshadows and primers.  These, however, did not help with controling the \\&quot;glitter explosion\\&quot;.  It is pretty, and it even looks okay when it dusts a bit on my face.  But, when I pay a certain amount for my make up, I expect precision.  I cover my cheek and below my eye with a paper towel during application, which makes it impossible for any glitter to get where it doesn&#x27;t belong, and this works great for a few hours...  I&#x27;ll try the dusting with powder thing as well...</li>
            <li> I love nearly all the colors. I have several, they blend very well &amp; i always get compliments when i wear their colors. I dont reccomend the heavy glitters as much. Every time i get a new UD eyeshadow it&#x27;s instantly my new favorite. I would suggest trying out X or vert for the first time.</li>
            <li> if you love glitter and eye shadow that is true to its color, buy this!</li>
            <li> I bought oil slick, black with silver shimmer. It&#x27;s velvet black with silver \\&quot;dust\\&quot; particles...not glitters since they are not that obvious but they give enough distinct sparkles...not just shimmers. The color is not that intense on first application compared to other black shadows I own but it&#x27;s smooth and buildable. The color stays true and blends perfectly. It works well as a blender or alone. If you find that too much \\&quot;dust\\&quot; fall on your face, try powdering the cheek bone a bit before eye color application so you can brush it out later with clean brush or try using primer (highly recommended UD Primer Potion) or cream eye shadow as a base for staying power.</li>
            <li> I love the color choices Urban Decay offers, and the cute packaging! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Applying to your eyes, the color is bold and controllable, and ultimately the staying power is ok. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But due to all of the glitter and shimmers added to these eyeshadows, they are somewhat crumbly and oftentimes I find the shadow on my cheeks after application - and have a very tough time getting it off after my foundation has set.</li>
            <li> I was in sephora one day looking for a new brown glittery shade of eye shadow to wear out clubbing that weekend. I found midnight cowboy rides again. It seemed to be perfect! i tested it in the store and i really liked it, it seemed to blend well and was what i was looking for. How I wish i could get my money back! The glitter got eveywhere! it does not stay on your eye lids like an eyeshadow should. Stila, in my opinion, makes the best eyeshadow. Try it im sure you will like it.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay definitely has some of the most innovative and hip products out there and their eye shadows are no exception. I adore all the colors and I have exactly nine of them at the moment. Some of the colors are extremely bold, but many of them work well as long as you blend and use the right colors for your skin tone. The only down side is that all the glitter makes the shadows gritty. Therefore I suggest trying the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion AND the Urban Decay Matte Eyeshadows (without glitter).</li>
            <li> I have this in Midnight Cowboy and it&#x27;s very pretty. It&#x27;s very glittery so watch out! But I still wear it near every day. It brightens up my whole face. I have golden brown eyes and they look bright and pretty with this. My friend has green eyes and hers look dazzling as well. Very versatile! It&#x27;s not so glittery that it&#x27;s evening shadow if you keep the eyeliner to a minimum. I might not wear it to the office, but for everything else it&#x27;s great! If you&#x27;re having trouble keeping the glitter on your eyes instead of your face, here are two great tricks. One, eyeshadow primers are bogus (overpriced and useless). You know that awful cakey gross foundation you bought that you can&#x27;t wear on your face but haven&#x27;t thrown out? Well put some of that on your eyelids before the shadow. Then PRESS (do NOT rub) the shadow onto your lids with your finger. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have only purchased and tried the Midnight Cowboy color. The actual color is beautiful, but I never wear it because it is so glittery that I look like a stripper! I can appreciate shimmer, but shimmer this is not. This is more appropriate for someone who is going clubbing.</li>
            <li> I love Urban Decay products and was not disappointed when I purchased the eyeshadow in the color Vert.  It is a \\&quot;vibrant jade\\&quot; just as described, it is also just a little shimmery as described.  That brings me to my next point.  These shadows either shimmer or sparkle, but the Amazon description does not mention that.  To get a good description of each color I advise everyone to check out the company&#x27;s website.  The color Midnight Cowboy mentioned above in a review is described as \\&quot;beige with lots of silver microglitter\\&quot;.  If this buyer would&#x27;ve read that description then she wouldn&#x27;t have been disappointed with the produce.</li>
