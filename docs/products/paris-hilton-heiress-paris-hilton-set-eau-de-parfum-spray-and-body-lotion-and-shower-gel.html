            <li> VERY GOOD was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted more quality in these products.  The shower gel was  about 1/3 filled with the gel.  The lotion was with  little or no scent.  I would not buy it again for myself or for a gift for some one.  My money would have been spent better going to a flea market and buying their scented oil that they carry.&lt;br /&gt;ME</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. No complaints. I&#x27;ve had the fragrance before. Not really sweet or strong but just right for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very feminine and light smelling fragrance that I can wear on a daily basis. I loved it!!</li>

            <li> Love it! I expected it to be smaller, but it was bigger. No complaints here. :) You get what you pay for. I absolutely Love this and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
