            <li>Oh did I tell you, this saves you a good minute compared to the manual toothbrush as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a good quality toothbrush for my wife and I that we could take with us when we travel.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for a top of the line product.</li>
            <li>Amazing value getting 2 electric brushes for this price.</li>
            <li>These are not &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; but they are amazing.</li>
            <li>One for this price is amazing, two is out of</li>
            <li>Charging does take more time than you would think, but got a good deal on the twin pack.</li>
            <li>Nice thing about this twin-pack, I use one till it&#x27;s drained and switch.  </li>
            <li>The truly important part, how well it cleans teeth, is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>and I spect, clean very nice</li>
            <li>So far, great experience!</li>
            <li>This is much more effective at cleaning your teeth and best of all, they dont damage your gum if you know how to use it properly.  </li>
            <li>We both love them.  </li>
            <li>better</li>
            <li>this is compatible with most if not all of oral-b brush heads, even the \\&quot;precision clean\\</li>
            <li>If everyone uses this, dentists will lose lots of money &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof:</li>
            <li>thing to note is with most electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>am extremely satisfied and have recommended the Oral-B to others.  </li>
            <li>The unit  will stay charged for up to 10 days, so most trips will be covered.  </li>
            <li>and I love the carrying case that came with it.  </li>
            <li>This is better than the original Oral-B--the variance in length of bristles is quite effective also.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well and charges nicely and I got a great price on the twin pack, otherwise I think there would be better brushes out there if you had the pay the regular price.</li>
            <li>Seemed like a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>there is no need to take the charger with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to know with power toothbrushes to get the best life span from them ( the only problem I&#x27;ve had is when I dropped it onto a tile floor)</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so clean!</li>
            <li>but, so far, I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>very powerful better than the sonicare which i&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful and intelligent than my old s18, and it cleans my tooth more thoroughly too.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean, it really does a good job.</li>
            <li>; I guess that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Super good, I have been using oral-b toothbrush for more than6 years, the old one broke after all these years</li>
            <li>a huge box with them.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>We used to use the cheap battery operated Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My switch from manual to this electric toothbrush was smooth.</li>
            <li>There is a pressure indicator light that tells you when you are brushing</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I enjoy using this electronic tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Works great and after using  for the last month I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product,  built to last.</li>
            <li>However, once you get the hang of the whole thing it is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The travel cases are so convenient and secure, snapping the handle and brush head into well fitted compartments.</li>
            <li>The units are very sturdy and have a nice feel.</li>
            <li>I already had an electric tooth brush and thought it did a good job, but this one outshines it by far.  </li>
            <li>I love this tooth cleaner, it is my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>which provides a highly significant removal of plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is our second Oral-B Electric toothbrush, and by far the best one we have used.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>These model feels more powerful and the 30-sec quarter alert is useful.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean</li>
            <li>I trust my judgement in keeping teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>I have had several good electric toothbrushes over the years, and I have found that I prefer the Oral-B versions over the Sonicare ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the price for two complete toothbrushes and chargers and travel cases.  </li>
            <li>very cute&amp;nice,i&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li>Using it for the full two minutes is key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this has to work better than my old unit and that worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This Oral-B design has some great improvements over my other brand, the Sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never seen a battery wear out so quickly</li>
            <li>travel case is a great bonus, charge it and go, it should stay charged for at least five days if not longer so most of the time</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the circular motion as that gives you a more focused clean, but for those who don&#x27;t want to spend that much time, or prefer this style of motion instead, I like this Oral-B more than its Sonicare counterparts.</li>
            <li>Great product for teaching kids how to brush correctly and the bristles are not abrasive but provide just the right amount of spinning heads to get into the crevices and down to the gums.  </li>
            <li>I was attracted by the much better price (about half the cost of Sonicare when purchased as a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, if you compare this product to a manual brush, you are getting a big upgrade, and I do believe the claim of 100% more plaque removal.</li>
            <li>Since starting to use this product my teeth have become much cleaner and bright.  </li>
            <li>The settings allow for gentle cleansing or polishing; qualities that were important to me.  </li>
            <li>I can always tell a difference in the brush strength right after I charge it than when I leave it for a day or two</li>
            <li>When the price was right</li>
            <li>The feather mode is nice to start out with, move up to the next level when you are ready.</li>
            <li>I really dislike this tooth brush and would &amp;#34;Never&amp;#34; buy another one ever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use Qral-B.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B has a different side-to-side mechanical motion which more closely mimics manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the manual Oral-B toothbrushes for many years now and at my dental hygienist&#x27;s urging finally decided to try a powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had various versions of Oral-Bs for many</li>
            <li>The timing device allows you to brush more efficiently as you are not inaccurately estimating how long you have been working in one area.  </li>
            <li>It ensures you are brushing completely for the full time.  </li>
            <li>This feels so solid and really gets my teeth clean!  </li>
            <li>Actually look forward to brushing now, and this brush makes it easy.</li>
            <li>It certainly cleans your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B simply offers of an up/down wide sweeping motion, whereas the Phillips Sonicare has some kind of high frequency pulsating super high speed vibration that creates bristle movement so fast and so strong that you get the impression that besides the contact with the bristles, your teeth are actually cleaned with tiny jets of water movement shot in all directions by the super fast bristle motion.</li>
            <li>The red light warns me when I am using too much pressure</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>/&gt;However if compared to Phillips Sonicare, this Oral-B leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>In contrast this Oral-b has a pressure sensor that flashes a red light and then the motor stops.</li>
            <li>the travel case seems very flimsy and broke in 2 after one use - not a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset about it.</li>
            <li>Great deal price-wise as I found these on a lightning deal just when my wif and I both needed to upgrade our aging Braun/Oral-B exhausted power toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Got this through an Amazon Prime Deal and have really come to like these brushes.  </li>
            <li>It has an incredibly fast motor and it can be a bit tricky rinsing out the brush when you are done.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>This will really upgrade your quality of dental care.  </li>
            <li>The action, or motion of the head is different than the older model and seems to be more efficient.  </li>
            <li>The brush signals you when to change to a different part of your mouth to clean.</li>
            <li>I remove the brush head each time and place it in the travel case to keep it clean until my next use.  </li>
            <li>Theoretically speaking, this will last for many years to come since most other electronic toothbrush becomes disposable once their batteries lose its capacity.  </li>
            <li>main difference between this particular model versus most other Oral-B&#x27;s is that while the others have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, this one has a longer brush head and sweeps back and forth to cover more area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.</li>
            <li>The strength of the motor will gradually weaken to the point where you end up having to charge them daily or every two days(as opposed to the description on most saying they can last up to a week).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I did so well with the old unit that I probably won&#x27;t go the whole 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Teeth right away felt cleaner and with Crest 3D white toothpaste even whiter.</li>
            <li>Still, I reasoned, perhaps Oral B has come up with a new and improved version.  </li>
            <li>I have owned another brand of electric toothbrush, was not pleased with it, but didn&#x27;t know there was a better option.  </li>
            <li>i pretty much bought this twin-pack at the price of just one pack at all other retailers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, this particular model has 3 \\&quot;sets\\&quot; of bristles: the top set is for those hard to reach back teeth, the main sets for the teeth surface, and the in-between sets to reach in-between</li>
            <li>They worked very well and held their charge for the entire 7 days without need of charging.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush is NOT for anyone with caps, fillings, dental work,  a sensitive mouth or gum issues...  </li>
            <li>Now, if you have sensitive teeth, then this may prove to be an advantage.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the beep when the brush stops working every 30 seconds to tell you to move on to the next sector.</li>
            <li>Was worried about using it on my sensitive teeth but not a problem.</li>
            <li>I have an Oral B toothbrush and induction charger that is about 10 years old - frankly I see no reason why it would not remain working for another 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The head on this unit is shaped more like a regular toothbrush and has several different modes of operation - the instructions also say that it has a timer to help pace you through a cleaning lasting 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>So far, the charge time has also proven to be quite acceptable (one week + between chargings).</li>
            <li>, you make the initial settings the first time and it will beep-beep and pause as you need to adjust to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>There is a pressure indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and as my son commented, it actually makes the daily routine of brushing something to look forward to!</li>
            <li>several times with Sonicare as new models came out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an Oral-B professional Care prior to this purchase</li>
            <li>But it is slippery and has a bend to it that makes it even easier to drop if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>A week after I purchased this item Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep 4000 Twin-Pack</li>
            <li>I wanted the professional series 4000 toothbrush, which is the 1 pack, then thought for only 1.5x</li>
            <li>This was a fabulous deal and product -- 2 for the price of one -- recommended by my dentist -- improvement in condition of gums from previous check-up -- however, the round brush was used and recommended over the Deep Sweep brush.</li>

            <li> I was attracted by the much better price (about half the cost of Sonicare when purchased as a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, if you compare this product to a manual brush, you are getting a big upgrade, and I do believe the claim of 100% more plaque removal.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this product my teeth have become much cleaner and bright.  </li>
            <li> The settings allow for gentle cleansing or polishing; qualities that were important to me.  </li>
            <li> I can always tell a difference in the brush strength right after I charge it than when I leave it for a day or two</li>
            <li> When the price was right</li>
            <li> The feather mode is nice to start out with, move up to the next level when you are ready.</li>
            <li> I really dislike this tooth brush and would &amp;#34;Never&amp;#34; buy another one ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use Qral-B.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B has a different side-to-side mechanical motion which more closely mimics manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the manual Oral-B toothbrushes for many years now and at my dental hygienist&#x27;s urging finally decided to try a powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various versions of Oral-Bs for many</li>
            <li> The timing device allows you to brush more efficiently as you are not inaccurately estimating how long you have been working in one area.  </li>
            <li> It ensures you are brushing completely for the full time.  </li>
            <li> This feels so solid and really gets my teeth clean!  </li>
            <li> Actually look forward to brushing now, and this brush makes it easy.</li>
            <li> It certainly cleans your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B simply offers of an up/down wide sweeping motion, whereas the Phillips Sonicare has some kind of high frequency pulsating super high speed vibration that creates bristle movement so fast and so strong that you get the impression that besides the contact with the bristles, your teeth are actually cleaned with tiny jets of water movement shot in all directions by the super fast bristle motion.</li>
            <li> The red light warns me when I am using too much pressure</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> /&gt;However if compared to Phillips Sonicare, this Oral-B leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> In contrast this Oral-b has a pressure sensor that flashes a red light and then the motor stops.</li>
            <li> the travel case seems very flimsy and broke in 2 after one use - not a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset about it.</li>
            <li> Great deal price-wise as I found these on a lightning deal just when my wif and I both needed to upgrade our aging Braun/Oral-B exhausted power toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Got this through an Amazon Prime Deal and have really come to like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> It has an incredibly fast motor and it can be a bit tricky rinsing out the brush when you are done.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This will really upgrade your quality of dental care.  </li>
            <li> The action, or motion of the head is different than the older model and seems to be more efficient.  </li>
            <li> The brush signals you when to change to a different part of your mouth to clean.</li>
            <li> I remove the brush head each time and place it in the travel case to keep it clean until my next use.  </li>
            <li> Theoretically speaking, this will last for many years to come since most other electronic toothbrush becomes disposable once their batteries lose its capacity.  </li>
            <li> main difference between this particular model versus most other Oral-B&#x27;s is that while the others have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, this one has a longer brush head and sweeps back and forth to cover more area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.</li>
            <li> The strength of the motor will gradually weaken to the point where you end up having to charge them daily or every two days(as opposed to the description on most saying they can last up to a week).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I did so well with the old unit that I probably won&#x27;t go the whole 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Teeth right away felt cleaner and with Crest 3D white toothpaste even whiter.</li>
            <li> Still, I reasoned, perhaps Oral B has come up with a new and improved version.  </li>
            <li> I have owned another brand of electric toothbrush, was not pleased with it, but didn&#x27;t know there was a better option.  </li>
            <li> i pretty much bought this twin-pack at the price of just one pack at all other retailers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, this particular model has 3 \\&quot;sets\\&quot; of bristles: the top set is for those hard to reach back teeth, the main sets for the teeth surface, and the in-between sets to reach in-between</li>
            <li> They worked very well and held their charge for the entire 7 days without need of charging.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is NOT for anyone with caps, fillings, dental work,  a sensitive mouth or gum issues...  </li>
            <li> Now, if you have sensitive teeth, then this may prove to be an advantage.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the beep when the brush stops working every 30 seconds to tell you to move on to the next sector.</li>
            <li> Was worried about using it on my sensitive teeth but not a problem.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B toothbrush and induction charger that is about 10 years old - frankly I see no reason why it would not remain working for another 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The head on this unit is shaped more like a regular toothbrush and has several different modes of operation - the instructions also say that it has a timer to help pace you through a cleaning lasting 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> So far, the charge time has also proven to be quite acceptable (one week + between chargings).</li>
            <li> , you make the initial settings the first time and it will beep-beep and pause as you need to adjust to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> There is a pressure indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and as my son commented, it actually makes the daily routine of brushing something to look forward to!</li>
            <li> several times with Sonicare as new models came out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B professional Care prior to this purchase</li>
            <li> But it is slippery and has a bend to it that makes it even easier to drop if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> A week after I purchased this item Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep 4000 Twin-Pack</li>
            <li> I wanted the professional series 4000 toothbrush, which is the 1 pack, then thought for only 1.5x</li>
            <li> This was a fabulous deal and product -- 2 for the price of one -- recommended by my dentist -- improvement in condition of gums from previous check-up -- however, the round brush was used and recommended over the Deep Sweep brush.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts not quite as long as advertised, but still for several days.</li>
            <li> I found that the Sonicare toothbrushes just don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> , you have to realize and beware that the battery don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, we need long time to charge, almost 24hours.</li>
            <li> The final quarter round (4 quadrants of course) makes a bigger beep and gestures that you are done but will allow you to continue further if you desire.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this long</li>
            <li> and it does work a little differently from the old version with the tiny round spinning head.  </li>
            <li> I also got 6 each of the round and regular brushes and alternate them.</li>
            <li> We got this last month to replace a 10-15 year old Oral-B that was slowly fading into the mist.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend swears his teeth are whiter after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the 2 pack is a completely different product, it is the Deep Sweep toothbrush that has a very different motion and a larger brush head.</li>
            <li> Our other Oral-B brushes would stop after 2 minutes this one does not.</li>
            <li> Careful!  </li>
            <li> (I had worn down the tooth enamel with the other brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I gave the second brush to my fiancée who has never liked any powered brushes, but she does use this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t compromise your teeth with a little savings on your electric bill</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll brush a little longer -</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time to charge -- there&#x27;s not a significant difference in the movement of the head</li>
            <li> and it does take a little adaption in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> &quot; ones (the round brush head).  </li>
            <li> less tartar build up on my teeth!</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel like you just came from your half year cleaning!  </li>
            <li> If you do not brush hard, this will not be a problem for you, but if you are like me, it will frustrate you how weak the mechanical system of this brush is, because it simply will not let you brush hard.</li>
            <li> The charging unit itself is small</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth hard (always have) and the Sonicare keeps going, no mater</li>
            <li> how hard I press it against my teeth as I brush.</li>
            <li> it reminds you when you brush too hard, and prompts you to move to another area of your mouth after 30 seconds in one place.  </li>
            <li> I find my self having to constantly charging it, drive&#x27;s me crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time user of sonic toothbrushes because I never liked mechanical brushes which use a rotary brush.</li>
            <li> heads move at a rapid, controlled speed (no more toothbrush abrasion!)</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and brushing my teeth properly can be painful in the morning.  </li>
            <li> is too expensive, will buy compatible head not the originals.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this toothbrush</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Recent dentist appointment reflects how well the toothbrushes work....less tartar build up on my teeth!</li>
            <li> My husband got me this toothbrush for Christmas. We used to use the cheap battery operated Oral B toothbrushes. What a difference! Your teeth will feel like you&#x27;ve just left the dentist chair. My teeth felt so clean! You won&#x27;t regret buying this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I really dislike this tooth brush and would &amp;#34;Never&amp;#34; buy another one ever! I never seen a battery wear out so quickly I find my self having to constantly charging it, drive&#x27;s me crazy. I had an Oral-B professional Care prior to this purchase and I loved that one, my advice, stay with what you like.</li>
            <li> We got this last month to replace a 10-15 year old Oral-B that was slowly fading into the mist.  This feels so solid and really gets my teeth clean!  The action, or motion of the head is different than the older model and seems to be more efficient.  Getting 2 for this price was a steal.  We almost got one from a big box store that is well known for deals, but the reviews gave me the impression that the motor was not as substantial.  So far, great experience!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and one for my boyfriend.  We both love them.  My boyfriend swears his teeth are whiter after only a few uses.  It certainly cleans your teeth and gums.  My teeth feel so much cleaner and I also think they look brighter.</li>
            <li> better and I spect, clean very nice the timer cleaner it&#x27;s perfect I will recomended a lot, need to buy a spare brush soon</li>
            <li> i pretty much bought this twin-pack at the price of just one pack at all other retailers.  this is compatible with most if not all of oral-b brush heads, even the \\&quot;precision clean\\&quot; ones (the round brush head).  battery can be replaced once they lose their capacity.  Theoretically speaking, this will last for many years to come since most other electronic toothbrush becomes disposable once their batteries lose its capacity.  Once you go electronic toothbrush, you will not go back to the manual ones.  This is much more effective at cleaning your teeth and best of all, they dont damage your gum if you know how to use it properly.  Oh did I tell you, this saves you a good minute compared to the manual toothbrush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;listen to me, buy this and send me a thank-you card later.  If everyone uses this, dentists will lose lots of money &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Super good, I have been using oral-b toothbrush for more than6 years, the old one broke after all these years so I ordered this one. It&#x27;s more powerful and intelligent than my old s18, and it cleans my tooth more thoroughly too. I like this toothbrush and will stay with it for the next 6 years. PS: the only thing unsatisfactory would be replacement head is too expensive, will buy compatible head not the originals.</li>
            <li> This is better than the original Oral-B--the variance in length of bristles is quite effective also.  The charge lasts not quite as long as advertised, but still for several days.</li>
            <li> a huge box with them.&lt;br /&gt;Good tools with teeth.It&#x27;s my first time to use Qral-B.&lt;br /&gt;However, we need long time to charge, almost 24hours.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and brushing my teeth properly can be painful in the morning.  This makes me and my dentist happy.</li>
            <li> Amazing value getting 2 electric brushes for this price. My switch from manual to this electric toothbrush was smooth. Teeth right away felt cleaner and with Crest 3D white toothpaste even whiter. Actually look forward to brushing now, and this brush makes it easy.</li>
            <li> I have had several good electric toothbrushes over the years, and I have found that I prefer the Oral-B versions over the Sonicare ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference between this particular model versus most other Oral-B&#x27;s is that while the others have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, this one has a longer brush head and sweeps back and forth to cover more area.

I found that the Sonicare toothbrushes just don&#x27;t last very long. They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof: several times with Sonicare as new models came out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is with most electric toothbrushes, you have to realize and beware that the battery don&#x27;t last very long. In fact, I have never had an electric toothbrush that can hold a charge over two years. The strength of the motor will gradually weaken to the point where you end up having to charge them daily or every two days(as opposed to the description on most saying they can last up to a week). Don&#x27;t compromise your teeth with a little savings on your electric bill - just charge it every 1 or 2 days. I can always tell a difference in the brush strength right after I charge it than when I leave it for a day or two uncharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this particular model has 3 \\&quot;sets\\&quot; of bristles: the top set is for those hard to reach back teeth, the main sets for the teeth surface, and the in-between sets to reach in-between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.

            <li> We just brought these tooth brushes and took them on vacation. They worked very well and held their charge for the entire 7 days without need of charging.They did an excellent job cleaning our teeth. The brush signals you when to change to a different part of your mouth to clean. It keeps working until you stop the brush.Our other Oral-B brushes would stop after 2 minutes this one does not.</li>
            <li> This is our second Oral-B Electric toothbrush, and by far the best one we have used. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is NOT for anyone with caps, fillings, dental work,  a sensitive mouth or gum issues...  a buzz saw to your mouth.... even on it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; mode... I used it 4 times and my gums and mouth were saw for 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> Bought this pair to replace a pair of Phillips Sonicare that are breaking apart after two years of use. I was attracted by the much better price (about half the cost of Sonicare when purchased as a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, if you compare this product to a manual brush, you are getting a big upgrade, and I do believe the claim of 100% more plaque removal. In that sense you would be getting your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;However if compared to Phillips Sonicare, this Oral-B leaves much to be desired.

            <li> Very pleased with this purchase. Nice to have an electric again! I wish the refill brushes weren&#x27;t so pricey, though.</li>
            <li> This was a fabulous deal and product -- 2 for the price of one -- recommended by my dentist -- improvement in condition of gums from previous check-up -- however, the round brush was used and recommended over the Deep Sweep brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works pretty well. But it is slippery and has a bend to it that makes it even easier to drop if you&#x27;re not careful. I really don&#x27;t like the beep when the brush stops working every 30 seconds to tell you to move on to the next sector. How about a beep without turning off? It cleans well and charges nicely and I got a great price on the twin pack, otherwise I think there would be better brushes out there if you had the pay the regular price.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this product my teeth have become much cleaner and bright.  Both my wife and I enjoy using this electronic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> very powerful better than the sonicare which i&#x27;ve used for years. you won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this toothbrush</li>
            <li> These are great! I wanted a good quality toothbrush for my wife and I that we could take with us when we travel. These are not &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; but they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought this as Todays Deal.  Received 2 for the price of one.  Works well, holds a charge.  Was worried about using it on my sensitive teeth but not a problem.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shut off after the four quadrant cycles but if you want to do some &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; I guess that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B toothbrush and induction charger that is about 10 years old - frankly I see no reason why it would not remain working for another 10 years.  Still, I reasoned, perhaps Oral B has come up with a new and improved version.  I liked the price for two complete toothbrushes and chargers and travel cases.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it does work a little differently from the old version with the tiny round spinning head.  The head on this unit is shaped more like a regular toothbrush and has several different modes of operation - the instructions also say that it has a timer to help pace you through a cleaning lasting 2 minutes.  Oops, I&#x27;ve been streaking through my brushings in about 30 seconds.  Maybe I&#x27;ll brush a little longer - but I did so well with the old unit that I probably won&#x27;t go the whole 2 minutes.  I&#x27;m sure this has to work better than my old unit and that worked pretty well.  Just one thing - the travel case seems very flimsy and broke in 2 after one use - not a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> A week after I purchased this item Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep 4000 Twin-Pack one of them stop to working. I can&#x27;t charge and use it anymore. I&#x27;m really upset about it.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time user of sonic toothbrushes because I never liked mechanical brushes which use a rotary brush. This Oral-B has a different side-to-side mechanical motion which more closely mimics manual brushing. My teeth feel really clean after I use it. I gave the second brush to my fiancée who has never liked any powered brushes, but she does use this one. So far, the charge time has also proven to be quite acceptable (one week + between chargings).</li>
            <li> Works great! Charging does take more time than you would think, but got a good deal on the twin pack.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth cleaner, it is my first electric toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt so clean, it really does a good job.</li>
            <li> I have owned another brand of electric toothbrush, was not pleased with it, but didn&#x27;t know there was a better option.  This Oral-B design has some great improvements over my other brand, the Sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanliness of the design is an improvement---no places for gunk to collect.  I remove the brush head each time and place it in the travel case to keep it clean until my next use.  The design of the brush head reaches all the nooks and crannies in my mouth.  The red light warns me when I am using too much pressure (I had worn down the tooth enamel with the other brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied and have recommended the Oral-B to others.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my dental hygienist says about my teeth next time!</li>
            <li> Careful!  The 2 pack on this webpage is not the same product as the 1 pack.  I wanted the professional series 4000 toothbrush, which is the 1 pack, then thought for only 1.5x the price of one I can get two of them.  Unfortunately, the 2 pack is a completely different product, it is the Deep Sweep toothbrush that has a very different motion and a larger brush head.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B 4000 for almost 2 months now and my teeth have never felt cleaner. I&#x27;ve used the manual Oral-B toothbrushes for many years now and at my dental hygienist&#x27;s urging finally decided to try a powered toothbrush. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t do it sooner.</li>
            <li> Works great and after using  for the last month I I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> very cute&amp;nice,i&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before and I should have because this works great.  At $89 for two can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Cleaner for my teeth. I will do anything to keep my teeth in my head. So just brush away. Keep my teeth until I am in the grave</li>
            <li> Great deal price-wise as I found these on a lightning deal just when my wif and I both needed to upgrade our aging Braun/Oral-B exhausted power toothbrushes.  These model feels more powerful and the 30-sec quarter alert is useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a top of the line product. At our office this is the &#x27;Cadillac&#x27; version of power toothbrushing.&lt;br /&gt; One for this price is amazing, two is out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads move at a rapid, controlled speed (no more toothbrush abrasion!) which provides a highly significant removal of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer will alert you when to move on from one quadrant to the next. Using it for the full two minutes is key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is a great bonus, charge it and go, it should stay charged for at least five days if not longer so most of the time there is no need to take the charger with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to know with power toothbrushes to get the best life span from them ( the only problem I&#x27;ve had is when I dropped it onto a tile floor) is to charge fully, then unplug the unit. You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time to charge -- there&#x27;s not a significant difference in the movement of the head but you will notice its a tad slower. I&#x27;ve had various versions of Oral-Bs for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product,  built to last. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Got this through an Amazon Prime Deal and have really come to like these brushes.  I have one for myself and another for my son. We both like the timing aspect and it does take a little adaption in the beginning.  It has an incredibly fast motor and it can be a bit tricky rinsing out the brush when you are done.  However, once you get the hang of the whole thing it is an amazing product.  Got this based on the recommendation of my dentist and when I saw the sale considered it total serendipity.  By and by, you make the initial settings the first time and it will beep-beep and pause as you need to adjust to the next quadrant of your mouth.  It ensures you are brushing completely for the full time.  The final quarter round (4 quadrants of course) makes a bigger beep and gestures that you are done but will allow you to continue further if you desire.  The settings allow for gentle cleansing or polishing; qualities that were important to me.  Your teeth will feel like you just came from your half year cleaning!  Great product for teaching kids how to brush correctly and the bristles are not abrasive but provide just the right amount of spinning heads to get into the crevices and down to the gums.  Highly recommend this product and as my son commented, it actually makes the daily routine of brushing something to look forward to!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent  product.  The timing device allows you to brush more efficiently as you are not inaccurately estimating how long you have been working in one area.  The travel cases are so convenient and secure, snapping the handle and brush head into well fitted compartments. The unit  will stay charged for up to 10 days, so most trips will be covered.  The charging unit itself is small so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the bathroom counter.The truly important part, how well it cleans teeth, is remarkable.  I already had an electric tooth brush and thought it did a good job, but this one outshines it by far.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.  This will really upgrade your quality of dental care.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this long but, so far, I&#x27;m happy with it.  My teeth feel really clean and I love the carrying case that came with it.  I kept one and gave one to my granddaughter.  Seemed like a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I have used these for 2 months now. I still use regular POH brushes once a day. The 4000&#x27;s twice a day. I also got 6 each of the round and regular brushes and alternate them. Gums took a week to get used to the power brushing. Nice thing about this twin-pack, I use one till it&#x27;s drained and switch.  The units are very sturdy and have a nice feel. I am 69 and was worried something might happen where I could no longer manipulate regular brushes so I got to work researching. I went through the Electric Toothbrush Recommender on OralB dotcom. When the price was right I got this pair.  I have not had a cavity in 44 years, so I trust my judgement in keeping teeth clean.  Stay informed on health topics then do the best you can.   Check out my note on POH dental floss for another great product.</li>
            <li> Really only needed one, when I ordered it, but then I had a friend who was in need and I gave her the second one.  I like this cause it reminds you when you brush too hard, and prompts you to move to another area of your mouth after 30 seconds in one place.  The feather mode is nice to start out with, move up to the next level when you are ready.</li>
