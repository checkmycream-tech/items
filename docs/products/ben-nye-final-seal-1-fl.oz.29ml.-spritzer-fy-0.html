            <li>I have never used any kind of setting product.</li>
            <li>Absolute best thing you could buy to set make up!</li>
            <li>When it takes me about an hour to get my make up for a particular costume perfect, I want it to stay put.</li>
            <li>I did expect more from the product, but I may need a better primer in order for this product to work wonders!</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to get alot more than 1fl.</li>
            <li>It was okay ...</li>
            <li>My makeup still looked pretty darn good for sweating/</li>
            <li>You think you&#x27;re getting a good deal, when really you&#x27;re getting scammed.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly, and works well</li>
            <li>Sets makeup for easily 6-8 hours with no need to re-apply.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light feeling and evaporates quickly.  </li>
            <li>After washing my face, moisturizing, and priming, I use final seal spray and my make up is good for twelve hours or more.  </li>
            <li>I was weary about buying it since it had no reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I did, and now I&#x27;m leaving a review since these help so much.</li>
            <li>Smells minty fresh</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Those with sensitive skin may want to buy the smallest bottle to test it out first!</li>

            <li>I live in San Diego where it&#x27;s hot 10/12 months during the year</li>
            <li>The only thing it doesn&#x27;t keep on is lip make ups; mostly because of the constant talking and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any makeup professional, bride, or anyone living in a warmer climate!!</li>

            <li>the Urban Decay sprays don&#x27;t work for you, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I go to conventions frequently and spend a lot of time being photographed.</li>
            <li>The stuffiness and heat of a convention center doesn&#x27;t take away from the quality of the product no matter how much I sweat or touch my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have never used any kind of setting product. I like the way this works. It actually minimized the perspiration on my face.</li>
            <li> Was having problems with facial sweat due to a medication and my makeup would literally come off after 2 hours.  This kept my makeup on all day/night.. CLOSE YOUR EYES WHILE YOU SPRAY!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make your decision based on the picture. I made the  mistake of looking at the picture and then ordering, without looking at the fl. oz. Based on the picture I thought I was going to get alot more than 1fl. oz, it&#x27;s my mistake though.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with my makeup staying on. I&#x27;m not oily either. I&#x27;m usually combination - very dry (in the winter)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff actually works! I used it at work where I work in an indoor waterpark. My makeup still looked pretty darn good for sweating/the humidity/ being splashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Urban Decay sprays don&#x27;t work for you, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Came very quickly, and works well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it for my cosplay makeup stuff! I was weary about buying it since it had no reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I did, and now I&#x27;m leaving a review since these help so much. (it comes in a little spritzer bottle)</li>
            <li> I work 8 hour shifts sometimes even 12 and I spray this on after I&#x27;m dome applying all my makeup and it stays all day I am really impressed</li>
            <li> Absolute best thing you could buy to set make up! I live in San Diego where it&#x27;s hot 10/12 months during the year and this has been a lifesaver! I&#x27;m a face sweater and with any other setting sprays (even urban decay) I would sweat myself a reverse mustache and it looked awful! Thankfully I heard about this product and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since!</li>
            <li> It was okay ... I did expect more from the product, but I may need a better primer in order for this product to work wonders! I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that they would put a picture up that was so deceiving !! You think you&#x27;re getting a good deal, when really you&#x27;re getting scammed. You end up getting a little 1 oz bottle which in my opinion is sample size. For over $14 after shipping? ridiculous. They need to change the picture on this!</li>
            <li> I tear up a lot-sometimes emotionally driven but other times it&#x27;s allergies, so tis product protects my make up from that.  I will be anxious to see how it does in the heat of summer.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wedding makeup in the southern heat. Nothing melted off!!! Highly reccomend. 1oz bottle enough for numerous makeup applications! Smells minty fresh</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! Great quality. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I go to conventions frequently and spend a lot of time being photographed. When it takes me about an hour to get my make up for a particular costume perfect, I want it to stay put. After washing my face, moisturizing, and priming, I use final seal spray and my make up is good for twelve hours or more.

            <li> Item is deceptive the picture shows a big amount next to the ounce bottle. But you just get the 1 oz bottle for what I thought was allot of money.</li>
            <li> This made my makeup stay on flawlessly overnight, however I ended up being severely allergic to it. Those with sensitive skin may want to buy the smallest bottle to test it out first! I&#x27;m really bummed because it worked SO well otherwise.</li>
            <li> I got this final seal thinking that it would come with everything in the picture. It only came with the tiny spray bottle but works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Final Seal prior to my wedding day and swear by it!  It has a very light feeling and evaporates quickly.  I have used it several time since to set my make up on hot days or days when I know I will be hugging!  Sets makeup for easily 6-8 hours with no need to re-apply.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any makeup professional, bride, or anyone living in a warmer climate!!</li>
