            <li>Good value!</li>
            <li>Another good thing for your hair!  </li>
            <li>Great for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>She said rubberband&#x27;s elasticity has been great, so there it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great for my girlfriend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not that great.</li>
            <li>Makes it look great and</li>
            <li>Great hair ties.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to put my hair up do.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re always durable and have great grip.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>They are great nonetheless.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>These hair ties aren&#x27;t the best, but they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>and it helps the purpose of buy - good one</li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>Not the best fit for her, though</li>
            <li>This is a good price for these elastics.  </li>
            <li>Good add-on item...</li>
            <li>Good quantity for the price.</li>
            <li>They are more attractive than rubber bands and don&#x27;t break from sun exposure like rubber bands.  </li>
            <li>My sisters and I go through so many hair-ties that it is nice to be able to find ones that are of great quality and a great price.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite ties, they don&#x27;t have any metal, keep their shape and come in good colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no metal piece catching on your hair.</li>
            <li>It also looks nice and sleek in the hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors that came in this set, as well.</li>
            <li>They are very strong.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I don&#x27;t love is that they fall off and slip very easily</li>
            <li>so I hair ties are very important in my life.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Would like more choice flexibility.</li>
            <li>have purchased many of these and will keep doing so.</li>
            <li>They were too snug to wrap more than twice, but slipped when wrapped twice.    </li>
            <li>It was a nice, smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love no-damage elastics by scunci.</li>
            <li>I put labels over the top of the bottle cover, and then pinch  it around the neck of the bottle with the elastic.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those of us constantly losing hair ties.</li>
            <li>Love all the colors these come in, the drawback is often they broke where the seam was-</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re not terribly substantial.</li>
            <li>I got this because our cats love to chase them.</li>
            <li>Love that you can add these on.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy!</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them and they are cheaper then most retail stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these in the store and they&#x27;ve been okay.  </li>
            <li>I wrap them around the top of each hanger.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want from a scrunci?</li>
            <li>These work well, better than some i&#x27;ve had..</li>
            <li>I need to write more words, but they are just hair ties.....</li>
            <li>The multiple colors are great too!</li>
            <li>Take it easy and they hold up a bit better.</li>
            <li>Most of these hair bands break easily.</li>
            <li>same as the photo, good stuff for a good price</li>
            <li>These bands work great, but they snap if you stretch them too far.</li>
            <li>easy getting into hair and more importantly...</li>
            <li>so, easy choice as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They break too easily.</li>
            <li>I like the no-damage bands, but often they are not as strong.</li>
            <li>Well made and strong.</li>
            <li>seems to be strong and well made.</li>
            <li>they weren&#x27;t as strongly stretchy as some others (like Goody), where I can wrap it around my ponytail 3 times and it holds it all day.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.. Very comfortable!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>When I take portrait photos I sometimes use a piece of nylon stocking instead of filter to provide a softening effect on the faces (hides fine wrinkles), I use this elastic to hold the nylon square over my lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Grabbed these no damage elastics as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; item to get free shipping on my eyelash curler purchase.</li>
            <li>I use two to secure my hair.</li>
            <li>I got it with free shipping because of my student account with amazon.</li>
            <li>I got these because there was no metal piece in it to snag my hair, and they work great, especially when I&#x27;m working out.</li>
            <li>so I could get free shipping.</li>
            <li>but wouldn&#x27;t buy if I didn&#x27;t need a cheap product to get me into &amp;#34;free-shipping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great pony tails, very easy to put on and not too tight.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my hair which is really curly and very long.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and these work great.</li>
            <li>a more positive note</li>
            <li>I needed large to wrap better around hair.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I do not get too much of my hair in this is any.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a definite win thus far. :)</li>
            <li>They were kind of old...</li>
            <li>these scrunchies are really good although the colors does not look like how it is shown in the picture the colors actually look brighter</li>
            <li>Good, lasting hair ties.</li>
            <li>some of the elastics snapped on first use... but a majority of them were fine.  </li>
            <li>worth the buy</li>
            <li>The near-invisibility of the place the ends join is nice, because I never have to try to place the band in such a way as to keep that part from showing.  </li>
            <li>Great for my hair type and do not break/stretch out as fast as some other brands.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very precise color, know that the pink and teal pictured here are lighter and dustier than the actual elastics, which are a bright pink and bright teal.</li>
            <li>but they were not the right size for me.</li>
            <li>This don&#x27;t last there very cheap</li>
            <li>They like them very much because these do not have the metal clip that pulls their hair.</li>
            <li>Some of them break in the first try and they stretch with use.</li>
            <li>Just be warned, the colors are brownish neutrals, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>so it does not damage hair yet stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>These break so often with the first use, will not buy again.....</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the product and I really do love them.</li>
            <li>so it may last longer for others :)  </li>
            <li>Quality exactly what you expect from Scunci.</li>
            <li>There are many of them and the price is decent but they stretch out quickly and several of them have snapped on my hand during the first use.</li>
            <li>These retain their elasticity pretty well, I like that they don&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
            <li>Other than size, they are a nice product.</li>
            <li>Good Product - will definitely buy it in future-</li>
            <li>great colors, they don&#x27;t pull your hair out, great for thin and thick hair.  </li>
            <li>When the seller states the are large hair bands</li>
            <li>Strong elastic holds my very heavy pony tail nicely with no slipping during the day.  </li>
            <li>But they do the job of holding my hair back and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>stuff at a reasonable price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my girlfriend thanks to these.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t loosen up on me as much as others</li>
            <li>but they work very well</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>I have very thinning hair from illness and medication used to treat it.</li>
            <li>Only good if you are not being active and to throw your hair up fast.</li>
            <li>Also, I will probably end up buying more some other day.</li>
            <li>Would not waste my money!!  </li>
            <li>This not unreasonable, just normal wear which is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, these work for a variety of hair types: They hold my thinner, very fine, straight hair with three loops, and my daughters thick, voluminous, curly hair with two, and they don&#x27;t grab out hair upon removal.</li>
            <li>Hopefully that helps you, because these did not work for another reviewer with fine hair--she described hers as \\&quot;extremely fine\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>but they do live up to the claim of no-damage.</li>
            <li>That is a new record.</li>
            <li>The quality is decent, but will stretch out quickly if you get them wet while in your hair.</li>
            <li>made- very soft fabric covering the elastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine so typically hair elastics break my hair when I pull them out.</li>
            <li>No snagging and far stretchy than the cheap ones from other companies.</li>
            <li>that being said, the only reason I have it 4 stars was because the colors of the elastics that were shipped wasn&#x27;t the pretty ones that are pictured.</li>
            <li>this Christmas (2012), and the first thing she did was take a blue one and put it in her hair.  </li>
            <li>The higher I try to make it, the further down it slips, so these elastics evidently don&#x27;t have the strength to do more than bind... certainly not to lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for cheap hair ties, these are the ones, but if you&#x27;re looking to have hair ties that will last a long time, I would steer clear from these.</li>
            <li>every second rubber band snaps open at first time use!</li>
            <li>Purchased for gf, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>My two year old daughter</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>These were expected to be Large..</li>
            <li>They hold pony well with no slipping during the day.</li>
            <li>;  right here, along with the 500 of these I bought for crazy cheap.  Buy em.</li>
            <li>These are poorly glued and come apart too easily.</li>
            <li>but I also have super thick hair.</li>

            <li> Quality exactly what you expect from Scunci.</li>
            <li> There are many of them and the price is decent but they stretch out quickly and several of them have snapped on my hand during the first use.</li>
            <li> These retain their elasticity pretty well, I like that they don&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
            <li> Other than size, they are a nice product.</li>
            <li> Good Product - will definitely buy it in future-</li>
            <li> great colors, they don&#x27;t pull your hair out, great for thin and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> When the seller states the are large hair bands</li>
            <li> Strong elastic holds my very heavy pony tail nicely with no slipping during the day.  </li>
            <li> But they do the job of holding my hair back and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> stuff at a reasonable price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my girlfriend thanks to these.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t loosen up on me as much as others</li>
            <li> but they work very well</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> I have very thinning hair from illness and medication used to treat it.</li>
            <li> Only good if you are not being active and to throw your hair up fast.</li>
            <li> Also, I will probably end up buying more some other day.</li>
            <li> Would not waste my money!!  </li>
            <li> This not unreasonable, just normal wear which is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , these work for a variety of hair types: They hold my thinner, very fine, straight hair with three loops, and my daughters thick, voluminous, curly hair with two, and they don&#x27;t grab out hair upon removal.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that helps you, because these did not work for another reviewer with fine hair--she described hers as \\&quot;extremely fine\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> but they do live up to the claim of no-damage.</li>
            <li> That is a new record.</li>
            <li> The quality is decent, but will stretch out quickly if you get them wet while in your hair.</li>
            <li> made- very soft fabric covering the elastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine so typically hair elastics break my hair when I pull them out.</li>
            <li> No snagging and far stretchy than the cheap ones from other companies.</li>
            <li> that being said, the only reason I have it 4 stars was because the colors of the elastics that were shipped wasn&#x27;t the pretty ones that are pictured.</li>
            <li> this Christmas (2012), and the first thing she did was take a blue one and put it in her hair.  </li>
            <li> The higher I try to make it, the further down it slips, so these elastics evidently don&#x27;t have the strength to do more than bind... certainly not to lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for cheap hair ties, these are the ones, but if you&#x27;re looking to have hair ties that will last a long time, I would steer clear from these.</li>
            <li> every second rubber band snaps open at first time use!</li>
            <li> Purchased for gf, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> These were expected to be Large..</li>
            <li> They hold pony well with no slipping during the day.</li>
            <li> ;  right here, along with the 500 of these I bought for crazy cheap.  Buy em.</li>
            <li> These are poorly glued and come apart too easily.</li>
            <li> but I also have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> They last for a pretty long time, and I tie my hair up tight and for them to last as long as they do with that, is saying something</li>
            <li> or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Besides being disappointed, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> In our house they only are worn until our cat with OCD gets his paws on them and carries them into the basement to add them to his collection of hair ties in his dry food bowl...  </li>
            <li> they mean LARGE.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve bought multiples times before they are too stretched out to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I have every thick and kinky hair, these pony tail holders worked really well.</li>
            <li> Takes about a month before it stretches out to the point where 6 or 7-loops are required for a tight hold on hair, but even then there&#x27;s still enough unbroken elasticity left to be usable.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my local stores only carry the goody brand rubber bands, and those kept stretching out after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased similar (I don&#x27;t remember the brand, unfortunately) elastics that are much thicker and last almost indefinitely, like, until you lose them or something -</li>
            <li> I have purchased these hair bands before (on Amazon and other stores) and this package was as expected, with several colors.  </li>
            <li> This coated elastic creates a relatively loose ponytail</li>
            <li> I swear there is 1,000 hidden in my house in various places !</li>
            <li> These name-brand scrunchies are only slightly longer-lasting than the cheapos you can buy from the drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of them numerous times, and lost them, and found them again.</li>
            <li> But of all the the elastics that I have, I don&#x27;t think that is such an odd occurrence.</li>
            <li> Blue for navy pants, pink for black pants, gray for sweat pants, etc.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t slip, but I could wrap 4 times if I wanted extra tight.</li>
            <li> While they do the job, at least initially, these Scunci elastics feel thin and as if they&#x27;re losing their elasticity too quickly.</li>
            <li> There were too loose at 3, but not able to be stretched enough to wrap it around 4 times.  </li>
            <li> , they work - at least for me - only to hold low ponytails.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these locally.</li>
            <li> These were not strong enough to hold up my hair-</li>
            <li> The reason for the one star is the picture shows colors black and grey</li>
            <li> but I receive the variety color one with pinks and other that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, waist length and other skinnier hair ties will not hold my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Just a any other hair tie.</li>
            <li> My mother has thick, long hair (she is mixed) and the bows break if you try and get a really tight ponytail.</li>
            <li> Value pack for me and daughters (dark - for me, blues and pinks + some other - for children).</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find hair ties that last and won&#x27;t snap wihle</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re your average run of the mill ouchless hair tie.  </li>
            <li> 5 out of 30 were broken already before even using them and they snap like an old rubber band.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I liked the color selection, but what I received was all very ugly brown colors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These elastics can be used for things other than hair too!</li>
            <li> Use them everyday and don&#x27;t break like other brands I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy another one if it came in all black.</li>
            <li> The other half are still waiting to be used!</li>
            <li> I like to keep my hair back, so it doesn&#x27;t fall into what I am doing (seriously)</li>
            <li> If you try and make them tight so your hair won&#x27;t slip down in a pony tail, they break.</li>
            <li> The grip is still not too tight, yet stays on all day without adjusting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me tell you who has her hair in a tight ponytail for a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> they are a little over priced.</li>
            <li> I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because after a while the glued connection disconnects a little at the edges and can snag hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the thinner ones (just do not stay in) and the silicone ones (just tangle up what little I have)</li>
            <li> But my hair is also a little heavy</li>
            <li> Too big for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> because i wear this everyday, i change hairbands every 2months or so.</li>
            <li> Not for thick hair or being active (running).</li>
            <li> Rather, it is some sort of wax/glue that is noticeable if you look closely, but otherwise is not easy to see.  </li>
            <li> but Ive been using them for the gym for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> A very tight pony tail can cause hair damage and lead to traction alopecia.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this brand but every one of these elastics snapped.</li>
            <li> Its way to small</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use excessive force or anything.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy and holds her hair well without damage.</li>
            <li> They were old or badly made.</li>
            <li> These are absolute crap.</li>
            <li> wish I could find thick ones like these but that don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick and have no metal to damage your hair.  </li>
            <li> Elastics do not hold thick hair and immediately stretch with one use.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so I thought a thicker band would help.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to break my hair and hold my thick hair</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair.</li>
            <li> The thickness of these pony tail holders makes it hard to twist around a girl&#x27;s thin braid.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the ribbon style, but sometimes you need these bad boys to get a tighter fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A staple for anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> When using them they stretch to just the right amount without being worthless afterwards!</li>
            <li> they rubber band looks like poorly clued together.</li>
            <li> and none of them have broken.</li>
            <li> and it is very weak as soon as I stretched it, it broke :(</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the pesky metal bars that catch on hair and are illegal for sports.</li>
            <li> Hair ties how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> Not a great quality!</li>
            <li> Though these elastics don&#x27;t have that annoying silver metal thing attaching them together, the glue used instead was not very effective.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning, but very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Price is a bit expensive but catch them on sale!</li>
            <li> Instead I got this ugly medley of browns and creams that are dull and boring :(</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these things. If only I could stop losing them... I swear there is 1,000 hidden in my house in various places !</li>
            <li> These name-brand scrunchies are only slightly longer-lasting than the cheapos you can buy from the drug store. Takes about a month before it stretches out to the point where 6 or 7-loops are required for a tight hold on hair, but even then there&#x27;s still enough unbroken elasticity left to be usable.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this brand but every one of these elastics snapped. Maybe I got a bad batch? I guess I&#x27;ll just keep buying these at target.</li>
            <li> Its way to small and it is very weak as soon as I stretched it, it broke :(</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine so typically hair elastics break my hair when I pull them out. These don&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t have the pesky metal bars that catch on hair and are illegal for sports. The one thing that I don&#x27;t love is that they fall off and slip very easily but they do live up to the claim of no-damage. Great for people with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re your average run of the mill ouchless hair tie.  They work as you&#x27;d expect any of them to work.  I personally prefer the ribbon style, but sometimes you need these bad boys to get a tighter fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A staple for anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this because it advertised neutral colors. There was no gamble or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Besides being disappointed, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Grabbed these no damage elastics as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; item to get free shipping on my eyelash curler purchase. Inexpensive and we always use these elastics...so, easy choice as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Hold up well. Would like more choice flexibility.</li>
            <li> I would have given 3 starts they are a little over priced. They also break where they join they are not one solid piece. The reason for the one star is the picture shows colors black and grey but I receive the variety color one with pinks and other that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This don&#x27;t last there very cheap</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I liked the color selection, but what I received was all very ugly brown colors.  Not worth the hassle of returning, but very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> These are poorly glued and come apart too easily. Not the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my local stores only carry the goody brand rubber bands, and those kept stretching out after just a few uses. I feel like the Scunci brand lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair so I hair ties are very important in my life.  I try to keep some at work, the car, on my wrist, any place I would need them.  These are my favorite ties, they don&#x27;t have any metal, keep their shape and come in good colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased many of these and will keep doing so.</li>
            <li> Purchased for gf, no complaints so far. She said rubberband&#x27;s elasticity has been great, so there it is.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and granddaughter. They like them very much because these do not have the metal clip that pulls their hair. And these lots of replacements for the lost ones!!</li>
            <li> These work for me. I have fine hair and I wrap them 3 times around a ponytail and they don&#x27;t slip, but I could wrap 4 times if I wanted extra tight. I tried [[ASIN:B0007W89KO Goody Ouchless Hair Elastics 17 pieces]] but they were not the right size for me. They were too snug to wrap more than twice, but slipped when wrapped twice.    My ponytail is about the size of a quarter. Hopefully that helps you, because these did not work for another reviewer with fine hair--she described hers as \\&quot;extremely fine\\&quot;.    I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because after a while the glued connection disconnects a little at the edges and can snag hair. When that happened I just threw that one away though--there are 30 in the pack and I expect it to last me years.</li>
            <li> These are absolute crap. 5 out of 30 were broken already before even using them and they snap like an old rubber band. don&#x27;t buy these, they are garbage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great for my girlfriend&#x27;s hair. It is very heavy and holds her hair well without damage.</li>
            <li> We received the items in a matter of days and they were just as described.  It was a nice, smooth transaction.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not that great. I use two to secure my hair. Some of them break in the first try and they stretch with use. But they do the job of holding my hair back and they&#x27;re cheap. I&#x27;d buy another one if it came in all black.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. The quality is decent, but will stretch out quickly if you get them wet while in your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like these.. Very comfortable!</li>
            <li> Good value! I got it with free shipping because of my student account with amazon. The quality is comparable to more expensive counterparts from beauty stores. One can hold all my hair with no problem, but sometimes I use two at a time to have a stronger grip so my pony tail keeps in place all day.</li>
            <li> I love no-damage elastics by scunci. Just be warned, the colors are brownish neutrals, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A very tight pony tail can cause hair damage and lead to traction alopecia.  This coated elastic creates a relatively loose ponytail so it does not damage hair yet stays on pretty well. When I want a tighter grip on my hair I use two of them at a time. The grip is still not too tight, yet stays on all day without adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends of the elastic are glued together, there are no metal connectors between the edges.  Another good thing for your hair!  However, over time the glue does loosen.  This not unreasonable, just normal wear which is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These elastics can be used for things other than hair too! They are more attractive than rubber bands and don&#x27;t break from sun exposure like rubber bands.  So I found a number of non-hair uses for them. Here are two example:&lt;br /&gt;(1) I use them to keep label&#x27;s on home-made jams  that I give as gifts. I put labels over the top of the bottle cover, and then pinch  it around the neck of the bottle with the elastic. Makes it look great and unique.&lt;br /&gt;(2) When I take portrait photos I sometimes use a piece of nylon stocking instead of filter to provide a softening effect on the faces (hides fine wrinkles), I use this elastic to hold the nylon square over my lens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff at a reasonable price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> These break so often with the first use, will not buy again.....wish I could find thick ones like these but that don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I got these because there was no metal piece in it to snag my hair, and they work great, especially when I&#x27;m working out.</li>
            <li> Good Product - will definitely buy it in future- worth the buy and it helps the purpose of buy - good one</li>
            <li> They work like they should. When using them they stretch to just the right amount without being worthless afterwards! I&#x27;ve used about half of them numerous times, and lost them, and found them again. The other half are still waiting to be used! Perfect for those of us constantly losing hair ties.</li>
            <li> Great hair ties.  What else can I say about hair ties.  They&#x27;re thick and have no metal to damage your hair.  Good price, too.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors these come in, the drawback is often they broke where the seam was- so I would tie them in a knot. I like the no-damage bands, but often they are not as strong.</li>
            <li> great colors, they don&#x27;t pull your hair out, great for thin and thick hair.  My two year old daughter and I both use these and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Not for thick hair or being active (running). If you try and make them tight so your hair won&#x27;t slip down in a pony tail, they break. Only good if you are not being active and to throw your hair up fast.</li>
            <li> While they do the job, at least initially, these Scunci elastics feel thin and as if they&#x27;re losing their elasticity too quickly. And they&#x27;re not terribly substantial. I&#x27;ve purchased similar (I don&#x27;t remember the brand, unfortunately) elastics that are much thicker and last almost indefinitely, like, until you lose them or something - but they don&#x27;t get looser and looser like these do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they work - at least for me - only to hold low ponytails. The higher I try to make it, the further down it slips, so these elastics evidently don&#x27;t have the strength to do more than bind... certainly not to lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, these work for a variety of hair types: They hold my thinner, very fine, straight hair with three loops, and my daughters thick, voluminous, curly hair with two, and they don&#x27;t grab out hair upon removal. So no complaints there. Like I said, they get the job done. And they&#x27;re just an add-on item, so you&#x27;re probably not buying packs and packs of them. I&#x27;d advise against that, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you&#x27;re looking for a very precise color, know that the pink and teal pictured here are lighter and dustier than the actual elastics, which are a bright pink and bright teal.</li>
            <li> Though these elastics don&#x27;t have that annoying silver metal thing attaching them together, the glue used instead was not very effective. Three of the elastics broke when I took them off the card and another broke in my hair.</li>
            <li> I like these elastics because there is no metal piece. Value pack for me and daughters (dark - for me, blues and pinks + some other - for children). They hold pony well with no slipping during the day. No pulling out of hair when removed.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair type and do not break/stretch out as fast as some other brands. Would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you who has her hair in a tight ponytail for a lifetime.  Kimmy Gibler...and my girlfriend thanks to these.  &amp;#34;Wheres my hairtie?&amp;#34;  right here, along with the 500 of these I bought for crazy cheap.  Buy em.</li>
            <li> I got this because our cats love to chase them. Ran out of the ones in our hosuse so got these.</li>
            <li> Sometimes will snap but I also have super thick hair. No snagging and far stretchy than the cheap ones from other companies.</li>
            <li> They are no damage and doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love that you can add these on. These ponytails dont pull on your hair and last forever. If only i could stop from losing them.</li>
            <li> They break too easily. My mother has thick, long hair (she is mixed) and the bows break if you try and get a really tight ponytail. Take it easy and they hold up a bit better. Not the best fit for her, though</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair which is really curly and very long.  They do not snap and break nor do they grab the hair.  Perfect!!</li>
            <li> My 2 stars are my fault. When the seller states the are large hair bands they mean LARGE. Too big for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I do not get too much of my hair in this is any. Well made and strong.</li>
            <li> Scunci elastics offer a very good variety of colors on one card. They seem to be well made- very soft fabric covering the elastic. It seems that they will hold up for quite a while- all though I have already popped one, But of all the the elastics that I have, I don&#x27;t think that is such an odd occurrence. Overall very happy! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Use them everyday and don&#x27;t break like other brands I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> the girls split them up asap and was very happy</li>
            <li> Medium size. I needed large to wrap better around hair. Other than size, they are a nice product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the product and I really do love them. The holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t stretch out. Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for hair ties, then use these. They don&#x27;t break and the seam is not visible so there&#x27;s no metal piece catching on your hair. I have long hair and these work great.</li>
            <li> I have long hair. These bands work great, but they snap if you stretch them too far. If you&#x27;re traveling, take a spare or two. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> For my girls.  No complaints from them.</li>
            <li> These were expected to be Large..&lt;br /&gt;Not wrist size</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, waist length and other skinnier hair ties will not hold my hair at all.  This doesn&#x27;t loosen up on me as much as others but I can&#x27;t give it all five stars because it does stretch out over time and you&#x27;ll find yourself tightening it against your head throughout the day.  But my hair is also a little heavy so it may last longer for others :)  It also looks nice and sleek in the hair.</li>
            <li> I like the hair ties, they don&#x27;t pull my hair. Also, I will probably end up buying more some other day.</li>
            <li> I reuse these several times. My hair&#x27;s always in a pony tail and these work well!</li>
            <li> I went to ralph and it was over priced so I bought this here. It&#x27;s great to put my hair up do.</li>
            <li> Hold your hair in place and doesn&#x27;t pull hair out!</li>
            <li> These are great. Strong elastic holds my very heavy pony tail nicely with no slipping during the day.  No pulling out of hair when removed. Quality exactly what you expect from Scunci.</li>
            <li> Most of these hair bands break easily. I try to put my hair in a ponytail and the hair band breaks on the second use.</li>
            <li> Ove always sworn by scunci elastic and this one is no different. They&#x27;re always durable and have great grip.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, the only reason I have it 4 stars was because the colors of the elastics that were shipped wasn&#x27;t the pretty ones that are pictured. Instead I got this ugly medley of browns and creams that are dull and boring :(</li>
            <li> I have every thick and kinky hair, these pony tail holders worked really well. I would recommend them and they are cheaper then most retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these in the store and they&#x27;ve been okay.  But there seem to be a number of hair ties that are too lose.  Not sure what happened.  But some of them already don&#x27;t have any elasticity.</li>
            <li> Just a any other hair tie. They blow out and stretch out. But, it is what it is. They are great nonetheless.</li>
            <li> They were old or badly made. They broke up on the 2nd use. Ive used this brand before and didnt have this problem.</li>
            <li> every second rubber band snaps open at first time use! they rubber band looks like poorly clued together. Thats what you get - a faulty product!</li>
            <li> Some of the elastics snapped at the seam the moment I tried to use them.  I don&#x27;t use excessive force or anything.  I like the colors and the thickness of the elastics.</li>
            <li> I know I have about a million of these around the house . . . but where I don&#x27;t know!  This is a good price for these elastics.  I have never had a problem with them breaking or fraying.</li>
            <li> Hair ties how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> Elastics do not hold thick hair and immediately stretch with one use.  Would not waste my money!!  Wish I would not have purchased.</li>
            <li> same as the photo, good stuff for a good price</li>
            <li> Got em for my wife. She loves them. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I like them. They don&#x27;t seem sturdy but Ive been using them for the gym for the past few weeks and none of them have broken.</li>
            <li> These hair ties aren&#x27;t the best, but they&#x27;re okay. I bought them to boost my order to $25 so I could get free shipping. There are many of them and the price is decent but they stretch out quickly and several of them have snapped on my hand during the first use. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap hair ties, these are the ones, but if you&#x27;re looking to have hair ties that will last a long time, I would steer clear from these.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so I thought a thicker band would help. Broke 2 just trying to wear a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They last for a pretty long time, and I tie my hair up tight and for them to last as long as they do with that, is saying something</li>
            <li> I have used these on my hair since they have come out. The don&#x27;t snag or catch my hair. They are very strong.</li>
            <li> The thickness of these pony tail holders makes it hard to twist around a girl&#x27;s thin braid.</li>
            <li> I use these hair elastics to identify different clothes in my closet.  I wrap them around the top of each hanger.  Blue for navy pants, pink for black pants, gray for sweat pants, etc.  Makes getting dressed easier in the morning.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t snapped yet! No snags either. What more could you want from a scrunci?</li>
            <li> Great pony tails, very easy to put on and not too tight. Holds hair all day</li>
            <li> These work well, better than some i&#x27;ve had.. because i wear this everyday, i change hairbands every 2months or so.</li>
            <li> They are hair ties, the hold my hair back efficiently.  I need to write more words, but they are just hair ties.....</li>
            <li> Like the title says, these are just what I was looking for! They don&#x27;t seem to break my hair and hold my thick hair so it&#x27;s a definite win thus far. :)</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t hold my hair. Go through one every two days. Something is different because I specifically buy this brand for its durability. Idk</li>
            <li> They were kind of old... some of the elastics snapped on first use... but a majority of them were fine.  Good add-on item... but wouldn&#x27;t buy if I didn&#x27;t need a cheap product to get me into &amp;#34;free-shipping&amp;#34; territory.</li>
            <li> these scrunchies are really good although the colors does not look like how it is shown in the picture the colors actually look brighter but they work very well</li>
            <li> These tend to work best for my thickness of hair.  I don&#x27;t go a day without it!  Price is a bit expensive but catch them on sale!</li>
            <li> easy getting into hair and more importantly...no pulling to get out!!!  seems to be strong and well made. lots of elasticity.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Scunci hair ties.  They last forever.  In our house they only are worn until our cat with OCD gets his paws on them and carries them into the basement to add them to his collection of hair ties in his dry food bowl...  but they still last!  I gave these to my wife as a stocking-stuffer this Christmas (2012), and the first thing she did was take a blue one and put it in her hair.  Ho ho ho!</li>
            <li> Good, lasting hair ties. I liked the colors that came in this set, as well.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hold up to lots of use but they do the trick for a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> My sisters and I go through so many hair-ties that it is nice to be able to find ones that are of great quality and a great price. The multiple colors are great too!</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not a great quality! Like 7 ripped after one usage. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I have purchased these hair bands before (on Amazon and other stores) and this package was as expected, with several colors.  They are considered &amp;#34;outchless&amp;#34;  because there is no metal crimp holding the band in a circle.  Rather, it is some sort of wax/glue that is noticeable if you look closely, but otherwise is not easy to see.  The near-invisibility of the place the ends join is nice, because I never have to try to place the band in such a way as to keep that part from showing.  No worries!</li>
            <li> These were not strong enough to hold up my hair- they weren&#x27;t as strongly stretchy as some others (like Goody), where I can wrap it around my ponytail 3 times and it holds it all day.  There were too loose at 3, but not able to be stretched enough to wrap it around 4 times.  I had to throw each one out after wearing for one day, whereas I can wear some that I&#x27;ve bought multiples times before they are too stretched out to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> These retain their elasticity pretty well, I like that they don&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thinning hair from illness and medication used to treat it. I like to keep my hair back, so it doesn&#x27;t fall into what I am doing (seriously) I had trouble finding these locally. I tried the thinner ones (just do not stay in) and the silicone ones (just tangle up what little I have) but these work and stay in, for me...thanks</li>
            <li> Good quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair. It is hard for me to find hair ties that last and won&#x27;t snap wihle I&#x27;m attempting to put my hair up. These are great. Since buying this product, I have used 5 hair ties and only one has snapped. That is a new record.</li>
