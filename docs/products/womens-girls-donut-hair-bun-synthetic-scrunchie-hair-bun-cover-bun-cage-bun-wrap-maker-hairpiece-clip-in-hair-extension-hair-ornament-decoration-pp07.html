            <li>This product it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>but I was more than happy when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hair bun!</li>
            <li>So cute!</li>
            <li>it looks natural and people ask me how I put up my hair so perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love amazon</li>
            <li>I just love this hair bun cover piece.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>i really love the bun that i purchased from the company.</li>
            <li>make sure i use bobby pins to secure it and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I luv it its my favorite pony but the hair is made really cheap</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this bun is easy to put on.</li>
            <li>even at this cheap price.</li>
            <li>unless it&#x27;s a light brown, I don&#x27;t think they made a mistake.</li>
            <li>the color is indeed a more brownish &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; black, but it still blends very nicely with my black-dyed hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Love it very realistic which was what I was looking for</li>
            <li>alot of people thinks its my hair and it very soft and it doesnt hurt when you put it in and its very easy to put it.</li>
            <li>people think it&#x27;s my real hair</li>
            <li>it looks real..</li>
            <li>I wear this as much as I can.</li>
            <li>This is so perfect for a bad hair day or for a day where you just absolutely don&#x27;t feel like trying.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, looks natural.</li>
            <li>Ended up taking 2 of different colors and sewing them together to make it worth wearing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s instead one of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; blacks that have a little dark brown infused in it, giving it sort of a brown appearance under the light.</li>
            <li>in order to make it look smaller and more natural, I cut the hairs on it a little shorter, and after I affix it on my head</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s just a little bit more difficult, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than 3-4 minutes to put this on, adjust it, and pin some stray hairs.</li>
            <li>please it try.  :O)</li>
            <li>First of all, I know how people have been saying that they&#x27;ve ordered a black but received a brown...</li>
            <li>I wrap the fake bun with a hairtie, to make it a little smaller and slightly more messy and therefore more real-looking.</li>

            <li> I wrap the fake bun with a hairtie, to make it a little smaller and slightly more messy and therefore more real-looking.</li>
            <li> This bun is much bigger/fuller than I expected, so it looks a little suspicious on me because my hair is quite short.</li>
            <li> I know it won&#x27;t last for long because it has a problem with shedding.</li>
            <li> took really long to receive since it was shipped abroad</li>
            <li> different manufacturer then when previously purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s from China, there is not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I am in the military -&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, don&#x27;t worry, because you can tighten it really well</li>
            <li> I thought I received the wrong color at first too</li>
            <li> Ordered a black an they sent a brown ..</li>
            <li> The black is not a jet black.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just their version of black.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black and</li>
            <li> then u mess the hair up finger comb</li>
            <li> I guess the lighting in the photos are a little off...</li>
            <li> Slightly too thin.</li>
            <li> so if u do buy it do not comb or brush too hard cus</li>
            <li> very fake and low quality.</li>
            <li> It is actually a very small bun.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>

            <li> Absolute waste of money...even at this cheap price. I just threw it out. It&#x27;s from China, there is not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I like it ..people think it&#x27;s my real hair and it&#x27;s so easy to put on. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I know it won&#x27;t last for long because it has a problem with shedding.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these.</li>
            <li> very fake and low quality.</li>
            <li> different manufacturer then when previously purchased. The combs are smaller (3 prong instead of 4) the elastic pull is flimsy. Ended up taking 2 of different colors and sewing them together to make it worth wearing</li>
            <li> love it! it looks real.. I am in the military -&lt;br /&gt;I make sure i use bobby pins to secure it and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Love it very realistic which was what I was looking for I love amazon i always find the best things at the best price overall great product for on the go moms like me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !!! These people don&#x27;t know there color. Ordered a black an they sent a brown ..after I had emailed em ..and it don&#x27;t look nothin like the picture. .</li>
            <li> I just love this hair bun cover piece.When I don&#x27;t feel doing my hair, come it up in a ponytail and the hair bun. Boom there it is. I wish the company would make them in different sizes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this. This is so perfect for a bad hair day or for a day where you just absolutely don&#x27;t feel like trying. First of all, I know how people have been saying that they&#x27;ve ordered a black but received a brown...unless it&#x27;s a light brown, I don&#x27;t think they made a mistake. The black is not a jet black. It&#x27;s instead one of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; blacks that have a little dark brown infused in it, giving it sort of a brown appearance under the light. I thought I received the wrong color at first too but it&#x27;s just their version of black. I guess the lighting in the photos are a little off... Anyways, this bun is easy to put on. If you have thin hair, don&#x27;t worry, because you can tighten it really well and it will not fall off. I have medium-thick hair so it&#x27;s just a little bit more difficult, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than 3-4 minutes to put this on, adjust it, and pin some stray hairs. I love this hair bun! It looks great when you wear a scarf or a sweater.</li>
            <li> I luv it its my favorite pony but the hair is made really cheap so if u do buy it do not comb or brush too hard cus then u mess the hair up finger comb it wud be best for this type of hair</li>
            <li> So cute! The mechanism for attaching it functions excellently- what a great design. I ordered the black and the color is indeed a more brownish &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; black, but it still blends very nicely with my black-dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt; This bun is much bigger/fuller than I expected, so it looks a little suspicious on me because my hair is quite short. in order to make it look smaller and more natural, I cut the hairs on it a little shorter, and after I affix it on my head I wrap the fake bun with a hairtie, to make it a little smaller and slightly more messy and therefore more real-looking.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s so good, especially went you don&#x27;t want to brush your hair. I really love it. Fast shipping, looks natural. I recommended ❤️</li>
            <li> It is actually a very small bun.</li>
            <li> I wear this as much as I can. It blends in well with my hair. Slightly too thin.</li>
            <li> Matched my hair perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;However as soon as I put it in my hair the bead holding the elastic broke. I can&#x27;t wear it. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> i really love the bun that i purchased from the company. alot of people thinks its my hair and it very soft and it doesnt hurt when you put it in and its very easy to put it. please it try.  :O)</li>
            <li> took really long to receive since it was shipped abroad but I was more than happy when I opened the box. it looks natural and people ask me how I put up my hair so perfectly. The only thing is that it sheds. but you know you get what you pay for</li>
