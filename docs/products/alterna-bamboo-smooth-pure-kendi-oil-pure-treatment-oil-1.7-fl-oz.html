            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>so this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair looking all sorts of fabulous.</li>
            <li>But nice to know that my hair dresser could tell the difference.</li>
            <li>in this one the smell is good, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, but for this price you can get a better deal.</li>
            <li>so it makes it shine nicely.</li>
            <li>The texture feels kind of sticky after it&#x27;s on your hair.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>it looks nice either way.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent, but thats all.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the original Kendi Oil is a great product.</li>
            <li>Is really works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and my hair is super shiny.  </li>
            <li>It also smells great - fresh not fruity.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair buttery soft, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery, Thank you!</li>
            <li>Light but effective and smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a sample from another company and instantly loved it.</li>
            <li>This product is very light on the hair and takes away all frizz with just a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li>and this is like magic compared to anything else I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I bought it and love it.  </li>
            <li>Its also more like a gel texture oil.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt better.</li>

            <li>I love it,</li>

            <li>so product lasts and able to use every day.</li>
            <li>From the drops to the mist I have never had a problem, with this &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; it seems more oily.</li>
            <li>It has a dropper application, it drops out of the dropper without even touching it.</li>
            <li>Great, clean, healthy feel, and smells extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I love the alterna oils .My</li>
            <li>For more of my reviews go to www.fromflabtofabfitness.com</li>
            <li>It does an ok job, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the original and this seems more like a down-grade.</li>
            <li>and I love the sent which is very mild</li>
            <li>My hair is light but shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Perfect after drying your wet hair.</li>
            <li>Not expecting much, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and it really makes my hair more shinning and healthy!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product with a purchase I made and was happy to see Amazon carries it as I am back for more.  </li>
            <li>hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>(I have fine shoulder length curly hair).</li>
            <li>it takes a second to get use to the amount of product you need for your hair without it becoming overly greasy, but once that ratio is figured out, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It does smell great and it may work better for someone that does not have coarse hair, I might buy it again just because i like the smell- it takes three full droppers</li>
            <li>but makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It is light but does the job.</li>
            <li>And he liked it and he is very picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing that has ever worked to get rid of frizz and fly aways.</li>
            <li>Also, the Alterna brand is awesome now that I have tried a few of its hair products.</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>light scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>Silky, smooth and manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Just want to put that out there for those who might be incorrectly believing this is a silicone free product as I did.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny, but not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Use it along with the Bamboo Smooth Shampoo and</li>
            <li>Shiny, silky &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks fabulous with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product...</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t know if it is original or not.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves hair conditioned, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>After my hair is dry I add about a dime size amount to the ends and my hair and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>dryed hair and it leaves my hair so soft and shiny and the curls look better and dreamier than ever!</li>
            <li>Wow, I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Nothing really special for this oil treatment.</li>
            <li>It creates slip and prevents tangling, which can be a problem especially in the lowest part of my hair near my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great oil, but what makes it stand out the most to me is how cleanly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>Often I feel I am trading a good hair day for greasy hair the next day, not with this.</li>
            <li>Love the whole line.</li>
            <li>This oil treatment really helps to make my hair look and feel healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Who each have long hair are thrilled when I give this oil as gifts!</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it helps with my daughters tangles and it brings so much shine to her hair.  </li>
            <li>disappear) and makes my hair a whole lot more manageable.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite hair oils that doesn&#x27;t create a really oily feel or look.</li>
            <li>This stuff has more of a control shine to it and tones down the frizz better, but the shine oil mist gives a better shine</li>
            <li>I immediately checked to see if Amazon had a better price and sure enough, they did.</li>
            <li>A quick hair wash</li>
            <li>I have always stayed away from oil-based products for my hair, as it gets greasy quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with fly aways and slight frizziness</li>
            <li>Alterna Bamboo is highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Its great for my and my daughters jair cuts down on hair styling because of the detangle properties!</li>
            <li>It does help smooth your hair, but don&#x27;t use too much of it as it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I initially tried this product as a sample and really liked the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I have been missing out on this for yeeeears and so far, this is the best product I have found for my frizziness.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things over the years and nothing has worked nearly as well as this stuff has.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Light and makes my hair smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair right after I wash with the Alterna line shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I felt and saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of some super cheap plastic, and I&#x27;ve dropped it twice on the floor and twice it broke completely.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look better, softer, less frizz, more shine and body.</li>
            <li>It certainly pays to do your price-comparison research before purchasing a product!</li>
            <li>ANd it is very, very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very light and manageable and can even be used daily.</li>
            <li>Works great as treatment and daily use before using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one because it was a good price, but compared the ingredients and found out that it now has less kendi oil and instead has more filler ingredients than it had several years ago.</li>
            <li>I put some on right before I flat iron my hair and my hair looks healthy and shiny and non greasy</li>
            <li>I love this oil, but beware, the bottle is extremely fragile.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>First bought it on QVC.  </li>
            <li>I also really really like the smell!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product -</li>
            <li>This has been enormously helpful in repairing split ends and restoring a healthy texture-</li>
            <li>thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>But, there is more than enough oil that sticks to the actual dispenser, so I never need to squeeze the bulb on top and fill up the tube.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too, but doesn&#x27;t create a greasy or wet look.  </li>
            <li>If you read the ingredients on many of those products, you will find that it is mostly silicon with a small trace of the argan/Moroccan oil, which is what causes the dullness and greasiness.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product of its type that leaves my hair feeling silky and looking shiny.</li>
            <li>I first used it as a leave in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li>Your best bet is eufora sculpting glaze or moroccan oil if you actually want to tame the frizz and keep your hair sleek and not greasy!</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used for my coarse thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>The glass adapter is very easy to use (until the you reach an almost empty bottle).  </li>
            <li>this oil calms my hair down and puts a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>A small dab also works great on dry hair to smooth away frizz.</li>
            <li>This product really works and is a great price alternative to other similar products.  </li>
            <li>I use a very very tiny amount (half the size of a dime, maybe?), and I try to keep it more on the top of my hair and away from my roots (where it gets oily first).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and shiny and helps seal up any split ends.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the plastic bottle, which cracks easily if it is dropped.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using hairspray or pretty much anything in my hair, really.</li>
            <li>Please note that in dry or windy weather (where your hair may create and attract more oil/dirt)</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the Pure Kendi Oil without paying the Sephora price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various smoothing oils over the years, but this is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Just a small amount in damp hair goes a long way to making my hair more smooth and shiny, appear less damaged (makes split ends, dryness, fly aways, etc.</li>
            <li>I expected this product to be more moisturizing because it is a pure oil.</li>
            <li>I think you will really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesnt really style or take to my hair..</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so much smoother and easier to style.</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to figure out how much to put in my hair.</li>
            <li>Product wrapped very well and as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have curly hair and during the winter time it is a real stuggle to keep it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with the frizzy look my hair gets in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with a little frizz or even want healthy shine to their!</li>
            <li>Other customers have warned to use sparingly, but sometimes I add a tad bit more for sleekness and control.</li>
            <li>Love this with other oils I use for my hair..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always surprised at how long it takes for my hair to feel greasy again--2 or more days.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a high quality hair oil!</li>
            <li>I very rarely buy the same product twice because I am always trying new products</li>
            <li>(I live in the south!).  </li>
            <li>Feels good when you first put it on, but after continuous use it leaves a film in your hair which leaves your hair feel dry and stiff.</li>
            <li>Great product for thick, coarse hair!</li>
            <li>It leaves my curls defined and feeling very soft, not greasy!</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very hot and humid outside</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>After drying and ironing it, I use a little bit more to add shine  and keep my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>I put on a little extra after my hair is straight to kind of finish it off</li>
            <li>I was using moroccan oil which is great but expensive when a saleswoman for alterna gave me a sample</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry, course hair and this makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and consistency- not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!!</li>
            <li>Kendi oil, however, leaves my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>People complimented me on the first time I used it, and I only used three sprays of it because I was scared that it would look oily.  </li>
            <li>works well but after purchasing fromsephora for the past 4 years and obtaining better results, it seems as though this is some sort of compromised formula.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried many hair oils in the past and couldn&#x27;t seem to find one that kept my hair smooth and soft without weighting it down</li>
            <li>the overall quality is nice though but not outstanding.</li>
            <li>it is a mess (live in Florida) between being outside more often and going in the pool</li>
            <li>I then lightly mist with the  Bamboo dry oil spray and flat iron.</li>
            <li>The oil is super light and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh over powering smell like some of the other brands do.</li>
            <li>Also, thanks to this product, I got rid of all my extra fancy shampoo and conditioner (was using DevaCurl), so it&#x27;s saving me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels bouncy and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>And apply this ... And leave it on all night and in the morning my hair is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft shiny and not heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>I purchased a lot of products trying to keep from buying one, but these product can only do so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from Sephora and had been using this for a week and have noticed considerable improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture, strength, and managability.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft even after I washed it.  </li>
            <li>Everything always went so far.</li>
            <li>If you have thin, straight, healthy hair</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, my hair gets stressed quickly and on top of my naturally fizzy hair, I have the extra frizziness from all of the heat and chemicals I put on it.</li>
            <li>Product came in time but either was not authentic or fresh since the one my stylist uses is much stronger scented.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless anti-frizz products, from cheap to expensive, and none of them has left my hair feeling and looking as healthy as this stuff.</li>
            <li>The price seemed high to me, but this bottle will probably last me a year.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle design was different and when the price comes down to what I originally paid for it I will order again.</li>
            <li>This is not pure oil - first ingredient is dimethicone.</li>
            <li>and I live in south florida where frizz is a constant problem bc of the humidity.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry, and I have noticed that this stuff really helps with the frizz.  </li>
            <li>The bottle design is fun but not very convenient, would like a different dispenser.</li>
            <li>Okay this stuff is a MUST if you have thick longish curly blonde (highlighted) hair like me.</li>
            <li>This is much better than other products I have tried from Sally Beauty and other places, such as Morrocan Oil and Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair, but as long as I treat the top and midsection then comb it down</li>
            <li>This product is okay, it is very thick.</li>
            <li>The Kendi Oil is great and doesn&#x27;t do any of that bad stuff to my hair.  </li>
            <li>For those who may make the same mistake as I did, I want to make it clear that this IS a silicone based product.</li>
            <li>/curly, I find this oil especially helpful for where my hair is coarser, around the bottom and near the crown.</li>
            <li>I can completely feel the difference in my hair when I&#x27;m blow drying it, but especially when I&#x27;m straightening it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply liquid gold for your hair, visibly and soft to the toch.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Not too expensive since it is effective</li>
            <li>I put a little on my hands and run it through my hair right when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how it will work on hair that is left to air dry, but for anyone with extra thick and long hair this is the best.</li>
            <li>Buyers should remember that a little oil goes a long way (especially with fine hair)</li>
            <li>My hair is normal except for the ends, which are dry.</li>
            <li>May be a bit light for very coarse hair, but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wavy long hair and it frizzes easily when we have high humidity.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and this one is very comparable to the others.</li>
            <li>The smell is noce and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, but other than that it doesn&#x27;t have much going for it.</li>
            <li>I take a nickel size amount &amp; run it through damp hair, put it in a bun, let it dry while I sleep, use a curling iron in the morning to straighten &amp; curl, and then use the Alterna new humidity spray.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry state.</li>
            <li>I had originally tried the aragan oil, but found that it was hard to work through my hair and left my hair greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is in my daily hair care and its very easy on my hair no real oily residue like with some other heavy oils.</li>
            <li>At first it left my hair a greasy mess</li>
            <li>this lacks a lot of the ingredients and the main Bamboo Extract is half way down the ingredients list rather than on the first line</li>
            <li>I have long wavy hair that is pretty thick and can become very frizzy when it is humid outside</li>
            <li>You apply this to the ends only when wet and style normally.</li>
            <li>Love this oil...was a salon recommendation for my hair type: wavy, long, thin.</li>
            <li>I only need to use a couple drops and I have super thick hair.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so its long lasting and worth every penny.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> so this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair looking all sorts of fabulous.</li>
            <li> But nice to know that my hair dresser could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> in this one the smell is good, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, but for this price you can get a better deal.</li>
            <li> so it makes it shine nicely.</li>
            <li> The texture feels kind of sticky after it&#x27;s on your hair.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> it looks nice either way.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice scent, but thats all.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the original Kendi Oil is a great product.</li>
            <li> Is really works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and my hair is super shiny.  </li>
            <li> It also smells great - fresh not fruity.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair buttery soft, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, Thank you!</li>
            <li> Light but effective and smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a sample from another company and instantly loved it.</li>
            <li> This product is very light on the hair and takes away all frizz with just a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li> and this is like magic compared to anything else I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I bought it and love it.  </li>
            <li> Its also more like a gel texture oil.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I put a bit more on my ends then use a blow dryer to add some heat.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product.  </li>

            <li> so product lasts and able to use every day.</li>
            <li> From the drops to the mist I have never had a problem, with this &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; it seems more oily.</li>
            <li> It has a dropper application, it drops out of the dropper without even touching it.</li>
            <li> Great, clean, healthy feel, and smells extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I love the alterna oils .My</li>
            <li> For more of my reviews go to www.fromflabtofabfitness.com</li>
            <li> It does an ok job, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the original and this seems more like a down-grade.</li>
            <li> and I love the sent which is very mild</li>
            <li> My hair is light but shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Perfect after drying your wet hair.</li>
            <li> Not expecting much, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and it really makes my hair more shinning and healthy!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product with a purchase I made and was happy to see Amazon carries it as I am back for more.  </li>
            <li> hair is fine and wavy</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> (I have fine shoulder length curly hair).</li>
            <li> it takes a second to get use to the amount of product you need for your hair without it becoming overly greasy, but once that ratio is figured out, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It does smell great and it may work better for someone that does not have coarse hair, I might buy it again just because i like the smell- it takes three full droppers</li>
            <li> but makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It is light but does the job.</li>
            <li> And he liked it and he is very picky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that has ever worked to get rid of frizz and fly aways.</li>
            <li> Also, the Alterna brand is awesome now that I have tried a few of its hair products.</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> light scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> Silky, smooth and manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Just want to put that out there for those who might be incorrectly believing this is a silicone free product as I did.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny, but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Use it along with the Bamboo Smooth Shampoo and</li>
            <li> Shiny, silky &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks fabulous with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product...</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t know if it is original or not.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves hair conditioned, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry I add about a dime size amount to the ends and my hair and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> dryed hair and it leaves my hair so soft and shiny and the curls look better and dreamier than ever!</li>
            <li> Wow, I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Nothing really special for this oil treatment.</li>
            <li> It creates slip and prevents tangling, which can be a problem especially in the lowest part of my hair near my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great oil, but what makes it stand out the most to me is how cleanly it absorbs.</li>
            <li> Often I feel I am trading a good hair day for greasy hair the next day, not with this.</li>
            <li> Love the whole line.</li>
            <li> This oil treatment really helps to make my hair look and feel healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Who each have long hair are thrilled when I give this oil as gifts!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it helps with my daughters tangles and it brings so much shine to her hair.  </li>
            <li> disappear) and makes my hair a whole lot more manageable.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair oils that doesn&#x27;t create a really oily feel or look.</li>
            <li> This stuff has more of a control shine to it and tones down the frizz better, but the shine oil mist gives a better shine</li>
            <li> I immediately checked to see if Amazon had a better price and sure enough, they did.</li>
            <li> A quick hair wash</li>
            <li> I have always stayed away from oil-based products for my hair, as it gets greasy quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with fly aways and slight frizziness</li>
            <li> Alterna Bamboo is highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Its great for my and my daughters jair cuts down on hair styling because of the detangle properties!</li>
            <li> It does help smooth your hair, but don&#x27;t use too much of it as it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product as a sample and really liked the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have been missing out on this for yeeeears and so far, this is the best product I have found for my frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things over the years and nothing has worked nearly as well as this stuff has.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Light and makes my hair smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair right after I wash with the Alterna line shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I felt and saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of some super cheap plastic, and I&#x27;ve dropped it twice on the floor and twice it broke completely.</li>
            <li> It made my hair look better, softer, less frizz, more shine and body.</li>
            <li> It certainly pays to do your price-comparison research before purchasing a product!</li>
            <li> ANd it is very, very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very light and manageable and can even be used daily.</li>
            <li> Works great as treatment and daily use before using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I ordered another one because it was a good price, but compared the ingredients and found out that it now has less kendi oil and instead has more filler ingredients than it had several years ago.</li>
            <li> I put some on right before I flat iron my hair and my hair looks healthy and shiny and non greasy</li>
            <li> I love this oil, but beware, the bottle is extremely fragile.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> First bought it on QVC.  </li>
            <li> I also really really like the smell!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product -</li>
            <li> This has been enormously helpful in repairing split ends and restoring a healthy texture-</li>
            <li> thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> But, there is more than enough oil that sticks to the actual dispenser, so I never need to squeeze the bulb on top and fill up the tube.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too, but doesn&#x27;t create a greasy or wet look.  </li>
            <li> If you read the ingredients on many of those products, you will find that it is mostly silicon with a small trace of the argan/Moroccan oil, which is what causes the dullness and greasiness.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product of its type that leaves my hair feeling silky and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I first used it as a leave in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li> Your best bet is eufora sculpting glaze or moroccan oil if you actually want to tame the frizz and keep your hair sleek and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used for my coarse thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> The glass adapter is very easy to use (until the you reach an almost empty bottle).  </li>
            <li> this oil calms my hair down and puts a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> A small dab also works great on dry hair to smooth away frizz.</li>
            <li> This product really works and is a great price alternative to other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I use a very very tiny amount (half the size of a dime, maybe?), and I try to keep it more on the top of my hair and away from my roots (where it gets oily first).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft and shiny and helps seal up any split ends.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the plastic bottle, which cracks easily if it is dropped.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using hairspray or pretty much anything in my hair, really.</li>
            <li> Please note that in dry or windy weather (where your hair may create and attract more oil/dirt)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the Pure Kendi Oil without paying the Sephora price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various smoothing oils over the years, but this is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount in damp hair goes a long way to making my hair more smooth and shiny, appear less damaged (makes split ends, dryness, fly aways, etc.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be more moisturizing because it is a pure oil.</li>
            <li> I think you will really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesnt really style or take to my hair..</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so much smoother and easier to style.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to figure out how much to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> Product wrapped very well and as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have curly hair and during the winter time it is a real stuggle to keep it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with the frizzy look my hair gets in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with a little frizz or even want healthy shine to their!</li>
            <li> Other customers have warned to use sparingly, but sometimes I add a tad bit more for sleekness and control.</li>
            <li> Love this with other oils I use for my hair..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always surprised at how long it takes for my hair to feel greasy again--2 or more days.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a high quality hair oil!</li>
            <li> I very rarely buy the same product twice because I am always trying new products</li>
            <li> (I live in the south!).  </li>
            <li> Feels good when you first put it on, but after continuous use it leaves a film in your hair which leaves your hair feel dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> Great product for thick, coarse hair!</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls defined and feeling very soft, not greasy!</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very hot and humid outside</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> After drying and ironing it, I use a little bit more to add shine  and keep my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> I put on a little extra after my hair is straight to kind of finish it off</li>
            <li> I was using moroccan oil which is great but expensive when a saleswoman for alterna gave me a sample</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, course hair and this makes it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and consistency- not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!!</li>
            <li> Kendi oil, however, leaves my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> People complimented me on the first time I used it, and I only used three sprays of it because I was scared that it would look oily.  </li>
            <li> works well but after purchasing fromsephora for the past 4 years and obtaining better results, it seems as though this is some sort of compromised formula.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair oils in the past and couldn&#x27;t seem to find one that kept my hair smooth and soft without weighting it down</li>
            <li> the overall quality is nice though but not outstanding.</li>
            <li> it is a mess (live in Florida) between being outside more often and going in the pool</li>
            <li> I then lightly mist with the  Bamboo dry oil spray and flat iron.</li>
            <li> The oil is super light and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh over powering smell like some of the other brands do.</li>
            <li> Also, thanks to this product, I got rid of all my extra fancy shampoo and conditioner (was using DevaCurl), so it&#x27;s saving me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels bouncy and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> And apply this ... And leave it on all night and in the morning my hair is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft shiny and not heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lot of products trying to keep from buying one, but these product can only do so much.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora and had been using this for a week and have noticed considerable improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture, strength, and managability.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft even after I washed it.  </li>
            <li> Everything always went so far.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, straight, healthy hair</li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair gets stressed quickly and on top of my naturally fizzy hair, I have the extra frizziness from all of the heat and chemicals I put on it.</li>
            <li> Product came in time but either was not authentic or fresh since the one my stylist uses is much stronger scented.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless anti-frizz products, from cheap to expensive, and none of them has left my hair feeling and looking as healthy as this stuff.</li>
            <li> The price seemed high to me, but this bottle will probably last me a year.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle design was different and when the price comes down to what I originally paid for it I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is not pure oil - first ingredient is dimethicone.</li>
            <li> and I live in south florida where frizz is a constant problem bc of the humidity.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry, and I have noticed that this stuff really helps with the frizz.  </li>
            <li> The bottle design is fun but not very convenient, would like a different dispenser.</li>
            <li> Okay this stuff is a MUST if you have thick longish curly blonde (highlighted) hair like me.</li>
            <li> This is much better than other products I have tried from Sally Beauty and other places, such as Morrocan Oil and Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair, but as long as I treat the top and midsection then comb it down</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it is very thick.</li>
            <li> The Kendi Oil is great and doesn&#x27;t do any of that bad stuff to my hair.  </li>
            <li> For those who may make the same mistake as I did, I want to make it clear that this IS a silicone based product.</li>
            <li> /curly, I find this oil especially helpful for where my hair is coarser, around the bottom and near the crown.</li>
            <li> I can completely feel the difference in my hair when I&#x27;m blow drying it, but especially when I&#x27;m straightening it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply liquid gold for your hair, visibly and soft to the toch.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Not too expensive since it is effective</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hands and run it through my hair right when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will work on hair that is left to air dry, but for anyone with extra thick and long hair this is the best.</li>
            <li> Buyers should remember that a little oil goes a long way (especially with fine hair)</li>
            <li> My hair is normal except for the ends, which are dry.</li>
            <li> May be a bit light for very coarse hair, but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy long hair and it frizzes easily when we have high humidity.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and this one is very comparable to the others.</li>
            <li> The smell is noce and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, but other than that it doesn&#x27;t have much going for it.</li>
            <li> I take a nickel size amount &amp; run it through damp hair, put it in a bun, let it dry while I sleep, use a curling iron in the morning to straighten &amp; curl, and then use the Alterna new humidity spray.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry state.</li>
            <li> I had originally tried the aragan oil, but found that it was hard to work through my hair and left my hair greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is in my daily hair care and its very easy on my hair no real oily residue like with some other heavy oils.</li>
            <li> At first it left my hair a greasy mess</li>
            <li> this lacks a lot of the ingredients and the main Bamboo Extract is half way down the ingredients list rather than on the first line</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that is pretty thick and can become very frizzy when it is humid outside</li>
            <li> You apply this to the ends only when wet and style normally.</li>
            <li> Love this oil...was a salon recommendation for my hair type: wavy, long, thin.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a couple drops and I have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so its long lasting and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I rub this through my hair when it&#x27;s wet and then dry and style like normal and</li>
            <li> This works really well to tame frizz and soften my hair.</li>
            <li> This product not only tames the frizz but also keeps my hair from getting damaged from the blower dryer, curling iron and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I put a dropper full in my hair after a shower and it totally detangles my hair, which is really thick, long and dry.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Diamond shine by Redkin but at 40 for one ounce it is a little spendy for an every day hair washer like myself.</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands and rub into hair from root down to ends, then I blow dry and style as normal.  </li>
            <li> to evenly distribute this in my hair so it isn&#x27;t going to last long.</li>
            <li> and I straighten it every day with the flat iron</li>
            <li> I still had to buy a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Use before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my hair&#x27;s shine and use this oil after using my ceramic flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The product leaves my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down or looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> next time i will try some other similar products.</li>
            <li> I use quite a bit, because my hair is long, and I have never had a problem with my hair feeling or looking greasy afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have medium long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> so I only oil my hair 2 or 3 times a week, but I expected this product to do what it said it would do: moisturize and control frizz.</li>
            <li> At 45 my grey wirey hair gets colored every five weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally quite frizzy and I also bleach my hair every few weeks to dye it a variety of rainbow colors and this exacerbates my frizziness.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I only literally use a drop or two and only apply from the ears down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan Oil, Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, and then all the other generic ones I could find.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with dry, frizzy or dull hair.</li>
            <li> (And my hair is really dry and damaged).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with dry, course, or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair also has a tendency to be on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> I use before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I wash and blow dry my hair every day</li>
            <li> Works for a blow out &amp; style and also if let your hair air dry in waves/curls.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my hair while its damp from the shower and let it sit for about 10 mins before I blow dry and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Towel dry ...</li>
            <li> and I have found that after applying this, I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Can be used on damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter size amount, rub between my palms and run it through my hair when it&#x27;s about 70% dry and just let it air dry or blow dry....</li>
            <li> I have thin natural curly hair and this oil makes it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair after I wash it, and I can actually leave my hair down again instead of tying it up in a bun (not even a ponytail was enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried BioSilk and Frizz-ease in the past, and by the second day without washing, my hair was always grossly greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy of an oil that it completely weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Have very dry, course hair.</li>
            <li> hair used to be very dry after I started using the bamboo oil</li>
            <li> it becomes very dry.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered  this product, and every time the product  has leaked and not a full bottle.  </li>
            <li> you prob only need a little at ends.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tends to frizz, this oil was not heavy enough to stop the frizz.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts for months as only a few drops are needed.</li>
            <li> however the shine isnt what i expected...</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended using Kendi oil on my wet hair as a way to protect it from the heat when blow drying.  </li>
            <li> So, I just have to be careful to not drip all over the bottle and counter when I pull out the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and straighten it daily using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I find less breakage when I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> The product does not make my hair greasy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so the 1.7oz bottle could last you at least six months to a year depending on how dry your hair gets and frequency of use.  </li>
            <li> These other reviewers either have hair made from straw or work for the company.</li>
            <li> so other oils would cause my curls to fall out.</li>
            <li> I just keep an empty one on standby, just in case!</li>
            <li> A small amount covers my short hair</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the way it worked with other Kendi Oil.</li>
            <li> I used Fekkai in the past and had to wash my hair the next day because it made it feel so oily....</li>
            <li> hair is curly, a little dry, color treated.</li>
            <li> hair is still dry, and it does get a little frizzy since it is so damaged, but this product has given my hair a semblance of normality again.</li>
            <li> have thick coarse hair and it was very dry looking.  </li>
            <li> but now that I figured out a few drops does the job, I will be using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> but it will last you at least a year.</li>
            <li> this product is labeled for thick or very coarse hair, I wish that I would have seen that to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Amazon.com because it was at least $10.00 LESS than my local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, and does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> , it works its way all the way down to the roots.</li>
            <li> and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> You only use a very small amount and work it into your hair after washing while it is damp.  </li>
            <li> (meaning that there is much less in the product).</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t spill all over the place or make a mess when you try to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I have long extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li> use a small dab everyday applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry thick hair</li>
            <li> It did little of either.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, frizzy, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I apply a small amount when wet and style as usual.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair with frizz, and was hoping this would help tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long curly hair</li>
            <li> product is very synthetic perfumey, which is distinctly unpleasant to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a little of this to get some control, then spritz with the spray for a bit of shine, and wallah!</li>
            <li> Its a small bottle</li>
            <li> Giving four cause its small but.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a ton of hair it is very heavy</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and during the summer months especially, it is dry.  </li>
            <li> Its really hard to find out unless your expert.</li>
            <li> crazy about the bottle design, would like a different dispenser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out in the market- from expensive shampoos to leave in products, spent tons of money on brand name and drugstore products alike.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, color treated hair and also spend a lot of time in the pool (chlorine).  </li>
            <li> This product works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> This oil works just as well if not better than the expensive argan oil and is half the price.  </li>
            <li> have a ton of very thick hair strands.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Worse than a frizz-ease serum in terms of what it does.</li>
            <li> False Advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other oil treatments and have found that they get greasy or shiny (in a bad way) looking by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Even when using a TINY amount of this product is it just insanely greasy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> and it unfortunately looks like it has, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Not impressed, for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has been cutting my hair for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate it...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that I hate the dispenser.</li>

            <li> I love this oil, but beware, the bottle is extremely fragile. It&#x27;s made of some super cheap plastic, and I&#x27;ve dropped it twice on the floor and twice it broke completely. Keep this well away from the edge of your counter!</li>
            <li> This is he best oil I have ever used. It is light but does the job. Hair is shiny and manageable! I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Even when using a TINY amount of this product is it just insanely greasy. These other reviewers either have hair made from straw or work for the company. (And my hair is really dry and damaged). Worse than a frizz-ease serum in terms of what it does. Your best bet is eufora sculpting glaze or moroccan oil if you actually want to tame the frizz and keep your hair sleek and not greasy!</li>
            <li> This is the best!  I use it every time I wash my hair.  Not oily and I find less breakage when I blow dry my hair.  First bought it on QVC.  They all of a sudden did not have it.  Found it on Amazon and ordered it immediately!  It is the greatest product I&#x27;ve used for my hair.  Try it...I think you will really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Alterna carries the only products that I use.  I have very fine long hair and this is like magic compared to anything else I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a sample from another company and instantly loved it. I immediately checked to see if Amazon had a better price and sure enough, they did. I bought it and love it.  I put a dropper full in my hair after a shower and it totally detangles my hair, which is really thick, long and dry.  I no longer find myself ripping out tons of hair trying to get a comb through it.  It has a nice pleasant smell and when my hair dries, it does not look greasy. It just makes my hair sleeker and no frizz at all.  I wish I had found this product earlier. Its also more like a gel texture oil.  Its thicker than regular oils so it won&#x27;t spill all over the place or make a mess when you try to apply it.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with dry, course, or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> Product came in time but either was not authentic or fresh since the one my stylist uses is much stronger scented.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this oil! I have long wavy hair that is pretty thick and can become very frizzy when it is humid outside (I live in the south!).  My hair also has a tendency to be on the dry side.  I discovered Kendi oil at Sephora when it was recommended to me by one of the sales people.  I had originally tried the aragan oil, but found that it was hard to work through my hair and left my hair greasy feeling.  Kendi oil, however, leaves my hair so soft and shiny! I use quite a bit, because my hair is long, and I have never had a problem with my hair feeling or looking greasy afterwards.  I let my hair air dry, and I have noticed that this stuff really helps with the frizz.  I also really really like the smell! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Okay this stuff is a MUST if you have thick longish curly blonde (highlighted) hair like me. I have used every product it seems to try to \\&quot;like\\&quot; my curly hair; and this is the best! It is meant for med/thick hair so beware if you have thinner hair you prob only need a little at ends. I use two hole \\&quot;drops\\&quot; of product thru my towel dryed hair and it leaves my hair so soft and shiny and the curls look better and dreamier than ever! must buy!</li>
            <li> My mom had given me a sample packet she got and gave it to me. Not expecting much, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it. It made my hair look better, softer, less frizz, more shine and body. And not at all oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a small dab everyday applied to wet hair.  I have medium long wavy hair. The bottle lasts a log time, so being on a low budget, this one thing I can do for me and my hair. I buy the 1.7oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser asked what I was using on my hair. She could tell the difference. So it isn&#x27;t just me. And wouldn&#x27;t care if no one noticed, because I did notice. But nice to know that my hair dresser could tell the difference. She has been cutting my hair for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend would even use it on his goatee when he was growing it out a while back. And he liked it and he is very picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it after blow drying and straightening my hair and it does a super job of taming my fly aways and smoothing it out!</li>
            <li> This is the best. I worked in a salon for years and have tried every product out there. I was using moroccan oil which is great but expensive when a saleswoman for alterna gave me a sample and i was hooked. I use this oil and my mom uses the spray because she has finer hair. Is really works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> i love almost all alterna products, they are awesome! in this one the smell is good, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, but for this price you can get a better deal. The bottle design is fun but not very convenient, would like a different dispenser. the overall quality is nice though but not outstanding. next time i will try some other similar products.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use before I blow dry.  I then lightly mist with the  Bamboo dry oil spray and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! I have long extremely thick hair.  I have been using the kendi oil for about 3 weeks (after my hair dresser recommended it) and I have nothing but good things to say. I wash and blow dry my hair every day and this is the only thing that has ever worked to get rid of frizz and fly aways. I am not sure how it will work on hair that is left to air dry, but for anyone with extra thick and long hair this is the best. It is not greasy, and does not weigh my hair down at all. it just smooths and softens. plus it smells great..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other oil treatments and have found that they get greasy or shiny (in a bad way) looking by the end of the day. This product is very light on the hair and takes away all frizz with just a couple of sprays. I have very long hair, but as long as I treat the top and midsection then comb it down, it works its way all the way down to the roots. My hair is light but shiny and healthy looking. People complimented me on the first time I used it, and I only used three sprays of it because I was scared that it would look oily.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a little frizz or even want healthy shine to their!</li>
            <li> I have tried several hair oils and serums including It&#x27;s a 10, this is by far my favorite. It absorbs quickly and leaves hair conditioned, smooth, and shiny. I like that it does not contain silicones.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and wavy/curly, I find this oil especially helpful for where my hair is coarser, around the bottom and near the crown. It creates slip and prevents tangling, which can be a problem especially in the lowest part of my hair near my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great oil, but what makes it stand out the most to me is how cleanly it absorbs. Often I feel I am trading a good hair day for greasy hair the next day, not with this. I very rarely buy the same product twice because I am always trying new products, this is my second time buying this. May be a bit light for very coarse hair, but a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> False Advertising. The image and the ingredients listed are not what you actually recieve in the mail. The label and ingredients are different, the one you will get if you order this lacks a lot of the ingredients and the main Bamboo Extract is half way down the ingredients list rather than on the first line (meaning that there is much less in the product). I really liked the original and this seems more like a down-grade.</li>
            <li> This product really works and is a great price alternative to other similar products.  Also, the Alterna brand is awesome now that I have tried a few of its hair products.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it is very thick. It does help smooth your hair, but don&#x27;t use too much of it as it will make your hair look greasy. I have fine hair this product is labeled for thick or very coarse hair, I wish that I would have seen that to begin with.  I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; prevents frizz &amp; smells great (light, earthy &amp; citrus scent -- smells like lemongrass).  Works for a blow out &amp; style and also if let your hair air dry in waves/curls.  Use the trifecta of shampoo, conditioner &amp; oil treatment for awesome results!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Light weight but makes a huge difference. Love the whole line.</li>
            <li> I love this. I don&#x27;t work for the company either. I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan Oil, Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, and then all the other generic ones I could find. This Alterna Kendi is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Very light scent&lt;br /&gt;Shine without grease&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy&lt;br /&gt;Not too expensive since it is effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not crazy about the bottle design, would like a different dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of very thick hair strands. My hair is normal except for the ends, which are dry. I take a nickel size amount &amp; run it through damp hair, put it in a bun, let it dry while I sleep, use a curling iron in the morning to straighten &amp; curl, and then use the Alterna new humidity spray. My hair has never looked or felt better. I go 4 days without washing again so I don&#x27;t use anymore until the 5th night about an hour before I wash my hair I put a bit more on my ends then use a blow dryer to add some heat. It works wonders. Since I have a ton of hair it is very heavy so other oils would cause my curls to fall out. The Kendi Oil doesn&#x27;t undo my styling. Love it!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product.  I have very thick hair and during the summer months especially, it is dry.  This product works wonderfully on my hair.  I put some on my hands and rub into hair from root down to ends, then I blow dry and style as normal.  Silky, smooth and manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I also bought the shine oil mist and love it. This stuff has more of a control shine to it and tones down the frizz better, but the shine oil mist gives a better shine I think. I put a little of this to get some control, then spritz with the spray for a bit of shine, and wallah! perfection.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair oils in the past and couldn&#x27;t seem to find one that kept my hair smooth and soft without weighting it down (I have fine shoulder length curly hair). I wanted to try the Pure Kendi Oil without paying the Sephora price so I bought it on Amazon. Wow, I LOVE this stuff! I put it on my hair while its damp from the shower and let it sit for about 10 mins before I blow dry and straighten my hair. It makes my hair super soft and shiny and helps seal up any split ends. I put on a little extra after my hair is straight to kind of finish it off and it does not weigh my hair down. The oil is super light and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh over powering smell like some of the other brands do. I will definitely continue to use Alterna!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Also, thanks to this product, I got rid of all my extra fancy shampoo and conditioner (was using DevaCurl), so it&#x27;s saving me a ton of money. Hooray!</li>
            <li> Just enough to hydrate hair</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is just wonderful for my hair and I love the sent which is very mild</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have used it for the last 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair healthy and beautiful without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered  this product, and every time the product  has leaked and not a full bottle.  Wasn&#x27;t  real happy. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without this oil!  It makes my hair shiny and helps eliminate the frizzies!  The only problem is the plastic bottle, which cracks easily if it is dropped.  I just keep an empty one on standby, just in case!</li>
            <li> Light but effective and smells lovely! This is my second bottle. I have shoulder length hair and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair right after I wash with the Alterna line shampoo and conditioner. It has a great smell and seems to really &amp;#34;aid&amp;#34; my hair. I don&#x27;t notice anything MAJORLY different but it does seem softer.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product as a sample and really liked the way it made my hair feel. I decided to buy it on amazon and have been extremely pleased. (This is my second bottle) I have very thick, long curly hair and I live in south florida where frizz is a constant problem bc of the humidity. I apply a small amount when wet and style as usual. It leaves my curls defined and feeling very soft, not greasy! I would definitely recommend...</li>
            <li> I normally use Diamond shine by Redkin but at 40 for one ounce it is a little spendy for an every day hair washer like myself. I have very thick hair that tends to frizz, this oil was not heavy enough to stop the frizz. It does smell great and it may work better for someone that does not have coarse hair, I might buy it again just because i like the smell- it takes three full droppers to evenly distribute this in my hair so it isn&#x27;t going to last long.</li>
            <li> Thicker than I would like</li>
            <li> Nothing really special for this oil treatment. I didnt see the result yet. What I like is my hand is not oily after apply to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, its kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> This is great when used very SPARINGLY. I only literally use a drop or two and only apply from the ears down. It isn&#x27;t life changing, but I think it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Love using this on my hair. It&#x27;s not too heavy of an oil that it completely weighs my hair down. And, my hair is definitely drier if I don&#x27;t use this. I use it nightly after I shower.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair. This works really well to tame frizz and soften my hair. It also smells great - fresh not fruity.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, makes hair soft. One bottle lasts for months as only a few drops are needed. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I don&#x27;t like using hairspray or pretty much anything in my hair, really. I have a problem with fly aways and slight frizziness so this stuff is amazing. And it smells good too! I put a little on my hands and run it through my hair right when I get out of the shower. Also, I like to put some on before I straighten my hair. A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> works well but after purchasing fromsephora for the past 4 years and obtaining better results, it seems as though this is some sort of compromised formula. spend the extra 8$ and buy at sephora</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product with a purchase I made and was happy to see Amazon carries it as I am back for more.  I have thick, curly, color treated hair and also spend a lot of time in the pool (chlorine).  This oil treatment really helps to make my hair look and feel healthy and shiny.  You only use a very small amount and work it into your hair after washing while it is damp.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple kinds of the argon oil, which I also like, but this works notably better for me.  My hair feels bouncy and soft to the touch.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have really dry thick hair and I hate it...  this oil calms my hair down and puts a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be more moisturizing because it is a pure oil. But I was disappointed. I have dreadlocs so I only oil my hair 2 or 3 times a week, but I expected this product to do what it said it would do: moisturize and control frizz. It did little of either. I am disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. It smells great and leaves my hair looking all sorts of fabulous. Buy the bigger size, tho-- cheaper!</li>
            <li> i like the smell.. however the shine isnt what i expected...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt really style or take to my hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will continue trying something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is curly, a little dry, color treated.</li>
            <li> Wow! Great product for thick, coarse hair! This is my first time using this product - I love the smell and consistency- not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!! Works great as treatment and daily use before using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I wash my hair when I take a shower before bed ... Towel dry ... And apply this ... And leave it on all night and in the morning my hair is so soft.  A quick hair wash and I&#x27;m good to go.  My daughters ... Who each have long hair are thrilled when I give this oil as gifts!</li>
            <li> Good product but don&#x27;t know if it is original or not. Its really hard to find out unless your expert.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and straighten it daily using a flat iron.  My hairdresser recommended using Kendi oil on my wet hair as a way to protect it from the heat when blow drying.  After drying and ironing it, I use a little bit more to add shine  and keep my hair from frizzing.  The product leaves my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down or looking greasy.  This product works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> For those who may make the same mistake as I did, I want to make it clear that this IS a silicone based product. Contrary to the ingredients listed on this page the actual ingredients on the product label are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Superoxide Dismutase, Polysilicone-15, Saccharomyces/Magnesium Ferment, Saccharomyces/Copper Ferment, Saccharomyces/Silicon Ferment, Saccharomyces/Zinc Ferment, Saccharomyces/Iron Ferment, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Glycerin, Mauritia Flexuosa Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Passiflora Edulis Seed Oil, Water (Aqua), Fragrance (Parfum), Citronellol, Limonene, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason Amazon is not listing the ingredients correctly (or they have changed). Just want to put that out there for those who might be incorrectly believing this is a silicone free product as I did.</li>
            <li> This a very good product. Helps with the frizzies. I have used it for quite some time. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Makes my ends shiny and healthy looking!  Love this product.  Definitely notice a difference when I do not use this product.  Alterna Bamboo has a great volumizing mousse too that I use.</li>
            <li> This product is one I use after washing my hair each time in tandem with Alterna&#x27;s Brilliance Cr&amp;egrave;me.  It helps keep my hair wonderfully shiny and manageable.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, wavy hair. This product makes my hair so much smoother and easier to style. It also makes my style last longer.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and I straighten it every day with the flat iron plus I get highlights, lowlights and color on my hair. Needless to say, my hair gets stressed quickly and on top of my naturally fizzy hair, I have the extra frizziness from all of the heat and chemicals I put on it. This stuff is amazing! It does not leave my hair greasy, takes care of the frizziness and smells good! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. I have been missing out on this for yeeeears and so far, this is the best product I have found for my frizziness.</li>
            <li> This oil works just as well if not better than the expensive argan oil and is half the price.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love this product but I wish the price didn&#x27;t continue to go up. It is in my daily hair care and its very easy on my hair no real oily residue like with some other heavy oils. I wish the bottle design was different and when the price comes down to what I originally paid for it I will order again.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and it really makes my hair more shinning and healthy! I will re-order it for my mom and my best friends as a holiday gift! Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This Kendi oil is great and smoothed out my hair beautifully. It took me awhile to figure out how much to put in my hair. At first it left my hair a greasy mess and I didn&#x27;t like it but now that I figured out a few drops does the job, I will be using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel healthy after drying my hair with a hair dryer , , , , , , ,</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and this one is very comparable to the others. Leaves hair soft shiny and not heavy and greasy. I have colored hair so it makes it shine nicely.</li>
            <li> Save your money and use it on Moroccan oil.  Alterna is an ok brand.  I have a course color treated hair and this did not add shine or de-frizz by any means.</li>
            <li> I love the way this leaves my hair.  At 45 my grey wirey hair gets colored every five weeks. This product keeps it looking healthy.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the dropper.  Wish it came in a pump like my stylist has at her station.</li>
            <li> I still had to buy a flat iron. I purchased a lot of products trying to keep from buying one, but these product can only do so much. My hair is soft and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again. I need all the help my hair can get!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Use before flat ironing. Have very dry, course hair. Helps me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. A little goes a long way so its long lasting and worth every penny. I&#x27;ve had a hellacious semester, which included a reoccurring lice outbreak on campus, so my hair has been through a lot and it unfortunately looks like it has, too. This has been enormously helpful in repairing split ends and restoring a healthy texture- and it makes my hair buttery soft, which is awesome. I&#x27;ve been swearing by it since last summer.</li>
            <li> Product wrapped very well and as described.</li>
            <li> Best oil I have tried. I only need to use a couple drops and I have super thick hair. Can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> anyone who is on the fence about buying this product, please read this review.  I love this oil, it helps with my daughters tangles and it brings so much shine to her hair.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  I will be purchasing more.  thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have always stayed away from oil-based products for my hair, as it gets greasy quite quickly. I&#x27;ve tried BioSilk and Frizz-ease in the past, and by the second day without washing, my hair was always grossly greasy. So, I was hesitant to try the Kendi Oil, but my hairdresser got me to try it. It is so light! I&#x27;m always surprised at how long it takes for my hair to feel greasy again--2 or more days. I use a very very tiny amount (half the size of a dime, maybe?), and I try to keep it more on the top of my hair and away from my roots (where it gets oily first). I can completely feel the difference in my hair when I&#x27;m blow drying it, but especially when I&#x27;m straightening it. I have a cheapo $15 straightener, and if I don&#x27;t put some sort of product in my hair, I can&#x27;t get the plates over my hair without pulling it and frying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that I hate the dispenser. It uses a bulb on a pipet, similar to how some cooking extracts are dispensed (or some Stevia bottles). But, there is more than enough oil that sticks to the actual dispenser, so I never need to squeeze the bulb on top and fill up the tube. So, I just have to be careful to not drip all over the bottle and counter when I pull out the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a bottle of this stuff lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Pequi Oil sold at Sephora but when they stopped stocking it in their stores, I tried Alterna Kendi Oil instead.  I absolutely love this stuff!  Just a small amount in damp hair goes a long way to making my hair more smooth and shiny, appear less damaged (makes split ends, dryness, fly aways, etc. disappear) and makes my hair a whole lot more manageable.  It smells nice too, but doesn&#x27;t create a greasy or wet look.  Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a high quality hair oil!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora and had been using this for a week and have noticed considerable improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture, strength, and managability.  You apply this to the ends only when wet and style normally. My hair is naturally wavy and I have found that after applying this, I let my hair air dry and the waves are perfect.  The product does not make my hair greasy and a little goes a long way.  The smell is great and my hair is super shiny.  This is much better than other products I have tried from Sally Beauty and other places, such as Morrocan Oil and Argan oil.  If you read the ingredients on many of those products, you will find that it is mostly silicon with a small trace of the argan/Moroccan oil, which is what causes the dullness and greasiness.  The Kendi Oil is great and doesn&#x27;t do any of that bad stuff to my hair.  I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type:  wavy, Native American&lt;br /&gt;Chemically processed, colored, bleached</li>
            <li> This is not pure oil - first ingredient is dimethicone. I can buy that for $5, and one that smells markedly better too. (Organix Coconut, specifically)&lt;br /&gt;This product is very synthetic perfumey, which is distinctly unpleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt; Not impressed, for the price.&lt;br /&gt; It probably smooths the hair - I don&#x27;t know - one read of the label, one whiff of the perfume, and back it went.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome!  I love it, SO MUCH!  I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for hair oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various smoothing oils over the years, but this is my new favorite.  Other customers have warned to use sparingly, but sometimes I add a tad bit more for sleekness and control. Good value, too.</li>
            <li> Love this with other oils I use for my hair.. I just thought I would try this and it works well without making your hair greasy!</li>
            <li> Good Lord this stuff is amazing. I have tried countless anti-frizz products, from cheap to expensive, and none of them has left my hair feeling and looking as healthy as this stuff. It&#x27;s simply liquid gold for your hair, visibly and soft to the toch. You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair care item! I&#x27;ve purchased this hair serum many times. Its a small bottle but it will last you at least a year. A little goes a long way. It smells so good too!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this oil &amp; I love it.  It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it as a scalp oil &amp; as a hair treatment. Will con&#x27;t to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Bought this product and applied following instructions.The texture feels kind of sticky after it&#x27;s on your hair. Wasn&#x27;t really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally quite frizzy and I also bleach my hair every few weeks to dye it a variety of rainbow colors and this exacerbates my frizziness. I got a sample of this oil from Ulta and noticed a big difference after just one use. My hair is smooth and shiny, but not oily at all. I rub this through my hair when it&#x27;s wet and then dry and style like normal and my frizz is totally under control. I have tried so many things over the years and nothing has worked nearly as well as this stuff has. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry, frizzy or dull hair. The price seemed high to me, but this bottle will probably last me a year. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Use it along with the Bamboo Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick coarse hair and it was very dry looking.  This solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.  Buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from another company, and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s the first product of its type that leaves my hair feeling silky and looking shiny. I&#x27;m ordering it it again as soon as I finish this review.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing treatment even for fine/oily prone hair.  Does not sit on the surface of your hair.  It soaks in providing shine and damage prevention.  Excellent oil.  Can be used on damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I will continue to purchase... it takes a second to get use to the amount of product you need for your hair without it becoming overly greasy, but once that ratio is figured out, it&#x27;s great. Shiny, silky &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I have thin natural curly hair and this oil makes it so soft and shiny. I use it right out of the shower while my hair is still wet. A small dab also works great on dry hair to smooth away frizz.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used for my coarse thick frizzy hair.  Gives a nice shine.  A small amount covers my short hair so product lasts and able to use every day.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry state. My hair always looks fabulous with this product.  I put some on right before I flat iron my hair and my hair looks healthy and shiny and non greasy</li>
            <li> I have used Bamboo Oil on my hair for several years now as an inexpensive version of Moroccan oil.  The glass adapter is very easy to use (until the you reach an almost empty bottle).  Buyers should remember that a little oil goes a long way (especially with fine hair) so the 1.7oz bottle could last you at least six months to a year depending on how dry your hair gets and frequency of use.  I always get compliments on my hair&#x27;s shine and use this oil after using my ceramic flat iron.  Please note that in dry or windy weather (where your hair may create and attract more oil/dirt) go sparingly with this product as it will make your hair look &amp;#34;dirty and oily&amp;#34; rather than have a sleek shine.  I purchased this product on Amazon.com because it was at least $10.00 LESS than my local beauty supply store.  It certainly pays to do your price-comparison research before purchasing a product!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about 7-8 months. From the drops to the mist I have never had a problem, with this &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; it seems more oily. It has a dropper application, it drops out of the dropper without even touching it. That wasn&#x27;t the way it worked with other Kendi Oil. Maybe the dropper is defective, who knows? Anyway, the original Kendi Oil is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy long hair and it frizzes easily when we have high humidity.  This product not only tames the frizz but also keeps my hair from getting damaged from the blower dryer, curling iron and flat iron.  It makes my hair very soft too.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.  I got a sample of this from sephora.  I used it and was hooked. I first used it as a leave in.  It made my hair soft even after I washed it.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am asian, have medium, coarse, wavy hair. ANd it is very, very frizzy. Lightening it twice and dyeing it several months ago did not help one bit. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out in the market- from expensive shampoos to leave in products, spent tons of money on brand name and drugstore products alike. Everything always went so far. Then i found this oil treatment. I use it on my hair after I wash it, and I can actually leave my hair down again instead of tying it up in a bun (not even a ponytail was enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is still dry, and it does get a little frizzy since it is so damaged, but this product has given my hair a semblance of normality again. And I&#x27;m so happy! It does not make my hair feel oily at all. It&#x27;s actually better the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Alterna! THeir shampoo/conditioner for frizzy hair is great too.</li>
            <li> Giving four cause its small but.  Its great for my and my daughters jair cuts down on hair styling because of the detangle properties! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great, clean, healthy feel, and smells extraordinary. Love this oil...was a salon recommendation for my hair type: wavy, long, thin. I really enjoy this product...it is my go -to in hair care for over a year now. I also apply some to my hands and legs on occasion.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for natural hair. Makes your hair very light and manageable and can even be used daily.</li>
            <li> I love the alterna oils .My hair used to be very dry after I started using the bamboo oil I felt and saw a difference right away.You don&#x27;t need much a little goes a long way.It won&#x27;t make your hair oily that&#x27;s another thing I like and it also smells great :)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have curly hair and during the winter time it is a real stuggle to keep it from frizzing.  I received a sample of this product from ULTA and I had to order a bottle.  It seems to help with the frizzes.  I love the way it makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 4 years ago and still have it. I ordered another one because it was a good price, but compared the ingredients and found out that it now has less kendi oil and instead has more filler ingredients than it had several years ago.</li>
            <li> was a gift for our daughter</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair oils that doesn&#x27;t create a really oily feel or look. Light and makes my hair smooth, shiny and soft. For more of my reviews go to www.fromflabtofabfitness.com</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair with frizz, and was hoping this would help tame the frizz. It does an ok job, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. The smell is noce and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, but other than that it doesn&#x27;t have much going for it.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! I have VERY dry, course hair and this makes it soft and smooth. 5 Stars !!</li>
            <li> Perfect after drying your wet hair. gives it shine and texture!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is great, but I find that Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Kendi Oil has a cleaner finish. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Feels good when you first put it on, but after continuous use it leaves a film in your hair which leaves your hair feel dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, frizzy, wavy hair.  It looks beautiful in fall and winter but spring and summer it is a mess (live in Florida) between being outside more often and going in the pool it becomes very dry.  This stuff makes it  look and feel great. I use about a quarter size amount, rub between my palms and run it through my hair when it&#x27;s about 70% dry and just let it air dry or blow dry....it looks nice either way. After my hair is dry I add about a dime size amount to the ends and my hair and it looks great.  Very pleased.  If you have thin, straight, healthy hair this is NOT for you...this is best for &amp;#34;challenging&amp;#34; hair. I love it!!! Also, it&#x27;s very hot and humid outside and I still wash my hair every 3rd day so I wouldn&#x27;t consider this greasy. I used Fekkai in the past and had to wash my hair the next day because it made it feel so oily....Alterna Bamboo is highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes hair without weighing it down.  Really helps with the frizzy look my hair gets in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because many of the reviews gave a great rating. It does have a nice scent, but thats all. I will go back to using the Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It goes a long way. Very quick delivery, Thank you!</li>
