    <ol>
            <li>So I stumbled across this and it looked like an awesome color.</li>
            <li>and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>but this one is the best....</li>
            <li>I love Punky Colour!!</li>
            <li>and It still smells good.</li>
            <li>u will be very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>Much better color(and smell!) than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>As always Jerome Russell has amazing hair dyes.</li>
            <li>and they are all amazing.</li>
            <li>Its a nice product for the price.</li>
            <li>did use it to dye my boyfriends hair to look like The Joker and it turned out perfect and really lasts.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m definitely impressed with the vivid hues and the longevity of the product itself.</li>
            <li>Punky Colors is by far the best out there.</li>
            <li>The best bright green hair color.</li>
            <li>I like this alot more than manic panic and splat</li>
            <li>but for the most part it stuck around.</li>
            <li>The color pops out so much better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how this color would turn or but after I used it i fell in love with this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I have used so many semi permanent dyes</li>
            <li>I hope to find a better dye.</li>
            <li>The color lasts for a really long time plus it smells great!!</li>
            <li>I loved the color so much I immediately ordered another one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful bright green!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still bright and vibrant</li>
            <li>the color is bright &amp; vivid!  </li>
            <li>so I could get some pastel green in my multicolored hair and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>But this color is fantastic on unbleached hair.</li>
            <li>Its so nice I had looking online for a nice green dye since I&#x27;m not a fan of manic panic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than manic panic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>I first ordered 3 of these as i was expecting it to fade quickly</li>
            <li>but if u do get one and it is the right color</li>
            <li>If you want a nice strong green, try it.</li>
            <li>Nice vibrant color but will stain light blonde hair and can be very stubborn to pull out.</li>
            <li>It stays where you stick it(great for multi-color designs), won&#x27;t bleed all over you or your sink/tub/pillow/clothes like other brands, lasts a long time, conditions your hair, smells good and is safe for your skin/hair.</li>
            <li>This color was exactly what it has been advertised as....</li>
            <li>Alpine green fades into a really nice bright green.</li>
            <li>it was very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand to anyone!</li>
            <li>It came fast too.</li>
            <li>so i ordered another one and it too was a much darker color</li>
            <li>She was so excited and now my parents won&#x27;t let me try a different brand.</li>
            <li>As long as you know how to accurately manage and maintain color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair crazy colours for over five years, and this is by far the best brand that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I mixed this with Punky Colour&#x27;s alpine green and it was great and long lasting, it&#x27;s been in my hair since christmas</li>
            <li>The color faded blue for me, which I was really anticipating.</li>
            <li>im very upset that only half of the ones i got were the right color</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and after two and a half weeks it had barely faded!</li>
            <li>In the future when I go green again I will most likely do the alpine again unless I try their spring.</li>
            <li>the other was much darker but the actual color turned out great and rinsing it with cold water increased the longevity and intensified the color</li>
            <li>It last so much longer than any other vibrant dye, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different kinds.</li>
            <li>If you have black hair; BLEACH IT FIRST.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you have black hair; BLEACH IT FIRST.</li>
            <li> I noticed if I stood directly under the shower stream for too long then it&#x27;ll fade (little blonde bits here and there)</li>
            <li> My roots came in a long time ago</li>
            <li> but only two of them were actually apple green</li>
            <li> (I dyed it a different color after 2 and a half weeks</li>
            <li> So I used the other half on the same hair but let it sit about 90 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected, no problem with delivery.</li>
            <li> but when it did fade i wanted to keep the same green</li>
            <li> And I also shower every other day and shampoo it.</li>
            <li> once i have money i would probably buy other colors.</li>
            <li> A little too neon for me, but</li>
            <li> Its a small jar</li>
            <li> It came out in a couple washes and left her hair an almost dirty grayish color.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly a bad effect, but if you don&#x27;t want blue I wouldn&#x27;t go for this shade.</li>

            <li> time and it still came out in two washes.  So I used the other half on the same hair but let it sit about 90 minutes.  It came out in a couple washes and left her hair an almost dirty grayish color.  She was so excited and now my parents won&#x27;t let me try a different brand.</li>
            <li> The color lasts for a really long time plus it smells great!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and after two and a half weeks it had barely faded! (I dyed it a different color after 2 and a half weeks so it would have lasted longer than that) I like this alot more than manic panic and splat</li>
            <li> Nice vibrant color but will stain light blonde hair and can be very stubborn to pull out.</li>
            <li> As always Jerome Russell has amazing hair dyes. I have tried almost every color and they are all amazing. I bought this to dilute so I could get some pastel green in my multicolored hair and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Punky Colors is by far the best out there. It last so much longer than any other vibrant dye, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different kinds. I would highly recommend this brand to anyone!</li>
            <li> The best bright green hair color.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair back in March. It&#x27;s now the middle of June and the color is STILL there. I&#x27;ve already gotten two haircuts between then and now. And I also shower every other day and shampoo it. I noticed if I stood directly under the shower stream for too long then it&#x27;ll fade (little blonde bits here and there) but for the most part it stuck around. My roots came in a long time ago so I gotta bleach and dye it again. But I&#x27;m definitely impressed with the vivid hues and the longevity of the product itself.</li>
            <li> If you have black hair; BLEACH IT FIRST. The color pops out so much better.</li>
            <li> The color faded blue for me, which I was really anticipating. Wasn&#x27;t exactly a bad effect, but if you don&#x27;t want blue I wouldn&#x27;t go for this shade. Alpine green fades into a really nice bright green. In the future when I go green again I will most likely do the alpine again unless I try their spring.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this color would turn or but after I used it i fell in love with this color. It&#x27;s a beautiful bright green!</li>
            <li> I love this color. Its so nice I had looking online for a nice green dye since I&#x27;m not a fan of manic panic. So I stumbled across this and it looked like an awesome color. Its a small jar but if you add lots of conditioner it will make the jar last. I loved the color so much I immediately ordered another one. It came fast too. I ordered it before I went out of town for a weekend and by the time I came back it had arrived. Its a nice product for the price. And by the way it smells like apples. I&#x27;ve washed my hair already once and It still smells good.</li>
            <li> Work as expected, no problem with delivery.</li>
            <li> My husband used this color for his hair to be The Joker for Halloween and it was perfect! Much better color(and smell!) than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> A little too neon for me, but I it was very vibrant. I love Punky Colour!!</li>
            <li> I mixed this with Punky Colour&#x27;s alpine green and it was great and long lasting, it&#x27;s been in my hair since christmas and it&#x27;s still bright and vibrant</li>
            <li> This color was exactly what it has been advertised as....the color is bright &amp; vivid!  As long as you know how to accurately manage and maintain color it stays that way until you tire of it or grow roots.</li>
            <li> I have used so many semi permanent dyes but this one is the best.... once i have money i would probably buy other colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair crazy colours for over five years, and this is by far the best brand that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I got this just to rainbow my hair, but haven&#x27;t used it for that.&lt;br /&gt;I did use it to dye my boyfriends hair to look like The Joker and it turned out perfect and really lasts.</li>
            <li> I only use Jerome Russell. It stays where you stick it(great for multi-color designs), won&#x27;t bleed all over you or your sink/tub/pillow/clothes like other brands, lasts a long time, conditions your hair, smells good and is safe for your skin/hair. Washes off skin with seabreeze or astringent like that, and lava soap(bar form).</li>
            <li> I used apple green on unbleached lightened hair, it took really well to the hair. It&#x27;s far better than manic panic. The only thing I dont like is the smell. It&#x27;s bubble gum but I find it really gross, and I dont think adults should smell like that...and I think manic panic would be safer for kids. I hope to find a better dye. But this color is fantastic on unbleached hair. If you want a nice strong green, try it. It&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> I first ordered 3 of these as i was expecting it to fade quickly but only two of them were actually apple green the other was much darker but the actual color turned out great and rinsing it with cold water increased the longevity and intensified the color but when it did fade i wanted to keep the same green so i ordered another one and it too was a much darker color so i tried it to see if it would lighten and it didnt im very upset that only half of the ones i got were the right color but if u do get one and it is the right color u will be very pleased with the results</li>
