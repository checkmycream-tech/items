            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Best external product for muscle spasms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s OK to just leave it on?</li>
            <li>If so, I would use it much more often.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I just add the lotion on top and nothing under arm.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>make it all the more better</li>
            <li>Product claims to restore cellular magnesium levels, act as a cellular protectant, support detoxification, relieve aches &amp; pains, improve mood, relieve stress and encourage healthy skin tissue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve helped many a friend and they&#x27;re hooked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In effort to try to get more sulfur</li>
            <li>Been using this for a couple weeks now and am pleased.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product so easily available and your prompt shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this Mineral oil.</li>
            <li>Even though they claim that it is more absorbable with MSM</li>
            <li>WILL GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY</li>
            <li>Time will be a better revealer.</li>
            <li>and I not on sleep better, but</li>
            <li>For many years I have been experiencing muscle spasms in my fingers, feet and calves.  </li>
            <li>My boys love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this product to get some magnesium into my system.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how many health problems I had until they started going away one by one.  </li>
            <li>This item works, he just likes the lotion better.</li>
            <li>This is one product I want to keep in my medicine cabinet for sure.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful health benefit overall!</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is my skin does not react and the product seems to absorb much better.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed her face has been more glowing (better looking skin).</li>
            <li>My husband and I have both been using Ancient Minerals for about a month, and find it does help us sleep better.</li>
            <li>Many take magnesium by mouth.</li>
            <li>I love Ancient Minerals and have recommended this brand of products in my healing facilitation practice for some years now.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to determine a value to this product.</li>
            <li>I read it works best to cover larger areas</li>
            <li>I was taking so many tablets that I think I&#x27;m probably saving money using the lotion.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give me a rash or itchiness like many mentioned</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s either gone or lessened significantly!  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for several years and originally it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the lotion much more.</li>
            <li>My back hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years!</li>
            <li>Have had great success and recommended it to others because it helped me so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that I felt very calm, peaceful, and I would even say happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for topical pain relief and helps hair to grow, really!</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I looked MSM up and in fine print one of the side effects for some</li>
            <li>No adverse reactions, just seems like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great product, recommended to me by my physical therapist friend.  </li>
            <li>No worries about it coming from a toxic/polluted lake or that it&#x27;s a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>For those who are recovering from a stage 2, 3 or 4 health condition, a nice soak in a warm bath with Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes is a simple way to re-energize the body.</li>
            <li>Great product, really like the new added MSM!  </li>
            <li>It is indeed rather slick &amp; oily, so that must be taken into consideration when applying and when donning clothes afterwards, but it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using it, the cramps in my legs have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>It whitens my teeth and makes them feel so squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I really needed more magnesium and my body absorbs this well.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, but the $20 price tag is a bit much.</li>
            <li>Great results as compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li>Ok I have used the regular Mg oil from Ancient Minerals and liked it pretty well.</li>
            <li>THE COMPANY GOT THEM TO ME QUICK.</li>
            <li>But applying magnesium oil to both sites reduces or eliminates pain surprisingly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Alleviates pain quickly and boosts my mood</li>
            <li>We use it for aches and pains and it works really quickly.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, ouch on shaved or dry skin</li>
            <li>I was willing to feel that sticky coating if I could feel a benefit to this product, but I did not notice anything special.</li>
            <li>The potassium worked best, but took a few minutes to go into action.</li>
            <li>but so worth reading about.</li>
            <li>I do have a metallic taste in my mouth that I dislike; but its worth it to get some healing going on in my body.  </li>
            <li>So far this is ok.</li>
            <li>this is worth a try-but the mag oil makes u relaxed and the msm wakes you up</li>
            <li>This is a powerful oil spray and have noticed a difference in muscles.</li>
            <li>For me, I prefer the lotion and spray..more economical and works just as well.  </li>
            <li>I also stay asleep, and generally wake feeling like I have gotten a better quality of sleep.  </li>
            <li>Within minutes I experienced some relief to cramped muscles in legs, low back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>BUT with the added MSM I can really feel it working quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I am not sure which is the effect of the magnesium and which is the MSM, but I am happy with this product because of its positive effects.</li>
            <li>I have been having leg cramps/spasms and back pain for years and have been using pain relievers and muscle relaxers to be able to get any sleep.</li>
            <li>I still have more than 75% of the product left.</li>
            <li>I use it for so many different things</li>
            <li>I seem to use the mag oil without the msm definitely the most.  </li>
            <li>Worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not my first order.</li>
            <li>It tingled when I first used it, but now I don&#x27;t even notice it and even leave it on for hours before I wash it off.  </li>
            <li>and I feel better, sleep like a baby, back ache is gone.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use enough...</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Just rub in to the sore area and your good in a few minutes</li>
            <li>My GERD has pretty much been cured as magnesium regulates your Ph.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re eating lots of leafy greens filled with organic calcium or milk products rich in calcium, then magnesium is essential to direct calcium to the skeletal system.</li>
            <li>My skin has become super soft since I began using this lotion a month or two ago.  </li>
            <li>This product at its full strength really protects you used as a deodorant, it is natural and you benefit from magnesium.  </li>
            <li>See my post on Ancient Minerals Ultra Pure Magnesium Oil Spray.</li>
            <li>We all need a little extra magnesium and this is a great product to deliver it.</li>
            <li>It really works on sore muscles for faster recovery from HIIT workouts.  </li>
            <li>This really helped my feet.  </li>
            <li>but this product doesn&#x27;t really do it for me.</li>
            <li>Too much Hype.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Works really well on muscle aches.</li>
            <li>Magnesium has been identified with a lot of benefits which you can readily read on the internet.  </li>
            <li>But sound, deep sleep is one benefit that I can attest for magnesium.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t have much else to say about it.</li>
            <li>Have no real idea which is better</li>
            <li>Did not help my leg cramps all that much.  </li>
            <li>As a side note, taking baths with one cup of baking soda and one cup of Epsom Salt provides me with another source of the much needed magnesium.</li>
            <li>I rub it on to aching joints and also pour some into my bath water so that the body absorbs the much needed magnesium.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Has helped her so much.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Nothing had really helped before this.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC  product and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>great stuff for sore muscles cramps stiff neck back pain,works in minutes time.</li>
            <li>Good for when I wake up in the middle of the night in sharp pain.</li>
            <li>This is also the only lotion I have used that doesn&#x27;t make my legs super itchy.  </li>
            <li>and she was amazed at how quickly it took away her knee and back pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with foot pain.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love Ancient Minerals but this Oil spray is a little ehhhh.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference so far.</li>
            <li>product says to leave on 20 minutes and wipe away and continue with normal lotion etc.  </li>
            <li>On the first day of a recent back pain issue, I sprayed her back and within about 15 minutes she said she was feeling better.</li>
            <li>Plus, they sent me the normal bottle instead of the &amp;#34;ultra&amp;#34</li>
            <li>new ancient minerals</li>
            <li>of course I thought this new improved version would be  better-NOT.....</li>
            <li>4 nights in a row I have slept better than in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I was having piercing pain in my right shoulder, and after a couple of days of use, the pain disappeared completely and didn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>I am able to continue working out longer without the usual soreness that I was getting before the use of the mag oil.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using the product on average twice a week.</li>
            <li>Barely a transient itch compared to the straight stuff.</li>
            <li>But so far I have to say Mmmmm!</li>
            <li>By the end of that day the pain was completely gone!</li>
            <li>Actually, I have been amazed when I have realized how far it is into the morning before I wake up for the first time.</li>
            <li>I was up all night with a mind clear as a bell....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything else about this oil except it does make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for four days and my skin wasn&#x27;t as soft again.  </li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to integrating this into my routine as I am a recent magnesiumphile</li>
            <li>I have tried crystal and supposed natural under arm products all with side effects.</li>
            <li>For those of you out there who wants to have deep sleep, try this one!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 75 now and age spots were everywhere; had no clue this stuff would make them go away completely.</li>
            <li>you go to the ER with heart problems, magnesium is in your IV nearly immediately.</li>
            <li>I purchased for foot pain and so far it has not worked.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell that it had any effect on my overall health and well being.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps a body regular and I would never go a day without using it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do any of this before, and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it, including all kinds of natural and homeopathic methods.  </li>
            <li>My sleep is markedly improved although I&#x27;m still hoping it gets better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I puchased this for my mom who stays in so much pain and discomfort  with her back.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It does make my heels soft as I soak my foot in a solution with the oil each night.  </li>
            <li>I do think that this product is helping me to sleep better; but, I have only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any earth-shattering results, but its still very early to tell about my particular \\&quot;mood\\&quot; problems and other things for which I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>I get a little tingling once in a while, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used long enough to have an ultimate review, but so far this seems very very viable!  </li>
            <li>Magnesium oil is readily absorbed through the skin, unlike taking magnesium tablets which are not completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The pure Ultra spray is an improvement on the regular oil with the MSM and there is no sensitivity to this type as it can be left on the skin after absorption without rinsing and moisturing.</li>
            <li>I have used other oils and my skin reacted strongly to those other products.  </li>
            <li>If I use to much I am a little bit to calm~  </li>
            <li>Be careful though, too much will &amp;#34;flush</li>
            <li>That appears to be the standard for putting liquid magnesium straight on the skin as I have purchased some locally from a health store and have had the same effect.  </li>
            <li>Most folks in this country are deficient in magnesium.</li>
            <li>My doctor told me that most people are deficient in magnesium and that it might help my sleep.  </li>
            <li>It burns a little for a second or two and has to be washed off in 20 minutes, which is a pain, but other than that, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Few realize that magnesium directs calcium to the right places in the body.</li>
            <li>Friends say daily use helps their constipation &amp; using the Regular Ancient Minerals directly on their scalp, helps with hair thinning.</li>
            <li>A little tingly at first but not anything you can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky when you first put it on, but then it goes on in.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s OK to just leave it on?</li>
            <li> If so, I would use it much more often.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I just add the lotion on top and nothing under arm.</li>

            <li> Product claims to restore cellular magnesium levels, act as a cellular protectant, support detoxification, relieve aches &amp; pains, improve mood, relieve stress and encourage healthy skin tissue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve helped many a friend and they&#x27;re hooked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In effort to try to get more sulfur</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple weeks now and am pleased.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this product so easily available and your prompt shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this Mineral oil.</li>
            <li> Even though they claim that it is more absorbable with MSM</li>
            <li> WILL GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY</li>
            <li> Time will be a better revealer.</li>
            <li> and I not on sleep better, but</li>
            <li> For many years I have been experiencing muscle spasms in my fingers, feet and calves.  </li>
            <li> My boys love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this product to get some magnesium into my system.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how many health problems I had until they started going away one by one.  </li>
            <li> This item works, he just likes the lotion better.</li>
            <li> This is one product I want to keep in my medicine cabinet for sure.  </li>
            <li> A wonderful health benefit overall!</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is my skin does not react and the product seems to absorb much better.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed her face has been more glowing (better looking skin).</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both been using Ancient Minerals for about a month, and find it does help us sleep better.</li>
            <li> Many take magnesium by mouth.</li>
            <li> I love Ancient Minerals and have recommended this brand of products in my healing facilitation practice for some years now.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to determine a value to this product.</li>
            <li> I read it works best to cover larger areas</li>
            <li> I was taking so many tablets that I think I&#x27;m probably saving money using the lotion.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give me a rash or itchiness like many mentioned</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s either gone or lessened significantly!  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years and originally it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the lotion much more.</li>
            <li> My back hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years!</li>
            <li> Have had great success and recommended it to others because it helped me so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that I felt very calm, peaceful, and I would even say happy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for topical pain relief and helps hair to grow, really!</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I looked MSM up and in fine print one of the side effects for some</li>
            <li> No adverse reactions, just seems like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product, recommended to me by my physical therapist friend.  </li>
            <li> No worries about it coming from a toxic/polluted lake or that it&#x27;s a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> For those who are recovering from a stage 2, 3 or 4 health condition, a nice soak in a warm bath with Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes is a simple way to re-energize the body.</li>
            <li> Great product, really like the new added MSM!  </li>
            <li> It is indeed rather slick &amp; oily, so that must be taken into consideration when applying and when donning clothes afterwards, but it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using it, the cramps in my legs have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> It whitens my teeth and makes them feel so squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I really needed more magnesium and my body absorbs this well.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, but the $20 price tag is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Great results as compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Ok I have used the regular Mg oil from Ancient Minerals and liked it pretty well.</li>
            <li> THE COMPANY GOT THEM TO ME QUICK.</li>
            <li> But applying magnesium oil to both sites reduces or eliminates pain surprisingly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Alleviates pain quickly and boosts my mood</li>
            <li> We use it for aches and pains and it works really quickly.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, ouch on shaved or dry skin</li>
            <li> I was willing to feel that sticky coating if I could feel a benefit to this product, but I did not notice anything special.</li>
            <li> The potassium worked best, but took a few minutes to go into action.</li>
            <li> but so worth reading about.</li>
            <li> I do have a metallic taste in my mouth that I dislike; but its worth it to get some healing going on in my body.  </li>
            <li> So far this is ok.</li>
            <li> this is worth a try-but the mag oil makes u relaxed and the msm wakes you up</li>
            <li> This is a powerful oil spray and have noticed a difference in muscles.</li>
            <li> For me, I prefer the lotion and spray..more economical and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I also stay asleep, and generally wake feeling like I have gotten a better quality of sleep.  </li>
            <li> Within minutes I experienced some relief to cramped muscles in legs, low back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> BUT with the added MSM I can really feel it working quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I am not sure which is the effect of the magnesium and which is the MSM, but I am happy with this product because of its positive effects.</li>
            <li> I have been having leg cramps/spasms and back pain for years and have been using pain relievers and muscle relaxers to be able to get any sleep.</li>
            <li> I still have more than 75% of the product left.</li>
            <li> I use it for so many different things</li>
            <li> I seem to use the mag oil without the msm definitely the most.  </li>
            <li> Worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not my first order.</li>
            <li> It tingled when I first used it, but now I don&#x27;t even notice it and even leave it on for hours before I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> and I feel better, sleep like a baby, back ache is gone.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use enough...</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Just rub in to the sore area and your good in a few minutes</li>
            <li> My GERD has pretty much been cured as magnesium regulates your Ph.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re eating lots of leafy greens filled with organic calcium or milk products rich in calcium, then magnesium is essential to direct calcium to the skeletal system.</li>
            <li> My skin has become super soft since I began using this lotion a month or two ago.  </li>
            <li> This product at its full strength really protects you used as a deodorant, it is natural and you benefit from magnesium.  </li>
            <li> See my post on Ancient Minerals Ultra Pure Magnesium Oil Spray.</li>
            <li> We all need a little extra magnesium and this is a great product to deliver it.</li>
            <li> It really works on sore muscles for faster recovery from HIIT workouts.  </li>
            <li> This really helped my feet.  </li>
            <li> but this product doesn&#x27;t really do it for me.</li>
            <li> Too much Hype.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Works really well on muscle aches.</li>
            <li> Magnesium has been identified with a lot of benefits which you can readily read on the internet.  </li>
            <li> But sound, deep sleep is one benefit that I can attest for magnesium.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t have much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Have no real idea which is better</li>
            <li> Did not help my leg cramps all that much.  </li>
            <li> As a side note, taking baths with one cup of baking soda and one cup of Epsom Salt provides me with another source of the much needed magnesium.</li>
            <li> I rub it on to aching joints and also pour some into my bath water so that the body absorbs the much needed magnesium.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Has helped her so much.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Nothing had really helped before this.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC  product and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> great stuff for sore muscles cramps stiff neck back pain,works in minutes time.</li>
            <li> Good for when I wake up in the middle of the night in sharp pain.</li>
            <li> This is also the only lotion I have used that doesn&#x27;t make my legs super itchy.  </li>
            <li> and she was amazed at how quickly it took away her knee and back pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with foot pain.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love Ancient Minerals but this Oil spray is a little ehhhh.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference so far.</li>
            <li> product says to leave on 20 minutes and wipe away and continue with normal lotion etc.  </li>
            <li> On the first day of a recent back pain issue, I sprayed her back and within about 15 minutes she said she was feeling better.</li>
            <li> Plus, they sent me the normal bottle instead of the &amp;#34;ultra&amp;#34</li>
            <li> new ancient minerals</li>
            <li> of course I thought this new improved version would be  better-NOT.....</li>
            <li> 4 nights in a row I have slept better than in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I was having piercing pain in my right shoulder, and after a couple of days of use, the pain disappeared completely and didn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I am able to continue working out longer without the usual soreness that I was getting before the use of the mag oil.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using the product on average twice a week.</li>
            <li> Barely a transient itch compared to the straight stuff.</li>
            <li> But so far I have to say Mmmmm!</li>
            <li> By the end of that day the pain was completely gone!</li>
            <li> Actually, I have been amazed when I have realized how far it is into the morning before I wake up for the first time.</li>
            <li> I was up all night with a mind clear as a bell....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything else about this oil except it does make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for four days and my skin wasn&#x27;t as soft again.  </li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to integrating this into my routine as I am a recent magnesiumphile</li>
            <li> I have tried crystal and supposed natural under arm products all with side effects.</li>
            <li> For those of you out there who wants to have deep sleep, try this one!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 75 now and age spots were everywhere; had no clue this stuff would make them go away completely.</li>
            <li> you go to the ER with heart problems, magnesium is in your IV nearly immediately.</li>
            <li> I purchased for foot pain and so far it has not worked.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell that it had any effect on my overall health and well being.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps a body regular and I would never go a day without using it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do any of this before, and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it, including all kinds of natural and homeopathic methods.  </li>
            <li> My sleep is markedly improved although I&#x27;m still hoping it gets better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I puchased this for my mom who stays in so much pain and discomfort  with her back.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It does make my heels soft as I soak my foot in a solution with the oil each night.  </li>
            <li> I do think that this product is helping me to sleep better; but, I have only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any earth-shattering results, but its still very early to tell about my particular \\&quot;mood\\&quot; problems and other things for which I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> I get a little tingling once in a while, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to have an ultimate review, but so far this seems very very viable!  </li>
            <li> Magnesium oil is readily absorbed through the skin, unlike taking magnesium tablets which are not completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The pure Ultra spray is an improvement on the regular oil with the MSM and there is no sensitivity to this type as it can be left on the skin after absorption without rinsing and moisturing.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils and my skin reacted strongly to those other products.  </li>
            <li> If I use to much I am a little bit to calm~  </li>
            <li> Be careful though, too much will &amp;#34;flush</li>
            <li> That appears to be the standard for putting liquid magnesium straight on the skin as I have purchased some locally from a health store and have had the same effect.  </li>
            <li> Most folks in this country are deficient in magnesium.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me that most people are deficient in magnesium and that it might help my sleep.  </li>
            <li> It burns a little for a second or two and has to be washed off in 20 minutes, which is a pain, but other than that, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Few realize that magnesium directs calcium to the right places in the body.</li>
            <li> Friends say daily use helps their constipation &amp; using the Regular Ancient Minerals directly on their scalp, helps with hair thinning.</li>
            <li> A little tingly at first but not anything you can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky when you first put it on, but then it goes on in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve exhausted most other alternatives for pain relief.</li>
            <li> He says it works very well on the deeper pain than his usual herbal med, but not on swelling, so he uses both.</li>
            <li> We older folk bruise easily; don&#x27;t stay ugly bruised &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Rub it on and watch them disappear.</li>
            <li> Also if you are concerned about the price it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does have a sting at times but not for long at all.  </li>
            <li> Long sleepless nights.  </li>
            <li> This last one is only half a strength because they added MSM to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  The metallic taste didn&#x27;t stay very long.  </li>
            <li> AND IF MY SKIN GETS DRY AND ITCHY</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin</li>
            <li> , it did however felt a bit dry and not oily.</li>
            <li> With my digestion problems for 20 years, I think I was really deficient, so it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> With my digestion problems for 20 years, I think I was really deficient, so it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> They usually come at the most in opportune moments - sleeping, sitting, or basically just the wrong move with the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS ALSO MADE MY VERY DRY SKIN EVEN DRIER .  </li>
            <li> My pain vanishes for at least several hours to the next day.</li>
            <li> The bottle and pump are not cheap such as another brand I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I believe it helps with some deficiencies I have due to the fibromyalgia</li>
            <li> the uses are endless and amazons pricing and speedy shipping</li>
            <li> My concentration and mental alertness is sharp!  </li>
            <li> I will try other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product has the barcode painted over with permanent black marker.</li>
            <li> However,  I gave it to my 78 year old mom who has bad knees and gets occasional (and severe) back pain</li>
            <li> I always spray on an area of skin that has a layer of fat, this keeps down any burning sensation, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the slight oil it contains to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It may have helped that slightly.  </li>
            <li> Myself and I have shoulders and knees pain and the application just wetting these joins reduced a little bit the pain for a day</li>
            <li> That could go away as I use it a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin a little itchy and leaves a funky film on it.</li>
            <li> Probably something wrong, too old?!</li>
            <li> When her back goes out she&#x27;s usually down for several days and really suffers.  </li>
            <li> so I consider it a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin with a sticky salty coating that feels like dried sweat.</li>
            <li> now I wasted my $$$$ and have to find another MSM-less mag oil..</li>
            <li> Drop a few drops of lavender oil in it</li>
            <li> I also noticed when I didn&#x27;t use it for a few days while traveling.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to burn like the plain Mg oil.</li>
            <li> use everyday and night! .......</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if I need magnesium</li>
            <li> No more foot or leg cramps and helped heal a nagging shoulder injury.</li>
            <li> A few sprays of this on my calves stopped night time cramping!  </li>
            <li> Not sure I notice any health benefits...</li>
            <li> Magnesium pills are not effective, I&#x27;m told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I used to eat bananas like crazy, pop potassium pills like candy and use some sort of over the counter anti-inflammatory medication to fight back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is why I normally only buy one ingredient products....am very very sorry I bought this........</li>
            <li> I get painful leg cramps in the middle of the night,</li>
            <li> tried the lotion because the oil is a little inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> so that can be a little inconvenient at times.</li>
            <li> Also, this spray is weird.</li>
            <li> and my hands feel really weird after rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> It is inconvenient to use since you need to rinse it off afterward.</li>
            <li> which had been driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Was suffering badly from allergies.  </li>
            <li> It helps my legs when they hurt so bad that I can&#x27;t sleep.  </li>
            <li> the MSM stimulated me so badly I was hyperventilating-</li>

            <li> I love this stuff! I have been having leg cramps/spasms and back pain for years and have been using pain relievers and muscle relaxers to be able to get any sleep. Since starting to use this magnesium oil, I have not had any leg cramps/ spasms and have been sleeping like a baby. My back hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years!</li>
            <li> Great product, really like the new added MSM!  It helps to minimize the itching when you apply it to the skin!  Will buy again!  :)</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE COMPANY GOT THEM TO ME QUICK.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I am able to continue working out longer without the usual soreness that I was getting before the use of the mag oil.  It really works on sore muscles for faster recovery from HIIT workouts.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It burns a little for a second or two and has to be washed off in 20 minutes, which is a pain, but other than that, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This really helped my feet.  I highly recommend it to anyone with foot pain.  try it, you&#x27;ll like it.  Most folks in this country are deficient in magnesium.</li>
            <li> Best external product for muscle spasms. Within minutes I experienced some relief to cramped muscles in legs, low back and shoulders. I have used it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything else about this oil except it does make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> My skin has become super soft since I began using this lotion a month or two ago.  I stopped using it for four days and my skin wasn&#x27;t as soft again.  This is also the only lotion I have used that doesn&#x27;t make my legs super itchy.  I adore it.</li>
            <li> Got this after reading a book on the need for magnesium, especially for rebalancing osteoporosis.  Then I injured a tendon and shoulder muscle and pinched a nerve in my back--painful!  But applying magnesium oil to both sites reduces or eliminates pain surprisingly quickly.  Good for when I wake up in the middle of the night in sharp pain.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference so far. It is inconvenient to use since you need to rinse it off afterward. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s OK to just leave it on? If so, I would use it much more often. No adverse reactions, just seems like a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love Ancient Minerals but this Oil spray is a little ehhhh. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough before I bought it but the directions say to spray it on and then rinse or wipe it off. I just....dont have time for that in my routine. I enjoy the lotion much more. You can just put it on and go. Also, this spray is weird. It make my skin all rubbery feeling and my hands feel really weird after rubbing it in. It make the matte. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. I really was looking forward to integrating this into my routine as I am a recent magnesiumphile but this product doesn&#x27;t really do it for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was having piercing pain in my right shoulder, and after a couple of days of use, the pain disappeared completely and didn&#x27;t come back. Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> Good quality. The bottle and pump are not cheap such as another brand I purchased on Amazon. Quantity size is good for price.</li>
            <li> Too much Hype.&lt;br /&gt;Just sits on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing that a good pain kill won&#x27;t do..&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I will use it. Sooner or later</li>
            <li> great stuff for sore muscles cramps stiff neck back pain,works in minutes time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It makes me sleepy so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I trusted the reviews and tried this product for under arm deodorant. Have been using it for a couple of months now and am amazed that it does the trick. I also use it on my feet to keep away any fungus etc….  I do use it all over several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;This product says to leave on 20 minutes and wipe away and continue with normal lotion etc.  (for all over body)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t bother with the 20 minutes or the wiping off,  I just add the lotion on top and nothing under arm. I don&#x27;t find the slight oil it contains to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Have always been worried about the possible damaging products that are contained in under arm deodorant.  I have tried crystal and supposed natural under arm products all with side effects. I smell so it does not do the trick by the end of the day or the smell is transferred to my clothing instead of me (still a problem) or brown stains on clothing. Not with this product. Also if you are concerned about the price it goes a long way. I still have more than 75% of the product left.</li>
            <li> Works really well on muscle aches. Just rub in to the sore area and your good in a few minutes</li>
            <li> For those of you out there who wants to have deep sleep, try this one!  Magnesium has been identified with a lot of benefits which you can readily read on the internet.  But sound, deep sleep is one benefit that I can attest for magnesium. I spray around 10-12 spritzes on my torso before going to bed. In the morning I wake up rested...</li>
            <li> The product did what the advertising said the product would do.  I enjoy using the product on average twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia an my massage therapist uses it during my massage. I believe it helps with some deficiencies I have due to the fibromyalgia</li>
            <li> Makes a great deodorant!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for pain relief and general health. Have had great success and recommended it to others because it helped me so much.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by a friend in the fitness business.  Excellent product. Great results as compared to other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Love it! It seems to help my tinnitus since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li> use everyday and night! .......new ancient minerals pure ultra magnesium oil spray with opt msm is the best i have everr used</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  If I have hip pain, I just spray it on the spot and it&#x27;s either gone or lessened significantly!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Had wonderful results.  Was suffering badly from allergies.  Put on my face, forehead, cheeks, etc.  Immediately stopped sneezing, itchy eyes, etc. which had been driving me crazy.  Also has helped with my sleep.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic pain and fatigue. I&#x27;ve exhausted most other alternatives for pain relief. This product is truly amazing. My pain vanishes for at least several hours to the next day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is revolutionary! I use it for so many different things it&#x27;s amazing. It whitens my teeth and makes them feel so squeaky clean like I just left the dentist, I spray it on muscle aches and within minutes they&#x27;re gone, works wonders if sprayed on hair while damp (totally eliminates the need for any mousse or gel)...the uses are endless and amazons pricing and speedy shipping make it all the more better</li>
            <li> This product made my skin itch when I rubbed it on. Therefore, I only used it a couple of times so don&#x27;t have much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Have tried this both with and w/o MSM and cannot tolerate this form of magnesium. See my post on Ancient Minerals Ultra Pure Magnesium Oil Spray.</li>
            <li> Product claims to restore cellular magnesium levels, act as a cellular protectant, support detoxification, relieve aches &amp; pains, improve mood, relieve stress and encourage healthy skin tissue.  It had no effect on me so I consider it a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I started using Magnesium Oil about three years ago. This stuff is simply wonderful. I&#x27;ve helped many a friend and they&#x27;re hooked. I&#x27;m 75 now and age spots were everywhere; had no clue this stuff would make them go away completely. It does! We older folk bruise easily; don&#x27;t stay ugly bruised &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Rub it on and watch them disappear. Ugly toes and feet? Spray-spray and rub. It&#x27;s wonderful for topical pain relief and helps hair to grow, really! (Along with Oil of Oregano). Need help with constipation? Here&#x27;s your remedy. Be careful though, too much will &amp;#34;flush you like nothing else before.&amp;#34; WARNING, I know what I speak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go to the ER with heart problems, magnesium is in your IV nearly immediately. What&#x27;s that tell you? Not going to go nuts on you here but you need to read about this stuff. Cannot believe that every &amp;#34;knowledgeable&amp;#34; doctor out there is not promoting magnesium oil spray to all their patients. Magnesium pills are not effective, I&#x27;m told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ancient Minerals are number ONE in this area &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; So I&#x27;ve read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boca</li>
            <li> Have no real idea which is better but I bought both the mag oil and mag oil with msm to compare them.  I seem to use the mag oil without the msm definitely the most.  Works fine.  Seems like if I rub it on my upper back/shoulder area that I get bunch of red spots like pimples. ... so I don&#x27;t rub it there anymore.  Everywhere else I rub it I don&#x27;t have any troubles.  Don&#x27;t rub it on your private parts.  Burns!!!&lt;br /&gt;In effort to try to get more sulfur, I am going to try epsom bath soak once/ week or so.  Haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li> Did not help my leg cramps all that much.  After going to my Internist, we discovered I was extremely low in iron as the cause.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple weeks now and am pleased. It is indeed rather slick &amp; oily, so that must be taken into consideration when applying and when donning clothes afterwards, but it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I purchased for foot pain and so far it has not worked.</li>
            <li> This stuff helped my leg cramps a lot-I love it!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell that it had any effect on my overall health and well being.  There were no improvements I could specifically tie to when I began using the spray.</li>
            <li> Worked the first time I used it. Great for leg cramps, and more efective than pills.</li>
            <li> not to impressed...could feel a numbness...but not enough to take the nagging ache away</li>
            <li> Barely a transient itch compared to the straight stuff. Best brand for topically absorbed magnesium.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Instant pain relief for sore muscles!</li>
            <li> I rate this product with five stars!  I just rub this oil in the affected areas and within minutes I found total relief!  It is amazing and would recommend it for anyone with pain and muscle spasms for temporary relief.  I bring it with me in my pocketbook and can descrietly use it any time!  This works like a miracle!  Thank you for making this product so easily available and your prompt shipping!</li>
            <li> Helps with quality of sleep!</li>
            <li> As of now, I&#x27;m still uncertain as to all the reasons I have the painful muscles spasms I get on a sometimes daily/nightly basis.  They usually come at the most in opportune moments - sleeping, sitting, or basically just the wrong move with the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I used to eat bananas like crazy, pop potassium pills like candy and use some sort of over the counter anti-inflammatory medication to fight back. The potassium worked best, but took a few minutes to go into action. With this magnesium spray, it works within a minute - two minutes tops based in severity of issue - for relief and release of the muscle spasm.  I have this in miniature spray bottles for immediate access when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this over and over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** As a side note, taking baths with one cup of baking soda and one cup of Epsom Salt provides me with another source of the much needed magnesium. The baths help to curb the number of the muscle spasm incidents, but the spray is my emergency kit.</li>
            <li> I love this Mineral oil. I have tried several and this one is one of my favorites! The benefits of daily use of Mineral Oil is to numerous to mention but so worth reading about. After you have read the benefits of this mineral for your health and well being give this brand a try!</li>
            <li> Recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> THE BEST way to absorb magnesium!</li>
            <li> That you have to wait 20 minutes for this to soak in and then you have to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years and originally it was wonderful.  This last one is only half a strength because they added MSM to it.  Even though they claim that it is more absorbable with MSM I can tell the difference in the strength and it frankly does not work that way in reality.  This product at its full strength really protects you used as a deodorant, it is natural and you benefit from magnesium.  It does not protect the same way with MSM.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IRRITATED MY SKIN AS SOON AS I APPLIED IT.  MY SKIN ITCHES TO THE POINT I COULD ONLY LEAVE ON FOR 15 MIN AND I HAD TO WASH IT OFF.  THIS ALSO MADE MY VERY DRY SKIN EVEN DRIER .  NOT SURE THIS WILL WORK FOR ME WILL GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY AND IF MY SKIN GETS DRY AND ITCHY AGAIN I WILL BE SENDING THIS BACK.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Better than taking a magnesium pill!</li>
            <li> We all need a little extra magnesium and this is a great product to deliver it. Not my first order. Helps with the cramping in my legs. A little tingly at first but not anything you can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to have an ultimate review, but so far this seems very very viable!  It does have a sting at times but not for long at all.  I do sense it is doing what is claimed.  Time will be a better revealer.</li>
            <li> Great product, recommended to me by my physical therapist friend.  I rub it on to aching joints and also pour some into my bath water so that the body absorbs the much needed magnesium.</li>
            <li> Magnesium oil is readily absorbed through the skin, unlike taking magnesium tablets which are not completely absorbed.  It is a little sticky when you first put it on, but then it goes on in.  It really keeps a body regular and I would never go a day without using it.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law told me about this product, so I thought I would give it a shot.  I dont&#x27; know how but it eliminates my leg pain.  I get painful leg cramps in the middle of the night, that wake me and I have to get up and move around to make them subside.  I use this oil before I go to bed and I not on sleep better, but I sleep through the night.  I will definitely keep this product around.</li>
            <li> Myself and I have shoulders and knees pain and the application just wetting these joins reduced a little bit the pain for a day</li>
            <li> For many years I have been experiencing muscle spasms in my fingers, feet and calves.  I bought this hoping the Magnesium would help.  I spray the oil on my hands feet and calves before going to bed at night and can not believe what an instant improvement I feel especially in the knuckles of my hands.  I have not had muscle spasms since beginning to apply this oil.  Great Results!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My boys love it.</li>
            <li> I mix it withn my body lotion &amp; rub on my leg.  This help relax the muscles.</li>
            <li> I love using this product to get some magnesium into my system.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any earth-shattering results, but its still very early to tell about my particular \\&quot;mood\\&quot; problems and other things for which I&#x27;m using it.  I do have a metallic taste in my mouth that I dislike; but its worth it to get some healing going on in my body.  That could go away as I use it a little longer.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The metallic taste didn&#x27;t stay very long.  I use the oil all the time and it is a good product!  I really needed more magnesium and my body absorbs this well.  I spray it on myself generously and rub it in.  I don&#x27;t have to wash it off, either. It soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> So far this is ok. It makes my skin a little itchy and leaves a funky film on it. I started applying my lotion over it, and that seems to do the trick</li>
            <li> top of the line for a good price</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It helps my legs when they hurt so bad that I can&#x27;t sleep.  I try not to take a lot of OTC pain meds so this is a great alternative.  It does dry your skin so I use lotion.</li>
            <li> Stopped my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s leg cramps!</li>
            <li> Ok I have used the regular Mg oil from Ancient Minerals and liked it pretty well. BUT with the added MSM I can really feel it working quickly. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to burn like the plain Mg oil. Hopefully it won&#x27;t be as drying on my skin as well! I&#x27;ll post an update after I have used it for a while. But so far I have to say Mmmmm!</li>
            <li> I started taking this product a 6 weeks ago.  My doctor told me that most people are deficient in magnesium and that it might help my sleep.  I tried capsules, but they hurt my stomach because I have GERD (acid reflux).  I came across this product and thought I would try it.  The effects were immediate.  I didn&#x27;t realize how many health problems I had until they started going away one by one.  The first thing I noticed was that I felt very calm, peaceful, and I would even say happy.  This didn&#x27;t go away.  The nervous feeling I always had, which I just thought was my personality, disappeared.  My GERD has pretty much been cured as magnesium regulates your Ph.  I am drinking coffee (2 mugs sometimes) in the morning and have a couple glasses of wine on Friday and Saturday night.  I couldn&#x27;t do any of this before, and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it, including all kinds of natural and homeopathic methods.  I also had Reynaud&#x27;s Disease, which is a circulation problem in the fingers.  That has improved by probably about 80%.  My brain functioning is also restored.  I couldn&#x27;t remember anything, always felt foggy in the head, couldn&#x27;t follow the plot in a movie.  It was terrible.  Now I&#x27;m the one that everyone has to ask what is going on in a movie or show.  My concentration and mental alertness is sharp!  My sleep is markedly improved although I&#x27;m still hoping it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the lotion because the oil is a little inconvenient.  (You have to rub it off after 20 minutes.)  The lotion didn&#x27;t work for me.  My symptoms started coming back.  I use the MSM, and I&#x27;m not going to change to just the regular oil because this one is working for me.  If it bothers your skin, keep trying.  It tingled when I first used it, but now I don&#x27;t even notice it and even leave it on for hours before I wash it off.  Amazing stuff!  Thank you whoever discovered this product.  It has changed my life.  You probably think that one product can&#x27;t help all these health problems, but this one has for me.  With my digestion problems for 20 years, I think I was really deficient, so it was exactly what I needed.  I hope it helps you!s, but this one has for me.  With my digestion problems for 20 years, I think I was really deficient, so it was exactly what I needed.  I hope it helps you!</li>
            <li> Spray it on almost each morning and I feel better, sleep like a baby, back ache is gone.  Make sure to use enough...</li>
            <li> My husband has rheumatoid arthritis and this product helps with his pain flare ups. I had a friend recommend it to me.  Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Great product. Alleviates pain quickly and boosts my mood</li>
            <li> Works well on my foot cramps.</li>
            <li> I puchased this for my mom who stays in so much pain and discomfort  with her back. She has used it for about 3 or 4 days and called me and said this stuff is a miracle.  Has helped her so much. I&#x27;m  so thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping.  This was purchased as an anti-nausea remedy.  It may have helped that slightly.  It did help with sleep and with moving toxins through the body.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try in place of the lotion, thinking it might be easier to use but my husband says it leaves a sticky residue on his legs so he always goes back to using the lotion.  This item works, he just likes the lotion better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. We use it for aches and pains and it works really quickly. I also used it for a pinched nerve in my neck and it worked like a charm.  I have been washing it off after 30 minutes (because that is what the instructions say) so that can be a little inconvenient at times. However,  I gave it to my 78 year old mom who has bad knees and gets occasional (and severe) back pain and she told me she didn&#x27;t wash it off and it didn&#x27;t bother her skin. It helped her sleep through the night and she was amazed at how quickly it took away her knee and back pain. When her back goes out she&#x27;s usually down for several days and really suffers.  Nothing had really helped before this. On the first day of a recent back pain issue, I sprayed her back and within about 15 minutes she said she was feeling better. By the end of that day the pain was completely gone! She asked to keep the bottle so I&#x27;ll be buying a second one to keep at home. This is one product I want to keep in my medicine cabinet for sure.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my leg and foot cramps, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. It really works! I get knee and hip aches at night sometimes. I spray it on, rub it in,and within a minute or two the pain is gone.</li>
            <li> As described and works beautifully.  If I use to much I am a little bit to calm~  A wonderful health benefit overall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, I also bought for my parents and they are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils and my skin reacted strongly to those other products.  What I love about this product is my skin does not react and the product seems to absorb much better.  Very easy to use and I don&#x27;t feel so greasy.  I&#x27;m still not sure if I need magnesium but this is sure a good way to get it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn like the non ultra solution can. I always spray on an area of skin that has a layer of fat, this keeps down any burning sensation, too. Non greasy formula, &amp; I&#x27;ve stopped having calf/foot cramps since I&#x27;ve been using it every day. No worries about it coming from a toxic/polluted lake or that it&#x27;s a cheap knock off. Friends say daily use helps their constipation &amp; using the Regular Ancient Minerals directly on their scalp, helps with hair thinning.</li>
            <li> Bought it as massage oil. My wife and I have been using it and I noticed her face has been more glowing (better looking skin). This was a pleasant surprise. I have noticed that my skin is softer as well. I am not sure which is the effect of the magnesium and which is the MSM, but I am happy with this product because of its positive effects.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product on a radio talk show. My husband and I have both been using Ancient Minerals for about a month, and find it does help us sleep better.</li>
            <li> A truly amazing transdermal supplement. Few realize that magnesium directs calcium to the right places in the body. If you&#x27;re eating lots of leafy greens filled with organic calcium or milk products rich in calcium, then magnesium is essential to direct calcium to the skeletal system. If magnesium is low or not present, then calcium can end up in the arteries. Many take magnesium by mouth. But it has been shown time and again that transdermal magnesium is best utilized by the cells for energy production. If you have aches and pains, skin issues, this is one happy way to help relieve pain and heal skin. I use Ancient Minerals every day and spray on face, arms and legs. If you&#x27;re short on magnesium, you may feel a tingling on your skin for 5 to 10 minutes. For those who are recovering from a stage 2, 3 or 4 health condition, a nice soak in a warm bath with Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes is a simple way to re-energize the body. I love Ancient Minerals and have recommended this brand of products in my healing facilitation practice for some years now.</li>
            <li> It does make my heels soft as I soak my foot in a solution with the oil each night.  Don&#x27;t let the terminology &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; fool you.  It is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to determine a value to this product. Nothing has indicated to me that it does anything. It leaves your skin with a sticky salty coating that feels like dried sweat. I read it works best to cover larger areas so I put this on my trunk as well as my arms and legs. I was willing to feel that sticky coating if I could feel a benefit to this product, but I did not notice anything special. Stick to Epsom Salts.</li>
            <li> watch it!!!! caution beFore you buy...&lt;br /&gt;other magnesium oils without the MSM worked like a charm-for helping me doze off to sleep&lt;br /&gt;so of course I thought this new improved version would be  better-NOT.....the MSM stimulated me so badly I was hyperventilating-I was up all night with a mind clear as a bell....&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I did try it several times including day time.....so&lt;br /&gt;IF you are buying mag oil to induce sleep/rest- DO NOT BUY THIS WITH THE MSM....&lt;br /&gt;I looked MSM up and in fine print one of the side effects for some is INSOMINIA&lt;br /&gt;THEY SHOULD tell us that warning....now I wasted my $$$$ and have to find another MSM-less mag oil..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is why I normally only buy one ingredient products....am very very sorry I bought this........&lt;br /&gt;for those of u that need alertness however-this is worth a try-but the mag oil makes u relaxed and the msm wakes you up-so your brain is sort of fuzzed in between......</li>
            <li> This is a powerful oil spray and have noticed a difference in muscles. Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Really works!</li>
            <li> Miracle Magnesium! No more foot or leg cramps and helped heal a nagging shoulder injury. Drop a few drops of lavender oil in it and you&#x27;ll sleep like a baby!</li>
            <li> It works for me ! I continue to buy this because of that</li>
            <li> I have been using this over a month now for RLS and leg cramps, I apply it to the bottom of my feet once a day. I haven&#x27;t had to take magnesium orally since I use this and I couldn&#x27;t go two days before without taking the tablets  I was taking so many tablets that I think I&#x27;m probably saving money using the lotion.</li>
            <li> I do think that this product is helping me to sleep better; but, I have only been using it a few days. You spray it on your skin and after 20 minutes you need to wipe it off as directed because it will leave an itching feeling on your skin if left there. That appears to be the standard for putting liquid magnesium straight on the skin as I have purchased some locally from a health store and have had the same effect.  It came in a plastic bag and had leaked a bit into the bag. I have also tried the lotion made by this same company. It does not itch once applied. At this point, I believe I would purchase both again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update. I had stopped using this product and was taking 5 magnesium tablets a night. Then, I decided to try this again. 4 nights in a row I have slept better than in a long, long time. Actually, I have been amazed when I have realized how far it is into the morning before I wake up for the first time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who was having suffer neck pain, worked immediately!! FANTASTIC  product and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> For me, I prefer the lotion and spray..more economical and works just as well.  I mix the spray into the lotion and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be working fairly well.  Since I have started using it, the cramps in my legs have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, ouch on shaved or dry skin</li>
            <li> The pure Ultra spray is an improvement on the regular oil with the MSM and there is no sensitivity to this type as it can be left on the skin after absorption without rinsing and moisturing.</li>
            <li> The product had no smell at all, it is just water... didn&#x27;t give me a rash or itchiness like many mentioned, it did however felt a bit dry and not oily. Didn&#x27;t feel any difference health wise. I will try other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product has the barcode painted over with permanent black marker. Probably something wrong, too old?! Plus, they sent me the normal bottle instead of the &amp;#34;ultra&amp;#34; what is up with that ?</li>
            <li> I heard to use this type of thing to stop pain and muscle cramps, I&#x27;ve been on pain meds for years and needed them, but not since I started using this stuff... best thing I&#x27;ve ever found and I look forward to always having this on hand!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the $20 price tag is a bit much.</li>
            <li> My son is using this on his arthritis. He says it works very well on the deeper pain than his usual herbal med, but not on swelling, so he uses both.</li>
            <li> A few sprays of this on my calves stopped night time cramping!  I also stay asleep, and generally wake feeling like I have gotten a better quality of sleep.  I also noticed when I didn&#x27;t use it for a few days while traveling.  Long sleepless nights.  This is going on my list of this to have on hand at all times!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use. Not sure I notice any health benefits...maybe it takes a while? I get a little tingling once in a while, but not bad. I spray it on my arms and tummy.  -Mrs. Slippy</li>
