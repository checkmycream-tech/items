    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was really excited to try this after all the positive reviews, but I was disappointed with the product. I did not notice a difference in my skin.  There are much better products out there.  I prefer the LCP Vitamin C infusion 20% cream that can be purchased on line at  las colinas pharmacy.  It&#x27;s more expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Omg all I have to say. I bought 15 % glycolic cream last month but my daughter kept it. She had breakout so she used it and it cleared her face up so this time I bought this one which is 20% glycolic acid. It changes the texture and clarity of your face. You can actual see the difference in just 2 days. Use this along with Neostrata face wash. The facial cleanser in the 6 oz Bottke. Only use a little bit.  This high potency cream is better than anything else I have tried. I bought high dollars products and Neostrsta works the best with visible results.  I found out about this product line because my daughter dermatologist sells it and recommends to all her patients.  Your skin will have better clarity and be smooth and even looking in just short time  I sm 54 and have oily acne prone sensitive skin and these products work wonders.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderfull cream. I love it</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but I love this product.  It really does smooth your skin, minimizes fine lines and keeps blemishes away.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in the texture of my skin with this product.  I also see the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  It leaves my skin smooth with a firm feeling.  I wear it at night because its very light, I prefer a heavier cream during the day.</li>
            <li> I had used another neostrata cream before and decided to go for one a little stronger. It does tingle when I first put it on but it goes away in a few minutes. The skin does not peel too much afterward. I have not noticed a change in my skin texture or open pores or anything like that yet but it has only been 2 weeks since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Probably the best kept secret in skin care. This powerful cream rejuvenates the skin cells. I saw great results quickly. My skin took on an even tone, looked brighter with less appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Like the name suggests... It ... Is... Potent. Dear lord! My face was on fire. Also didn&#x27;t make my skin any clearer. Just an expensive way of burning my face off for a month with no results. I unfortunately decided to stick it out to see if it needed a week or two before my skin responded positively... It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using NeoStrata for years since visiting a physician&#x27;s office.  I love this product and over-all improvement of skin and giving your skin that bright glow.</li>
            <li> Better than any thing else. Perfect skin care cream. Better than all other expensive skin care treatments my dermatology has recommended</li>
            <li> First time I got it it came in a gift box. It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast. This time I got it again for her and came in a bag. Not that happy now. Doesn&#x27;t look like a kit for a gift. Seems like random things I bought that I will put together in a beg</li>
            <li> I am 47 and have been using this product along with the neostrata foaming glycolic wash for about 10 years. it has taken the dullness and fine lines away. People never believe my age. I highly recommend this product for aging skin.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency.  Goes on well.  Feels like an 8% glycolic cream.&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser system does not let me know when I am running out.  Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;What if I am on a trip and I run out?  Awful.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> there is a strong tingle when you first start using this cream but it is a great face cream.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Use this with Neostrata AHA 20 foaming wash once daily and your skin will look terrific!  Begin with every other day application if your skin is sensitive.  My skin is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> super drying on the skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and clear, but it&#x27;s not for everyday use. You can use it every 3 days to peel of the skin. If you use it everyday it will cause redness and pimples on your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this item. Unfortunately it does not have any information about producing or expiration date!!</li>
            <li> I chose the product because it has glycolic acid. It has made my skin smoothe and beautiful. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
