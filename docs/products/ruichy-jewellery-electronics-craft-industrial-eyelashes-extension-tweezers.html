            <li>hihihihhhi need more practice in using these with out messing up.</li>
            <li>and I love these.</li>
            <li>, I wish Amazon would in some way let customers know if items are shipping from across the world, I would have gladly paid more to get them from US.</li>
            <li>They are okay</li>
            <li>I found this and thought I would be able to use to pick up rhinestones</li>
            <li>Okay, not the highest quality for sure (they won&#x27;t work on your eyebrows!)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I havent got the chance to use them yet but they seem ok.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>These are not the highest quality tweezers, but for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect them to be, and for my purposes, I am pleased with them.</li>
            <li>you would be satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I guess that they will be okay.......</li>
            <li>I was able to use them a couple of times and the tips stopped meeting up.</li>
            <li>I love it, so</li>
            <li>Much better quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>So many uses.  </li>

            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The price is great and product is very durable.  </li>
            <li>The curved ones are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>They do the job and they were so inexpensive that I ordered more than one set.</li>
            <li>If you want to pick up any design or also the glitter that you can easly take one by one just touching it with the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>The curved ones are a joke but the pointed ones seemed okay.</li>
            <li>okay for craft uses.</li>
            <li>These are great for nail art, they pick up the rhinestones and glitters very well.</li>
            <li>I like the curved tweezers better.</li>

            <li>I love these nail art tweezers , a must have for those who love doing cute things with their nails.</li>
            <li>but you need to add more stuff as a package for customers</li>
            <li>These are strong, good sized medium tweezers about 5 or 6 inches and the price is right!</li>

            <li>Arrived quickly &amp; just as described.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>very fast arrival!</li>
            <li>If I were to recommend this product, I would mentioning the very first sentence of my review.</li>
            <li>Such a good product especially if you can&#x27;t pick up stones on your own</li>
            <li>It does take time to get a technique down, but once you do these are a great time saver.</li>
            <li>But these are great to use for other projects as well!  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for picking up small stones and placing  the rhinestones in the exactly the right place on my nails and any manicure.</li>
            <li>Works really good for applying rhinestones to the nails (you will need a special glue)... not for any harder task, because they will bend.</li>
            <li>I found I can easily place the item wherever I like on my nails without having to spend too much time or effort on the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very durable and easy to use</li>
            <li>Love my Tweezers, it looks very professional.</li>
            <li>Easy to use great 4 them hard 2 pick up items when doing nail art.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do!</li>
            <li>The angled ones are great for placing anything you want correctly and the fine-tip ones are stellar at picking even the most delicate corner of a sticker.</li>
            <li>Pretty much straightforward use...  </li>
            <li>exactly as described, came before the shipping date!</li>
            <li>I just got involved in doing some nail art of my own and saw this on amazon, it just took a little time to get here, but that was fine , I knew that already!</li>
            <li>They work great at picking the little diomonds up.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, they work perfect for applying the little nail diamonds etc to the nail.</li>
            <li>WORTH TO WAIT</li>
            <li>But for the money, they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Not too useful for my taste.</li>
            <li>Would have liked if they had even a simple carrying case.</li>
            <li>My nails look way more professional when I use these rather than drugstore tweezers.</li>
            <li>So nice to finally find something to make the job easier!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>ARE SO USEFUL</li>

            <li>but they are good for other things.</li>
            <li>price is right...</li>
            <li>shipped they right away but even from China I received them in 2 week&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The tweezers slide right off</li>
            <li>These tweezers r cheap looking but r good for picking up small stuff for my nail art..  </li>
            <li>The only problem I had with them is that they tend to bend very easily.</li>
            <li>amazon is great for some products and others i would say dont waste your money when you could get something better from the local dollar tree.</li>

            <li>These work great for picking up tiny pieces of craft supplies, especially or the nail gem stones I purchased.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to order these...shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m glad that the package included two tweezers and the other one works fine.</li>
            <li>This order was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an amazing 18 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>These Tweezers are great for using flat back gemstones.</li>

            <li>They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>these are perfect for picking up extra small items.</li>
            <li>better deal then at local stores or even walmart!</li>

            <li>These are awesome tweezers...and for the price you cannot go wrong...</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what i needed for the stones to place on the nails.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail early and was exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li>then I am happy because they will last very long</li>
            <li>The tweezers are much larger than expected which is great.</li>
            <li>Came when expected, good quality but the straighter pair doesn&#x27;t come together completely.</li>
            <li>They are a little shorter than I would like but definitely useable and will be good for detailed projects.  </li>
            <li>I love how easily these tweezers are to use to grip the small rhinestone decals for nails.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I pretty much got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>They also work pretty good for applying full cover false nails.</li>
            <li>If extreme precision were essential, I would have sought out industrial quality, not nail art tools, and intended to pay many times more.</li>
            <li>so idk how good &amp; long they are going to last...</li>
            <li>I think they are fine for nail art, would not technically work as tweezers.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.  </li>
            <li>First of All this tweezers took way too long to get to me and when I finally got them they were just OK!</li>
            <li>Handy little tweezers.  </li>
            <li>They work great for big decorations that can&#x27;t be picked up with a little topcoat on a dotting tool.</li>
            <li>Curved Tweezer work better than expected and straight</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>Vs the straight</li>
            <li>There not to sturdy but they do the job thanks</li>
            <li>they are very thin/ flimsy  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I should of really read the reviews before I purchsed.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I really didn&#x27;t expect much for under $2</li>

            <li>These tweezers were very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>They are still usuable but I expected a better product.  </li>
            <li>The company I ordered (Hongnuo nail supplies factory ) from was really fast though.</li>

            <li>well to my surprise once they were delivered I received two of each they&#x27;re very well made and came way before the delivery date</li>
            <li>got 2 pair 1 straight and 1 curved.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li>Fast service would do business with again</li>
            <li>For sure I would buy another set in the near future.</li>
            <li>Not the absolute highest quality but way better than I expected for this price.  </li>
            <li>Equal quality to what you can get in the stores, just much cheaper!!!  </li>
            <li>A great pair that you can get a little messy and clean up.</li>
            <li>These are large so that you can have a little more control.</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, durable, and comfortable to work with for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>No problems with either pair so far, and they really help me with placing nail tape!</li>
            <li>A cannot live without tool!</li>
            <li>Nothing more or less of what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>the shipping from hong kong took FOREVER, but for such a low price, I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent prices pair of tweezers for nail art</li>
            <li>Not really a serious pair of tweezers but</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for something to help put rhinestones on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Plus they were super cheap (especially for 2 pairs) and arrived quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Company responded right away when the order was late and were very friendly.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are nice enough, but they&#x27;re so cheaply made that it&#x27;s impossible to do any very high detailed work with them.</li>
            <li>Which almost made me feel a little exclusive :)</li>
            <li>They work, but I wish they were a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>The metal is pretty cheap though and my tips on the angled ones have bent a little from use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s low quality, the tip didn&#x27;t line up well, so it wasn&#x27;t useful</li>
            <li>These are really nice tweezers for picking up tiny objects such as tiny gemstones or the like.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are longer than normal ones I bought in the store.  </li>
            <li>The points are super small, perfect for rhinestones and other small decorations.</li>
            <li>They are pretty thin, but for me they are very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Cheap and sharp.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was bit odd when I received it, one of the tweezers were glued crooked which I thought was kinda weird lol but other than that, I don&#x27;t have anything much to complain about :P</li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>so I could use them to adhere my new sparkles to my nails.</li>
            <li>Its very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to mention, your eyebrows are gonna look fantastic at your next house party, which may possibly be a conversation starter...</li>
            <li>The price is a bargain since it is coming from very far.</li>
            <li>Very skinny tips, makes it easy to grab small crystals.</li>
            <li>They operate like any pair of tweezers, but the angled and sharp end makes them useful for doing all sorts of things, like picking splinters out of fingers, pulling out the change that falls in the cracks of the sofa (because who wants to put their hands in there)</li>
            <li>I got this pair of tweezers for less than $2 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>they arrived quickly and was just what i expected.</li>
            <li>Theres alot of bad reviews but they came in perfect nothing wrong with them i love them!</li>
            <li>Quality is a little cheap, does the job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand why there were two that were included in this, but I use the standard straight tweezers nearly every time I add something to my manicure.</li>
            <li>These two items arrived way too early than it was scheduled.</li>
            <li>so I was very happily surprised when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>I was nicely surprised with the weight and quality  of them.</li>
            <li>It was not made of regular stainless steel.</li>
            <li>well, so far.</li>
            <li>i suggest to not waste your money</li>
            <li>This product far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>When I got them in the mail I was surprised by the quality</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how sturdy they were.  </li>
            <li>I bought the nail art gems which are tiny and the tweezers grab them very well.</li>
            <li>and if you apply too much pressure (assuming you use both hands), you CAN bend them, but for what they cost and overall use, I would say they were just as advertised.</li>
            <li>early then the date u say.</li>
            <li>They get the job done as far as with pulling off nail tape or holding sponges/cotton for nail designs.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>tips did not match up completely, guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li>I have a friend that is really into crafts and DIY projects, and she recently mentioned that while picking up the tiniest pieces, she tends to glue her fingers together.</li>
            <li>they arrived, I was really surprised at how sturdy they were.</li>
            <li>I went wrong by thinking I had a good deal</li>
            <li>Nice, thick metal and tension is just right for applying little jewels, etc.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you purchased more than one set as these are hard to find in my local area.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use these to tweeze eyebrows, but they work just fine for picking up small rhinestones.</li>
            <li>be stable too actually be used as normal tweezers because the  tip ends  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, wanted, and expected.  </li>
            <li>BUT mine came wrapped in individual boxes, brand new, just as you would buy them from the store.</li>
            <li>I visited my local nail store only to find the identical item was way too much money.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Easy to grip which is essential in using them with the small nail art pieces.</li>
            <li>It came with a pair of really long, not sharp normal tweezers and then the curved tweezers.</li>
            <li>for general art, beading, crafts, etc.</li>
            <li>I will test them in the near future.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the curved ones.</li>
            <li>But, I have absolutely no use for the straight tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the curved tweezer so far</li>
            <li>Now they aren&#x27;t going to be as nice as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I love how thin these are.  </li>
            <li>These are ok, but not great quality.</li>
            <li>They appear to be stainless steel, as described, although not as heavy grade as more expensive ones, and the spring in the pinching action is quite soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my little crystal nail art.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all weak and easy to break.</li>
            <li>The project that I ordered these to complete has long been done.</li>
            <li>Bites real hard unlike some other tweezers I own.  </li>
            <li>They also work well just for super small tweezer things!</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacturer and they promised to ship new ones due to</li>
            <li>In addition to allowing you to handle small appliques for nails, they are also very useful for other crafting purposes.  </li>
            <li>when I got them in the mail they were in a huge bag and bent because of how thin they are...</li>

            <li> They are okay</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I havent got the chance to use them yet but they seem ok.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>

            <li> very fast arrival!</li>
            <li> If I were to recommend this product, I would mentioning the very first sentence of my review.</li>
            <li> Such a good product especially if you can&#x27;t pick up stones on your own</li>
            <li> It does take time to get a technique down, but once you do these are a great time saver.</li>
            <li> But these are great to use for other projects as well!  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for picking up small stones and placing  the rhinestones in the exactly the right place on my nails and any manicure.</li>
            <li> Works really good for applying rhinestones to the nails (you will need a special glue)... not for any harder task, because they will bend.</li>
            <li> I found I can easily place the item wherever I like on my nails without having to spend too much time or effort on the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very durable and easy to use</li>
            <li> Love my Tweezers, it looks very professional.</li>
            <li> Easy to use great 4 them hard 2 pick up items when doing nail art.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do!</li>
            <li> The angled ones are great for placing anything you want correctly and the fine-tip ones are stellar at picking even the most delicate corner of a sticker.</li>
            <li> Pretty much straightforward use...  </li>
            <li> exactly as described, came before the shipping date!</li>
            <li> I just got involved in doing some nail art of my own and saw this on amazon, it just took a little time to get here, but that was fine , I knew that already!</li>
            <li> They work great at picking the little diomonds up.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, they work perfect for applying the little nail diamonds etc to the nail.</li>
            <li> WORTH TO WAIT</li>
            <li> But for the money, they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Not too useful for my taste.</li>
            <li> Would have liked if they had even a simple carrying case.</li>
            <li> My nails look way more professional when I use these rather than drugstore tweezers.</li>
            <li> So nice to finally find something to make the job easier!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> ARE SO USEFUL</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I bout these along with many new details for nails, I got the gems and fimo clay fruit slices; these make it so much easier to apply on your nails!</li>
            <li> but they are good for other things.</li>
            <li> price is right...</li>
            <li> shipped they right away but even from China I received them in 2 week&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The tweezers slide right off</li>
            <li> These tweezers r cheap looking but r good for picking up small stuff for my nail art..  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with them is that they tend to bend very easily.</li>
            <li> amazon is great for some products and others i would say dont waste your money when you could get something better from the local dollar tree.</li>
            <li> Great item for picking up small items.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are great for small mail art</li>
            <li> Great for grabbing small gems or stones to put on your nails.  </li>
            <li> I use them all the time they are great for picking up small jewels for your nails.</li>
            <li> Curved pair great for placing small glitters and studs.</li>
            <li> great for picking up small items and for crafting you get two tweezers</li>
            <li> , I have discard it once received, not worth it even with the good price</li>
            <li> These tweezers are a good deal for the price, and they are sharp!</li>
            <li> I am happy to get what I was looking for and within a such short period of time.</li>
            <li> It is rather soft and easily bent out of shape before picking up anything.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These work great for picking up tiny pieces of craft supplies, especially or the nail gem stones I purchased.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to order these...shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m glad that the package included two tweezers and the other one works fine.</li>
            <li> This order was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an amazing 18 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> These Tweezers are great for using flat back gemstones.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very useful in crafts that I do; sometimes nothing else will work nearly as well--or at all!</li>
            <li> These are Okay - thin metal that bends easily but were super cheap.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> i love that they came in the same month</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I discovered.</li>
            <li> i love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> just exactly what I needed for my crafting.</li>
            <li> working pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> love the fact that two different styles of tweezers are included.</li>
            <li> had I seen them first.</li>
            <li> were exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Useful when putting jewels on your nails.</li>
            <li> i actually brought it for my wife for eye brows, but i kept one of them  :-)</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li> I find that I used them on most every project I make &amp; not only with jewels.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m nor satisfied or dissatisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> but they look exactly like I thought they would.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seem like much but worth the money being paid</li>
            <li> but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> these are perfect for picking up extra small items.</li>
            <li> better deal then at local stores or even walmart!</li>
            <li> The ends don&#x27;t meet up, and they are pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> I know where to buy more product from next time i shop online!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present and my granddaughters will love using them for all their nail products.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more to have extra on hand</li>
            <li> A must have for your projects, makes getting those Phinestones in place so much easier!</li>
            <li> These are awesome tweezers...and for the price you cannot go wrong...</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i needed for the stones to place on the nails.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail early and was exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li> then I am happy because they will last very long</li>
            <li> The tweezers are much larger than expected which is great.</li>
            <li> Came when expected, good quality but the straighter pair doesn&#x27;t come together completely.</li>
            <li> They are a little shorter than I would like but definitely useable and will be good for detailed projects.  </li>
            <li> I love how easily these tweezers are to use to grip the small rhinestone decals for nails.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I pretty much got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> They also work pretty good for applying full cover false nails.</li>
            <li> If extreme precision were essential, I would have sought out industrial quality, not nail art tools, and intended to pay many times more.</li>
            <li> so idk how good &amp; long they are going to last...</li>
            <li> I think they are fine for nail art, would not technically work as tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  </li>
            <li> First of All this tweezers took way too long to get to me and when I finally got them they were just OK!</li>
            <li> Handy little tweezers.  </li>
            <li> They work great for big decorations that can&#x27;t be picked up with a little topcoat on a dotting tool.</li>
            <li> Curved Tweezer work better than expected and straight</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> Vs the straight</li>
            <li> There not to sturdy but they do the job thanks</li>
            <li> they are very thin/ flimsy  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I should of really read the reviews before I purchsed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really didn&#x27;t expect much for under $2</li>
            <li> And they are very durable.</li>
            <li> Their also slim making it lighter on  your hand when you are trying to focus so intensely.</li>
            <li> these make designing so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> got here fast too.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot .</li>
            <li> i really dont like them, but for the price i got them</li>
            <li> The beauty supply stores charge so much for these.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for rhinestone.</li>
            <li> they are a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like the angled tweezers.  </li>
            <li> very happy&lt;</li>
            <li> and they r very sturdy</li>
            <li> I am using them to pick up nail decorations and the straight ones didn&#x27;t open as big as I would have liked</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others who is looking for the tools for precise work</li>
            <li> Ready to get to work on my daughters toes</li>
            <li> These work great as they have thin tips to pick up the variety of nail art decal I have.</li>
            <li> I got these for my goddaughter, she is really into nail design</li>
            <li> very practical.</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast considering it came from China.</li>
            <li> I prefer the angled ones when applying gems to my nails, and the straight ones when organizing my placement.  </li>
            <li> I really like that u get 2 pairs.</li>
            <li> One curved and one straight.</li>
            <li> I am into designing my nails and I was looking for something to help me apply the gems in my nails, this tweezers are very helpful and they are made with a very resistant material</li>
            <li> These tweezers were very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> They are still usuable but I expected a better product.  </li>
            <li> The company I ordered (Hongnuo nail supplies factory ) from was really fast though.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS ITEM.&lt;br</li>
            <li> before it said they would come I absolutely recommend buying these</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have TOO much to say about these, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleaded with product.</li>
            <li> well to my surprise once they were delivered I received two of each they&#x27;re very well made and came way before the delivery date</li>
            <li> got 2 pair 1 straight and 1 curved.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li> Fast service would do business with again</li>
            <li> For sure I would buy another set in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not the absolute highest quality but way better than I expected for this price.  </li>
            <li> Equal quality to what you can get in the stores, just much cheaper!!!  </li>
            <li> A great pair that you can get a little messy and clean up.</li>
            <li> These are large so that you can have a little more control.</li>
            <li> They are lightweight, durable, and comfortable to work with for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> No problems with either pair so far, and they really help me with placing nail tape!</li>
            <li> A cannot live without tool!</li>
            <li> Nothing more or less of what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> the shipping from hong kong took FOREVER, but for such a low price, I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent prices pair of tweezers for nail art</li>
            <li> Not really a serious pair of tweezers but</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for something to help put rhinestones on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Plus they were super cheap (especially for 2 pairs) and arrived quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Company responded right away when the order was late and were very friendly.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are nice enough, but they&#x27;re so cheaply made that it&#x27;s impossible to do any very high detailed work with them.</li>
            <li> Which almost made me feel a little exclusive :)</li>
            <li> They work, but I wish they were a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> The metal is pretty cheap though and my tips on the angled ones have bent a little from use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low quality, the tip didn&#x27;t line up well, so it wasn&#x27;t useful</li>
            <li> These are really nice tweezers for picking up tiny objects such as tiny gemstones or the like.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are longer than normal ones I bought in the store.  </li>
            <li> The points are super small, perfect for rhinestones and other small decorations.</li>
            <li> They are pretty thin, but for me they are very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Cheap and sharp.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was bit odd when I received it, one of the tweezers were glued crooked which I thought was kinda weird lol but other than that, I don&#x27;t have anything much to complain about :P</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li> so I could use them to adhere my new sparkles to my nails.</li>
            <li> Its very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention, your eyebrows are gonna look fantastic at your next house party, which may possibly be a conversation starter...</li>
            <li> The price is a bargain since it is coming from very far.</li>
            <li> Very skinny tips, makes it easy to grab small crystals.</li>
            <li> They operate like any pair of tweezers, but the angled and sharp end makes them useful for doing all sorts of things, like picking splinters out of fingers, pulling out the change that falls in the cracks of the sofa (because who wants to put their hands in there)</li>
            <li> I got this pair of tweezers for less than $2 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> they arrived quickly and was just what i expected.</li>
            <li> Theres alot of bad reviews but they came in perfect nothing wrong with them i love them!</li>
            <li> Quality is a little cheap, does the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why there were two that were included in this, but I use the standard straight tweezers nearly every time I add something to my manicure.</li>
            <li> These two items arrived way too early than it was scheduled.</li>
            <li> so I was very happily surprised when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I was nicely surprised with the weight and quality  of them.</li>
            <li> It was not made of regular stainless steel.</li>
            <li> well, so far.</li>
            <li> i suggest to not waste your money</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> When I got them in the mail I was surprised by the quality</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how sturdy they were.  </li>
            <li> I bought the nail art gems which are tiny and the tweezers grab them very well.</li>
            <li> and if you apply too much pressure (assuming you use both hands), you CAN bend them, but for what they cost and overall use, I would say they were just as advertised.</li>
            <li> early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> They get the job done as far as with pulling off nail tape or holding sponges/cotton for nail designs.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> tips did not match up completely, guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li> I have a friend that is really into crafts and DIY projects, and she recently mentioned that while picking up the tiniest pieces, she tends to glue her fingers together.</li>
            <li> they arrived, I was really surprised at how sturdy they were.</li>
            <li> I went wrong by thinking I had a good deal</li>
            <li> Nice, thick metal and tension is just right for applying little jewels, etc.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you purchased more than one set as these are hard to find in my local area.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use these to tweeze eyebrows, but they work just fine for picking up small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> be stable too actually be used as normal tweezers because the  tip ends  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, wanted, and expected.  </li>
            <li> BUT mine came wrapped in individual boxes, brand new, just as you would buy them from the store.</li>
            <li> I visited my local nail store only to find the identical item was way too much money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Easy to grip which is essential in using them with the small nail art pieces.</li>
            <li> It came with a pair of really long, not sharp normal tweezers and then the curved tweezers.</li>
            <li> for general art, beading, crafts, etc.</li>
            <li> I will test them in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the curved ones.</li>
            <li> But, I have absolutely no use for the straight tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the curved tweezer so far</li>
            <li> Now they aren&#x27;t going to be as nice as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I love how thin these are.  </li>
            <li> These are ok, but not great quality.</li>
            <li> They appear to be stainless steel, as described, although not as heavy grade as more expensive ones, and the spring in the pinching action is quite soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my little crystal nail art.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all weak and easy to break.</li>
            <li> The project that I ordered these to complete has long been done.</li>
            <li> Bites real hard unlike some other tweezers I own.  </li>
            <li> They also work well just for super small tweezer things!</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacturer and they promised to ship new ones due to</li>
            <li> In addition to allowing you to handle small appliques for nails, they are also very useful for other crafting purposes.  </li>
            <li> when I got them in the mail they were in a huge bag and bent because of how thin they are...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of them so far, but I expect the other one to work just as well.  </li>
            <li> These little tweezers are very useful for picking up and positioning small nail art items--</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and they came before expected date!!!</li>
            <li> The shipping was normal I guess, considering the fact that it&#x27;s coming from Hong Kong to U.S., so it took about a little over two weeks (17 days) to arrive.</li>
            <li> Handy tools for what you need to have for small objects or small tight spots.</li>
            <li> They are not very strong they are very flimsy and they don&#x27;t open very wide</li>
            <li> I did truthfully not expect much of these when I ordered them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super thin so they feel flimsy, but they have not bent.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular hair-tweezing tweezers, as I own only thick stiff ones for my thick brows and cannot risk messing up their precision for nail art.  </li>
            <li> poorly made,  cheap and waste of time, the money and efforts of even going to the mail box to get them after they finally came over 1 month later.</li>
            <li> Arrived a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Came in yesterday earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I am no professional, but I do have a ton of nail stuff</li>
            <li> it took to long to get.</li>
            <li> I think not too long</li>
            <li> They are a complete waste.  </li>
            <li> Was delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> the one with the curved tip got like a bit stretched out and doesn&#x27;t line up correctly anymore and doesnt tweeze because of that</li>
            <li> The tweezers are cheap, but the quality is very poor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did my nail art for so long without these!</li>
            <li> You always need tweezers to pick things up when you nails aren&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> The straight pointed tweezers weren&#x27;t align but still manageable, however, the curve ones was thrown to the trash, it was so misplaced and uneven</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS</li>
            <li> The tweezers are not firm and they are not good for short hair.</li>
            <li> They do the job without being anything extra or less.</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to bend them</li>
            <li> There were a few tiny scratches</li>
            <li> They were resonably priced and they came in a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Tweezers were exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> it was not what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> than expected</li>
            <li> I bought it to use to place jewels onto wet nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is as I expected.</li>
            <li> They work Amazing, thin yet can pick up the nail art and put the nail art on very careful with out messing up your nails, because they are thin!</li>
            <li> Very hard to pick up the stone and keep them  level to glue them on mails or any other surfaces it is a good quality but very difficult to use on rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m placing the rhinestones (or other decorative elements).</li>
            <li> Other then that what else can I say?</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use them to put on eye lash and to place sequence and nail arts decoration on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;compare to some other products</li>
            <li> other reviews said they were bent or rusted.</li>
            <li> I guess I will use them for other type of craft</li>
            <li> These nail art tweezers are so pointy it is designed for small items and that is what I purchased them for, they are two different shapes.  </li>
            <li> other than being a bit sideways they get the job done.</li>
            <li> These nail tweezers make everything a lot easier to handle nail gems and other nail art products.</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> they are sharp,,, not 4  lil children.</li>
            <li> I mean its not exactly a conversation piece at your next house party, but</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I had no idea they were coming from overseas until after I purchased them.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it took forever to arrive, but we were not in a hurry, so I&#x27;m giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are pointed and sharp!  </li>
            <li> It would be pretty difficult to pick all those little pieces up without these tools!</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews before buying this product and was warned that though one of the tweezers was in mint condition, the other seemed to be \\&quot;used\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Both products were sealed and yet the curved tweezers seemed to have an odd indescribable substance on them that wouldn&#x27;t wash off.</li>
            <li> Less than $2 for 2 tweezers.</li>
            <li> The curved tip one has a slight longer length on the tip , maybe a millimeter, have not of seen if this affects the performance yet.</li>
            <li> LOOKING AT THE PRICE, I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE LESS THAN WHAT THEY WERE.</li>
            <li> get in tight spots with no problem.</li>
            <li> Fake, not authentic stainless steel, coating chipping off and rust marks inside both sets of tweezers.</li>
            <li> so i use them to apply rhinestones &amp;other small things.</li>
            <li> They are a little</li>
            <li> These are a little flimsy but get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I use them to put little rhine stones on my nails.</li>
            <li> but if you are trying to grab some thing a little heavier it dosen&#x27;t grab it as well</li>
            <li> does what they&#x27;re made to do, a little filmsy but they&#x27;re made for nail art.</li>
            <li> but when you take It out of the package it looks scratches up a little..</li>
            <li> these do the job by picking up small jewls and other nail 3d art.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them a few weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t run into any problems with them.</li>
            <li> I  ordered these  tweezers  quite a  few  weeks ago,  in fact  over 4  wks  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, do not buy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an epic fail.</li>
            <li> They are overall thin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> They are a waste because they don&#x27;t line up at all</li>
            <li> Very tight grip.  </li>
            <li> Thin, small, took forever to arrive...would not hold up over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> and these are helpful in placing the little crystals on her nails!</li>
            <li> but they are a little hard too use and handle no grip</li>
            <li> not top of the line</li>
            <li> picking up beads and small gems.</li>
            <li> They do well with small jewels.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to handle those small gems.  </li>
            <li> They do have a gripped tip which helps picking up small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> It picks up all the nail art small objects for your nails.</li>
            <li> well the stones are so small they can&#x27;t pick them</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that they are practically almost useless when it comes to peeling things off like when I use the striping tape.  </li>
            <li> I use the curved on for picking up small items when crafting.</li>
            <li> I even if they were free, they are very bad.</li>
            <li> very heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers serve their purpose one is used for my daughters nail jewels and the other is used to fix any broken jewelry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the ability to to grip anything least of all small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> so they are hard to use</li>
            <li> A little thin</li>
            <li> Or to apply little sequins to art projects with thin glue.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be getting dirty</li>
            <li> Cheap.. terrible quality, do not buy!</li>
            <li> I just received them today and they are so thin and one of them are uneven.</li>
            <li> I mean people have tweezers, but aint NOBODY got THESE tweezers.</li>
            <li> 2 pairs small to catch those sparkle gems!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grasp anything small or thin at all.  </li>
            <li> i noticed rust on the tips of the tweezers which i hated so much.</li>
            <li> its not good quality</li>
            <li> I wish that I had purchased them sooner, then I wouldn&#x27;t be so frustrated with having to pick them up with my long fingernails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so weak..</li>
            <li> Arrived way late but got here!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would!</li>
            <li> It is still usable, but it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The angled don&#x27;t grab thin things either or very delicate things.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work...very poorly made.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are made to thin</li>
            <li> These are paper thin...</li>
            <li> Extremely poorly made.  </li>
            <li> received with package broken and nothing inside the package, and i believe its the tweezer because i received everything else i purchased but not this one.</li>
            <li> They are useless.  </li>
            <li> I was going to use them to do my nails, but they are useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the curve one, it seems weird angle.</li>
            <li> They are made of a very thin &amp;#34;starling steel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The quality of these is very poor.</li>
            <li> but item looks very expensive</li>
            <li> , maybe I got a bad set but both are bad.  </li>
            <li> Real disappointed.</li>
            <li> awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> These work very well. I am assuming they still do but my daughter lost them somewhere in my daughter&#x27;s room. :)</li>
            <li> I like having both tip types available.  The tweezer I use depends on what finger I&#x27;m working on, or where on the nail I&#x27;m placing the rhinestones (or other decorative elements). the shipping from hong kong took FOREVER, but for such a low price, I&#x27;m okay with that.  I&#x27;ve had them a few weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t run into any problems with them.</li>
            <li> These are large so that you can have a little more control. They&#x27;re great for the price. If I ever need more I&#x27;ll definitely come here for more. I love nail art so these come in handy! Highly recommended and they came before expected date!!! Gotta love that right?</li>
            <li> These two items arrived way too early than it was scheduled. I am happy to get what I was looking for and within a such short period of time. Thanks, for a great service.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and the edge is very convenient to pick even the smallest rhinestones.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> ive passed these up at the beauty supply houses thinking these were nice &amp; pointy (like sharpened)..  They arent. one thing is, i needed the curvature Vs the straight point- so I ordered these. they come in a pair.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, they bend super easy. Would not buy again!</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> Cheap and sharp.  Wish I never bought.</li>
            <li> Great just as expected</li>
            <li> There not to sturdy but they do the job thanks</li>
            <li> I do nails so i use them to apply rhinestones &amp;other small things. They work great, they hold onto the item well, &amp; the way theyre shaped makes it easy to place things where u want them. Doing nails is alot easier with these. They also arrived about a week before the estimated delivery date. I would recomend these.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails... These are perfect for picking gems, rhinestones, fimo and the color strips. Great quality and got this item pretty fast... And the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;already ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Being me I didn&#x27;t even realize I was getting 2 different tweezers in this. I thought I was only getting 1 so I was very happily surprised when I opened the package. These work great for picking up the tiny gems I apply to my nails. Plus they were super cheap (especially for 2 pairs) and arrived quicker than I expected. VERY HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> Just like the picture...good tweezers. Its probably better if they had rubber handles. They are a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right...</li>
            <li> They work ok...the points don&#x27;t align perfectly so they don&#x27;t have that great  accuracy or the best grip on things</li>
            <li> So many used for these!</li>
            <li> Great deal and the products worked well for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great grip and they grab on to gems which is what i use them for perfectly. Both are excellent for the price i paid for them.</li>
            <li> I  wouldn&#x27;t even give them a  star but it won&#x27;t let me leave it blank. I  ordered these  tweezers  quite a  few  weeks ago,  in fact  over 4  wks  ago  and I  have just received then only to  be continuously dissatisfied. I  guess it&#x27;s very true... you get what you pay for.  and don&#x27;t be fooled  by the writing and labeling on this listing.  they are very thin/ flimsy  and  won&#x27;t hold anything  let alone  be stable too actually be used as normal tweezers because the  tip ends  don&#x27;t even line up.  poorly made,  cheap and waste of time, the money and efforts of even going to the mail box to get them after they finally came over 1 month later.</li>
            <li> These are a little flimsy but get the job done.  You have to be careful not to bend them but they do great for helping pick and peel stripping tape and gems.</li>
            <li> Love them both! Do their job perfectly and would recommend. I used them for rhinestones and nail bows, love it! Great quality</li>
            <li> I love these surgical quality tweezers. I use them for ALL kinds of projects and they&#x27;ve so far been holding up great.How could anyone compete?</li>
            <li> it works great it picks up mostly any beads thank you for selling this item for a great price &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> I only needed the curved one. works fine.</li>
            <li> These do what they say they will. They are really good quality as well. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all. The price is right and the quality is good. The shipping was fast. If ur into doing different things this is a great tool</li>
            <li> I just received them today and they are so thin and one of them are uneven. I should of really read the reviews before I purchsed. Real disappointed. Not trying to return, it took forever to get here. Waste of money, do not buy.</li>
            <li> MAKE YOUR JOB EASY FOR ANY PROJECT .... PRICE IS AWESOME... WORTH TO WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR IT.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> nice works great for stones but not so well with the stickers</li>
            <li> Arrived a week earlier than expected. The tweezers are good and solid, with fine tips. Honestly, I really didn&#x27;t expect much for under $2 and I am incredibly pleased!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are much larger than expected which is great. Better to help in my hand. Came in 2 separate packages. Very skinny tips, makes it easy to grab small crystals. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great tool for my nail kit</li>
            <li> I liked the tweezers they were a great buy and a good quality for the price. I would recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> I love these item&#x27;s. I use them all the time when doing my nails to pick up the littlest of gems.</li>
            <li> these are a good quality &amp; great for picking up the little studs &amp; placing them on the nail plate</li>
            <li> They did take a while to arrive, but overall they great! Curved Tweezer work better than expected and straight tweezers as well! They both have multiple uses!</li>
            <li> so i just got my tweezers today and they are freaking cool..i love that they came in the same month i ordered them ..they came quicker than what i was expecting ..everyone should buy this ..you wont be disapointed ^_^</li>
            <li> Love my Tweezers, it looks very professional. It looks better than the  ones used in the nail salon. Love it</li>
            <li> These took a while to get to me about a month or more. The angles ones don&#x27;t look like the picture.  And the tweezer looking one was bent a but at the tip and looks like it&#x27;s burned on one side</li>
            <li> These are a great necessity. I can&#x27;t do the gemstones without them. They work like a charm. Such a great value too. Gonna order another set.</li>
            <li> They came packaged nicely with the tips held together to prevent expansion, and they work perfectly for nail art. They also work well just for super small tweezer things!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be any good since they were so cheap. I was nicely surprised with the weight and quality  of them. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I did play with them. Definitely a great purchase not only for the price but if you want to make your nails snazzy with jewels and such.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews before buying this product and was warned that though one of the tweezers was in mint condition, the other seemed to be \\&quot;used\\&quot;. That&#x27;s exactly what I discovered. Both products were sealed and yet the curved tweezers seemed to have an odd indescribable substance on them that wouldn&#x27;t wash off. It is still usable, but it was a little disappointing. Still a good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE THE TOOLS THAT THE NAIL TECHNICIAN USES IN THE NAIL SALON. VERY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOING HER OWN NAILS</li>
            <li> well ya get what you pay for folks and with all this nail art stuff and makeup as well i am def learning my lesson. amazon is great for some products and others i would say dont waste your money when you could get something better from the local dollar tree.</li>
            <li> I visited my local nail store only to find the identical item was way too much money. Finding them here was a blessing for my pocket book not to mention they work just as good as those pricey ones in my local nail store. I will continue to order from this supplier via Amazon. I actually got my product sooner than I was advised.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for my nail art. Other then that what else can I say? It&#x27;s just tweezers.</li>
            <li> They are not very strong they are very flimsy and they don&#x27;t open very wide so they are hard to use</li>
            <li> I just got involved in doing some nail art of my own and saw this on amazon, it just took a little time to get here, but that was fine , I knew that already!</li>
            <li> These tweezers serve their purpose one is used for my daughters nail jewels and the other is used to fix any broken jewelry. Both are great for precision and perfection I like them a lot. And they are very durable.</li>
            <li> I love how easily these tweezers are to use to grip the small rhinestone decals for nails. Their also slim making it lighter on  your hand when you are trying to focus so intensely.</li>
            <li> came in two separate packages.. theyre flimsy but picks up the rhinestones. not top of the line but I like them.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fast shipping. Works great. I use them to put little rhine stones on my nails. They work great at picking the little diomonds up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low quality, the tip didn&#x27;t line up well, so it wasn&#x27;t useful, I have discard it once received, not worth it even with the good price</li>
            <li> I was glad to have received these items.. they arrived quickly and was just what i expected. Items were priced well and will be a great assess to my nail art collection. I recommend for the application of rhinestones, etc. i was applying mine my hand and know that these will help in the future process. Arrived well packaged and as I stated before quickly. I would order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> They work Amazing, thin yet can pick up the nail art and put the nail art on very careful with out messing up your nails, because they are thin!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Bigger than pictured, really sturdy and nice set!&lt;br /&gt;i really am happy i bought these, they are great quality for the price! love love love! if needed will buy again!</li>
            <li> They are useless.  The tips don&#x27;t line up so they can&#x27;t be used. I know they were inexpensive but still....</li>
            <li> Works really good for applying rhinestones to the nails (you will need a special glue)... not for any harder task, because they will bend.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t notice it came two in a pack till i received it. i love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The tweezers pick up tiny items such as nail art gems well. There were a few tiny scratches even though the packaging was in tact, they packed it securely, and it works which is what I was asking for. The price is a bargain since it is coming from very far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to pick up the little decorations to place on my nails. Lol. before I was losing and dropping them when using regular tweezers. Nice product. I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these for her nails. We&#x27;re saving a bunch of money doing this at home instead of going to the nail salon</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I needed them to do. I was looking for a decent prices pair of tweezers for nail art and that&#x27;s just what I got. I use them to pick up and place gems on my nails. They aren&#x27;t really good for anything else but nail art.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why there were two that were included in this, but I use the standard straight tweezers nearly every time I add something to my manicure. Absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> This product was good for what I needed them for. Nothing fancy but just as described. Also received them within the time frame stated during my transaction.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely perfect.  Exactly what I needed and work wonderfully.  I am able to use them for many different things. Love Em Thank you</li>
            <li> who knew! these make designing so much easier and faster. light weight and affordable. I love em, two pair for this great price</li>
            <li> These tweezers have the curved in which makes placing decorations such as rhinestones, striping tape, etc on your nails.  They are solidly made and I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> If you have butter fingers, and do lots of tiny art (nail art for example)these are a life saver. I don&#x27;t know how I did my nail art for so long without these!</li>
            <li> Very cheap. They do not work like I thought they would.  I would not recommend for anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Does its job and is a lot easier to pick up the rhinestones than trying to use my fingers like I was!</li>
            <li> just exactly what I needed for my crafting. picking up beads and small gems. working pretty well for me. got here fast too.</li>
            <li> Great value for under $3 - especially with the free shipping! While the shipping does take a while from overseas, I received my products well ahead of the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that two different styles of tweezers are included. The angled pair is awesome for picking up small gemstones or fimo cane slices when doing nail art.  I found I can easily place the item wherever I like on my nails without having to spend too much time or effort on the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Quality is a little cheap, does the job. Definitely will be getting dirty so I am ok with that. Shipping quick, coming from overseas. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These work great and are very inexpensive.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for something to help put rhinestones on.</li>
            <li> A cannot live without tool! Picks up&amp;places perfectly! Can&#x27;t begin to work with rhinestone glitters without them! Thankyou&amp;I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers. Now they aren&#x27;t going to be as nice as the expensive ones. But for the money, they are worth it. They work great. You can&#x27;t beat the price. And coming from overseas, it arrived a lot earlier than I was expecting. Overall, I do recommend. They are working out great for me!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t use these to tweeze eyebrows, but they work just fine for picking up small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see the amazing nail art that my daughter and I can create using all this fun nail stuff!!!</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s what you get for a buck! lol Hopefully I can come up with something to use them for cause they definitely do not work the way they&#x27;re suppose to</li>
            <li> They are nice just a little thinner than i thought but over all nice. definitely good to pick up gems! Delivery took about 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> These are great for picking up rhinestones ang things like that. Great product. I would recommend this for nail art addicts lol.</li>
            <li> It took an eternity to receive these tweezers. The project that I ordered these to complete has long been done. The tweezers however&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seem sturdy and arrived damage free. I will test them in the near future. An update may follow if warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/24/2013  Tweezers work well have used them in several craft projects.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. Was advertised free dollarwise...just use some freebie points earned. I paid only 95 cents but I wouldn&#x27;t have paid 95 cents for them had I seen them first. Cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> Came in yesterday earlier than expected. And I used them right away packaged good and I recommend this. Its very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These took a while to arrive but still within the to e frame.&lt;br /&gt;They were exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Useful when putting jewels on your nails.</li>
            <li> the metal is quite flexible but it will do the work. I recommend. graet price tho.exactly as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Have to learn to use these! hihihihhhi need more practice in using these with out messing up.Thanks a lot . good job.</li>
            <li> I used this product right when I got it! Such a good product especially if you can&#x27;t pick up stones on your own</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, and sometimes I like to get fancy...These are perfect for gems, rhinestones, fimo canes and the color strips. Great quality and arrived well before estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work...very poorly made. I can&#x27;t clasp on to any nail art or anything else needed. I go somewhere else and buy</li>
            <li> Great item for picking up small items. Price is  great but item looks very expensive but it&#x27;s not. Great quality.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are great for small mail art but if you are trying to grab some thing a little heavier it dosen&#x27;t grab it as well</li>
            <li> These tweezers are a good deal for the price, and they are sharp! So far I have only used the curved ones.</li>
            <li> They showed up in Chinese packages, with no english on them anywhere. Which almost made me feel a little exclusive :) I mean people have tweezers, but aint NOBODY got THESE tweezers. I mean its not exactly a conversation piece at your next house party, but you know in the back of your mind, you have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, your eyebrows are gonna look fantastic at your next house party, which may possibly be a conversation starter... They could even contribute to your sex life, so really, these little puppies are priceless...</li>
            <li> very fast arrival! does what they&#x27;re made to do, a little filmsy but they&#x27;re made for nail art. I think they&#x27;re great for the price and what they&#x27;re meant to be used for.</li>
            <li> best twizzzers, i like my beard in the perfect form, i dont like stray hair on my face, its able to grab the smallest grab able hair on the face .. i actually brought it for my wife for eye brows, but i kept one of them  :-)</li>
            <li> This tool is great for adding rhinestones to nail designs.</li>
            <li> i like my tweezers they are of good quality&lt;br /&gt;i use them to put on eye lash and to place sequence and nail arts decoration on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;compare to some other products the hold they has grips that hold the item weather it is eyelash etc.&lt;br /&gt;Sandra J</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what the description says. No problems with either pair so far, and they really help me with placing nail tape!</li>
            <li> i noticed rust on the tips of the tweezers which i hated so much. i dont know how to solve this issue as im afriad it might be harmful as i use it on nail art for me and my family members.</li>
            <li> I was going to use them to do my nails, but they are useless. I even if they were free, they are very bad. The metal is so soft you can bend them with minimal force.</li>
            <li> Just received them today! The points are super small, perfect for rhinestones and other small decorations. I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> These Tweezers are great for using flat back gemstones. I wish that I had purchased them sooner, then I wouldn&#x27;t be so frustrated with having to pick them up with my long fingernails.</li>
            <li> I know they were cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.  Not too useful for my taste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even pick anything up with them. I about to throw them away they are so crappy and cheap.</li>
            <li> It came with a pair of really long, not sharp normal tweezers and then the curved tweezers. I threw away the normal ones, but the curved ones are great for putting on nail jewels.</li>
            <li> I am no professional, but I do have a ton of nail stuff and I&#x27;m getting good at it! These seem quite cheaply made. I guess they&#x27;ll do the job for larger things, but not tiny gems.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are made to thin I don&#x27;t have the ability to to grip anything least of all small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> it took to long to get. and they are cheaply made. i really dont like them, but for the price i got them</li>
            <li> these two tools are a must for any nail person they are so handy and for the price you cant go worng.</li>
            <li> other reviews said they were bent or rusted. BUT mine came wrapped in individual boxes, brand new, just as you would buy them from the store. PERFECT for jewel application...</li>
            <li> Very hard to pick up the stone and keep them  level to glue them on mails or any other surfaces it is a good quality but very difficult to use on rhinestones. I guess I will use them for other type of craft</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product! I use mine all the time to place small rhinestones when doing my nails works very well!</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great for all of my nail art and I&#x27;m very happy with the success that I&#x27;m having using them.</li>
            <li> the straight tweezers do not work as good as the curved ones i like them perfectly packaged will shop again</li>
            <li> It does its job...but when I received it, one of the tweezer was all scratched up and can see the rust mark.....but like I said...it does its job....</li>
            <li> These tweezers r cheap looking but r good for picking up small stuff for my nail art..  its not good quality but it works..</li>
            <li> These are really nice tweezers for picking up tiny objects such as tiny gemstones or the like.  They are not designed for tweezing eyebrows.  The price was great.  This order was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an amazing 18 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  I am very pleased with this seller and this product and will use them again.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a couple sets of tweezers? They&#x27;re tweezers! They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I have rhinestones and stickers for days to do my nails and I love these. The angled ones are great for placing anything you want correctly and the fine-tip ones are stellar at picking even the most delicate corner of a sticker. Would have liked if they had even a simple carrying case.</li>
            <li> worked for what I bought it for</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend she loved them.  Very useful for eyelash applications.</li>
            <li> First of All this tweezers took way too long to get to me and when I finally got them they were just OK! They are made of a very thin &amp;#34;starling steel&amp;#34; so idk how good &amp; long they are going to last... I think not too long but we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers to pick up rhinestones to put on my nails and they do that with no problems.</li>
            <li> These are nice tweasers. not the best quality but for 85 cents you cannot complain. They do their job well and the 2 different kinds allow you to do different things.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for using decals with Nail Art.  My only complaint is I had no idea they were coming from overseas until after I purchased them.  The took forever to get here, I wish Amazon would in some way let customers know if items are shipping from across the world, I would have gladly paid more to get them from US.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers, it&#x27;s a great value for 2 pairs one curved and one fine point.  The beauty supply stores charge so much for these.</li>
            <li> They are okay I found this and thought I would be able to use to pick up rhinestones but no it wasn&#x27;t I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for rhinestone.</li>
            <li> My tween daughter used some of her birthday money and purchased these along with miniature crystals for nails - she loves creating designs on her nails and these are helpful in placing the little crystals on her nails!</li>
            <li> But these are great to use for other projects as well!  I would purchase again!  My boyfriend uses them on model cars with the tiny pieces.</li>
            <li> Okay, not the highest quality for sure (they won&#x27;t work on your eyebrows!)&lt;br /&gt;But for general art, beading, crafts, etc. they are a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped they right away but even from China I received them in 2 week&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are cheap, but the quality is very poor</li>
            <li> Great for grabbing small gems or stones to put on your nails.  Makes precision decorating easier.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It was not made of regular stainless steel. It is rather soft and easily bent out of shape before picking up anything.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, wanted, and expected.  They took awhile to get here but they were wonderfully priced and work well.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Very cheap for two tweezers.  Bought them to go with some rhinestones for my sister for Christmas.  She has not used tem yet but i am sure they will work fine.</li>
            <li> Good deal works well for applicating nail art charms.</li>
            <li> It works fine. Lifts even the tiniest rhinestones for nail art. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves doing their own nail art. It well-made too and does not rust...well, so far.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are not firm and they are not good for short hair. i suggest to not waste your money</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations. I find that I used them on most every project I make &amp; not only with jewels.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, ok delivery times, work great to pick small things  and decorate my nails</li>
            <li> These are great for picking up the rhinestones and decals! It would be pretty difficult to pick all those little pieces up without these tools! Love them!</li>
            <li> This was sent to someone out of state for a Christmas gift, I was told it arrived on time as stated, won&#x27;t know anything else till opened.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are very useful for picking up and positioning small nail art items-- my daughter loves using them.</li>
            <li> I did truthfully not expect much of these when I ordered them. When I got them in the mail I was surprised by the quality and I look forward to using them soon.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like the angled tweezers.  But, I have absolutely no use for the straight tweezers.  They don&#x27;t grasp anything small or thin at all.  They are a complete waste.  The angled don&#x27;t grab thin things either or very delicate things.  They do well with small jewels.  I tried to take tape off with both and they don&#x27;t grab well.</li>
            <li> They look just like in the pic, rcvd way before expected and using them to do grafts n projects with my 5 yr old, she likes picking up beads with them n sorting cotton balls. Also used to add bling to her nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  see why I got write a bunch of words for something I like, now if I didn&#x27;t like I have a whole lot more to say. But I don&#x27;t cause I like it, it&#x27;s pretty cool!!!</li>
            <li> Great for nail art and for eye brows!  Very high quality.  Very pleased with them.  Easy to hold and to use.</li>
            <li> i use it sometimes. It helps when i am placing the nail tape, the different decal stickers and the glitter.</li>
            <li> Item worked just as tweezers should.  I was surprised at how sturdy they were.  I would order this item again.</li>
            <li> awful. Thin, small, took forever to arrive...would not hold up over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I received these tweezers in about two weeks and they&#x27;re just perfect. My nails look way more professional when I use these rather than drugstore tweezers. For around $3 these are just life savers! I also use these tweezers when I am making my jewelry items for my online store. These tweezers get the job done nice and neat. For sure I would buy another set in the near future. If you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive rhinestone tweezers, these are what you need!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are alright, they&#x27;re \\&quot;you get what you paid for.\\&quot; One of the tweezers I received, the curved one, the ends don&#x27;t meet well therefore it does not pick up the stones easily. However, I&#x27;m glad that the package included two tweezers and the other one works fine. The shipping was normal I guess, considering the fact that it&#x27;s coming from Hong Kong to U.S., so it took about a little over two weeks (17 days) to arrive. The packaging was bit odd when I received it, one of the tweezers were glued crooked which I thought was kinda weird lol but other than that, I don&#x27;t have anything much to complain about :P Overall, I&#x27;m nor satisfied or dissatisfied with my purchase. If I were to recommend this product, I would mentioning the very first sentence of my review.</li>
            <li> These nail art tweezers are so pointy it is designed for small items and that is what I purchased them for, they are two different shapes.  I highly recommend you purchased more than one set as these are hard to find in my local area.  They can handle really tiny items.</li>
            <li> I havent got the chance to use them yet but they seem ok. Took forever to get. But im happy with it.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and perfect for picking up the tiny gems for my nail art.  I love them.</li>
            <li> I just got these and used them for 2mm rhinestones for nail art and they work great!! I even used them for nail art tape and they help me put the tape where it needs to be. very happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus they came waayy sooner than i was expecting</li>
            <li> Packaging is all in Chinese.  Pretty much straightforward use...  Use them to pick up your nail art so you can place it in the precise spot you want it.  Comes with two.  Very tight grip.  Bites real hard unlike some other tweezers I own.  You know how you get that one good pair of tweezers out of all 10 you own and you always go back to that one?  These are both like those.  Very impressed.  Now on to decipher all this Chinese text on the packaging...</li>
            <li> These are not the highest quality tweezers, but for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect them to be, and for my purposes, I am pleased with them. They appear to be stainless steel, as described, although not as heavy grade as more expensive ones, and the spring in the pinching action is quite soft. The tooling on the tips is only fair in its precision, but again, it works for my my purposes. If extreme precision were essential, I would have sought out industrial quality, not nail art tools, and intended to pay many times more.</li>
            <li> First off I LOVE these because come on ladies how many of u try to place something on ur nails n it&#x27;s an epic fail. They&#x27;re arrival time was amazing and they r very sturdy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality great use for grabbing rhinestones 100 % stainless steel and it comes from china. you would be satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I loved the price as well. I would definitely recommend this product. I really loved it.</li>
            <li> I guess that they will be okay.......I&#x27;m still waiting for the nail art to come, hopefully they will work when nail art arrives!</li>
            <li> These are exactly as described. I use them for my nail art rhinestones and it works perfectly! They were resonably priced and they came in a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> These are great...exactly what I needed.  They are very useful in creating nail art designs on my manicures.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> These are good tweezers. I especially love the curved ones. I am using them to pick up nail decorations and the straight ones didn&#x27;t open as big as I would have liked but they are good for other things.</li>
            <li> The quality of these is very poor. I was able to use them a couple of times and the tips stopped meeting up. I never dropped them or used them incorrectly. Oh well, I pretty much got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> What I great value!  I got this pair of tweezers for less than $2 with free shipping.  I love them!  In addition to allowing you to handle small appliques for nails, they are also very useful for other crafting purposes.  I use them to rethread my serger (the bent nose tweezers are the best for this) and to place rhinestones onto costumes and other projects.  I suggest getting a couple of sets and keeping them in your crafting kits as well as your travel kit.  If you do your own nails and want to add appliques these will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> These are paper thin...when I got them in the mail they were in a huge bag and bent because of how thin they are...I went wrong by thinking I had a good deal</li>
            <li> Theres alot of bad reviews but they came in perfect nothing wrong with them i love them! They are worth the time and money!</li>
            <li> These are pretty great for nail art and the quality is great. I thought it was gonna be cheap looking but it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m happy with them and I would definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> This product is a perfect tool to take the small piece that I have to take to design my customer nails.</li>
            <li> perfect item for the price.  I would definitely recommend it to others who is looking for the tools for precise work</li>
            <li> These tools have made all the difference in the world when applying rhinestones to nail art!  Wish I had them years ago!  So nice to finally find something to make the job easier!</li>
            <li> Tweezers were exactly as I expected.  The good thing is that they work well on craft projects.  Definitely bang for the bucks. Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> like omg here love it their a lot got them to day and happy with the striping i got thank you</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, they work perfect for applying the little nail diamonds etc to the nail. I don&#x27;t use the curve one, it seems weird angle. i love the straight one. For a buck apiece, who cares</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my little crystal nail art. I love it, so I would definitely recommend these tools.</li>
            <li> These are strong, good sized medium tweezers about 5 or 6 inches and the price is right! Excellent for picking up small objects.</li>
            <li> This nail art tweezers are great. They hold and grab on to the smallest nail art. I bought the nail art gems which are tiny and the tweezers grab them very well. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Haven&#x27;t used them yet. I will use soon though. Ready to get to work on my daughters toes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so weak.. can&#x27;t even pluck a hair out with this tweezer. very cheap. just threw them away.. do not purchase.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Less than $2 for 2 tweezers. Its not a bad product nor a great one. But it works for simple application of gems and etc..</li>
            <li> I had regular tweezers I could use for the rhinestones I bought, but decided to get specific ones for nail art. These work great as they have thin tips to pick up the variety of nail art decal I have. They are overall thin and if you apply too much pressure (assuming you use both hands), you CAN bend them, but for what they cost and overall use, I would say they were just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I was expecting. I got these for my goddaughter, she is really into nail design so I bought her a bunch of items from this seller because the prices were so great. Going to put it all together and give her a nail design kit for Christmas. I think she will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> So many uses.  I used them primarily to place designs in nail art.  They are the perfect size and easy to use.  They pick up and grip nicely, and the one with the curved tip is best for placing items onto the nail bed.  It is just easier to see using the curved tip.</li>
            <li> These work great for picking up tiny pieces of craft supplies, especially or the nail gem stones I purchased. very practical.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers. I use them all the time for all my nail art needs. These are great for beginner nail techs to seasoned nail techs. A great pair that you can get a little messy and clean up. For what you pay for them hey you can use them for whatever you need to pick up. The angled tweezers are my absolute favorite. I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Product came just like it was advertised. Packaged as well in cardboard individually. The curved tip one has a slight longer length on the tip , maybe a millimeter, have not of seen if this affects the performance yet. Product shipped fast considering it came from China.</li>
            <li> These are Okay - thin metal that bends easily but were super cheap. Arrived way late but got here! I think they are fine for nail art, would not technically work as tweezers. Company responded right away when the order was late and were very friendly.</li>
            <li> I use these tweezers to place beads on my manicures and pedicures, I especially like the curved tipped one. They are made of good quality and makes my job so much easier and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I prefer the angled ones when applying gems to my nails, and the straight ones when organizing my placement.  So glad I have both to use.</li>
            <li> is ok  is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> There cheap and do the job I need them for! Great at picking up rhinestones for nail art. I really like that u get 2 pairs. One curved and one straight. Good addition for anyone into nailart.</li>
            <li> I like them but they don&#x27;t seem to work like they should...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was amazing, the tweezers arrived within two weeks. They are lightweight, durable, and comfortable to work with for long periods of time. They are helpful with handling various sizes of rhinestones, especially the micro ones.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t not like that product at all.. it was not what i expected it to be. it&#x27;s all weak and easy to break.</li>
            <li> Very precise. Very happy with these. I use then for all sorts of crafting stuff besides nails. The angled tips are fun :)</li>
            <li> Very durable and easy to use</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would! Fake, not authentic stainless steel, coating chipping off and rust marks inside both sets of tweezers. The metal may as well be aluminum because they bend without any force. I contacted the manufacturer and they promised to ship new ones due to \\&quot;faulty\\&quot; set. It&#x27;s been well over a month since, haven&#x27;t heard back from them.</li>
            <li> the two different types of tweezers was good angle but they are a little hard too use and handle no grip</li>
            <li> Equal quality to what you can get in the stores, just much cheaper!!!  If I needed to I would order again, but they are made well and I don&#x27;t see them getting ruined.  But they did ship from China, so shipping time was just over a month!!!</li>
            <li> I love how thin these are.  I can&#x27;t use regular hair-tweezing tweezers, as I own only thick stiff ones for my thick brows and cannot risk messing up their precision for nail art.  These are great AND come as a pair.  Worth it!</li>
            <li> these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...I love them.I Will do business again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, Jeannie</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Easy to grip which is essential in using them with the small nail art pieces.</li>
            <li> I like these nail tweezers great for picking up the nail jewels, and very easy to apply on your nail.</li>
            <li> other than being a bit sideways they get the job done. pretty sturdy and good metal for the price! yay?</li>
            <li> Cheap.. terrible quality, do not buy!</li>
            <li> I have used both of these tweezers for various things while doing nails. The price is great and product is very durable.  Great for any salon or home.</li>
            <li> Very cheap tweezers. They get the job done as far as with pulling off nail tape or holding sponges/cotton for nail designs. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you&#x27;re trying to grip a cotton ball or something big these may work for you.  They will not work for anything tiny like an eyebrow hair or a sliver.</li>
            <li> These nail tweezers make everything a lot easier to handle nail gems and other nail art products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look exactly like I thought they would.  They were a great deal for the money and good quality.</li>
            <li> awesome product&lt;br /&gt;bigger than expected but they still worked&lt;br /&gt;bright colors&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seem like much but worth the money being paid</li>
            <li> these are perfect for using to apply and handle nail art tape and other various tasks - wouldn&#x27;t for the trying to pick up anything that is too heavy - good for dainty items though!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are pointed and sharp!  Not something to be used by children.  They are a little shorter than I would like but definitely useable and will be good for detailed projects.  I didn&#x27;t buy them for nails but I believe they would be good for that use.  I would  probably buy them again and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Good value for the cost. Appear to be of good enough quality that they will be usable for awhile. I have had them 2 months.</li>
            <li> exactly as described, came before the shipping date! will be perfect for the nail decals my daughter likes to use doing her nail art!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to handle those small gems.  Works and described as posted.  Good value for the product.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are nice enough, but they&#x27;re so cheaply made that it&#x27;s impossible to do any very high detailed work with them.</li>
            <li> They are pretty thin, but for me they are very easy to work with. They are very usable and nice!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using the eyebrow tweezers you have than these cheap metal things.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time</li>
            <li> These tweezers are longer than normal ones I bought in the store.  I like them for the decals for my nails.  They are nice.  The curved ones are my favorite.  It is nice to get both pairs though.</li>
            <li> Was delivered earlier than expected. However you definitely get what you pay for. Super flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  Extremely poorly made.  I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I received this right away and in tact! Have not used yet but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought these for doing my nails and also for scrapbooking.  They do the job and they were so inexpensive that I ordered more than one set.</li>
            <li> Tips close nicely. They do have a gripped tip which helps picking up small rhinestones. They work well. They take a while to ship but they did come from over seas</li>
            <li> I am into designing my nails and I was looking for something to help me apply the gems in my nails, this tweezers are very helpful and they are made with a very resistant material then I am happy because they will last very long</li>
            <li> Came in the mail early and was exactly like the picture!! Amazing price. Can&#x27;t wait to use these!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers! Just what I was looking for. I cut hair so when the hair gets lodged into my skin I&#x27;m able to pull it out easily.</li>
            <li> The handy tweezers took about a month to receive from China (to Alaska, an unpopular place to ship!).  Nice, thick metal and tension is just right for applying little jewels, etc.  Great price and if I ever lose these I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use great 4 them hard 2 pick up items when doing nail art. I use these 4 every design.</li>
            <li> Handy tools for what you need to have for small objects or small tight spots. Good thing i bought more..</li>
            <li> CONVENIENT. Happy with this purchase got it in perfect timing, they do the job and were a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a must have, very nicely made, easy to use on nails, very good for the price. It makes aplications easy</li>
            <li> I use them all the time they are great for picking up small jewels for your nails.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> great price. these are perfect for picking up extra small items. better deal then at local stores or even walmart!</li>
            <li> great products.  very heavy duty.  the perfect tweezers for using to put nail decals or even cell phone decorations on.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be 2 pairs of tweezers, There was only one pair included in my order.  I left feedback, but did not receive the 2nd set</li>
            <li> These were cheap and they work for what I need them for, I don&#x27;t see how you could complain about them.</li>
            <li> these tweezers are really good at the time you want to press any decoration against your nails.  If you want to pick up any design or also the glitter that you can easly take one by one just touching it with the tweezers.  Really Good tool, it look that it will last for generations. :-D.</li>
            <li> good for crafts. just what I expected! Great for putting rhinestones gems and ribbon on nails. Useful tool to add to my nail art collection!</li>
            <li> Well i guess these are going to be helpful  i have not gotten the chance to use them yet but working on it</li>
            <li> This item arrived intact and was shipped promptly. It is as described and it is good quality. I have used it already and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> they are sharp,,, not 4  lil children. great for picking up stones and what ever. very nice tips.so far so</li>
            <li> Came when expected, good quality but the straighter pair doesn&#x27;t come together completely. Curved pair great for placing small glitters and studs. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased here, is exactly what they offered me. Are happy with this.</li>
            <li> tips did not match up completely, guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These tweezers were very flimsy.  They are still usuable but I expected a better product.  I only use for nail art.</li>
            <li> received with package broken and nothing inside the package, and i believe its the tweezer because i received everything else i purchased but not this one.</li>
            <li> an thank you for the items they are good for like  pull like that nail to use the tips and pick as well as the gem stones</li>
            <li> These will be perfect to use while working with rhinestones and also while working with cut out vinyl. Great price!</li>
            <li> The curved ones are a joke but the pointed ones seemed okay. Not really a serious pair of tweezers but okay for craft uses.</li>
            <li> They work great for big decorations that can&#x27;t be picked up with a little topcoat on a dotting tool. They also work pretty good for applying full cover false nails. The metal is pretty cheap though and my tips on the angled ones have bent a little from use. I don&#x27;t even use the pointed ones. The company I ordered (Hongnuo nail supplies factory ) from was really fast though. One of mine also had a deep scratch on one side from the machinery but it doesn&#x27;t affect the utility of the product. They work if you need them, that&#x27;s the best I can say.</li>
            <li> LOOKING AT THE PRICE, I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE LESS THAN WHAT THEY WERE. I REALLY LIKE THIS ITEM.&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE SO USEFUL AND A MUST HAVE</li>
            <li> Not the absolute highest quality but way better than I expected for this price.  They came packaged well and not tweaked or bent.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Why did i order these things because they do not accomplish what I need them too! Should have have left this buy alone!</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> I only received one pair of tweezers and they were all bent up; not to mention it took a month to arrive. Don&#x27;t waste your money; I use a teensy dab of clear nail polish on a toothpick to pick up rhinestones when I do my own nails now and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> they are kinda cheap dont recomend</li>
            <li> I was unsure when I purchased these tweezers but they have a great grip. I would recommend them if you like to do you nails or just need a good pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love these so much it is so much easier than having to pick up gems or rhinestones with your hands cheap price and came weeks and weeks before it said they would come I absolutely recommend buying these</li>
            <li> These are great for nail art, they pick up the rhinestones and glitters very well. It does take time to get a technique down, but once you do these are a great time saver.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help my in applying my nail studs &amp; works just great. Arrived quickly &amp; just as described.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nail art projects. Tips come together nicely but cannot put alot of pressure on them.  Probably will not try to do my eyebrows with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have TOO much to say about these, they get the job done. I use them to pick up the rhinestones for my nails. They arrived fairly quickly, within a week or two ! I would recommend</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, and sometimes I like to get fancy...&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for gems, rhinestones and the color strips. Great quality</li>
            <li> These work great.&lt;br /&gt;They are super thin so they feel flimsy, but they have not bent.&lt;br /&gt;They get in tight spots with no problem.</li>
            <li> It take take to get the hand on these but you get the hang of it. It picks up all the nail art small objects for your nails. Every girl should have one in their nail art.</li>
            <li> well the stones are so small they can&#x27;t pick them up.bu I will find another use for them.thanks I need to make another order</li>
            <li> They are absolutely perfect for applying stones to your nails. The only problem I had with them is that they tend to bend very easily.</li>
            <li> great to put on my pearls and rhinestones that I ordered I have took a splinter out of my sons hand with this handy tool also!</li>
            <li> Nice tweezers perfect for applying gem stones did not realize there would be 2 pairs I like the curved tweezers better.</li>
            <li> I bout these along with many new details for nails, I got the gems and fimo clay fruit slices; these make it so much easier to apply on your nails!</li>
            <li> These are ok, but not great quality. The ends don&#x27;t meet up, and they are pretty flimsy. They work, but I wish they were a little more sturdy. But for the price, I guess you can&#x27;t expect the moon. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Nothing more or less of what you see in the picture. You get what your order. Definitely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use to place jewels onto wet nail polish. It makes it super easy! Very good price for two.</li>
            <li> This product works great with the nail art tape.. It comes wrapped up but when you take It out of the package it looks scratches up a little.. I&#x27;ve only used the curved tweezer so far and it does it&#x27;s job..</li>
            <li> Product as described,  I  will order again. I&#x27;m very pleaded with product. Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my projects.</li>
            <li> well to my surprise once they were delivered I received two of each they&#x27;re very well made and came way before the delivery date so now I have a set I can give away or keep for further use I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could use them to adhere my new sparkles to my nails. Such a great price! Can&#x27;t wait for girlie fun!</li>
            <li> great for picking up small items and for crafting you get two tweezers and it is a very good value</li>
            <li> got 2 pair 1 straight and 1 curved. was a pleasant surprise. fast shipment and very cheap. great for adding stones to your finger nail art</li>
            <li> 2 pairs small to catch those sparkle gems! Haven&#x27;t used them yet but look like they will do the job.</li>
            <li> These tweezers worked perfectly for what I needed them for.  They are durable and versatile.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> 2 piecce set great price and multy use quality is good enough for me!!! easier then trying to lick your finger to pick up decrations</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift with rhinestones for a girl to do her nails.</li>
            <li> The straight pointed tweezers weren&#x27;t align but still manageable, however, the curve ones was thrown to the trash, it was so misplaced and uneven i couldn&#x27;t even try to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I contacted the service and they return my money and sent me another pair as a gifts that works absolutely perfect!!!! Great service and product. I know where to buy more product from next time i shop online!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great for use when decorating your nail.  They are inexpensive so having several on hand will allow you to do anything with them.</li>
            <li> Another must have for nail art. You always need tweezers to pick things up when you nails aren&#x27;t dry and they are great for the larger rhinestones that you always have to turn over. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are good, definitely better than I expected for the price.  It took me a while to get them because they were mailed from Hong Kong, but so far so good. I do nail art so I use them for that to pick up rhinestones.  I&#x27;ve only used one of them so far, but I expect the other one to work just as well.  If you&#x27;re doubting whether to get this or not, don&#x27;t. They work well so just get them.</li>
            <li> I purchased some nail gems and they recommended I also buy these, I&#x27;m glad I did, they make it so easy to put the gems on my nails. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> Product was just as stated in the ad. I would purchase again if needed. The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li> I do a lot of decorating of my own nails and this is great and makes it so much easier for a number of tasks</li>
            <li> these are wonderful, I would order again if needed.  I used them today when doing my nails, perfect, I was able to pick the jewels and place them where they belong, with no problems.</li>
            <li> Well you can not beat the price and the product is just fine for nails, crafts. I would recommend this item to anyone who does fine work.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very useful in crafts that I do; sometimes nothing else will work nearly as well--or at all!</li>
            <li> Great vendor highly recommend</li>
            <li> these do the job by picking up small jewls and other nail 3d art. dont try tweezing your brows because they may not work for that.</li>
            <li> The straight point tip tweezers work wonderfully. the one with the curved tip got like a bit stretched out and doesn&#x27;t line up correctly anymore and doesnt tweeze because of that</li>
            <li> I got these products to use for placing embellishments on the nails. They do the job without being anything extra or less. My only gripe is that they are practically almost useless when it comes to peeling things off like when I use the striping tape.  The tweezers slide right off so I have to keep trying otherwise I just end up using my fingers to peel things off.</li>
            <li> Perfect and work great.</li>
            <li> Just took awhile to send out but I loved them and I am a manicurist and they have came in handy</li>
            <li> Use these for applying most of my nail art , I like them</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the price, the quality of the product is not at it&#x27;s greatest, but It has already served the purpose.</li>
            <li> Handy little tweezers.  They arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is as I expected. Really good!!</li>
            <li> But this for my wife and she really like it</li>
            <li> I just started doing nail art with my daughters and it&#x27;s perfect for putting the little gems on your feet.  The only complaint is that it took forever to arrive, but we were not in a hurry, so I&#x27;m giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Package nicely. Got two of them really cheap. The are a nice size one straight tipped one bent at en like a cat claw. They hold nicely in your Hand.</li>
            <li> These are okay for craft products but bend very easy.&lt;br /&gt; One drop and the tips bent, I would not purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that is really into crafts and DIY projects, and she recently mentioned that while picking up the tiniest pieces, she tends to glue her fingers together. So I thought I&#x27;d buy her a pair of these to save her digits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived, I was really surprised at how sturdy they were. They&#x27;re not flimsy at all and they fit perfectly in my hand. They operate like any pair of tweezers, but the angled and sharp end makes them useful for doing all sorts of things, like picking splinters out of fingers, pulling out the change that falls in the cracks of the sofa (because who wants to put their hands in there) and of course, for adding gems and jewels to crafts as well finger and toenails. I&#x27;m planning on buying a pair to keep for myself as well.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for picking up small stones and placing  the rhinestones in the exactly the right place on my nails and any manicure.I choose. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present and my granddaughters will love using them for all their nail products.  Fast service would do business with again</li>
            <li> These work great. I needed something to use for decals and gems on my nails. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good Tweezers, just what i expected at a great price. I use the curved on for picking up small items when crafting.</li>
            <li> They are a waste because they don&#x27;t line up at all so don&#x27;t bother, maybe I got a bad set but both are bad.  I got them for nail art and they don&#x27;t work.... ;(</li>
            <li> Great tools, very useful for many uses in my nail salon awesome for small artwork details easy to hold ,and easy to clean I will buy more to have extra on hand thank you</li>
            <li> A must have for your projects, makes getting those Phinestones in place so much easier! A much needed craft item!!!</li>
            <li> I had a feeling these might not be the best tweezers due to the price, and I was right. Oh, well.</li>
            <li> These are awesome tweezers...and for the price you cannot go wrong...my neices will have an easy time putting the faux crystals on their nails. Don&#x27;t hesitate to order these...shipping was super fast too. thanks!</li>
            <li> A little thin but they get the job done</li>
            <li> I use them for eye lash extension, work great.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tweezers to help me do the rhinestones to put on my nails and they work like a charm.  I am so glad I purchased them and for the money you can not go wrong.  It did take a couple of weeks to get here, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Not only are these great for nail art they are useful in jewelry making. Picking up a bead for your nail or for your necklace works well.</li>
            <li> This set of nail art tweezers are perfect for placing the little gems onto nails. I think they are a must have item for a perfect manicure.</li>
            <li> I love these nail art tweezers , a must have for those who love doing cute things with their nails.</li>
            <li> I saw this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting them to be good quality, but they are! I use them for rhinestones while doing nails and they pick up perfectly. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! I was very impressed with how soon I got them. They help and are very precise for my nail art adventures!!!</li>
            <li> Great tool to pickup rhinestones for nail designs. This is a good purchase and will help with nail designs. Good tool</li>
            <li> They are the best product I have ever gotten my hands on for my purposes. What I especially like them for is the ease&lt;br /&gt; with which they can pick up and apply tiny objects, such as jewels and tiny decals for fingernails. Or to apply little sequins to art projects with thin glue. There are so many uses! I LOVE AMAZON!</li>
            <li> para las actividades de decoración que las he necesitado han respondido a la altura, livianas y con la forma apropiada para las labores.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for picking up fimo slices or rhinestones to put in your nail art designs.  I especially like the curved one.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for and cheap. package arrived on time!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what i needed for the stones to place on the nails. i will recommend it anytime. but you need to add more stuff as a package for customers</li>
    </ol>
