            <li>This product is Amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so surprising since it&#x27;s Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>Compact size makes it good for travel</li>
            <li>It does work decently good as a primer.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help with my brown spots at all after using it for more than 2 months!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I have used this for 2 months putting on twice a day,the results are amazing</li>
            <li>but it goes on real smooth</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t tell you for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>This is a lot better and no pain.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if I order more.</li>
            <li>great item fast service ..very pleased</li>
            <li>but, it didn&#x27;t get any better, face</li>
            <li>I love all Neutrogena products, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t leave that out because the device supposedly helps products like this one absorb better..</li>
            <li>You need to put it on while your skin is still a bit moist after washing your face and it will spread out better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products</li>
            <li>And I will be sure to tell as many people of my experience.</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so perhaps this Spot Corrector doesn&#x27;t work for everyone; but, as for me, I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is my favorite for skin care.</li>
            <li>Hubby and I both tried it when it came more than 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>i think i need more time for it to get the desired result am looking for.</li>
            <li>It Really Does Work!!!!</li>
            <li>Has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>: You may experience mild redness, a warm tingling sensation or flaking (skin exfoliant).</li>
            <li>It is a very nice moisturizer though, and I have had no negative reactions or side effects to the product.</li>
            <li>before couln&#x27;t even cover with foundation but now easily covered with just bb cream.</li>
            <li>the formula is like a serum that absorb very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not super impressed.</li>
            <li>Fine lines &#x27;n wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li>The product did arrive quickly and was just as advertised in that way by the seller!</li>
            <li>well, I super love it</li>
            <li>you can hardly see it any more I am very happy with the results and will keep using this</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Light and immediately absorbs on the skin.  </li>
            <li>A very light moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t do very much.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased thus far!</li>
            <li>After many hot presses and a lot o Lubriderm cream, they are almost gone.</li>
            <li>but this one seems to be the best so far, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>my everyday aging process but using this cream has felt very good and silky on the skin but for rapid result i would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer</li>
            <li>Other than that it smells really great.</li>
            <li>What can I say ,other than its a great product.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product..it does lighten dark spots</li>
            <li>Neutrogena never disappoints , easy to use ,gentle, and fragrance does not offend or interfere with you perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>Sometimes not sure how much good it does but haven&#x27;t found anything better</li>
            <li>Spend your money on more organic, natural fading creams.</li>
            <li>So the $20 or so bucks you pay for is worth it</li>
            <li>This on is nice enough as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>, I applied this directly to my face despite the warm tingling sensation and kept doing so, as the product clearly states:&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first tube I thought maybe, after the second the targeted brown spots had greatly diminished and I&#x27;m on my third tube.</li>
            <li>Did nothing, no fading no change in skin color, Just very very upset with the way this product is made to work on TV ads.  </li>
            <li>I put this on first under the moisturizer</li>
            <li>I did notice improvement after my first week.</li>
            <li>The product delivers exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>But you need to use it consistently .</li>
            <li>So... It is a product you need to use consistently .</li>
            <li>I would caution you though to use it as directed at first, because it did irritate my skin and make it sort of day and sore when I tried to us it twice a day.</li>
            <li>When I put it on the scars on my back I can use it more often, and it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you first hand that this does nothing to help aid in your ailment</li>
            <li>Its okay so far..it only been two weeks</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, after I buy so many products to make a dark spot clear in my face, this product finally work very quick and</li>
            <li>it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t really do anything for dark spots.</li>
            <li>this strong perfume smell similar to Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>A great product that really works on dark facial spots.</li>
            <li>Also, having some slight adult acne I never had before, I am delighted that this isn&#x27;t clogging any of my pores.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help and what really bothered me was</li>
            <li>I really had hope for it.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>it is much lighter but still there and noticeable.</li>
            <li>It really does go well under moisturizers and makeup.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a week, but I can&#x27;t stand the intense fragrance</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s like wearing too much perfume.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen much change</li>
            <li>and it was very encouraging</li>
            <li>I really like Neutrogina&#x27;s retinol cream, night moisturizer, which really works unlike this one.</li>
            <li>I was bummed because i would really like to get these spots off my face.</li>
            <li>and you know it really works  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what I really wanted from the product.</li>
            <li>and I noticed no visible improvement in my dark spots from acne and to top it all off</li>
            <li>This product helps breakouts go away fast and has even prevented new breakouts from occurring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for only about two weeks, and I see a marked improvement in my skin already - a HUGE improvement, as a matte of fact.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The company needs to make a fragrance free or minimal fragrance version.</li>
            <li>It is much smoother and clear.</li>
            <li>These are normal, temporary indications that the formula is working.</li>
            <li>It does sink right in to your skin and becomes totally invisible.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m slowly beginning to see not just a fading of (some really old) pink acne scars and striations across my cheeks, but better more uniform skin tone across my face.</li>
            <li>This works far better, and is like 70 dollars less!</li>
            <li>My dark spot after first week lookex lighter and like it wAs breaking up right before my eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Middle Eastern and our complexion easily scars in a very noticeable way, I&#x27;ve tried other things from Pro-Activ for scarring but nothing has worked anything like this has.</li>
            <li>Using Neutrogena Rapid Repair didn&#x27;t remove but did somewhat fade facial brown spots better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>i put it on the spots first then spread over entire face.  </li>
            <li>a load of rubbish, three days later I made an appointment to see my dermatologist who told me I have a first degree chemical burn on my face and to stop using this product immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First face moisturizer I have found that is totally non greasy.</li>
            <li>The only positive results have been softer skin.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with  tone repair because I had a huge brown age spot on my cheek which I hated.</li>
            <li>I am an 18 year old African American female with a light complexion and I feel like I have no results I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin not to try this product.</li>
            <li>I do not even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t completely remove them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would be surprised to see any difference in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using the Rapid Tone Repair I have seen a considerable reduction in size and deepness of color in those spots.</li>
            <li>nothing really do not waste u r time</li>
            <li>but it does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>unfortunately this cream has not lived up to my expectation or what Neutrogena claimed for good results in a week.</li>
            <li>It really works to fade the dark facial patches, but you must be willing to give it time to work.</li>
            <li>There was no dark spot correcting.  </li>
            <li>skin tone was little lighter but dark spots are more vivid.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would remove a few very light dark spots, but after a month I see no difference at all.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I would like a bigger tube since I will definitely need more than a pearl-sized squirt per day.</li>
            <li>I have seen a major difference in my overall tone and texture.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair to at least minimize the appearance of dark spots but this product did so much more.  </li>
            <li>Let me first say, I am an African American with a deep skin tone with scars that hyper pigments very dark...</li>

            <li> it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t really do anything for dark spots.</li>
            <li> this strong perfume smell similar to Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> A great product that really works on dark facial spots.</li>
            <li> Also, having some slight adult acne I never had before, I am delighted that this isn&#x27;t clogging any of my pores.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help and what really bothered me was</li>
            <li> I really had hope for it.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> it is much lighter but still there and noticeable.</li>
            <li> It really does go well under moisturizers and makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a week, but I can&#x27;t stand the intense fragrance</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s like wearing too much perfume.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much change</li>
            <li> and it was very encouraging</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogina&#x27;s retinol cream, night moisturizer, which really works unlike this one.</li>
            <li> I was bummed because i would really like to get these spots off my face.</li>
            <li> and you know it really works  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what I really wanted from the product.</li>
            <li> and I noticed no visible improvement in my dark spots from acne and to top it all off</li>
            <li> This product helps breakouts go away fast and has even prevented new breakouts from occurring.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only about two weeks, and I see a marked improvement in my skin already - a HUGE improvement, as a matte of fact.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The company needs to make a fragrance free or minimal fragrance version.</li>
            <li> It is much smoother and clear.</li>
            <li> These are normal, temporary indications that the formula is working.</li>
            <li> It does sink right in to your skin and becomes totally invisible.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m slowly beginning to see not just a fading of (some really old) pink acne scars and striations across my cheeks, but better more uniform skin tone across my face.</li>
            <li> This works far better, and is like 70 dollars less!</li>
            <li> My dark spot after first week lookex lighter and like it wAs breaking up right before my eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Middle Eastern and our complexion easily scars in a very noticeable way, I&#x27;ve tried other things from Pro-Activ for scarring but nothing has worked anything like this has.</li>
            <li> Using Neutrogena Rapid Repair didn&#x27;t remove but did somewhat fade facial brown spots better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> i put it on the spots first then spread over entire face.  </li>
            <li> a load of rubbish, three days later I made an appointment to see my dermatologist who told me I have a first degree chemical burn on my face and to stop using this product immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First face moisturizer I have found that is totally non greasy.</li>
            <li> The only positive results have been softer skin.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with  tone repair because I had a huge brown age spot on my cheek which I hated.</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old African American female with a light complexion and I feel like I have no results I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin not to try this product.</li>
            <li> I do not even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t completely remove them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would be surprised to see any difference in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using the Rapid Tone Repair I have seen a considerable reduction in size and deepness of color in those spots.</li>
            <li> nothing really do not waste u r time</li>
            <li> but it does leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this cream has not lived up to my expectation or what Neutrogena claimed for good results in a week.</li>
            <li> It really works to fade the dark facial patches, but you must be willing to give it time to work.</li>
            <li> There was no dark spot correcting.  </li>
            <li> skin tone was little lighter but dark spots are more vivid.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would remove a few very light dark spots, but after a month I see no difference at all.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I would like a bigger tube since I will definitely need more than a pearl-sized squirt per day.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major difference in my overall tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair to at least minimize the appearance of dark spots but this product did so much more.  </li>
            <li> Let me first say, I am an African American with a deep skin tone with scars that hyper pigments very dark...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements on the dark spots, it just leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> My son had gotten a skin infection and had been left a mark and did not clear that up either.</li>
            <li> Three stars so far because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The way I use it to minimize waste is apply it directly over the problem area and then rub outwards over the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I had some minor results in the beginning</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and firm.</li>
            <li> If effects persist or cause discomfort, limit use to once every other night until your skin adjusts, then revert to daily use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Also, it tends to dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> When I wear it at night, I wake up with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night after my face wash routine for an entire month and have not seen an ounce of difference in the dark spots on my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> It definitely did lighten up the dark spots I have on my face.</li>
            <li> I have seen definite FADING of dark spots and am hopeful with continued use my spots will get even lighter.</li>
            <li> Dark spots still there after entire tube.</li>
            <li> it is more expensive and it is usually sold out.</li>
            <li> is completely reckless of Neutrogena to not have any recommendations on their packing for consumers to trial test this product before using it on the delicate face</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> I expected Neutrogena to be odorless.</li>
            <li> The box was crushed when it arrive too but the product was intact.</li>
            <li> it leaves absolutely NO residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> but i expected some sort of change, but</li>
            <li> waste you time, if you are white than take your chances.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Regrettably this product made absolutely no difference to my face.  </li>
            <li> started using it and saw not one difference in the dark spots on my face; that&#x27;s the thing with all these stupid&lt;br /&gt;beauty creams they&#x27;re made for white people in mind and does nothing for black people, see a difference in one&lt;br</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way ..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause pimples as other product.</li>
            <li> My skin is sun damaged with large dark spots randomly across my face.</li>
            <li> However it did not lighten the dark spot.</li>
            <li> There is not any difference at all in the coloration of the dark spot.</li>
            <li> No change in dark spots, doesn&#x27;t lightening or diminish the spots on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month and have not seen any appreciable lightening of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s this dark spot corrector that did the trick, or the Tone Repair moisturizer, but I used all 3 and that&#x27;s what worked for</li>
            <li> I have frackles and dark age spots on my cheek area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week, and it seems to have helped the appearance of my patchy dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> But no success.</li>
            <li> It noticeably lightens acne-caused dark sports</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it because my face got really dark.</li>
            <li> I have a small dark spot and did not clear it.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Dark Spot Corrector Serum burned my skin immediately after application.</li>
            <li> that to say.. give this a try...  if you are looking for something to help with the dark spots and skin tone..</li>
            <li> I should have used common sense before using this product and performed a patch test on the back of my hand before using it.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> and I can tell no difference in my dark sun spots.</li>
            <li> I am used to buying Clinique&#x27;s dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> but I know it is going too take time for my dark spot.</li>
            <li> I have been using this dark spot corrector serum for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I like this tone repair since it does even out skin tone and helps fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> I do notice a smoother finer appearance to my skin, but don&#x27;t see a difference in the dark spots yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found myself using less and less liquid foundation the last few days, because there&#x27;s just less and less splotchiness to cover today than there was a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> After one week I do see little peeling on dark spot area snd after 2 weeks, it start getting lighter on dark spot area.</li>
            <li> 2 days later, angry red clusters of acne and itchy skin on my cheeks, chin, and forehead.</li>
            <li> Previously I used the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Night and found it a bit oily so that is why I changed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black person</li>
            <li> I did not see any noticeable difference in any dark spots or uneven complexion.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced such luck with any other product.  </li>
            <li> but I can see a little difference after a week, without any discoloration of the skin elsewhere (or the peeling that for some might be a slight side-effect).  </li>
            <li> I have a little bit of acne scarring around my face</li>
            <li> The name dark spot corrector implies the spot will go away, i.e. be corrected!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped but it did show a little improvement on my skin...</li>
            <li> maybe it could take a little longer  than what it says or depends on the SCAR TISSUE.</li>
            <li> had it professionally removed about 5 years ago which was painful to do but was told it will come back</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping I could replace my expensive Obagi Clear which runs at around $80 a bottle</li>
            <li> My skin dried out and flaked and peeled for a week.  </li>
            <li> This was seriously a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> Bought it, tried it for 3 weeks, waste of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> this serum is vey slow in working.my sun spot has started to get lighter but nothing major.it does not work in ten days.at least not  for me,been using it for  a month.will continue to use it till is gone and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I strongly DO not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a small dark spot on my cheek and never believed a small amount of a product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it everyday for the past four weeks and there no sign of improvement.</li>
            <li> The dark spots have diminished a lot in just 3 days!!</li>
            <li> this product would fade them at least a LITTLE bit.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer (both day and night variety) over the past month or so</li>
            <li> but I did not see any dramatic reduction in dark spots.  </li>
            <li> but I have found I need to use at least two pearl size drops to cover my face and neck and that is a stretch.  </li>
            <li> I can see it will take time for it to slowly work</li>
            <li> When I read this product reviews, I was little skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> it did not give me any diffrent not happy at all &amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I use this product approximately 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> Dark pigmentation is very difficult to get rid of!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I seem to be allergic to this.  </li>
            <li> It is useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Another disappointing skin care product.</li>
            <li> Waste of $!!!!!</li>
            <li> I hope anyone who suffers from breakouts gives this product a try!  </li>
            <li> Using for 4 weeks now and no results for me :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think the amount of retinoids in this product will cause a horrible allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> , I broke out terribly on my forehead so now I have to perform damage</li>
            <li> Terrible, does not work.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great product that really works on dark facial spots.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night after my face wash routine for an entire month and have not seen an ounce of difference in the dark spots on my cheek bones. If anything, its made me break out.</li>
            <li> Very good price and delivery on time , Neutrogena always been standard for quality of their product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product..it does lighten dark spots</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old African American female with a light complexion and I feel like I have no results I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks and I discontinued the use because it got tiring.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it did make my face look healthier. However it did not lighten the dark spot.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> I have been using this on one spot for 4 weeks. There is not any difference at all in the coloration of the dark spot. Thought about asking for a refund...feel like I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> This product may not be rapid but it works with time and patience.  After the first tube I thought maybe, after the second the targeted brown spots had greatly diminished and I&#x27;m on my third tube.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I seem to be allergic to this.  It&#x27;s so surprising since it&#x27;s Neutrogena.  Don&#x27;t let this affect your purchase. It definitely did lighten up the dark spots I have on my face.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and I had an allergic reaction to this product. My skin dried out and flaked and peeled for a week.  I would recommend it you have sensitive skin not to try this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been applying it everyday for the past four weeks and there no sign of improvement. The affected area didn&#x27;t change one shade. It is useless. Also, it tends to dry out the skin. When I wear it at night, I wake up with dry, flaky skin. Other than that it smells really great. This was seriously a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference yet, we will see over the next month</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I am 29 and have suffered from acne since I was a teen.  I have gone to dermatologists for years and nothing has worked.  Name the acne medication and I have probably tried it.  I decided to try Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair to at least minimize the appearance of dark spots but this product did so much more.  This product helps breakouts go away fast and has even prevented new breakouts from occurring.  I have not experienced such luck with any other product.  I use this every morning after washing my face.  My breakouts have almost stopped altogether and when I do have one, it is never severe like before.  I hope anyone who suffers from breakouts gives this product a try!  I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> A very light moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t do very much.  There is no repair that I&#x27;ve seen tone-wise. Compact size makes it good for travel but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. No change in dark spots, doesn&#x27;t lightening or diminish the spots on my cheeks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any contact reaction on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month and have not seen any appreciable lightening of my dark spots. It is a very nice moisturizer though, and I have had no negative reactions or side effects to the product. I will not repurchase...</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer (both day and night variety) over the past month or so and I&#x27;m slowly beginning to see not just a fading of (some really old) pink acne scars and striations across my cheeks, but better more uniform skin tone across my face. It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Middle Eastern and our complexion easily scars in a very noticeable way, I&#x27;ve tried other things from Pro-Activ for scarring but nothing has worked anything like this has. It&#x27;s really impressive. Now I can&#x27;t tell you for sure if it&#x27;s this dark spot corrector that did the trick, or the Tone Repair moisturizer, but I used all 3 and that&#x27;s what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it to minimize waste is apply it directly over the problem area and then rub outwards over the rest of my face. I put this on first under the moisturizer and I do it twice a day. I use the day formula in the morning and the night formula before bed. Always after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out. It does work decently good as a primer. I did not see any noticeable difference in any dark spots or uneven complexion.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. I have a little bit of acne scarring around my face and I thought buying this product would fade them at least a LITTLE bit. 2 days later, angry red clusters of acne and itchy skin on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. After many hot presses and a lot o Lubriderm cream, they are almost gone. I do not even have sensitive skin. I think the amount of retinoids in this product will cause a horrible allergic reaction. I strongly DO not recommend this product. Spend your money on more organic, natural fading creams.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY  I used this product faithfully twice a day morning and night till the tube was gone.  Did nothing, no fading no change in skin color, Just very very upset with the way this product is made to work on TV ads.  Save your money...</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother and this is one great product . She loves it .</li>
            <li> I am so happy with  tone repair because I had a huge brown age spot on my cheek which I hated.I have used this for 2 months putting on twice a day,the results are amazing you can hardly see it any more I am very happy with the results and will keep using this I&#x27;m sure in time will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;I had it professionally removed about 5 years ago which was painful to do but was told it will come back and they were right. This is a lot better and no pain. Give it a try</li>
            <li> Bought it, tried it for 3 weeks, waste of time.  Noticed no change whatsoever.  Total waste of time and money.  Would not recommend for specified use or for any use for that matter.  Should be taken off the market so as not to fool the unsuspecting public.</li>
            <li> I like how it hydrates around my eyes. Does not help puffy eyes though. It dries well and it is not oily. I may buy it again.</li>
            <li> Using Neutrogena Rapid Repair didn&#x27;t remove but did somewhat fade facial brown spots better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a almost 2 weeks and I&#x27;m still waiting to see the results I&#x27;m hoping for. We&#x27;ll see if I order more.</li>
            <li> great item fast service ..very pleased</li>
            <li> this serum is vey slow in working.my sun spot has started to get lighter but nothing major.it does not work in ten days.at least not  for me,been using it for  a month.will continue to use it till is gone and see what happens.</li>
            <li> What can I say ,other than its a great product.  Thank you. Neutrogena never disappoints , easy to use ,gentle, and fragrance does not offend or interfere with you perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. Have been using for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen any results. The only positive results have been softer skin.</li>
            <li> Another disappointing skin care product. Didn&#x27;t help and what really bothered me was this strong perfume smell similar to Oil of Olay. I expected Neutrogena to be odorless. The box was crushed when it arrive too but the product was intact.</li>
            <li> I have frackles and dark age spots on my cheek area. I had dermabration treatment ,  laser treatment  and chemical peeling also but, it didn&#x27;t get any better, face skin tone was little lighter but dark spots are more vivid. When I read this product reviews, I was little skeptical about this product but I have decided to try. It has been 2 weeks since I  had applied to all over my face at night. After one week I do see little peeling on dark spot area snd after 2 weeks, it start getting lighter on dark spot area. before couln&#x27;t even cover with foundation but now easily covered with just bb cream. happy with this product. I will give follow up updates after one week or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week, and it seems to have helped the appearance of my patchy dark spots on my face.  They are still there, but don&#x27;t seem to be as visible.  I&#x27;ll continue to use.  Product doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Using for 4 weeks now and no results for me :( I really had hope for it. But no success.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It noticeably lightens acne-caused dark sports but it doesn&#x27;t completely remove them.</li>
            <li> I love all Neutrogena products, and this one is no exception.  After just a week of use, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m currently use this product for two weeks, i feel there is some improvement. It doesn&#x27;t cause pimples as other product.</li>
            <li> Thank you I am very happy</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots</li>
            <li> The name dark spot corrector implies the spot will go away, i.e. be corrected! That has not happened it is much lighter but still there and noticeable. The product did arrive quickly and was just as advertised in that way by the seller!</li>
            <li> I did notice improvement after my first week.</li>
            <li> Seems to work on my concerned areas.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Use it every day.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with my brown spots at all after using it for more than 2 months!</li>
            <li> It burned up my face. I had to stop using it because my face got really dark. I don&#x27;t recommend it to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This works well.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything for  me or my son.  I have a small dark spot and did not clear it.  My son had gotten a skin infection and had been left a mark and did not clear that up either.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Dark Spot Corrector Serum burned my skin immediately after application. Will not continue its&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Let me first say, I am an African American with a deep skin tone with scars that hyper pigments very dark... okay that out of the way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been a week and I already see the results! I am very pleased thus far! the formula is like a serum that absorb very quickly. It really does go well under moisturizers and makeup. Also noticing over all evening of my skin tone (aka) i put it on the spots first then spread over entire face.  I apply morning and night... and using in conjunction with the Tone Repair Moisturizer (Night).  I also use a Clarisonic cleansing device with the deep pore brush... i can&#x27;t leave that out because the device supposedly helps products like this one absorb better.. so I may be increasing the efficacy of the product.... I will try to remember to update this review ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that to say.. give this a try...  if you are looking for something to help with the dark spots and skin tone..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and a little goes a long way .. So the $20 or so bucks you pay for is worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped and Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about four months now.  Previously I used the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Night and found it a bit oily so that is why I changed.  Amazon product title states &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; but note that the words &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; are not mentioned on the packaging.  This is a treatment product and there is no moisturizing with it.  It does sink right in to your skin and becomes totally invisible. I like that it leaves absolutely NO residue on my skin. The directions say to use a pearl size amount but I have found I need to use at least two pearl size drops to cover my face and neck and that is a stretch.  You need to put it on while your skin is still a bit moist after washing your face and it will spread out better.  Dark pigmentation is very difficult to get rid of!  I&#x27;ve tried many products but this one seems to be the best so far, especially for the price.  The ingredients are proven and it is packaged to keep the ingredients stable.  I have seen definite FADING of dark spots and am hopeful with continued use my spots will get even lighter.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a -10 I would. I should have used common sense before using this product and performed a patch test on the back of my hand before using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I applied this directly to my face despite the warm tingling sensation and kept doing so, as the product clearly states:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Important: You may experience mild redness, a warm tingling sensation or flaking (skin exfoliant). These are normal, temporary indications that the formula is working. If effects persist or cause discomfort, limit use to once every other night until your skin adjusts, then revert to daily use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;What a load of rubbish, three days later I made an appointment to see my dermatologist who told me I have a first degree chemical burn on my face and to stop using this product immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I am now in pain and discomfort and having to deal with the sheer embarrassment of this visible facial burn.&lt;br /&gt;It is completely reckless of Neutrogena to not have any recommendations on their packing for consumers to trial test this product before using it on the delicate face area.&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I be using Neutrogena. And I will be sure to tell as many people of my experience.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a week, but I can&#x27;t stand the intense fragrance -- it&#x27;s like wearing too much perfume. The company needs to make a fragrance free or minimal fragrance version. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much change but it goes on real smooth</li>
            <li> Waste of $!!!!! I had some minor results in the beginning and it was very encouraging but after repeated use was just a placebo&#x27;!! Save your $!!!</li>
            <li> The product delivers exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I used it for one week and I noticed no visible improvement in my dark spots from acne and to top it all off, I broke out terribly on my forehead so now I have to perform damage control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend nor use again.</li>
            <li> I like the item and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Great Moisturizer!!! Works Great!!! Helps get rid of fine lines!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied this order</li>
            <li> great repair cream , my wife loves it</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  I will continue using this product.  It really works to fade the dark facial patches, but you must be willing to give it time to work.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only about two weeks, and I see a marked improvement in my skin already - a HUGE improvement, as a matte of fact.  I&#x27;ve even found myself using less and less liquid foundation the last few days, because there&#x27;s just less and less splotchiness to cover today than there was a few weeks ago.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so perhaps this Spot Corrector doesn&#x27;t work for everyone; but, as for me, I&#x27;m very happy.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> unfortunately this cream has not lived up to my expectation or what Neutrogena claimed for good results in a week. I am not weathered from sun .just my everyday aging process but using this cream has felt very good and silky on the skin but for rapid result i would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped but it did show a little improvement on my skin...</li>
            <li> I did purchas this item because I tried everything out there&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you It Really Does Work!!!! My dark spot after first week lookex lighter and like it wAs breaking up right before my eyes&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this item N the price was good for it too</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogina&#x27;s retinol cream, night moisturizer, which really works unlike this one. it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t really do anything for dark spots. doesn&#x27;t provide any lifting effect either.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say is that it is not making my face break out.  I have used this product for about 5-8 weeks and I can tell no difference in my dark sun spots.</li>
            <li> Love it. It does work. But you need to use it consistently . I notice results in two week. Stopped after a month and the unevenness came back. So... It is a product you need to use consistently .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements on the dark spots, it just leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the drug store, but had to come write a review. I don&#x27;t understand those who said it did nothing. I noticed the difference within days. I am used to buying Clinique&#x27;s dark spot corrector. This works far better, and is like 70 dollars less! I wont be buying Clinique anymore. I would caution you though to use it as directed at first, because it did irritate my skin and make it sort of day and sore when I tried to us it twice a day. I think it also depends on what part of the skin youre using it on. When I put it on the scars on my back I can use it more often, and it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem. I hope this works as well for you all as it does for me!!!</li>
            <li> Such a terrific product! I had a small dark spot on my cheek and never believed a small amount of a product when used daily would have the spot disappear. It&#x27;s actually gone now. Don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Sometimes not sure how much good it does but haven&#x27;t found anything better</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months and have not seen any difference whatsoever. I have hyper pigmentation on my face from acne. I did not expect this to be a miracle worker but i expected some sort of change, but none. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Only recently start using this but the results have been good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black person and I can tell you first hand that this does nothing to help aid in your ailment&lt;br /&gt;I started using it and saw not one difference in the dark spots on my face; that&#x27;s the thing with all these stupid&lt;br /&gt;beauty creams they&#x27;re made for white people in mind and does nothing for black people, see a difference in one&lt;br /&gt;week? I would be surprised to see any difference in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste you time, if you are white than take your chances.</li>
            <li> I like the way it tone my skin but I know it is going too take time for my dark spot. I will used it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! I saw a difference in one use!!!! I&#x27;m an African American woman and our  pigmentations are a bit tougher to handle some times... But this right here is awesome. Consistency is key!! I have seen a major difference in my overall tone and texture. The dark spots have diminished a lot in just 3 days!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I can see a change in my skin. It is much smoother and clear. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my favorite for skin care. All of their products work for me and do what the company claims for my skin. My skin is sun damaged with large dark spots randomly across my face. Since using the Rapid Tone Repair I have seen a considerable reduction in size and deepness of color in those spots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see even the smallest improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> nothing really do not waste u r time it did not give me any diffrent not happy at all &amp;#62;_</li>
            <li> Not something I would buy again.  Dark spots still there after entire tube.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing! I love it, very smooth and smells great! I have use Neturogena for months now..I have no complaints</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Neutrogena for over 30 years and I am so happy that they now make this product. And it works! I have been using this dark spot corrector serum for about 2 weeks and I can see a difference. I am thrilled. Another excellent Neutrogena product</li>
            <li> I like this tone repair since it does even out skin tone and helps fade dark spots. It&#x27;s not perfect but I think for the price you do get what you pay for. I have been using this product for about 3 years. Also to buy it in a store it is more expensive and it is usually sold out.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. I see and feel improvements in my skin tone within days. Makes my skin feel soft and firm.</li>
            <li> I can see it will take time for it to slowly work but I can see a little difference after a week, without any discoloration of the skin elsewhere (or the peeling that for some might be a slight side-effect).  I have very fair sensitive skin and so I can appreciate the lack of peeling, burning, or discoloration which would show up like a sore thumb.  Also, having some slight adult acne I never had before, I am delighted that this isn&#x27;t clogging any of my pores.  Light and immediately absorbs on the skin.  My only complaint is that I would like a bigger tube since I will definitely need more than a pearl-sized squirt per day.</li>
            <li> I tried it for 3 weeks , nothing happened . I end up going to have iPL laser done. It&#x27;s a waste of time and money. Misleading advertisement.</li>
            <li> Everything works differently on different people.  Regrettably this product made absolutely no difference to my face.  Was hoping it would remove a few very light dark spots, but after a month I see no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed. I&#x27;ve had to only use it at night because it tends to flake. The smell is amazing. I bought it hoping I could replace my expensive Obagi Clear which runs at around $80 a bottle but that&#x27;s not going to happen. I think I&#x27;ll try it on my hands.</li>
            <li> Hubby and I both tried it when it came more than 2 weeks ago.  I detect no visible difference on me and he reports no change on him either.  So, 1 week?  No.  2 weeks?  No.  Maybe in a month??????</li>
            <li> This product broke me out. Had to give it to my cousin. I was bummed because i would really like to get these spots off my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product approximately 3 times a week. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference but it does leave my skin feeling soft. Maybe I should use it every night. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for one week and you know it really works  ,i think some people should give products a chance some times maybe it could take a little longer  than what it says or depends on the SCAR TISSUE. will buy more.</li>
            <li> It works and I will continue using this!  And I would recommend this to a friend. what else can i say</li>
            <li> Terrible, does not work.  Don&#x27;t even bother wasting your money - buy something else.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.  This on is nice enough as a moisturizer but I did not see any dramatic reduction in dark spots.  I finished using it and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Three stars so far because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.  I do notice a smoother finer appearance to my skin, but don&#x27;t see a difference in the dark spots yet......and that&#x27;s what I really wanted from the product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Spots are fading. Fine lines &#x27;n wrinkles are diminishing. To boot, seller went above and beyond to garner my satisfaction. Thanx guys!</li>
            <li> Its okay so far..it only been two weeks but i am seeing improvement</li>
            <li> I like the way this product smells, I like the way it feels on my face, but I have been using it almost two months..every day...but do not see any results. I hope it works for others but my skin is so stubborn nothing seems to help.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, after I buy so many products to make a dark spot clear in my face, this product finally work very quick and well, I super love it</li>
            <li> First face moisturizer I have found that is totally non greasy.</li>
            <li> There was no dark spot correcting.  False advertising.</li>
            <li> i think i need more time for it to get the desired result am looking for.</li>
