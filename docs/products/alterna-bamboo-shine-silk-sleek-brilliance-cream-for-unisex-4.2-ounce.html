            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Everytime I would go to the salon they just wanted to lop more inches of my hair off despite my protests.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is growing better because it doesn&#x27;t break every minute.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>So love this product.  </li>
            <li>I used this product in a sample size and love it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a cream but mOre like a lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this brand</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the salon quality products out there that are safe for Celiacs.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It also really helps with my fly always and breakage, as well.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get any more.</li>
            <li>It was even better.</li>
            <li>I tried this after my hair dresser recommended it, and I love it for my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair always looks healthy since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.</li>
            <li>fascinated me the most was</li>
            <li>I first bought this product a couple of years ago hoping it would be a good replacement for a hydrating cream</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely and fresh!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.</li>
            <li>I also love the earthy smell and way it right away makes your hair feel better as soon as you put it on damp hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I made the mistake of using too much product and my hair looked great but felt greasy and weighted.</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my fine shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>You hair will be soft, smell great and totally full of shine.</li>
            <li>it is worthy!</li>
            <li>They are a little pricey, but they make you hair feel and look wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Seems to keep frizz in check and add an attractive shine to my white hair.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous conditioning as well as styling product.</li>
            <li>I inhale it as I smooth it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I avoid the hair dryer as much as I can during the warm season...</li>
            <li>Not greasy and helps to smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and more</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feeling smooth and silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Soft hold, smells good.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I was in love with it right away....</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I wish other creams smelled this good!</li>
            <li>I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>So, this would not be a good product for a shiny, blow out, and it has no hold whatsever, but its nice to give a little shine for a bit of time.</li>
            <li>Takes as long to look for the right hair product as it does for the right guy....can literally take years!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great for dry or color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>When the sample ran out, I purchased the full size.  </li>
            <li>hair feels good still the next am</li>
            <li>I already have pretty healthy, normal hair, but this product just made it better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair at all and delivers a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super oily, tho, so it may not work for a teenager or anyone else who has oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I just love how soft and light it makes my hair feel,</li>
            <li>This helps control the frizz that I normally have on humid days and makes my hair over all more manageable.</li>
            <li>It did smell nice, but I think there are other products that will give my hair more shine for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a really good hair cream for keeping long hair sleek and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and pretty, but the heaviness felt as if I&#x27;d used a dollop of Vaseline and scrunched it in my medium thick wavy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite hair product by far, and makes my hair feel, smell and look like a million bucks!</li>
            <li>First purchased this product from my hair dresser..loved it!  </li>
            <li>This still is pretty miraculous!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a frizz free shine to their curls or straight styles.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The consistency is not extremely thick, so it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My hair is already pretty shiny, but I still noticed a significant improvement the first time I used this cream.</li>
            <li>This product is great for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have chronically dry and fragile yet wavy hair--not a good combo!</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t add very much shine, like I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>its not sticky at all and gives you the nice soft smooth feel and look on damp of dry hair.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and love it.</li>
            <li>Once I scaled back on the amount of product I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>sure it works differently on all hair types but it defintely doesn&#x27;t work on mine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the Fekkai glossing cream or the Biosilk gloss for shine, both of which work so much better on my hair.</li>
            <li>Found this product and tried it in sample size first.  </li>
            <li>First introduced at my salon.</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for nice hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in your hair but it really works!  </li>
            <li>or it looks really greasy!</li>
            <li>Good shine product that&#x27;s not to heavy.</li>
            <li>It will not weight your hair down but provides a healthy glow to your hair along with a light hold for your style.  </li>
            <li>Only four stars because the scent, although quite pleasant, is a little too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and most products weigh it down or make the hair feel and appear greasy.</li>
            <li>It has worked amazing on my daughters hair which is thick but fine.  </li>
            <li>it is so light that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, doesn&#x27;t harden, makes my hair soooo soft and it smells absolutely nice.  </li>
            <li>So natural, outdoorsy and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Just enough, and it has a nice soft shine, no frizz, and manageability.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner really adds shine and sheen to my hair but no sticky, greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It really helps bring out the highlights.</li>
            <li>not greasy, does not leave hair crunchy, and works for curly or straight or wavy</li>
            <li>I really do recommend Alterna hair Products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so much compliments regarding my hair.</li>
            <li>I have white hair which is somewhat coarse, and it softens and tames it nicely.</li>
            <li>I use a dime sized amount for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and usually use moose for my curls, but I figured I would try this out since I got a sample of it and liked how it smelled and worked at the time.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and this works great without being heavy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options.</li>
            <li>i usually use it on dry but either way its great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I read the other reviews of this product (on a beauty product website) of people that said this left a nice shimmer / shine to your hair</li>
            <li>I normally use either the Fekkai cream or a liquid gloss.  </li>
            <li>It makes damaged hair feel normal.  </li>
            <li>The cream works very well on my biracial hair, making it manageable and very soft without stripping it of its natural curl or volume.</li>
            <li>I figured I would save it for those days that I blow dry my hair straight and maybe it would work better on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>When applied direclty to hair and left, shine is really nice (mind you, not an all day shine, maybe few hours).  </li>
            <li>I used just a tiny bit and my hair felt heavy and greasy when it should have felt fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>And if I style it that day, WOW.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It gives natural body to the hair and shine.  </li>
            <li>It protects your hair from heat leaving it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it makes my hair feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair looks soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>Smells divine and makes my hair shine and soft, which is a plus</li>
            <li>because I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li>Elves my hair silky soft</li>
            <li>hair is soft and shiny after use</li>
            <li>I completely empathize with you on a broader level, I do not make the products.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and one bottle lasts forever since you can use such a tiny amount each time.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>use this after each shampoo and conditioner I use around a dime size mybe a little more to wet hair</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Only takes a spare amount; too much, and your hair will be flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>Although I love other Alterna Bamboo products, this item was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>and my hair is left soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s long and it silky soft.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous other products promising the same results...</li>
            <li>Then I blow dry my hair and the cream leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to let my hair air dry naturally</li>
            <li>My hair is about halfway down my back and stick straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long, dry, dull, frizzy and tangles easily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> And after loving Alterna&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, I thought this would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ick.</li>
            <li> This is a great product when sold in its original state.</li>

            <li> I actually love all of the Alterna products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Love the cap on the tube.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells and works.  </li>
            <li> Used it mostly on the ends, then worked it through the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  </li>

            <li> Love Alterna bamboo hair cream - makes my hair manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> but I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I would go to the salon they just wanted to lop more inches of my hair off despite my protests.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is growing better because it doesn&#x27;t break every minute.</li>
            <li> They love it too.</li>
            <li> So love this product.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in a sample size and love it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a cream but mOre like a lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this brand</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the salon quality products out there that are safe for Celiacs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It also really helps with my fly always and breakage, as well.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get any more.</li>
            <li> It was even better.</li>
            <li> I tried this after my hair dresser recommended it, and I love it for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair always looks healthy since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.</li>
            <li> fascinated me the most was</li>
            <li> I first bought this product a couple of years ago hoping it would be a good replacement for a hydrating cream</li>
            <li> It also smells lovely and fresh!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.</li>
            <li> I also love the earthy smell and way it right away makes your hair feel better as soon as you put it on damp hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I made the mistake of using too much product and my hair looked great but felt greasy and weighted.</li>
            <li> and I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my fine shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> You hair will be soft, smell great and totally full of shine.</li>
            <li> it is worthy!</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey, but they make you hair feel and look wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Seems to keep frizz in check and add an attractive shine to my white hair.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioning as well as styling product.</li>
            <li> I inhale it as I smooth it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I avoid the hair dryer as much as I can during the warm season...</li>
            <li> Not greasy and helps to smooth.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and more</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feeling smooth and silky and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Soft hold, smells good.</li>
            <li> When I got it, I was in love with it right away....</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I wish other creams smelled this good!</li>
            <li> I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> So, this would not be a good product for a shiny, blow out, and it has no hold whatsever, but its nice to give a little shine for a bit of time.</li>
            <li> Takes as long to look for the right hair product as it does for the right guy....can literally take years!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for dry or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and it makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> When the sample ran out, I purchased the full size.  </li>
            <li> hair feels good still the next am</li>
            <li> I already have pretty healthy, normal hair, but this product just made it better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair at all and delivers a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super oily, tho, so it may not work for a teenager or anyone else who has oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I just love how soft and light it makes my hair feel,</li>
            <li> This helps control the frizz that I normally have on humid days and makes my hair over all more manageable.</li>
            <li> It did smell nice, but I think there are other products that will give my hair more shine for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a really good hair cream for keeping long hair sleek and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious and pretty, but the heaviness felt as if I&#x27;d used a dollop of Vaseline and scrunched it in my medium thick wavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite hair product by far, and makes my hair feel, smell and look like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> First purchased this product from my hair dresser..loved it!  </li>
            <li> This still is pretty miraculous!</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a frizz free shine to their curls or straight styles.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not extremely thick, so it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> My hair is already pretty shiny, but I still noticed a significant improvement the first time I used this cream.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry and fragile yet wavy hair--not a good combo!</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t add very much shine, like I was hoping.  </li>
            <li> its not sticky at all and gives you the nice soft smooth feel and look on damp of dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and love it.</li>
            <li> Once I scaled back on the amount of product I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> sure it works differently on all hair types but it defintely doesn&#x27;t work on mine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the Fekkai glossing cream or the Biosilk gloss for shine, both of which work so much better on my hair.</li>
            <li> Found this product and tried it in sample size first.  </li>
            <li> First introduced at my salon.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for nice hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in your hair but it really works!  </li>
            <li> or it looks really greasy!</li>
            <li> Good shine product that&#x27;s not to heavy.</li>
            <li> It will not weight your hair down but provides a healthy glow to your hair along with a light hold for your style.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars because the scent, although quite pleasant, is a little too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and most products weigh it down or make the hair feel and appear greasy.</li>
            <li> It has worked amazing on my daughters hair which is thick but fine.  </li>
            <li> it is so light that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, doesn&#x27;t harden, makes my hair soooo soft and it smells absolutely nice.  </li>
            <li> So natural, outdoorsy and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> Just enough, and it has a nice soft shine, no frizz, and manageability.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner really adds shine and sheen to my hair but no sticky, greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It really helps bring out the highlights.</li>
            <li> not greasy, does not leave hair crunchy, and works for curly or straight or wavy</li>
            <li> I really do recommend Alterna hair Products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so much compliments regarding my hair.</li>
            <li> I have white hair which is somewhat coarse, and it softens and tames it nicely.</li>
            <li> I use a dime sized amount for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and usually use moose for my curls, but I figured I would try this out since I got a sample of it and liked how it smelled and worked at the time.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this works great without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options.</li>
            <li> i usually use it on dry but either way its great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews of this product (on a beauty product website) of people that said this left a nice shimmer / shine to your hair</li>
            <li> I normally use either the Fekkai cream or a liquid gloss.  </li>
            <li> It makes damaged hair feel normal.  </li>
            <li> The cream works very well on my biracial hair, making it manageable and very soft without stripping it of its natural curl or volume.</li>
            <li> I figured I would save it for those days that I blow dry my hair straight and maybe it would work better on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> When applied direclty to hair and left, shine is really nice (mind you, not an all day shine, maybe few hours).  </li>
            <li> I used just a tiny bit and my hair felt heavy and greasy when it should have felt fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> And if I style it that day, WOW.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It gives natural body to the hair and shine.  </li>
            <li> It protects your hair from heat leaving it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it makes my hair feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair looks soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and makes my hair shine and soft, which is a plus</li>
            <li> because I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li> Elves my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> hair is soft and shiny after use</li>
            <li> I completely empathize with you on a broader level, I do not make the products.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and one bottle lasts forever since you can use such a tiny amount each time.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> use this after each shampoo and conditioner I use around a dime size mybe a little more to wet hair</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Only takes a spare amount; too much, and your hair will be flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Although I love other Alterna Bamboo products, this item was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> and my hair is left soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long and it silky soft.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous other products promising the same results...</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry my hair and the cream leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to let my hair air dry naturally</li>
            <li> My hair is about halfway down my back and stick straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, dry, dull, frizzy and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> After I flat iron, I use a tiny dollop as a finisher.</li>
            <li> I have super frizzy, coarse and THICK hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry and a tad bit unruly, but this product is my go-to for an instant boost.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair, so my hair loves the extra moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> It really helps my thick, coarse hair to behave.  </li>
            <li> It can dry your hair after left on long.</li>
            <li> Because I have fine thin hair I would think a cream would weight my hair down</li>
            <li> I am on my @ 5th order of this styling product and will continue to have it as long as it is around.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet from shampooing, when it&#x27;s dry the next day before styling and after styling.  </li>
            <li> My long hair is never tangle, even when I let it air dry</li>
            <li> It also has little subtle sparkles in it that make your hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> For the shine part, if I emulsify between my hands and run thru my hair and then dry, I noticed no difference.  </li>
            <li> I was putting it in my hair after I would shower and let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I used about 3 or 2 dime size portions on my dry hair cause</li>
            <li> I apply a dime size after getting out of the shower and blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I use it for a variety of purposes, usually when I want my style to be sleek and soft.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I simply rub between my hands and then run my hands through my damp hair a few times to apply.  </li>
            <li> the final results are shine ,no frizz,great scent even had a few people ask me what I use in my hair to leave it</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> When I used it on wet hair to let it air dry, my hair dried frizzy without a bit of shine.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get the results from this that I get from other gloss or shine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually put a tiny bit on after as well, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Also other products work well too.</li>
            <li> The shine it gives is unbelievable, my hairdresser has started to buy alterna products especially the bamboo shine line.</li>
            <li> realize this disagrees with the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it weighs the hair down at all</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to hold the little hairs down at my crown and part down without looking greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I have very, and I mean VERY thick, semi-coarse hair, but this cream softens and sleeks my hair effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve towel dried it, then blow dry and straighten as usual.</li>
            <li> I used it on styled hair just to give it a little bit of shine.  </li>
            <li> Just need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t want you to get stuck with a product you&#x27;re unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Product is heavy and does not leave hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Use in moderation though, or else it feels too heavy.</li>
            <li> I got a few of my friends hooked on this product as well</li>
            <li> I found it sometimes clumped and dried in chunks which was a bummer.</li>
            <li> Even after being exposed to that water, this heavy cream was still in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I like to put in a little product to tame it somewhat.  </li>
            <li> This cream helps tame frizz and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all.</li>
            <li> after you have dried your hair...use a very little bit...</li>
            <li> Same product as sephora carries, but less expensive here on amazon.</li>
            <li> it has no residue and you need very little.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small sample bag of the Alterna Bamboo products because I wanted to try the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the Alterna line products but this is one I&#x27;m not entirely sure I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> Even if I got a buzz cut it would be dry and nasty the next day.</li>
            <li> My hair has not experienced any increased shine and brilliance as promised.</li>
            <li> No matter what type of hair you have...thick or thin...</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any dramatic differences.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t work like I was hoping it would.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when Alterna discontinued the hemp line and with it the styling mud.  </li>
            <li> Zero stars for horrible service and somewhat rude/defensive attitude.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Soft hold, smells good.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and love it. The first time I used it I made the mistake of using too much product and my hair looked great but felt greasy and weighted. Once I scaled back on the amount of product I fell in love with it. I have medium thickness hair and am a stay at home mom, which often leads to days of washing and air drying my hair. Using this product helps my hair look better on the days when I wash and run. And if I style it that day, WOW. Everyone should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small sample bag of the Alterna Bamboo products because I wanted to try the shampoo and conditioner.  This cream came along in the pack and boy am I glad it did!  I love this stuff! The consistency is not extremely thick, so it is easy to apply.  My hair is about halfway down my back and stick straight.  I use about a nickel size amount and that is plently.  I simply rub between my hands and then run my hands through my damp hair a few times to apply.  Then I blow dry my hair and the cream leaves it soft and shiny.  I don&#x27;t think it weighs the hair down at all and I have fine hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t super oily, tho, so it may not work for a teenager or anyone else who has oily hair.  It smells great and lasts a long time.  I highly recommend it.  I actually love all of the Alterna products I have tried.  They are a little pricey, but they make you hair feel and look wonderful.  I&#x27;m sold for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a really good hair cream for keeping long hair sleek and tangle-free. Best one I found when I had waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that smells divine!  I used to use a similar product by Kiehl&#x27;s that was wonderful also, but had a strong, mediciny smell.  This Brilliance Cream is so much better!  It really helps my thick, coarse hair to behave.  Just a dab is all you need.</li>
            <li> I prefer to let my hair air dry naturally so I like to put in a little product to tame it somewhat.  I normally use either the Fekkai cream or a liquid gloss.

            <li> This hair product is great!  I have naturally curly hair and it tames the firzzies and adds a shine to my hair. I have used numerous other products promising the same results... this one carries through.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  It gives natural body to the hair and shine.  Easy to use.  Love the cap on the tube.  Only four stars because the scent, although quite pleasant, is a little too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Good shine product that&#x27;s not to heavy. Just need a little bit. It can dry your hair after left on long.</li>
            <li> Smells great, adds shine!</li>
            <li> Product is heavy and does not leave hair silky and shiny. Could have gotten the same results with any styling product bought at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Bamboo does an awesome job with its product line.  Love the way this product smells and works.  Recommend with no reservation.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner really adds shine and sheen to my hair but no sticky, greasy feeling.  It really helps bring out the highlights.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, dry, dull, frizzy and tangles easily.  Found this product and tried it in sample size first.  Used it mostly on the ends, then worked it through the rest of my hair. When the sample ran out, I purchased the full size.  I now use it all the time, after and in between shampoos.  My hair is softer and more manageable. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and now use all the Alterna Bamboo Shine products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It has worked amazing on my daughters hair which is thick but fine.  Smells great too.  You only need a little and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  It protects your hair from heat leaving it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year because it was recommended by my hairdresser for my type of hair. This helps control the frizz that I normally have on humid days and makes my hair over all more manageable.</li>
            <li> not greasy, does not leave hair crunchy, and works for curly or straight or wavy getting rid of summer frizzes.  hair feels good still the next am</li>
            <li> Love this product! Not greasy. First introduced at my salon. Have been using it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with a nice shine.  Only takes a spare amount; too much, and your hair will be flat and lifeless.  Just enough, and it has a nice soft shine, no frizz, and manageability.</li>
            <li> Another awesome product from Alterna .I use this after each shampoo and conditioner I use around a dime size mybe a little more to wet hair the final results are shine ,no frizz,great scent even had a few people ask me what I use in my hair to leave it so shinny I really do recommend Alterna hair Products I will never be without them.A small price to pay for nice hair!</li>
            <li> Same product as sephora carries, but less expensive here on amazon. Smells great, makes hair shiney but not at all oily, and lessens frizz. Use in moderation though, or else it feels too heavy. I use a dime sized amount for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing leave in hair cream! I use it everyday and it makes my hair feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for somebody and they absolutely love it! I like the size it comes in for the price and they like the results on their hair! It feels smoother, looks shinier, and is healthier. Will buy again when I need to.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep frizz in check and add an attractive shine to my white hair.  I like this product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioning as well as styling product. I have fine straight hair and most products weigh it down or make the hair feel and appear greasy. This does not. It gives my hair substance and shine and conditioning. It is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream&#x27;s perfume. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it is very pleasant. The cream works very well on my biracial hair, making it manageable and very soft without stripping it of its natural curl or volume. It&#x27;s also easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair. In fact, it seems to protect it during styling. I wish other creams smelled this good!</li>
            <li> Love Alterna bamboo hair cream - makes my hair manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry and a tad bit unruly, but this product is my go-to for an instant boost. My hairstylist introduced me to it and swears by it, and I was hooked after I smelled it! I use it for a variety of purposes, usually when I want my style to be sleek and soft. If you put it on before curling or straightening, it locks in the scent and smooths the hair. I usually put a tiny bit on after as well, a little goes a long way! It also has little subtle sparkles in it that make your hair super shiny. I got a few of my friends hooked on this product as well, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and one bottle lasts forever since you can use such a tiny amount each time. It&#x27;s my favorite hair product by far, and makes my hair feel, smell and look like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> needed to find another product since RUSK gleam cream went off the market.  this one is a bit heavier but i love the anti-frizz results and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s all I have used for several years...</li>
            <li> I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for something nice.</li>
            <li> Now this Alterna product I love!  I gave a &amp;#34;bleh&amp;#34; to the Caviar Protein cream by Alterna earlier.  This product not only gives shine and smoothness but I love the scent.  So natural, outdoorsy and clean smelling.  I inhale it as I smooth it through my hair.  I use it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet from shampooing, when it&#x27;s dry the next day before styling and after styling.  I use it to refresh my style since I don&#x27;t shampoo every day.  I have dry, wavy hair, so my hair loves the extra moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> I love it. Use it every time I shampoo. The best there is. Also other products work well too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and I have not noticed any dramatic differences.  My hair has not experienced any increased shine and brilliance as promised. Although I love other Alterna Bamboo products, this item was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  Makes my hair looks soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> I recommend it as part of your hair care...it is worthy! My long hair is never tangle, even when I let it air dry and I don&#x27;t comb it. I avoid the hair dryer as much as I can during the warm season...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry and fragile yet wavy hair--not a good combo! I probably have 30 bottles of shampoos, conditioners and creams in my bathroom vanity, none of which made any appreciable difference in my hair. My mom got me this product for my birthday and I am WOWED. My hair is super-shiny AND has more texture and volume AND the smell is awesome. This product is a must-have for problem hair. Everytime I would go to the salon they just wanted to lop more inches of my hair off despite my protests. Even if I got a buzz cut it would be dry and nasty the next day. Now my hair is growing better because it doesn&#x27;t break every minute. I am psyched to try the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I use Alterna shampoo and conditioner, so I thought this would be great on my fine hair.  It just didn&#x27;t add very much shine, like I was hoping.  It did smell nice, but I think there are other products that will give my hair more shine for the money.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and makes my hair shine and soft, which is a plus because I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li> Works well on my fine shoulder length hair.  Not greasy and helps to smooth. I only use a pea size amount rubbed between my fingers and then through the mid to ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Elves my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when Alterna discontinued the hemp line and with it the styling mud.  I was looking for something to hold the little hairs down at my crown and part down without looking greasy or weighed down.  For the shine part, if I emulsify between my hands and run thru my hair and then dry, I noticed no difference.  When applied direclty to hair and left, shine is really nice (mind you, not an all day shine, maybe few hours).  So, this would not be a good product for a shiny, blow out, and it has no hold whatsever, but its nice to give a little shine for a bit of time.</li>
            <li> hair is soft and shiny after use</li>
            <li> My hair has been through a lot from the effects of medication.  This product tamed it and I didn&#x27;t look like I had just poked my finger in a socket.</li>
            <li> My hair gets frizzy in the summer and this works GREAT.  In fact, its the winter now and I still use it every day!  It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in your hair but it really works!  They have a hair spray in the same line that I use also.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and usually use moose for my curls, but I figured I would try this out since I got a sample of it and liked how it smelled and worked at the time.  When I got it, I was in love with it right away....Even though it says SLEEK - it works great on curly hair....it is so light that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, doesn&#x27;t harden, makes my hair soooo soft and it smells absolutely nice.  I just love how soft and light it makes my hair feel, how it makes my curls come out, and how it smells.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this after my stylist used it on my hair.  It will not weight your hair down but provides a healthy glow to your hair along with a light hold for your style.  I am on my @ 5th order of this styling product and will continue to have it as long as it is around.  It has mysteriously disappeared on several occasions after my daughters &#x27;borrowed&#x27; it.  They love it too.</li>
            <li> Great product...helps with frizz</li>
            <li> This cream helps tame frizz and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the Alterna line products but this is one I&#x27;m not entirely sure I will purchase again. I was putting it in my hair after I would shower and let my hair air dry. I found it sometimes clumped and dried in chunks which was a bummer. I don&#x27;t know it did anything &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; for my hair but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> So love this product.  It makes damaged hair feel normal.  I would definitely buy this again. Worth every penny and more</li>
            <li> I used this product in a sample size and love it . Because I have fine thin hair I would think a cream would weight my hair down but it doesn&#x27;t. I used about 3 or 2 dime size portions on my dry hair cause it&#x27;s long and it silky soft. I think its water based cause as u rub it in ur hands it gets  slippery . It&#x27;s not like a cream but mOre like a lotion. It actually smell like bamboo. This product is great for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> No matter what type of hair you have...thick or thin...this product works well.  Use it after you shampoo and/or after you have dried your hair...use a very little bit...it gives your hair a nice shine and takes out all the &amp;#34;snarls!&amp;#34;  It was recommended and is used by my hairdresser...I love it!</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!! I love this brand and it&#x27;s well worth the price. I&#x27;ve never gotten so much compliments regarding my hair. The shine it gives is unbelievable, my hairdresser has started to buy alterna products especially the bamboo shine line.</li>
            <li> i got introduced to the Alterna line from my friend and hair-dresser. every product is great!! this cream is a light weight stunner that will make your hair manageable, silky and shine like glass!! it has no residue and you need very little. and Amazon has many choices from the line-all at better prices than the salons!! whats better than that!! treat your hair--its your hair!! it deserves it!!</li>
            <li> First purchased this product from my hair dresser..loved it!  Smells wonderful and makes your hair shine. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my hair feeling smooth and silky and frizz free. Would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a frizz free shine to their curls or straight styles.</li>
            <li> Some really great product. I also love the earthy smell and way it right away makes your hair feel better as soon as you put it on damp hair. FINALLY , a product that does what it says. Takes as long to look for the right hair product as it does for the right guy....can literally take years!!!!! Very happy with this!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! First, once you are diagnosed with Celiac, many (if not most) salon products you have been using, are no longer options. I have tried many of the salon quality products out there that are safe for Celiacs. Alterna Bamboo line is without question the best product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is great. I put just a dime size amount in my hand once my hair is towel-dried. That is all it takes. You hair will be soft, smell great and totally full of shine.</li>
            <li> I have very, and I mean VERY thick, semi-coarse hair, but this cream softens and sleeks my hair effortlessly.  I still use a thick-barrel curling iron, but the Brilliance cream does its job and maintains my hair&#x27;s health and texture.  It also smells lovely and fresh!</li>
            <li> This still is pretty miraculous! I have super frizzy, coarse and THICK hair! I apply a dime size after getting out of the shower and blow dry it. After I flat iron, I use a tiny dollop as a finisher. Looks so polished and shiny. Be careful not to use too much or it looks really greasy!</li>
            <li> Great for dry or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a reputable salon, and it was wonderful. I then found it here and ordered a replacement expecting the same product. The one from this seller is GREASY &amp; OILY BUYER BEWARE. I contacted the seller and this was their response&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;While I completely empathize with you on a broader level, I do not make the products. Your concerns are properly directed at the manufacturer who puts these products on store shelves for people like me to buy and re-sell to you- the customer. If the manufacturer&#x27;s product is not up to your standards, I personally have nothing to do with that. The product is the same no matter where you buy it from. I cannot and do not &amp;#34;water down&amp;#34; products.I would always opt for the return in this sort of situation. I certainly don&#x27;t want you to get stuck with a product you&#x27;re unhappy with. The problem for me is that the product was used, which means I have to throw it away, hence why I cannot accept returns for used products.&amp;#34;  How would one know the product wasn&#x27;t the same unless it was opened and tried/used? Seriously?  This is a great product when sold in its original state. So spend the extra money and just get it at your salon. Zero stars for horrible service and somewhat rude/defensive attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have long hair and this works great without being heavy. And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and silky.  It also really helps with my fly always and breakage, as well.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product, and a little goes a very long way. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair at all and delivers a beautiful shine. My hair is already pretty shiny, but I still noticed a significant improvement the first time I used this cream. You cannot beat this stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my must have product.  It leaves my hair feeling great and makes it shine.  A great product for the hair.</li>
            <li> Always awesome, I keep well stocked on this product.  Good for all seasons and smells amazing.  Wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from a local salon, and once I tried it I was hooked. It smells amazing, and it makes my hair so shiny and soft. I already have pretty healthy, normal hair, but this product just made it better. I put it on my hair after I&#x27;ve towel dried it, then blow dry and straighten as usual. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks even healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li> love this product. its not sticky at all and gives you the nice soft smooth feel and look on damp of dry hair. i usually use it on dry but either way its great.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product a couple of years ago hoping it would be a good replacement for a hydrating cream I couldn&#x27;t get any more. It was even better. I love the texture, the smell, the result, everything! I have long fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Knots are easier to comb out and my hair is left soft and shiny. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this after my hair dresser recommended it, and I love it for my hair.  It gives it a nice shine, adds body and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I have white hair which is somewhat coarse, and it softens and tames it nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Hair comes out so shiny and manageable.  My hair always looks healthy since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look awesome even if it&#x27;s damaged!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Great results without the weight</li>
            <li> This adds shine and control without making your hair feel greasy.  I have a short hairstyle and i apply while my hair is still damp. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair beautifully shining but not greasy looking. Definitely worth the money. I would recommend this to any of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I use serums and creams for the purpose of this Silk&#x3D;Sleek Cream all of the time. And after loving Alterna&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, I thought this would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ick. I used just a tiny bit and my hair felt heavy and greasy when it should have felt fresh and clean.  It smells delicious and pretty, but the heaviness felt as if I&#x27;d used a dollop of Vaseline and scrunched it in my medium thick wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What fascinated me the most was I went swimming in a chlorinated pool the next day without my swim cap.  Even after being exposed to that water, this heavy cream was still in my hair. I had to shampoo three times to get it out and get my regular hair back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this disagrees with the other reviewers: maybe I got an \\&quot;off\\&quot; bottle.  But I did use it according to directions so I&#x27;d suggest another product OR buy it in a starter kit that has several of their products so you don&#x27;t invest in the full-size without checking it.</li>
