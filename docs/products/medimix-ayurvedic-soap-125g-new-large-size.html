    <ol>
            <li>What a great soap!  </li>
            <li>I use to think that Zest was the best soap out there because it leaves no sticky film on the skin when rinsed off.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful also</li>
            <li>But in defense of this bar, it&#x27;s good for dry/sensitive/itchy skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is exhilarating</li>
            <li>, we gave it a try, love she does have to pay for a prescription her face looks great</li>

            <li>I am going to order more because it is my favorite soap!</li>
            <li>And it smells okay, not too strong/overpowering.</li>
            <li>I started using the soap and my skin feels and looks much better.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks better.</li>
            <li>and I tend to break out with most soaps.</li>
            <li>I love his smell.</li>
            <li>I originally gifted this soap from a friend who visited Kerala, India to which end</li>
            <li>I promptly fell in love with everything about it.  </li>
            <li>So far I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Overall great experience from the product to the supplier.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily when I shower and moisturize with Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E cream which I customize with almond oil, coconut oil, myrrh oil, and Bringraj oil (all purchased on Amazon at great prices).</li>
            <li>I first came across this soap on a study aboard trip to India and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>This soap gets me squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>okay, although not as much as the glycerin soap.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product...even love the stamps on the box.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild, leaves skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s packed full of ayurvedic herbs.  </li>
            <li>Finally can get away with no foundation and feel comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel pretty clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li>I even use toothpaste with neem in it since it&#x27;s  far better than mainstream toothpaste for my teeth &amp; gums.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>so I love an herbal or natural scent.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, but I&#x27;ll change to my more fragrant soaps sometimes when I want a more fragrant scent.  </li>
            <li>However, the first night I used it</li>
            <li>Very little residual left on skin and pleasant smell that makes you feel wholesome and clean!  </li>
            <li>After my skin is squeaky clean and not dry at all!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend product for anyone that has skin problems!</li>
            <li>However, it goes rather fast</li>
            <li>My skin is normal, but it used to be oh so dry at certain areas like the elbow before, but now, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It seems like my face looks pretty clear.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this soap but received it and</li>
            <li>so you use a little moisturizer afterwards love it highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy I did because it seems almost instant with it&#x27;s ability to clean and clear the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive face</li>
            <li>It has a funny smell, not offensive at all, but different.</li>
            <li>Honestly its always been clear but when I moved back up north, it seems like the hard water didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li>complexion is clear and it exfoliates the skin which gives a glow.</li>
            <li>My skin was red and very irritated for a couple of days after I used this, and I couldn&#x27;t cover the reaction with makeup</li>
            <li>My skin was much clearer the next day.  </li>
            <li>But do apply an natural moisturizer after bath soap drys the skin bit.</li>
            <li>and it helps on sensitive too,</li>
            <li>It seems to help with adult acne.</li>
            <li>After many tries with numerous different products, I found the one.</li>
            <li>Tried this soap, after the first bath the rashes were down by 70% and went away after 2 washes.</li>
            <li>It arrived in Hawaii all the way from India with not a single dent!  </li>

            <li> This worked on my body but not my face. My skin was red and very irritated for a couple of days after I used this, and I couldn&#x27;t cover the reaction with makeup -- it still looked bad. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I had red painfull rashes on my skin (that I later figured out were bed bug bites). I tried over-the-counter allergy creams and capsules, but no relief. Tried this soap, after the first bath the rashes were down by 70% and went away after 2 washes. I keep this soap handy incase of any insect bites.</li>
            <li> I like this soap okay, although not as much as the glycerin soap. I wish this company would either make the bar(glycerin)&lt;br /&gt;bigger or charge less for it! But in defense of this bar, it&#x27;s good for dry/sensitive/itchy skin. And it smells okay, not too strong/overpowering. I HATE perfume in my soap!</li>
            <li> I started using the soap and my skin feels and looks much better.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for only a few days.  However, the first night I used it I saw an immediate difference.  My skin was much clearer the next day.  Someone even asked me what I used on my face.  So far I am happy with it.  My skin feels and looks better.</li>
            <li> I was very upset to receive this product and find out there are at least half a dozen synthetic ingredients i this product. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY ANYTHING THEY SAY TO SELL THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I use shampoo with tea tree oil for my hair to keep off lice and to keep from scratching/itching.  I even use toothpaste with neem in it since it&#x27;s  far better than mainstream toothpaste for my teeth &amp; gums.  I decided to try this soap since it had ayurvedic ingredients and was herbal and I was suffering from mite infestation;  The soap has a funky smell (probably the sandalwood), but I&#x27;ve never scratched since!!  My skin is normal, but it used to be oh so dry at certain areas like the elbow before, but now, it&#x27;s fine.  I even use it on my cat when I bathe her and have not had any problems. I use it everyday, but I&#x27;ll change to my more fragrant soaps sometimes when I want a more fragrant scent.  Medimix DOES help with body odor since I notice I have less of it when I use it.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every soap out there and if you&#x27;re looking for a HEALING soap, give this soap a try for a month and you should see results. I agree about getting a caseful - it&#x27;s worth every penny and you&#x27;ll never have to run around worrying about bathing without your purrrecious medimix soap bar!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap since 15 years my pimples are gone complexion is clear and it exfoliates the skin which gives a glow.But do apply an natural moisturizer after bath soap drys the skin bit.</li>
            <li> What a great soap!  I&#x27;ve tried everything out there but decided to give this a shot given that it is so inexpensive.. But I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Happy I did because it seems almost instant with it&#x27;s ability to clean and clear the skin. Def would recommend it !</li>
            <li> Love Medimix!  Fast shipping, quality product...even love the stamps on the box. Overall great experience from the product to the supplier.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this soap but received it and the expiration date on it is March 2011 and it&#x27;s December 2011.  Oh well, just will use it for washing my hands!  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> My daughter was paying alot for a prescription for her acne, we tried all the other stuff out there too and all didnt work I ran across this by accident researching for something else, we gave it a try, love she does have to pay for a prescription her face looks great and it has improved my complexion yes it does leave your face a little drier if you have regular skin but oily it shouldnt and it helps on sensitive too, so you use a little moisturizer afterwards love it highly recommend</li>
            <li> It seems to help with adult acne. I have very sensitive face and I tend to break out with most soaps. Not this one though so I&#x27;ll stick to it.</li>
            <li> I use to think that Zest was the best soap out there because it leaves no sticky film on the skin when rinsed off. This soap gets me squeaky clean. It has a funny smell, not offensive at all, but different. I use this daily when I shower and moisturize with Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E cream which I customize with almond oil, coconut oil, myrrh oil, and Bringraj oil (all purchased on Amazon at great prices). My skin is super soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this soap!  Very little residual left on skin and pleasant smell that makes you feel wholesome and clean!  I do wash my face twice because I use powder and have oily skin.  After my skin is squeaky clean and not dry at all!  I believe that it is pulling out impurities but it could be my imagination.  I have no scientific proof.  It arrived in Hawaii all the way from India with not a single dent!  I am going to order more because it is my favorite soap!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend product for anyone that has skin problems! clears skin up, i have , tried everything, this does the trick</li>
            <li> It makes me feel pretty clean. I love his smell. I&#x27;m Jamaican so I love an herbal or natural scent. I use this on my face and my body. It seems like my face looks pretty clear. Honestly its always been clear but when I moved back up north, it seems like the hard water didn&#x27;t agree with me. So maybe it truly is working.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap. We use it for face washing. The smell is mild, leaves skin feeling clean and moisturized. Will continue to buy this soap whenever I can find it.</li>
            <li> After many tries with numerous different products, I found the one. I pair this with dermalogica active moist moisturizer. My skin is not only clearer, less irritated, but my scars are fading too. Finally can get away with no foundation and feel comfortable in my own skin.</li>
            <li> I first came across this soap on a study aboard trip to India and fell in love.  This stuff can heal all sorts of skin  irritations including eczema.  It smells wonderful also</li>
            <li> I originally gifted this soap from a friend who visited Kerala, India to which end I promptly fell in love with everything about it.  The smell is exhilarating (what I imagine the irish spring people were talking about) and it&#x27;s packed full of ayurvedic herbs.  Your skin will thank you.  I found that I don&#x27;t need lotion after using it.  It makes you feel SO clean and as someone effected by smells makes me happy to use it.  However, it goes rather fast (or maybe I just use a lot) so be prepared.  My next purchase will be a case of it.  I don&#x27;t think I can ever use anything else.</li>
