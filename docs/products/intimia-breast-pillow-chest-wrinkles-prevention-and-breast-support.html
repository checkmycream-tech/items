            <li>This works great !!</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if the bottom part along and around the breast was also cushioned.</li>

            <li>I been using the Breast  pillow for 2 weeks , and Iam really happy with it.</li>
            <li>It does however greatly reduce them.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>It may have been a great product for some</li>
            <li>Great for anyone showing signs of chest wrinkles, has breast implants or us a side sleeper.</li>
            <li>I feel so happy now -  after two weeks of use my chest wrinkles</li>
            <li>have greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Amazing product - amazing results!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t beleive how great this product works.  </li>
            <li>Great invention</li>
            <li>Great quality</li>
            <li>Love this product!!  </li>
            <li>This is excellent and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d be very happy to find a happy medium between confirmed breast separation and airflow to prevent wrinkles, pimples/itch bumps.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I&#x27;d discovered Intimia Pillow because the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend laughed and made a comment I can&#x27;t state here</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good thing</li>
            <li>Sounded good at the time.</li>
            <li>This could be good for maintenance but did not resolve my problem.</li>
            <li>so I think it must be good for any age.</li>
            <li>Good product and idea but need improvement.</li>
            <li>it is truly ok, is that I wish it were made out of 100% silk because it is really great for skin.</li>
            <li>This keeps them separated and is very comfortable to wear!</li>
            <li>I must say it took my husband some time getting used to it, but he is very supportive now.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and plan to buy another.</li>
            <li>Anyway its a great deal and works just as good! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sleeping much better with it !</li>
            <li>i love it !</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Happy chest wrinkle free mornings.</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;m just relieved to not wake up stressing out about wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the shiny material is kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these years ago &amp; really liked it.</li>
            <li>Somewhat effective at preventing wrinkles in d√©colletage.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Intimia&amp;#34; is much superior with thicker supportive straps and</li>
            <li>My solution was to wrap a spongy kind of material around the bottom elastic</li>
            <li>This is ideal for large breasted women!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, nice fabric.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with the results - my chest wrinkles are gradually disappearing.</li>
            <li>But the best pick I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>Super happy :))))</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>and you do have to fit the straps so that it&#x27;s very snug in order for it too work with the best results.</li>
            <li>I cannot put into words exactly how happy I am with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable</li>
            <li>It stays in place and very comfortable</li>
            <li>but it is very comfortable</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to sleep with..</li>
            <li>Very comfortable</li>
            <li>I found the pillow very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t work like the pad.  </li>
            <li>My chest wrinkles had disappeared and i sleep better than ever before.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Most defifnitely returning this item!&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li>It is holding up well, and it has been washed many times.</li>
            <li>Over time, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if the more permanent lines fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it does the job it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>just okay</li>
            <li>so perhaps better for not so.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles look noticably better.</li>
            <li>All around I love it.</li>
            <li>I was a bit dubious about spending the money for this breast pillow, but now I have, I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I didnt even think I would be able to use it all</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>You gotta give your decollete area just as much attention as your neck and face-if you want it to look great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This simple pillow is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Many regards from Germany!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m returning it and am going to try the more obscure ChestSaver.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put it in a lingerie bag for washing in machine.  </li>
            <li>I used the product and found it okay to use.</li>
            <li>I will still say that it is not the cutest, most enticing thing to wear when I go to bed, however, my husband doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.  </li>
            <li>I simply love this product.</li>
            <li>Would also love one in a cotton fabric too</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found this.  </li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s washable :-)  </li>
            <li>I love this pillow and have recommended it to all of my girlfriends.  </li>
            <li>I love the silicone pads that you wear at night.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Lovely company to work with also.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it was fabulous!</li>
            <li>Nothing betrays your age more than wrinkly cleavage and neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to expect them to affect the wrinkles you have already established but do know that it will prevent more from forming as a result of side-sleeping.</li>
            <li>Look for something better.</li>
            <li>I got this not for prevention of wrinkles, although if that&#x27;s true it&#x27;d be nice, but when I lay on my side I don&#x27;t want the girls to touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and really does help with chest wrinkles, but it looks super goofy.</li>
            <li>, it means I can go out every day confident and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable to sleep with it than without it.</li>
            <li>I started sleeping with a sports bra on and just placing the pillow between my breasts without &amp;#34;strapping&amp;#34; it on and this is much more comfortable</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more comfortable than one would imagine sleeping with something on their chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still holding up well after consistent use over many years :)</li>
            <li>It is high-quality, comfortable, easy to use, stays in place and does its job.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 1 day and already saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy wearing it every night.</li>
            <li>The bra itself is comfortable</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this will fit on a petite woman.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely comfortable to wear, and it keeps everything in place when I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li>I use it every night because it&#x27;s so comfortable</li>
            <li>and I enjoy wearing it at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable for me to wear</li>
            <li>it is soooo comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wake up wrinkle free every day and stay that way.</li>
            <li>Its really comfortable.. with adjustable straps..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable that I forget I have it on until my husband reminds me on weekend mornings.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>The Intimia breast pillow is comfortable and gives the support and keeps the wrinkle look from appearing.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear and it doesn&#x27;t impede your sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable</li>
            <li>I am a stomach sleeper, and the cushion is comfortable to wear when sleeping.</li>
            <li>I also use a light moisturiser on my chest b4 going to bed and this also helps.</li>
            <li>To be honest, even if it wasn&#x27;t fighting wrinkles I would still wear it because something about it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>my chest wrinkles were way more pronounced in the morning- especially after a particularly good night of sleep.</li>
            <li>But I still have 2 lines which are higher where the pillow gets slimmer at the top so it has not reached there....</li>
            <li>Definately worth it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous this every large breasted women should have one :-)</li>
            <li>I have a large bust 34DDD and it has made sleeping so much more comfortable</li>
            <li>Like a bra would and there is no way to clean it.  </li>
            <li>The pillow itself is super comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very comfortable - really truly, it is - and I can wear it all night with no problems and sometimes lots of tossing and turning.</li>
            <li>but it may be more significant for someone who isn&#x27;t very flexible.  </li>
            <li>I think these companies such as Intimia and Chest Savers have the best intentions of helping women get rid of their chest wrinkles, and I&#x27;m sure what you&#x27;re really buying is the quality, but do they really have to charge so much?</li>
            <li>For $50, I will give it much more time to see what it does for real wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Although very pricey in my opinion, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this pillow to others, not only for wrinkle prevention, but comfortable side sleeping during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Fabric is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>i love it very much&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Comfortable for sleep and useful after breast surgery however a bit bulky</li>
            <li>That one would lose its stickiness so quick and one side or both would start flapping around and didn&#x27;t help my chest creasing.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I gave this gift to myself and have been enjoying deeper, more restful sleep.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pregnant at the moment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty comfortable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to properly adjust the pillow&#x27;s straps to make sure you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>its pretty comfortable and I have no problem with the strap.</li>
            <li>Nope, it doesn&#x27;t make me hot!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32DD, and this is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li>: After several years of using this pillow, I can confidently attest to its ability to prevent chest wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first night I used it!</li>
            <li>It is soft to the touch and feels like a synthetic satin which is totally fine!</li>
            <li>Too large to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am a full B cup and it stays right in place, right where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I actually find it more comfortable sleeping on my side with this pillow &amp;#34;supporting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I wake up feeling more like my old self and the wrinkles are almost non-existent.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of summer dresses and swim suits anymore.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I discovered this early on</li>
            <li>Light fitting  and all the lines simply disappear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is eliminating all wrinkles, or preventing them, but it is just keeping my chest nice and flat so that they aren&#x27;t as noticable.</li>
            <li>because if I don&#x27;t have it nestled the right way, there are wrinkles when I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I found the Intimia Pillow on Amazon and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>This pillow was very well made, I clean it with</li>
            <li>I guess if you don&#x27;t move around at all and are very large breasted it might work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a comfortable breast pillow and easy to use for sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged very well with a cute little bag.</li>
            <li>I am also pregnant, but needed it anyway due to having a larger chest, but this has also helped me sleep a bit better, more comfortably and with confidence that I can wake up to no chest wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I recommend for all large breast ladies!    </li>
            <li>To be honest, I haven&#x27;t really noticed that big of a difference in the look, but where has this been all my life?  </li>
            <li>I will say it was more comfortable than I expected, but it moved no matter how I secured it and did not stay where it needed to be in order to prevent wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My chest feels very soft and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>Moves around too much and very hot.</li>
            <li>I find it very comfortable, especially when it&#x27;s that time of the month</li>
            <li>I have to say that my husband started laughing when he saw it, but it is working quite well, so he can laugh all he wants.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I would have invented this!  </li>
            <li>so I will give it much more time and come back to adjust my review, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, something that adheres to the skin would do a better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money, it really works</li>
            <li>You just have to adjust the straps to your comfort the first time you put it on, then slip it on and off accordingly.</li>
            <li>First these bras do work.  </li>
            <li>I find I&#x27;m getting a deeper, more restful sleep because of not having to worry about creating deep wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you cant exactly hide the fact that youre wearing it..</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>The pillow is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Glad the copany tried to put soemthing out to help with this problem, but they need to go back to the drawing board with this.</li>
            <li>I thought it was so funny when I saw this.</li>
            <li>I think it could be a slimmer shape therefor the breasts would be much more supported, and as it is now you have to constantly ajust it into the crease line of the breast.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the intimia breast pillow to anyone who is interested in this product.</li>
            <li>This pillow definitely works better than rolling up a towel and sleeping that way.</li>
            <li>At first I looooved this product.  </li>
            <li>works well, although it makes me too hot sometimes.</li>
            <li>I look noticeably better, but the wrinkles around my upper chest/ collarbones are still there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would work good on a lighter chested lady, but if you are heavy chested I would give this one a miss.</li>
            <li>I used to spend the better part of my nights tossing and turning and holding a pillow tightly against me in the hopes of keeping wrinkle free in the cleavage area.  </li>
            <li>What a simple, common sense, great invention!</li>
            <li>Pillow is just the right firmness to work and be comfortable at the same time.  </li>
            <li>As long as your wearing a tank top or bandeau type bra it will stay in.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been extremely pleased with this product and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>If you have the same problem, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but if you don¬¥t have large breasts it can move around a bit.</li>
            <li>I have large breast</li>
            <li>would very highly recommend this pillow.</li>
            <li>Not only is this breast pillow super soft and comfortable, but it really works.  </li>
            <li>I am able to wear the low cut shirts when I like, and I feel completely confident, I wish they also made other products!!  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Intimia Breast Pillow several months ago after reading a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>its comfortable to wear I guess expecting it to totally keep wrinkles away was a bit much for one product.</li>
            <li>I will occasionally use with the d√©collet√© silicone pad, which works amazing together, but it not necessary.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement.</li>
            <li>I am a real customer and even tho</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really feel it when I have it on at night.</li>
            <li>Very well made and does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>but unfortunatly i have not made it through one whole night wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work.  </li>
            <li>Cannot wear it straps are horrible....way too much money and cant even use it.  </li>
            <li>There are no fasteners to dig into my skin, and the silky pillow rests gently on my sternum.  </li>
            <li>The stretchy adjustable straps stay in place all night, no matter how much I move.  </li>
            <li>I have been a side sleeper my whole life...</li>
            <li>but it really does work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so big that it&#x27;s bothersome, but big enough to cuddle with and get some great sleep.</li>
            <li>The pillow moves too much, thus changing the position of the straps.  </li>
            <li>crossover design really did separate.  </li>
            <li>It also helps me to sleep on my front if I want to, without feeling my breast is in the way too much.</li>
            <li>This pillow really works and I wish I had known about it before developing the creases between my breasts.  </li>
            <li>Good idea, clumsy design.</li>
            <li>Very well done with high quality material.</li>
            <li>I purchased this pillow 3 yrs ago direct from the Intimia company  when I first started noticing my chest wrinkles.</li>
            <li>new design is about 50% larger than the original.</li>
            <li>After regularly wearing the Intimia, I can understand how it could benefit nursing, pregnant or post-surgical women, as well.  </li>
            <li>I &#x27;m using for prevention, however I recommended it to an older friend and she has seen results too</li>
            <li>/&gt;Observation: It less comfortable in hot or humid weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very uncomfortable and because I do not have large breasts, it actually pushes/separates my breasts so much that I wonder if it&#x27;s doing more harm than good.  </li>
            <li>While the craftsmanship appears to be high quality</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone concerned about chest wrinkels.</li>
            <li>I do however find it quite high to the neck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold, and highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The price is too high for it being a so-so, product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that the little pillow will soften up over time, and I love the fact that you can wash it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, in a lingerie laundry bag and drip dry, it is a breeze to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Also, living in Florida and geting hot in the middle of the night I was really worried about it....</li>
            <li>I am 48 and normally sleep on my side.</li>
            <li>If it works, it is worth this annoyance and I am holding out hope that long-term use will prevent further wrinkle development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew creams alone would be a waste of time and deliberated about the pillow as had been using a similiar one purchased  4  yrs ago(different manufacturer) which had seen better days.  </li>
            <li>Only other draw back is that it is not the cutest \\&quot;sleepwear\\&quot; item, but I am fine with that overalll, it is easily put on or taken off under my night time cami.  </li>
            <li>If you skip a night, those sleep wrinkles will be right back.</li>
            <li>only complaint is the high cost - even with the good quality, it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
            <li>The pillow does move a little during the night but it doesn&#x27;t move completely still keeping my breasts somehow separated from each other, making it much more comfortable to sleep.</li>
            <li>I guess they depend on you spending another $60 plus shipping to get a new one.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have new &#x27;wrinkles&#x27; now.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I really had to adjust the straps to make it fit properly, so if you&#x27;re a really tiny person, this may be too large for you</li>
            <li>Over time, all of this early stage wrinkling is going to set in and become permanent!</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that actually works and is comfortable</li>
            <li>All of the lines that I had on my chest from sleeping on my side are completely gone!</li>
            <li>For the first time in years I wake up without big creases on my chest.  </li>
            <li>I found I became extra hot while wearing it during the night and had to remove it.</li>
            <li>In the first week of wearing it I saw a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Last night was my first night with the pillow</li>
            <li>my other laundry-throw it into the wash and dryer (probably not supposed to clean it this way)</li>
            <li>it is not flat with a dome but more like looking down the length of a football</li>
            <li>so not sure if it would be as effective for bigger busted ladies</li>
            <li>I am large busted and do not think it comes up to my collarbone far enough.  </li>
            <li>At last I found something that really works.</li>
            <li>I am 38 yrs old and a 36DD.</li>
            <li>For the reviewers that said it worked the next day... really???</li>
            <li>(stretchy straps and soft material)</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and have no chest wrinkles because of this product.</li>
            <li>When I tried this pillow for the first time, it felt a wee bit strange, but now I can&#x27;t sleep without it.</li>
            <li>They only lasted around a month or two and at $25 a pop that adds up fast.  </li>
            <li>I have not been using collagen cream which was directed by the oz show, so that may be the reason I really havent seen a big decrease-</li>
            <li>I only wish I had found it so much</li>
            <li>Although I really really like this, it does look hideous wearing it, so I only put it on at the last minute when I&#x27;m ready to hit the sack.</li>
            <li>The material is soft and the straps aren&#x27;t bothersome.</li>
            <li>The pillow is a soft satin cushion.  </li>
            <li>The material is veeeeery soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the sensitive skin of the bottom of my breast.</li>
            <li>I wish the straps were as soft as the pillow.</li>
            <li>I am a side sleeper and have been trying to train myself to sleep on my back, with limited success.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to get a few little wrinkles on my chest which are more prominent if I get a little sun.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so bulky and look so ridiculous under my pajamas, so unless you&#x27;re putting this on right before you get into bed and removing it before you get up for a morning coffee, forget about sleepovers with friends or family.</li>
            <li>I wash mine in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the original was small and flexible enough this didn&#x27;t matter so much, the new larger size means it does not stay in place during the night; a definite design flaw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheaply made, so I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I wish it worked as well as the silk pad product because that is expensive and does not last long where this product is a great value.  </li>
            <li>I still have my original one and usually wear</li>
            <li>I have major chest wrinkles and had been searching for something to improve it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to use a super emollient moisturizer to make them less obvious.  </li>
            <li>A little line from a strap is different from a big crease from where a breast was crushing into another breast</li>
            <li>It works, and it is barely felt.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t prevent creases near the shoulder or upper neck area.</li>
            <li>I only wish I would have found it 10 years ago before my wrinkles developed.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but the product had proven to be very useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent side-sleeper, and at 40D, it can get uncomfortable up top when it all squooshes together.  </li>
            <li>This little pillow does exactly what it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When my boob folds over the pillow as I&#x27;m sleeping on my side, I now have a &#x27;sleep-wrong wrinkle&#x27; down the middle of each breast as well as the real cleavage wrinkles in the middle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this product!!  </li>
            <li> This is excellent and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d be very happy to find a happy medium between confirmed breast separation and airflow to prevent wrinkles, pimples/itch bumps.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I&#x27;d discovered Intimia Pillow because the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend laughed and made a comment I can&#x27;t state here</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good thing</li>
            <li> Sounded good at the time.</li>
            <li> This could be good for maintenance but did not resolve my problem.</li>
            <li> so I think it must be good for any age.</li>
            <li> Good product and idea but need improvement.</li>
            <li> it is truly ok, is that I wish it were made out of 100% silk because it is really great for skin.</li>
            <li> This keeps them separated and is very comfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> I must say it took my husband some time getting used to it, but he is very supportive now.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and plan to buy another.</li>
            <li> Anyway its a great deal and works just as good! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sleeping much better with it !</li>
            <li> i love it !</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Happy chest wrinkle free mornings.</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m just relieved to not wake up stressing out about wrinkles.</li>
            <li> the shiny material is kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these years ago &amp; really liked it.</li>
            <li> Somewhat effective at preventing wrinkles in d√©colletage.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Intimia&amp;#34; is much superior with thicker supportive straps and</li>
            <li> My solution was to wrap a spongy kind of material around the bottom elastic</li>
            <li> This is ideal for large breasted women!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, nice fabric.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the results - my chest wrinkles are gradually disappearing.</li>
            <li> But the best pick I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> Super happy :))))</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> and you do have to fit the straps so that it&#x27;s very snug in order for it too work with the best results.</li>
            <li> I cannot put into words exactly how happy I am with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable</li>
            <li> It stays in place and very comfortable</li>
            <li> but it is very comfortable</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to sleep with..</li>
            <li> Very comfortable</li>
            <li> I found the pillow very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t work like the pad.  </li>
            <li> My chest wrinkles had disappeared and i sleep better than ever before.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Most defifnitely returning this item!&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> It is holding up well, and it has been washed many times.</li>
            <li> Over time, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if the more permanent lines fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it does the job it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> just okay</li>
            <li> so perhaps better for not so.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles look noticably better.</li>
            <li> All around I love it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious about spending the money for this breast pillow, but now I have, I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I didnt even think I would be able to use it all</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> You gotta give your decollete area just as much attention as your neck and face-if you want it to look great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This simple pillow is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Many regards from Germany!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m returning it and am going to try the more obscure ChestSaver.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put it in a lingerie bag for washing in machine.  </li>
            <li> I used the product and found it okay to use.</li>
            <li> I will still say that it is not the cutest, most enticing thing to wear when I go to bed, however, my husband doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.  </li>
            <li> I simply love this product.</li>
            <li> Would also love one in a cotton fabric too</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found this.  </li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s washable :-)  </li>
            <li> I love this pillow and have recommended it to all of my girlfriends.  </li>
            <li> I love the silicone pads that you wear at night.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Lovely company to work with also.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it was fabulous!</li>
            <li> Nothing betrays your age more than wrinkly cleavage and neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make sense to expect them to affect the wrinkles you have already established but do know that it will prevent more from forming as a result of side-sleeping.</li>
            <li> Look for something better.</li>
            <li> I got this not for prevention of wrinkles, although if that&#x27;s true it&#x27;d be nice, but when I lay on my side I don&#x27;t want the girls to touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great and really does help with chest wrinkles, but it looks super goofy.</li>
            <li> , it means I can go out every day confident and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable to sleep with it than without it.</li>
            <li> I started sleeping with a sports bra on and just placing the pillow between my breasts without &amp;#34;strapping&amp;#34; it on and this is much more comfortable</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more comfortable than one would imagine sleeping with something on their chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still holding up well after consistent use over many years :)</li>
            <li> It is high-quality, comfortable, easy to use, stays in place and does its job.</li>
            <li> and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 1 day and already saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy wearing it every night.</li>
            <li> The bra itself is comfortable</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this will fit on a petite woman.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely comfortable to wear, and it keeps everything in place when I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> I use it every night because it&#x27;s so comfortable</li>
            <li> and I enjoy wearing it at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable for me to wear</li>
            <li> it is soooo comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wake up wrinkle free every day and stay that way.</li>
            <li> Its really comfortable.. with adjustable straps..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable that I forget I have it on until my husband reminds me on weekend mornings.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> The Intimia breast pillow is comfortable and gives the support and keeps the wrinkle look from appearing.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear and it doesn&#x27;t impede your sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable</li>
            <li> I am a stomach sleeper, and the cushion is comfortable to wear when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I also use a light moisturiser on my chest b4 going to bed and this also helps.</li>
            <li> To be honest, even if it wasn&#x27;t fighting wrinkles I would still wear it because something about it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> my chest wrinkles were way more pronounced in the morning- especially after a particularly good night of sleep.</li>
            <li> But I still have 2 lines which are higher where the pillow gets slimmer at the top so it has not reached there....</li>
            <li> Definately worth it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous this every large breasted women should have one :-)</li>
            <li> I have a large bust 34DDD and it has made sleeping so much more comfortable</li>
            <li> Like a bra would and there is no way to clean it.  </li>
            <li> The pillow itself is super comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very comfortable - really truly, it is - and I can wear it all night with no problems and sometimes lots of tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> but it may be more significant for someone who isn&#x27;t very flexible.  </li>
            <li> I think these companies such as Intimia and Chest Savers have the best intentions of helping women get rid of their chest wrinkles, and I&#x27;m sure what you&#x27;re really buying is the quality, but do they really have to charge so much?</li>
            <li> For $50, I will give it much more time to see what it does for real wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Although very pricey in my opinion, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this pillow to others, not only for wrinkle prevention, but comfortable side sleeping during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Fabric is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> i love it very much&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Comfortable for sleep and useful after breast surgery however a bit bulky</li>
            <li> That one would lose its stickiness so quick and one side or both would start flapping around and didn&#x27;t help my chest creasing.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I gave this gift to myself and have been enjoying deeper, more restful sleep.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pregnant at the moment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comfortable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important to properly adjust the pillow&#x27;s straps to make sure you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> its pretty comfortable and I have no problem with the strap.</li>
            <li> Nope, it doesn&#x27;t make me hot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32DD, and this is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> : After several years of using this pillow, I can confidently attest to its ability to prevent chest wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first night I used it!</li>
            <li> It is soft to the touch and feels like a synthetic satin which is totally fine!</li>
            <li> Too large to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am a full B cup and it stays right in place, right where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I actually find it more comfortable sleeping on my side with this pillow &amp;#34;supporting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wake up feeling more like my old self and the wrinkles are almost non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of summer dresses and swim suits anymore.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I discovered this early on</li>
            <li> Light fitting  and all the lines simply disappear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is eliminating all wrinkles, or preventing them, but it is just keeping my chest nice and flat so that they aren&#x27;t as noticable.</li>
            <li> because if I don&#x27;t have it nestled the right way, there are wrinkles when I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I found the Intimia Pillow on Amazon and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> This pillow was very well made, I clean it with</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t move around at all and are very large breasted it might work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a comfortable breast pillow and easy to use for sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged very well with a cute little bag.</li>
            <li> I am also pregnant, but needed it anyway due to having a larger chest, but this has also helped me sleep a bit better, more comfortably and with confidence that I can wake up to no chest wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I recommend for all large breast ladies!    </li>
            <li> To be honest, I haven&#x27;t really noticed that big of a difference in the look, but where has this been all my life?  </li>
            <li> I will say it was more comfortable than I expected, but it moved no matter how I secured it and did not stay where it needed to be in order to prevent wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My chest feels very soft and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> Moves around too much and very hot.</li>
            <li> I find it very comfortable, especially when it&#x27;s that time of the month</li>
            <li> I have to say that my husband started laughing when he saw it, but it is working quite well, so he can laugh all he wants.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I would have invented this!  </li>
            <li> so I will give it much more time and come back to adjust my review, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, something that adheres to the skin would do a better job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money, it really works</li>
            <li> You just have to adjust the straps to your comfort the first time you put it on, then slip it on and off accordingly.</li>
            <li> First these bras do work.  </li>
            <li> I find I&#x27;m getting a deeper, more restful sleep because of not having to worry about creating deep wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you cant exactly hide the fact that youre wearing it..</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> The pillow is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Glad the copany tried to put soemthing out to help with this problem, but they need to go back to the drawing board with this.</li>
            <li> I thought it was so funny when I saw this.</li>
            <li> I think it could be a slimmer shape therefor the breasts would be much more supported, and as it is now you have to constantly ajust it into the crease line of the breast.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the intimia breast pillow to anyone who is interested in this product.</li>
            <li> This pillow definitely works better than rolling up a towel and sleeping that way.</li>
            <li> At first I looooved this product.  </li>
            <li> works well, although it makes me too hot sometimes.</li>
            <li> I look noticeably better, but the wrinkles around my upper chest/ collarbones are still there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would work good on a lighter chested lady, but if you are heavy chested I would give this one a miss.</li>
            <li> I used to spend the better part of my nights tossing and turning and holding a pillow tightly against me in the hopes of keeping wrinkle free in the cleavage area.  </li>
            <li> What a simple, common sense, great invention!</li>
            <li> Pillow is just the right firmness to work and be comfortable at the same time.  </li>
            <li> As long as your wearing a tank top or bandeau type bra it will stay in.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been extremely pleased with this product and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> If you have the same problem, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but if you don¬¥t have large breasts it can move around a bit.</li>
            <li> I have large breast</li>
            <li> would very highly recommend this pillow.</li>
            <li> Not only is this breast pillow super soft and comfortable, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> I am able to wear the low cut shirts when I like, and I feel completely confident, I wish they also made other products!!  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Intimia Breast Pillow several months ago after reading a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> its comfortable to wear I guess expecting it to totally keep wrinkles away was a bit much for one product.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally use with the d√©collet√© silicone pad, which works amazing together, but it not necessary.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> I am a real customer and even tho</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really feel it when I have it on at night.</li>
            <li> Very well made and does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> but unfortunatly i have not made it through one whole night wearing it.  </li>
            <li> This really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work.  </li>
            <li> Cannot wear it straps are horrible....way too much money and cant even use it.  </li>
            <li> There are no fasteners to dig into my skin, and the silky pillow rests gently on my sternum.  </li>
            <li> The stretchy adjustable straps stay in place all night, no matter how much I move.  </li>
            <li> I have been a side sleeper my whole life...</li>
            <li> but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so big that it&#x27;s bothersome, but big enough to cuddle with and get some great sleep.</li>
            <li> The pillow moves too much, thus changing the position of the straps.  </li>
            <li> crossover design really did separate.  </li>
            <li> It also helps me to sleep on my front if I want to, without feeling my breast is in the way too much.</li>
            <li> This pillow really works and I wish I had known about it before developing the creases between my breasts.  </li>
            <li> Good idea, clumsy design.</li>
            <li> Very well done with high quality material.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pillow 3 yrs ago direct from the Intimia company  when I first started noticing my chest wrinkles.</li>
            <li> new design is about 50% larger than the original.</li>
            <li> After regularly wearing the Intimia, I can understand how it could benefit nursing, pregnant or post-surgical women, as well.  </li>
            <li> I &#x27;m using for prevention, however I recommended it to an older friend and she has seen results too</li>
            <li> /&gt;Observation: It less comfortable in hot or humid weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable and because I do not have large breasts, it actually pushes/separates my breasts so much that I wonder if it&#x27;s doing more harm than good.  </li>
            <li> While the craftsmanship appears to be high quality</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone concerned about chest wrinkels.</li>
            <li> I do however find it quite high to the neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold, and highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The price is too high for it being a so-so, product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that the little pillow will soften up over time, and I love the fact that you can wash it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, in a lingerie laundry bag and drip dry, it is a breeze to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Also, living in Florida and geting hot in the middle of the night I was really worried about it....</li>
            <li> I am 48 and normally sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> If it works, it is worth this annoyance and I am holding out hope that long-term use will prevent further wrinkle development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew creams alone would be a waste of time and deliberated about the pillow as had been using a similiar one purchased  4  yrs ago(different manufacturer) which had seen better days.  </li>
            <li> Only other draw back is that it is not the cutest \\&quot;sleepwear\\&quot; item, but I am fine with that overalll, it is easily put on or taken off under my night time cami.  </li>
            <li> If you skip a night, those sleep wrinkles will be right back.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the high cost - even with the good quality, it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
            <li> The pillow does move a little during the night but it doesn&#x27;t move completely still keeping my breasts somehow separated from each other, making it much more comfortable to sleep.</li>
            <li> I guess they depend on you spending another $60 plus shipping to get a new one.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have new &#x27;wrinkles&#x27; now.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I really had to adjust the straps to make it fit properly, so if you&#x27;re a really tiny person, this may be too large for you</li>
            <li> Over time, all of this early stage wrinkling is going to set in and become permanent!</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that actually works and is comfortable</li>
            <li> All of the lines that I had on my chest from sleeping on my side are completely gone!</li>
            <li> For the first time in years I wake up without big creases on my chest.  </li>
            <li> I found I became extra hot while wearing it during the night and had to remove it.</li>
            <li> In the first week of wearing it I saw a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Last night was my first night with the pillow</li>
            <li> my other laundry-throw it into the wash and dryer (probably not supposed to clean it this way)</li>
            <li> it is not flat with a dome but more like looking down the length of a football</li>
            <li> so not sure if it would be as effective for bigger busted ladies</li>
            <li> I am large busted and do not think it comes up to my collarbone far enough.  </li>
            <li> At last I found something that really works.</li>
            <li> I am 38 yrs old and a 36DD.</li>
            <li> For the reviewers that said it worked the next day... really???</li>
            <li> (stretchy straps and soft material)</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and have no chest wrinkles because of this product.</li>
            <li> When I tried this pillow for the first time, it felt a wee bit strange, but now I can&#x27;t sleep without it.</li>
            <li> They only lasted around a month or two and at $25 a pop that adds up fast.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using collagen cream which was directed by the oz show, so that may be the reason I really havent seen a big decrease-</li>
            <li> I only wish I had found it so much</li>
            <li> Although I really really like this, it does look hideous wearing it, so I only put it on at the last minute when I&#x27;m ready to hit the sack.</li>
            <li> The material is soft and the straps aren&#x27;t bothersome.</li>
            <li> The pillow is a soft satin cushion.  </li>
            <li> The material is veeeeery soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the sensitive skin of the bottom of my breast.</li>
            <li> I wish the straps were as soft as the pillow.</li>
            <li> I am a side sleeper and have been trying to train myself to sleep on my back, with limited success.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to get a few little wrinkles on my chest which are more prominent if I get a little sun.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so bulky and look so ridiculous under my pajamas, so unless you&#x27;re putting this on right before you get into bed and removing it before you get up for a morning coffee, forget about sleepovers with friends or family.</li>
            <li> I wash mine in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle, and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the original was small and flexible enough this didn&#x27;t matter so much, the new larger size means it does not stay in place during the night; a definite design flaw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheaply made, so I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish it worked as well as the silk pad product because that is expensive and does not last long where this product is a great value.  </li>
            <li> I still have my original one and usually wear</li>
            <li> I have major chest wrinkles and had been searching for something to improve it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to use a super emollient moisturizer to make them less obvious.  </li>
            <li> A little line from a strap is different from a big crease from where a breast was crushing into another breast</li>
            <li> It works, and it is barely felt.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t prevent creases near the shoulder or upper neck area.</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have found it 10 years ago before my wrinkles developed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but the product had proven to be very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent side-sleeper, and at 40D, it can get uncomfortable up top when it all squooshes together.  </li>
            <li> This little pillow does exactly what it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When my boob folds over the pillow as I&#x27;m sleeping on my side, I now have a &#x27;sleep-wrong wrinkle&#x27; down the middle of each breast as well as the real cleavage wrinkles in the middle.</li>
            <li> So, not only is this thig super ackward and uncomfortable, it simply does not work and because it is so bukly, new lines began to form.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is far from inconspicuous and awkward is not necessarily a huge issue, but I also found that it was only effective for wrinkles in the cleavage area and not the entire chest area which is what I have problems with.</li>
            <li> I will say that it has a funny smell to it initially, but after cleaning it and letting it dry outside, I hardly notice the smell at all.  </li>
            <li> The truth is, no piece of clothing is high enough and tight enough to hold the upper half of this breast pillow against your decolletage to prevent wrinkling.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the top of the cushion is a bit high on the chest, but its not too annoying.</li>
            <li> I was soooooooo skeptical as to how comfortable it would be because bras kill me and I can&#x27;t wait to take them off at night so putting something else on worried me.....  </li>
            <li> On a normal bra, I usually have the straps towards the loosest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as long as you can stand to have it strapped to your chest all night  long.</li>
            <li> Within weeks though it is so stretched out that it ends up improperly placed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was a much bigger deal than I expected.</li>
            <li> At the beginning I felt weird using it, but after my first month I start seeing results, no wrinkles on my chest!!</li>
            <li> This recent one is much larger than the previous.</li>
            <li> If you pull them to tight, by morning they have left marks on your shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> As such, it doesn&#x27;t stay in place as well as the other.</li>
            <li> ...just don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy one!</li>
            <li> awhile(hang dry takes a couple</li>
            <li> Decreased my existing wrinkles, and prevents new wrinkles from forming!!!  </li>
            <li> right at all...very dissapointed don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> and it needs hand washing every other week, so considering the price I expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> Only one little thing, and</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but the elastics cause your upper shoulder muscles to get tight, then your neck tightens, and by morning you wake with a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> The bras design goes under the breasts and over the shoulders so there is no movement of the center part.  </li>
            <li> I try to be careful mixing sunshine and V-neck</li>
            <li> I eventually had to scissor off the elastic straps, and try to tuck into a sports bra that had spaghetti straps placed wide.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really rocket science on how to get rid of chest wrinkles....</li>
            <li> It kept my breasts apart but did not keep the skin in the center from bunching up while side sleeping.</li>
            <li> But that said, so far, the product works as described and I do feel it has made a difference - no more creases in the morning!</li>
            <li> so it does not fit flat against the body, but balloons out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand it when I&#x27;m lying on my side and my breasts touch each other.</li>
            <li> I am not interested in fillers but may eventually resort to Retin A to rebuild the collagen from age and sun damage from years past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may work for other people, but it just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I tried some other products but had to keep replacing..</li>
            <li> (like other stick on options)</li>
            <li> Not sexy but totally gets the job done!</li>
            <li> not only helpes with prevention wrinkles, but also gives you a unbelievable support for your breasts</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> An athletic bra with a rolled up washcloth didn&#x27;t stay in place for me, and I&#x27;ve passed up buying other items that are supposed to keep cleavage from creasing.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s not exactly flattering (at all), the kids have asked &#x27;what is that&#x27;, but...</li>
            <li> The biggest disappointment was that it made my chest wrinkles worse more toward my neck!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it would erase existing wrinkles but definitely prevents them.  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit high but less expensive versions don&#x27;t appear to have straps - you definitely need straps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3, average build, and I have the straps as small as possible).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sleeping really well with mine, it has decreased a few lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff now, but I&#x27;ve only had it a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s so uncomfortable and just moves around too much during the night.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is it is quite pricey for what it is....</li>
            <li> After speaking with my dermatologist and learning how much it would cost me to fix them with cosmetic injections, I knew there had to be a less expensive solution.</li>
            <li> but if you look down the length of it</li>
            <li> I had been sleeping in a sports bra and stuffing rolled socks down there to prevent these, but it was not doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> Dinged one star because it does wear down at the seams too soon</li>
            <li> and if they don&#x27;t buy it, I think (to myself) that they are crazy to use other products without trying this one first.  </li>
            <li> I am also using doTERRA Anti-Aging products to help with previously acquired wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I do have to adjust the straps every night and the pillow does slip slightly.</li>
            <li> It separates those girls like they need to be, and as a result, my chest wrinkles are a lot less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> far the only thing I have found that works for me are the Calvet Decollette Pads and although the wrinkles do not go away, they are certainly minimized and do not look awful when I wake up.</li>
            <li> After about 4 or so months of nightly wearing, the wrinkles are gone, no special creams (except now</li>
            <li> on e b a y to save a little on shipping.  </li>
            <li> This little pillow works wonders to keep everything in place in any position.  </li>
            <li> and though it does bulk out a little bit..</li>
            <li> it is a little bulky</li>
            <li> It took a little bit of getting use to</li>
            <li> This little pillow did the trick.  </li>
            <li> I wish the cushion was little firmer.</li>
            <li> I like the pillow, but it is I really pricey and does get dirty --</li>
            <li> After a few nights the chest creases have started to diminish.</li>
            <li> I am a side sleeper &amp; hated my boobs touching.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wasted $50.  </li>
            <li> Frankly,  I never wear this, it&#x27;s plain old uncomfortable,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just noticed the chest wrinkles this past year that don&#x27;t go away after a few hours of waking up.</li>
            <li> I am 36 and I&#x27;ve been noticing some wrinkles between my breasts in the past few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve don&#x27;t usually write product review, but I just had to share that this product works.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small issue for me</li>
            <li> After noticing the usual sleep wrinkles not going away...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month.</li>
            <li> No more morning wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just past the 30-year mark</li>
            <li> However within the past month of moisturing and using this pillow the lines are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> Usually wake up with tons of chest wrinkles but that is no more!</li>
            <li> and maybe that&#x27;s why hardly any of the reviews mention this.</li>
            <li> Putting on at night really isn&#x27;t a hard ship as stated by one reviewer.</li>
            <li> I also tried another product but it was a hard plastic thing that didn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li> My chest wrinkles started to appear in my late thirties.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works for sleep wrinkles - you know, those lines you get on your face when you sleep wrong, but not REAL permanent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at least 3 or 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> I want to state that I do not own the intima bra</li>
            <li> The only issue is that you might feel a bit awkward wearing it.  </li>
            <li> Being larger chested (32 DD+, I was very skeptical).</li>
            <li> I found the product a little bit expensive to purchase.</li>
            <li> I do find it to be a little uncomfortable,  but it works well</li>
            <li> My chest wrinkles were so bad and deep, I had taken to wearing shirt buttoned up and turtlenecks.</li>
            <li> am so disappointed because I thought I finally had the answer to the \\&quot;sleeping-on-side, chest wrinkles\\&quot; issue.  </li>
            <li> Before I found this breast pillow, I tried the silicone sticky thing, and it was awful, left an itchy rash and not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> is irritating.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would argue it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable but the fact is it did not work in the least!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid as least in my case.  </li>
            <li> It is so very uncomfortable and i end up taking it off half way through the night!!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this item would be uncomfortable or bulky, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> sorry to say.</li>
            <li> It does work but the pillow is bulky and uncomfortable to wear while sleeping on your side/stomach</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> You get results from this product, but it&#x27;s too bulky and uncomfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and makes me sweaty</li>
            <li> Go for it ladies; you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product</li>
            <li> When I forget to use it or fall asleep before putting it on, I REGRET it the next morning when I see horrible wrinkles from sleeping on my side!!</li>
            <li> i bit expensive to buy when you dont know  if it works</li>
            <li> If the straps are pulled tighter, it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the product before I bought it</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a solution</li>
            <li> I always sleep on my side and my chest wrinkles were just getting worse!!</li>
            <li> but now I feel uncomfortable sleeping without it!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and for me it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it looks silly on, but he loves that I don&#x27;t have the ugly cleavage wrinkles!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing a camisole, bra, socks, whatever to sleep in.</li>
            <li> but feels like it&#x27;s strangling you and gets annoying.</li>
            <li> and my breasts are very painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the pillow, but it is I really pricey and does get dirty -- Like a bra would and there is no way to clean it.  I guess they depend on you spending another $60 plus shipping to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Strapping this thing on every night is the last thing I feel like doing.  I am going to modify the straps with some velcrow to make it easier to get on and off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it every night since I got it about 4w ago but I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t work like the pad.  It keeps the breasts in place but it doesn&#x27;t prevent the decolette to get wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after seeing Dr. Oz talk about it.  I am a side sleeper and have been trying to train myself to sleep on my back, with limited success.  I was concerned that this item would be uncomfortable or bulky, but it isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s pretty comfortable.  I have to say that my husband started laughing when he saw it, but it is working quite well, so he can laugh all he wants.  I feel like I can sleep on my side again without being as concerned about those ugly chest wrinkles.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because if I don&#x27;t have it nestled the right way, there are wrinkles when I get up in the morning.  But overall, it works well.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good idea, clumsy design. Only way to get this on or off is by pulling it over one&#x27;s head. Also, and perhaps it has to do with the crisscrossed strap design, I wind up choked by this item if I roll over in my sleep. Frankly,  I never wear this, it&#x27;s plain old uncomfortable,  sorry to say.</li>
            <li> sent it back doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> I am a real customer and even tho I didn&#x27;t buy it here on Amazon but on e b a y to save a little on shipping.  I have size 32 G breasts because of weight gain and this is AWESOME!  I was soooooooo skeptical as to how comfortable it would be because bras kill me and I can&#x27;t wait to take them off at night so putting something else on worried me.....  This is truly wonderful.  I was spending $30 on the silicone sticky one every 3-4 weeks and was fed up with it.  That one would lose its stickiness so quick and one side or both would start flapping around and didn&#x27;t help my chest creasing.  THANK GOD FOR THIS!!!!  It helps my brest pain AND I wake up wrinkle-less!  Also, living in Florida and geting hot in the middle of the night I was really worried about it....Nope, it doesn&#x27;t make me hot! YES!  Only one little thing, and it is truly ok, is that I wish it were made out of 100% silk because it is really great for skin. But, silk wouldn&#x27;t hold up as well as this would.  It is soft to the touch and feels like a synthetic satin which is totally fine! Plus with this pillow you can wear your moisturizer and just hand wash whenever you feel it needs it.  Also, the straps are well done and you cannot feel this once you get it in place!!!!!! I really wish I would have invented this!  5 STARS!!!!!!!! IT IS WORTH 59!!!!!!  BUT PLEASE DON&#x27;T RAISE THE PRICE INTIMIA!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me - I&#x27;m a side sleeper and this pillow did not keep my skin taut enough to prevent wrinkling.</li>
            <li> Go with the d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; silc skin pad. This just does not get it done and it is wat overpriced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve don&#x27;t usually write product review, but I just had to share that this product works. Seems so simple, but it does work. I&#x27;ve used it for 1 day and already saw a huge difference. I woke up with no chest wrinkles after 1 use. It works!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months. My chest wrinkles had disappeared and i sleep better than ever before. I was skeptical at first, but the product had proven to be very useful. I truly enjoy wearing it every night. Additionally, it makes for a great gift for all my friends.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well for me. It&#x27;s very comfortable and I don&#x27;t really feel it when I have it on at night. I am no longer concerned about my chest wrinkles as I am a side sleeper. My wrinkles are gone. I also like the overall product quality. My only wish was to have a choice of colors. Great Product!</li>
            <li> At last I found something that really works. I am 48 and normally sleep on my side. My chest wrinkles started to appear in my late thirties. I am so happy I&#x27;d discovered Intimia Pillow because the results are amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for seven days and my wrinkles are noticeably diminished. I can&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. And the best thing I don&#x27;t need to purchase it every month. Thank you, the inventors!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use this thing every night. I can&#x27;t stand it when I&#x27;m lying on my side and my breasts touch each other. This keeps them separated and is very comfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> Very well made and does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I only with I&#x27;d bought it sooner.  Happy chest wrinkle free mornings.</li>
            <li> After a few nights the chest creases have started to diminish. It is very comfortable</li>
            <li> It does work but the pillow is bulky and uncomfortable to wear while sleeping on your side/stomach</li>
            <li> I am 38 yrs old and a 36DD. I&#x27;ve just noticed the chest wrinkles this past year that don&#x27;t go away after a few hours of waking up. I am not interested in fillers but may eventually resort to Retin A to rebuild the collagen from age and sun damage from years past.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the pillow for a month so I will give it much more time and come back to adjust my review, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. For the reviewers that said it worked the next day... really??? Yes, it works for sleep wrinkles - you know, those lines you get on your face when you sleep wrong, but not REAL permanent wrinkles. If you skip a night, those sleep wrinkles will be right back. In fact, I have new &#x27;wrinkles&#x27; now. When my boob folds over the pillow as I&#x27;m sleeping on my side, I now have a &#x27;sleep-wrong wrinkle&#x27; down the middle of each breast as well as the real cleavage wrinkles in the middle. My husband says that you can&#x27;t see those wrinkles when you have a shirt on and maybe that&#x27;s why hardly any of the reviews mention this. Out of sight, out of mind? I just hope those boob wrinkles don&#x27;t become permanent like my cleavage wrinkles have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is annoying/uncomfortable. The bra itself is comfortable (stretchy straps and soft material) BUT to have it strapped to you while trying to fall asleep is irritating. If it works, it is worth this annoyance and I am holding out hope that long-term use will prevent further wrinkle development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t see how this will fit on a petite woman. The straps seem to be catered towards the overweight. I am a size 8-10 and I have the straps towards the smallest setting! On a normal bra, I usually have the straps towards the loosest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I did not want to spend $50. I tried homemade but couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in place all night. This does stay in place. This bra does work on sleep wrinkles. For $50, I will give it much more time to see what it does for real wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I purchased  this based on the reviews as I am a side sleeper and have chest wrinkles. Unfortunately this did not work at all for me. In fact, I would argue it made it worse. So, not only is this thig super ackward and uncomfortable, it simply does not work and because it is so bukly, new lines began to form. Most defifnitely returning this item!&lt;br /&gt;Thus far the only thing I have found that works for me are the Calvet Decollette Pads and although the wrinkles do not go away, they are certainly minimized and do not look awful when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I need to return. Very uncomfortable and for me it doesn&#x27;t work. I even gave it to mom and she felt the same. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The straps are present to help keep the pillow between breasts. But, I find that I still get &amp;quot;folding breast&amp;quot; wrinkles in the morning. Personally, something that adheres to the skin would do a better job. I&#x27;ve used Silcskin, but if you&#x27;re a &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; sleeper, your sweat combined with the decollete pad can cause pimples or heat bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be very happy to find a happy medium between confirmed breast separation and airflow to prevent wrinkles, pimples/itch bumps.</li>
            <li> This is ideal for large breasted women! I&#x27;m a 32DD, and this is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for! It&#x27;s extremely comfortable to wear, and it keeps everything in place when I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at least 3 or 4 years ago. I use it every night because it&#x27;s so comfortable and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It is holding up well, and it has been washed many times. I am 58 years old and have no chest wrinkles because of this product. I can&#x27;t believe it has worked so well. I had wrinkles before, but they disappeared shortly after I started wearing the pillow. Before I found this breast pillow, I tried the silicone sticky thing, and it was awful, left an itchy rash and not comfortable.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely higher quality than I expected. It&#x27;s not cheaply made, so I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time. My only problem is that I really had to adjust the straps to make it fit properly, so if you&#x27;re a really tiny person, this may be too large for you (FYI: I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3, average build, and I have the straps as small as possible). But that said, so far, the product works as described and I do feel it has made a difference - no more creases in the morning! Over time, I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if the more permanent lines fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the high cost - even with the good quality, it&#x27;s overpriced. A  variety of colors would also be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After several years of using this pillow, I can confidently attest to its ability to prevent chest wrinkles! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Still holding up well after consistent use over many years :)</li>
            <li> I love this pillow!!! I&#x27;m 40 and I&#x27;m starting to get a few little wrinkles on my chest which are more prominent if I get a little sun. In the morning when I get up I have a wrinkly chest which goes away after about 30 minutes but still concerns me. Over time, all of this early stage wrinkling is going to set in and become permanent! I got a 60 SPF baby sunscreen that I am starting to use on my chest during the day and I got this wonderful pillow for night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable - really truly, it is - and I can wear it all night with no problems and sometimes lots of tossing and turning. I am a full B cup and it stays right in place, right where it is supposed to. I actually find it more comfortable sleeping on my side with this pillow &amp;#34;supporting&amp;#34; me than with my chest smooshing in on itself. In the morning I DO NOT have chest wrinkles. Periodically I&#x27;ll have some sleep lines from the straps of the pillow but they aren&#x27;t in my V-neckline area and they go away shortly. A little line from a strap is different from a big crease from where a breast was crushing into another breast all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would very highly recommend this pillow. It is high-quality, comfortable, easy to use, stays in place and does its job.</li>
            <li> It is brilliant I love it! Absolutely fabulous this every large breasted women should have one :-) I&#x27;m sleeping really well with mine, it has decreased a few lines. But I still have 2 lines which are higher where the pillow gets slimmer at the top so it has not reached there....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now. It was recommended by a friend. So far I am very happy with the results - my chest wrinkles are gradually disappearing. Overall it&#x27;s comfortable to sleep in and I enjoy wearing it at night. I must say it took my husband some time getting used to it, but he is very supportive now. I also like the product quality and the attention to details. Hope my review is helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it does the job it is supposed to do but unfortunatly i have not made it through one whole night wearing it.  It is so very uncomfortable and i end up taking it off half way through the night!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!  Great  immediate  results!  Very happy with Intimia.  Not like Kush pillow- It stays in place and very comfortable</li>
            <li> I am only 37 with 36b breasts but I have been dealing with chest wrinkles for the last 7 years.  In the last several months I would wake up with discomfort in the skin of my upper chest along with deeply wrinkled, red skin.  I&#x27;d have to use a super emollient moisturizer to make them less obvious.  I was desperate to find a solution so I started researching and this product came up.  I have been very pleased with its performance.  I wake up feeling more like my old self and the wrinkles are almost non-existent.  I don&#x27;t believe this product can \\&quot;cure\\&quot; wrinkles but my results have been terrific.  It&#x27;s comfortable for me to wear but it&#x27;s a bit tricky to get off without having to adjust everything.  That&#x27;s a small issue for me but it may be more significant for someone who isn&#x27;t very flexible.  I am very satisfied and plan to buy another.</li>
            <li> I am a side sleeper &amp; hated my boobs touching. This is excellent and very comfortable. The decrease in chest wrinkles is a wonderful bonus. I noticed a difference the first night I used it! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> well it is just okay I&#x27;m afraid as least in my case.  I wish it worked as well as the silk pad product because that is expensive and does not last long where this product is a great value.  It just did not work as well for me and I&#x27;m busty so perhaps better for not so.</li>
            <li> Even after a couple nights it seemed the wrinkles on my chest were reduced.  Probably from eliminating the creasing during my sleep.  I bought this in anticipation of an event next year to allow time for results.  I am also using doTERRA Anti-Aging products to help with previously acquired wrinkles.  My initial thoughts are it is going to help.</li>
            <li> I been using the Breast  pillow for 2 weeks , and Iam really happy with it. It&#x27;s well worth the money, it really works</li>
            <li> This little pillow does exactly what it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I am a side-sleeper, and a 32DD, so my chest wrinkles were way more pronounced in the morning- especially after a particularly good night of sleep. The wrinkles look noticably better. I don&#x27;t think it is eliminating all wrinkles, or preventing them, but it is just keeping my chest nice and flat so that they aren&#x27;t as noticable. It&#x27;s a little stiff now, but I&#x27;ve only had it a couple weeks. I&#x27;m thinking that the little pillow will soften up over time, and I love the fact that you can wash it. All around I love it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious about spending the money for this breast pillow, but now I have, I&#x27;m really glad I did. I always sleep on my side and my chest wrinkles were just getting worse!! When I tried this pillow for the first time, it felt a wee bit strange, but now I can&#x27;t sleep without it. I find it very comfortable, especially when it&#x27;s that time of the month and my breasts are very painful. Putting on at night really isn&#x27;t a hard ship as stated by one reviewer. You just have to adjust the straps to your comfort the first time you put it on, then slip it on and off accordingly. Simple, no stress!&lt;br /&gt;Using this has definitely improved my chest wrinkles. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using the d√©collet√© pads for almost 4 years now.  They only lasted around a month or two and at $25 a pop that adds up fast.  I also tried another product but it was a hard plastic thing that didn&#x27;t work that well.  I recently notice that the d√©collet√© pad was not helping with wrinkles that were starting to appear on under my clavicles.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided I would try out one of these wrinkle bras.  I want to state that I do not own the intima bra but I have one that is almost the same.  I purchased the Anti Wrinkle Bra.  The only difference I can tell is that mine is a slimmer design.  First these bras do work.  You would think just using a roll of towels or socks might work the same but they will slip out of place while you sleep.  The bras design goes under the breasts and over the shoulders so there is no movement of the center part.  The only issue is that you might feel a bit awkward wearing it.  My boyfriend laughed and made a comment I can&#x27;t state here but now just calls it the &amp;#34;breasteses pillow&amp;#34;.  To be honest I&#x27;m just relieved to not wake up stressing out about wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I got it because I saw some sun damage (being from FL and always out in the sun) and saw some thing on Dr Oz to prevent the wrinkles in the chest area. To be honest, I haven&#x27;t really noticed that big of a difference in the look, but where has this been all my life?  it is soooo comfortable. I have a large bust 34DDD and it has made sleeping so much more comfortable so I dont care if it does what I want it to... I have not been using collagen cream which was directed by the oz show, so that may be the reason I really havent seen a big decrease- I didnt even think I would be able to use it all night- I hate wearing a camisole, bra, socks, whatever to sleep in. I wake up and have to take off... but not with this. Love love love</li>
            <li> Although very pricey in my opinion, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this pillow to others, not only for wrinkle prevention, but comfortable side sleeping during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I was using an athletic bra and a sock...but it didn&#x27;t work as well as this pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I had used silc skin which is a costly route, paying for the stick ons. Those work but only for about 2 weeks and stuff gets stuck in the silicone. Ew! This pillow is washable. I only wish I had found it so much sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up now since I&#x27;m a side sleeper without the chest lines. But what I also think is key is that I use a concoction of eight hour skin cream (from Elizabeth Arden) over a peptide serum -on my chest before putting on the breast pillow. You gotta give your decollete area just as much attention as your neck and face-if you want it to look great.</li>
            <li> I used to spend the better part of my nights tossing and turning and holding a pillow tightly against me in the hopes of keeping wrinkle free in the cleavage area.  This little pillow works wonders to keep everything in place in any position.  I find I&#x27;m getting a deeper, more restful sleep because of not having to worry about creating deep wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quality made and feels like it&#x27;ll last a lifetime.  Although I really really like this, it does look hideous wearing it, so I only put it on at the last minute when I&#x27;m ready to hit the sack.</li>
            <li> Too large to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for about 3 years now after seeing it demo-ed on Dr Oz.. Yes, it DOES get rid of wrinkles. My chest wrinkles were so bad and deep, I had taken to wearing shirt buttoned up and turtlenecks. Being larger chested (32 DD+, I was very skeptical). After about 4 or so months of nightly wearing, the wrinkles are gone, no special creams (except now I try to be careful mixing sunshine and V-neck tops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observation: It less comfortable in hot or humid weather. the shiny material is kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design is about 50% larger than the original. I thought it would be a good thing but if you look down the length of it it is not flat with a dome but more like looking down the length of a football so it does not fit flat against the body, but balloons out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the original was small and flexible enough this didn&#x27;t matter so much, the new larger size means it does not stay in place during the night; a definite design flaw. I still have my original one and usually wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, in a lingerie laundry bag and drip dry, it is a breeze to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Works great and really does help with chest wrinkles, but it looks super goofy. My husband laughs and rolls his eyes every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend. Doesn&#x27;t hold and I am a size A. Socks or a homemade hanky can give you the same result. Money to the wind!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but the elastics cause your upper shoulder muscles to get tight, then your neck tightens, and by morning you wake with a horrible headache. I tried sewing and redesigning the straps, but to no avail. I eventually had to scissor off the elastic straps, and try to tuck into a sports bra that had spaghetti straps placed wide. The truth is, no piece of clothing is high enough and tight enough to hold the upper half of this breast pillow against your decolletage to prevent wrinkling. I still have yet to figure out how to use this pillow.</li>
            <li> It may work for other people, but it just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. Plus it slid around a lot at night.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Sounded good at the time. I guess if you don&#x27;t move around at all and are very large breasted it might work.</li>
            <li> Can not sleep without it now. Worried my wrinkles will start to come back again. Almost like a security blanket.</li>
            <li> its comfortable to wear I guess expecting it to totally keep wrinkles away was a bit much for one product. It does however greatly reduce them. Im still using mine.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is on the pricey side, it does what is says it does (the best out of 4 products tried).  My chest has a reduction in lines!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever!!! Have been using for about a year.. After noticing the usual sleep wrinkles not going away...I tried some other products but had to keep replacing.. This thing is here to stay.. Totally worth the money. I wake up wrinkle free every day and stay that way. Its really comfortable.. with adjustable straps..  and though it does bulk out a little bit.. and you cant exactly hide the fact that youre wearing it..(like other stick on options), it means I can go out every day confident and wrinkle free. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  This really works!  However, as with everything, you must be diligent about wearing it.  Thank God my husband doesn&#x27;t mind my wearing it.  LOL</li>
            <li> i used this every night for a while we recently moved and have not started using again but it is very comfortable i can not feel it there it is a little bulky but i dont mind.</li>
            <li> You get results from this product, but it&#x27;s too bulky and uncomfortable to sleep in.  The bottom strap does not stay in place during the night.</li>
            <li> I love it. My chest feels very soft and smooth in the morning. It is more comfortable to sleep with it than without it.</li>
            <li> Decreased my existing wrinkles, and prevents new wrinkles from forming!!!  Would recommend to any side sleeper. Very comfortable to sleep with..</li>
            <li> Not sexy but totally gets the job done!</li>
            <li> The pillow is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This simple pillow is wonderful.  It truly works.  I use it along with Bellini chest pad and I wake up with out the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I see no improvement in my d√©collet√©. None.  However, this pillow has increased my sleeping comfort level somewhat, about the same as using a rolled up tea towel between the breasts. This could be good for maintenance but did not resolve my problem.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea for preventing these ugli wrinkles! I wear it every night and don&#x27;t notice it during sleep. I like to look into the mirror every morning!!! Very well done with high quality material. Many regards from Germany!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Es ist eine gro√üartige Idee, auf diese Weise die h√§√ülichen Falten zu vermeiden. Ich trage es jede Nacht, man f√ºhlt es im Schlaf gar nicht.  - und ich mag es, morgens in den Spiegel zu gucken! Sehr hochwertige Herstellung. Viele Gr√º√üe aus Deutschland!</li>
            <li> I am 36 and I&#x27;ve been noticing some wrinkles between my breasts in the past few months. Since I started to use Intimia Breast Pillow I wake up without wrinkles, simple as that! If you have the same problem, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly impressed with the Intimia breast pillow. First of all, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so bulky and look so ridiculous under my pajamas, so unless you&#x27;re putting this on right before you get into bed and removing it before you get up for a morning coffee, forget about sleepovers with friends or family. The fact that it is far from inconspicuous and awkward is not necessarily a huge issue, but I also found that it was only effective for wrinkles in the cleavage area and not the entire chest area which is what I have problems with. Furthermore, if I lay on my back I feel like this thing chokes me.  While the craftsmanship appears to be high quality this product is overall not for me so I&#x27;m returning it and am going to try the more obscure ChestSaver.</li>
            <li> It may have been a great product for some but it made my shoulders hurt.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work.  But, it&#x27;s so uncomfortable and just moves around too much during the night.  Wasted $50.  Glad the copany tried to put soemthing out to help with this problem, but they need to go back to the drawing board with this.</li>
            <li> My wife wears it ever night. Very comfortable</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and makes me sweaty</li>
            <li> This breast pillow is everything it claims to be.  It works, and it is barely felt.  My husband thinks it looks silly on, but he loves that I don&#x27;t have the ugly cleavage wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a while and use it nightly......but I don&#x27;t think it has done anything for me.  I am large busted and do not think it comes up to my collarbone far enough.  It does help lower towards my cleavage...slightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month. It&#x27;s very uncomfortable and because I do not have large breasts, it actually pushes/separates my breasts so much that I wonder if it&#x27;s doing more harm than good.  I still wake up with chest wrinkles.  I started sleeping with a sports bra on and just placing the pillow between my breasts without &amp;#34;strapping&amp;#34; it on and this is much more comfortable but I can&#x27;t tell if its actually helping or not.  Because I am a side sleeper, I think there&#x27;s no getting away from having chest creases when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> You have to get this !!!  I was paying $40 a month for these adhesive things and this worked just as good !!! Super happy :))))</li>
            <li> I thought it was so funny when I saw this. For years I have been rolling up a face cloth and putting it between my breasts. As long as your wearing a tank top or bandeau type bra it will stay in. My fianc√© and I joke around and call it the titty towel. Save yourself some money and grab a face cloth.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these years ago &amp; really liked it. This recent one is much larger than the previous. As such, it doesn&#x27;t stay in place as well as the other. I will continue to use it; however, the company should have let consumers know that the size was increased.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Intimia Breast Pillow several months ago after reading a lot of positive reviews.  Being a side sleeper and just around the corner of turning 60, I did not like what I saw in the mirror.  Tried a lot of products and even had laser - did not notice a big difference until I bought this product.  I use it every night, even when travelling and have recently purchased my second.  Go for it ladies; you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> The pillow definitely helps to soften existing chest wrinkles.  It&#x27;s so comfortable that I forget I have it on until my husband reminds me on weekend mornings.  The price is a bit high but less expensive versions don&#x27;t appear to have straps - you definitely need straps.</li>
            <li> Cannot wear it straps are horrible....way too much money and cant even use it.  im 5&#x27;7 123lbs and it doesn&#x27;t fit right at all...very dissapointed don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Saw it on dr oz.... Tried it... And it works!!! The only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that actually works and is comfortable</li>
            <li> Works well.  The harness is a big plus.  Be sure to put it in a lingerie bag for washing in machine.  Prevents &amp;#34;uniboob&amp;#34; formation in reconstructed implanted breasts.  Somewhat effective at preventing wrinkles in d√©colletage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to reduce chest wrinkles and came across Intimia breast pillow. I found the product a little bit expensive to purchase. I used the product and found it okay to use. The 1st issue I have is the staps. If you pull them to tight, by morning they have left marks on your shoulders and back. The 2nd issuse would be the shape of the pillow itself. I think it could be a slimmer shape therefor the breasts would be much more supported, and as it is now you have to constantly ajust it into the crease line of the breast. It has reduced my lines by upto 25%, but i think this is because the pillow itself creases and the shape is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would work good on a lighter chested lady, but if you are heavy chested I would give this one a miss.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the intimia breast pillow to anyone who is interested in this product. Definately worth it! Great for anyone showing signs of chest wrinkles, has breast implants or us a side sleeper. Any or all of these reasons are reason to buy this well designed product.</li>
            <li> This is the second pillow I&#x27;ve ordered.I love,love this pillow! The chest wrinkles I had for YEARS disappeared over night! I never knew this was possible!I use it every night. I found after washing, the drying time took awhile(hang dry takes a couple days)and I couldn&#x27;t be without it! The wrinkles were back. I ordered another one for back-up. Years of sun worship and sleeping on my side left me feeling the only resolution was cosmetic surgery.Even considered it! Thank you,Breast Pillow!</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t work well.  Does some preventative but simply does not prevent the lines I wish to remove.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you can stand to have it strapped to your chest all night  long.</li>
            <li> It works well but if you don¬¥t have large breasts it can move around a bit.</li>
            <li> UPDATE in 1/2015:  I used this through out my pregnancy, nursing and still use it today.  I will occasionally use with the d√©collet√© silicone pad, which works amazing together, but it not necessary.  Especially when I just adjust the straps.  I am now almost 40 and have a 36DD, and I have not had any chest wrinkles since I began using this.  I am able to wear the low cut shirts when I like, and I feel completely confident, I wish they also made other products!!  This pillow was very well made, I clean it with my other laundry-throw it into the wash and dryer (probably not supposed to clean it this way) but that is what I have done and it has lasted me for years now.  I will still say that it is not the cutest, most enticing thing to wear when I go to bed, however, my husband doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.  I have had several people ask me about it when I tell them and if they don&#x27;t buy it, I think (to myself) that they are crazy to use other products without trying this one first.  It does go under a sports bra, and when I wear a standard night time bra, I just put this over that bra and it works fine.  Overall, I have been extremely pleased with this product and highly recommend.  I know if and when this one falls apart, I will be purchasing another one!!      I had been using the silicone sticky pad for about a month, and while that worked, it seemed to move around quite a bit, or would come off with moisture-I was still waking up some days with some creases on my decollete.  I tried this and have had no problems with creases or wrinkels yet.  I will say that it has a funny smell to it initially, but after cleaning it and letting it dry outside, I hardly notice the smell at all.  I am also pregnant, but needed it anyway due to having a larger chest, but this has also helped me sleep a bit better, more comfortably and with confidence that I can wake up to no chest wrinkles.  Only other draw back is that it is not the cutest \\&quot;sleepwear\\&quot; item, but I am fine with that overalll, it is easily put on or taken off under my night time cami.  I would highly recommend this to anyone concerned about chest wrinkels.</li>
            <li> I get deep lines from sleeping on my side and I was hopeful this pillow would help.  I will say it was more comfortable than I expected, but it moved no matter how I secured it and did not stay where it needed to be in order to prevent wrinkles.  I&#x27;m thinking that those who like it have larger breasts than I do and that helps keep it in place.  I returned mine within the week.</li>
            <li> Helps keeps wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. I just turned 40 and started to develop deep vertical wrinkles on my chest. After speaking with my dermatologist and learning how much it would cost me to fix them with cosmetic injections, I knew there had to be a less expensive solution. I found the Intimia Pillow on Amazon and ordered it right away. I feel so happy now -  after two weeks of use my chest wrinkles have greatly diminished. I&#x27;m not afraid of summer dresses and swim suits anymore. One last thing - it&#x27;s important to properly adjust the pillow&#x27;s straps to make sure you feel comfortable. Amazing product - amazing results!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best purchase that i ever did ! i hightly recomend for all women, all ages and shape,&lt;br /&gt;it not only helpes with prevention wrinkles, but also gives you a unbelievable support for your breasts&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sleeping much better with it ! i love it !</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  I have tried different methods for my chest wrinkles..this one works!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product does exactly what it says it will do.  Keeps breasts/skin apart at night to prevent lines and sweating.  Fabric is nice and soft.  Would also love one in a cotton fabric too</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as i was hoping. i wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it again.</li>
            <li> I think these companies such as Intimia and Chest Savers have the best intentions of helping women get rid of their chest wrinkles, and I&#x27;m sure what you&#x27;re really buying is the quality, but do they really have to charge so much? It&#x27;s not really rocket science on how to get rid of chest wrinkles....just stick something in between them! For the ladies looking for a cheaper alternative, I recommend the KUSH Support System for only $14.99 or up to $19.99!! Anyway its a great deal and works just as good! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Kush-Support-System-Anti-Wrinkle-Night-Time-Pillow-For-DD-Breast-/261224097443?pt&#x3D;US_Skin_Care&amp;hash&#x3D;item3cd22b66a3</li>
            <li> This pillow added comfort when sleeping.  I had double bypass surgery and as my recovery progressed and sleeping on my side, I felt the need for support of the breast.  I actually tried a rolled up wash cloth but it did not create comfort I was wanting.  The Intimia breast pillow is comfortable and gives the support and keeps the wrinkle look from appearing.</li>
            <li> This pillow definitely works better than rolling up a towel and sleeping that way. I do have to adjust the straps every night and the pillow does slip slightly. But I wouldn&#x27;t go to sleep without it. I do use a side pillow to hold it in place at night and then don&#x27;t wake up with any creases. But it doesn&#x27;t prevent creases near the shoulder or upper neck area.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I&#x27;m a 32ddd and I am so glad I found this.  When I first saw it, I was skeptical.  It does make a difference!  When you sleep on your side, you end up with chest wrinkles in the morning.  With this thing, they are prevented.  It also helps to correct the ones you have.  I even bring it with me when I travel.  This is one of my best purchases ever!  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this beast pillow now for about a week and I am noticing a difference. Some of the lines that were noticeble before seem to be gone.  I think that with this product consistency may be the key factor.  So I am going to keep using it and check in within a month to see if they are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;It is a comfortable breast pillow and easy to use for sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged very well with a cute little bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the pillow for a week and I have seen noticeable results. It is comfortable to wear and it doesn&#x27;t impede your sleep. I do however find it quite high to the neck and you do have to fit the straps so that it&#x27;s very snug in order for it too work with the best results.</li>
            <li> Buying this this was one of the best decisions I ever made. It took a little bit of getting use to but now I feel uncomfortable sleeping without it! All of the lines that I had on my chest from sleeping on my side are completely gone! If you are a side sleeper with larger breasts you NEED to by this product to save your skin from the chest wrinkles (that will give away your age!). I cannot put into words exactly how happy I am with this product. Genius invention.</li>
            <li> It took me quite a while to convince myself that I needed the Intimia Breast Pillow.  I&#x27;m a frequent side-sleeper, and at 40D, it can get uncomfortable up top when it all squooshes together.  An athletic bra with a rolled up washcloth didn&#x27;t stay in place for me, and I&#x27;ve passed up buying other items that are supposed to keep cleavage from creasing.  Finally, I gave this gift to myself and have been enjoying deeper, more restful sleep.  There are no fasteners to dig into my skin, and the silky pillow rests gently on my sternum.  The stretchy adjustable straps stay in place all night, no matter how much I move.  After regularly wearing the Intimia, I can understand how it could benefit nursing, pregnant or post-surgical women, as well.  I&#x27;m sold, and highly recommend this product...just don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy one!</li>
            <li> I have been a side sleeper my whole life...I had never heard of the issue of chest wrinkles until I saw something online about it.  It hink started doing research, and found recommendations for this breast pillow.  I had been sleeping in a sports bra and stuffing rolled socks down there to prevent these, but it was not doing the trick.  Not only is this breast pillow super soft and comfortable, but it really works.  It separates those girls like they need to be, and as a result, my chest wrinkles are a lot less noticeable.  AND it&#x27;s washable :-)  What a simple, common sense, great invention!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product but it really does work.  I have major chest wrinkles and had been searching for something to improve it.  This little pillow did the trick.  It is a bit cumbersome to put on every night but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried this item and didn&#x27;t notice any change at all. It did not keep the skin on my chest from wrinkling up. It kept my breasts apart but did not keep the skin in the center from bunching up while side sleeping. It wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable but the fact is it did not work in the least! And for $60.00 for a bit of satin on some straps I feel totally taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t beleive how great this product works.  It&#x27;s so comfortable you forget it&#x27;s on.  For the first time in years I wake up without big creases on my chest.  I am so impressed with this product.  I only wish I would have found it 10 years ago before my wrinkles developed.</li>
            <li> At first I looooved this product.  Within weeks though it is so stretched out that it ends up improperly placed.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed because I thought I finally had the answer to the \\&quot;sleeping-on-side, chest wrinkles\\&quot; issue.  I am petite though so maybe you will be luckier than I.</li>
            <li> At the beginning I felt weird using it, but after my first month I start seeing results, no wrinkles on my chest!!</li>
            <li> No more morning wrinkle.  I love this pillow and have recommended it to all of my girlfriends.  This is a must have!</li>
            <li> works well, although it makes me too hot sometimes.</li>
            <li> This does just what it boasts.. When I forget to use it or fall asleep before putting it on, I REGRET it the next morning when I see horrible wrinkles from sleeping on my side!! The material is soft and the straps aren&#x27;t bothersome. Great invention and I&#x27;m glad I discovered this early on so I &#x27;m using for prevention, however I recommended it to an older friend and she has seen results too so I think it must be good for any age. Dinged one star because it does wear down at the seams too soon and it needs hand washing every other week, so considering the price I expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> This works great !! Just like it says</li>
            <li> I found the pillow very comfortable. I found I became extra hot while wearing it during the night and had to remove it. I will try using it again after summer. I recommend the pillow as it does what it advertises itself to do, keep wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> Moves around too much and very hot.</li>
            <li> Works if you use it every night- I noticed my chest wrinkles improving. But, after owning mine for 8-10 months it is quite worn out. I decided to just start sleeping on my back.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this about 8 months ago, I thought he was joking, but agreed to give it a try. Honestly, it&#x27;s not exactly flattering (at all), the kids have asked &#x27;what is that&#x27;, but... my chest wrinkles have disappeared. I am a stomach sleeper, and the cushion is comfortable to wear when sleeping.</li>
            <li> i thought it was i bit expensive to buy when you dont know  if it works..&lt;br /&gt;but it does and my wrinkles are gone i love it very much&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This was a much bigger deal than I expected. It went back. I love the silicone pads that you wear at night. Light fitting  and all the lines simply disappear.</li>
            <li> Ever heard of a bone pillow? I&#x27;ve been sleeping with one cuddled between my breasts for years and never had a breast wrinkle. I&#x27;m 45 and size DD. It&#x27;s not so big that it&#x27;s bothersome, but big enough to cuddle with and get some great sleep.</li>
            <li> its pretty comfortable and I have no problem with the strap.</li>
            <li> It sort of works. The pillow moves too much, thus changing the position of the straps.  If the straps are pulled tighter, it&#x27;s uncomfortable. I think it&#x27;s better than nothing. The price is too high for it being a so-so, product.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, nice fabric.  I am a C cup &amp; sometimes feels like it&#x27;s riding up beneath my breasts.  But the best pick I&#x27;ve found so far.  I like the djustable straps.  I look noticeably better, but the wrinkles around my upper chest/ collarbones are still there.  Probably need to learn to start sleeping on my back.  :)</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all.  It did not stay in place through the night even though I had properly adjusted the straps.  The biggest disappointment was that it made my chest wrinkles worse more toward my neck!  I tried it for a week and returned it.  I was skeptical of the product before I bought it and I should have gone with my instinct.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pillow 3 yrs ago direct from the Intimia company  when I first started noticing my chest wrinkles. I saw  it on the Dr. Oz show. In the first week of wearing it I saw a big difference.  The pillow is a soft satin cushion.  I wear it without a bra. I&#x27;m a side sleeper and this is a big help. After three yrs its time to replace it. I wash mine in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle, and let it air dry. I do find it to be a little uncomfortable,  but it works well so I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I knew creams alone would be a waste of time and deliberated about the pillow as had been using a similiar one purchased  4  yrs ago(different manufacturer) which had seen better days.  The &amp;#34;Intimia&amp;#34; is much superior with thicker supportive straps and crossover design really did separate.  Physics alone says this pillow should work by minimizing the pull of gravity whilst lying on ones side during the night. I also use a light moisturiser on my chest b4 going to bed and this also helps. I would recommend it as it definately prevents the nightly onset of wrinkles.  I am a 12 B Australian so not sure if it would be as effective for bigger busted ladies but you can only try it.  The only negative is it is quite pricey for what it is....mass made in China.</li>
            <li> This is a well made, quality product. Pillow is just the right firmness to work and be comfortable at the same time.  Definitely helps if you use it. Lovely company to work with also.</li>
            <li> It works for me! I have large breast and I&#x27;m pregnant at the moment. It is even more uncomfortable to sleep on my side now. The pillow does move a little during the night but it doesn&#x27;t move completely still keeping my breasts somehow separated from each other, making it much more comfortable to sleep. The material is veeeeery soft on the skin. I love it. It also helps me to sleep on my front if I want to, without feeling my breast is in the way too much. I&#x27;m not sure it would erase existing wrinkles but definitely prevents them.  I recommend for all large breast ladies!    Edit: it started to hurt the bottom part of my breasts where the elastic hits. It would be perfect if the bottom part along and around the breast was also cushioned. My solution was to wrap a spongy kind of material around the bottom elastic so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the sensitive skin of the bottom of my breast. Good product and idea but need improvement.</li>
            <li> Last night was my first night with the pillow and it was fabulous! I did not feel my breasts smashing together and causing the cleavage wrinkles. The pillow itself is super comfortable. To be honest, even if it wasn&#x27;t fighting wrinkles I would still wear it because something about it is very soothing. Seriously! Maybe it&#x27;s like sleeping with a teddy bear you don&#x27;t have to hold? Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I saw this product make the connection between side-sleeping and cleavage wrinkles I was terrified of sleeping on my side until this product arrived. The fact is that once that correlation was brought to my attention I did notice that when I slept on my side I woke up with wrinkles. Nothing betrays your age more than wrinkly cleavage and neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just past the 30-year mark so I don&#x27;t have ingrained cleavage wrinkles but I know this will prevent them. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to expect them to affect the wrinkles you have already established but do know that it will prevent more from forming as a result of side-sleeping.</li>
            <li> Comfortable for sleep and useful after breast surgery however a bit bulky</li>
            <li> Great quality but feels like it&#x27;s strangling you and gets annoying.</li>
            <li> Use this with [[ASIN:B000PARERW Decollette Pad - Correct &amp; Prevent Chest Wrinkles, 1 pad,(Calvet Cosmetics)]]. Read my review for the Decollette Pad and hopefully you, like me, won&#x27;t have to worry about vertical chest wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This pillow really works and I wish I had known about it before developing the creases between my breasts.  However within the past month of moisturing and using this pillow the lines are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> I got this not for prevention of wrinkles, although if that&#x27;s true it&#x27;d be nice, but when I lay on my side I don&#x27;t want the girls to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks&lt;br /&gt;You HAVE to wear it under your clothes or it just slides around. Even when you wear it underneath your clothes, and you&#x27;re well endowed, it often slides. If you&#x27;re a wiggle worm like me, you can twist the strap occasionally and the metal adjuster will dig into your skin. I wish the straps were as soft as the pillow. I agree with others that the top of the cushion is a bit high on the chest, but its not too annoying. The cloth around the cushion is satin like and I thought it&#x27;d make me sweat in the summer months, but it didn&#x27;t. I wish the cushion was little firmer. It seems over priced for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives: it works 80% of the time for my purposes. it&#x27;s more comfortable than one would imagine sleeping with something on their chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this, but I&#x27;m still in the market to. Look for something better. I read on here about chest savers.com and I think I&#x27;ll check that out too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, this product is the best thing since sliced bread! Usually wake up with tons of chest wrinkles but that is no more! Genius!</li>
