            <li>Smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is also a very good deal for the product.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>When i got it i thought it smelled great</li>
            <li>And really, lovely is the perfect word to describe it.</li>
            <li>it was a tad bit stronger and had better staying power, it would be the perfect fragrance imo.</li>
            <li>It looks gorgeous just sitting in my make-up prep area.  </li>
            <li>It is very fresh and you will smell great!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>bottle is VERY cute.  </li>
            <li>Flower Princess is now my favorite scent to wear.</li>
            <li>In a word: Lovely.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This perfume deserves way more love and attention.</li>
            <li>i love it and am going to buy more</li>
            <li>I tried this and loved it right away.</li>
            <li>But i liked the original princess and thought i would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I thought the original Princess was too potent in the vanilla department, even though I like vanilla.</li>
            <li>I am not a girly girl, so when I smelled this product at a make-up counter, I was surprised at how much I liked it!  </li>
            <li>I am 25, so I was fine with this.  </li>
            <li>probably too light and insubstantial.</li>
            <li>I love to spritz it on my pulse points and hair right after showering.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something more sophisticated and mature, I would recommend looking at [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Hope this helps make your decision easier!ooking for something more sophisticated and mature</li>
            <li>Just to be fair, a limited edition was released here, and thankfully, it&#x27;s still available on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased the original Vera Wang Princess in the past and have loved it, so I thought I would love this one too.</li>
            <li>Made me feel very feminine, which I didn&#x27;t think I would enjoy.</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s fresh and not too heady</li>
            <li>This is such a lovely, light floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 and have loved this since it came out in &#x27;06, so I&#x27;m guessing an older crowd looking into perfumes probably wouldn&#x27;t have the same opinion--</li>
            <li>But for me right now, this is one of my favorite--if not my favorite--scents still.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, makes you feel feminine and actually puts me in a better mood when I wear it.  </li>

            <li>This exact product as you see, for about $40.00.  </li>
            <li>The scent gives me a headache and just isn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>Obviously, it is more floral than the original Princess and less vanilla-y, but I personally like floral and fruity a bit more than vanilla.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I guess that&#x27;s good for me that it doesn&#x27;t, because it means the likelihood of someone else wearing the same perfume is low</li>
            <li>The name is spot on really, as you feel exactly like a</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super feminine and soft, and I imagine anyone else wearing it would be a dream to hug</li>
            <li>Apparently, it was released in Japan because Japanese women prefer a more fresh, airy, floral scent than Americans.  </li>

            <li>I suppose the fact that it&#x27;s no longer sold or made in the U.S. contributes to its minimal recognition, which is a shame really because it&#x27;s suuuch a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more floral than fruity, but without the bitterness or in-your-face quality I find with a lot of other florals.</li>
            <li>I actually accidentally ordered this instead of the original Princess, but I decided to keep it and give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly sweet either, which you&#x27;ll find with a lot of fruity-floral fragrances aimed at the younger crowd.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally into floral scents, but I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>I am always leery of ordering perfume online, but my boyfriend (very picky and sensitive to smells) gave me the thumbs up when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>This seller is selling the real scent, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Took longer than anticipated to arrive but exactly what I expected and was the right version of Vera Wang.</li>
            <li>Well, the first is that Vera Wang fragrances are pretty notorious for not lasting too long.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was decent (all perfumes take longer to ship due to \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; material and are therefore not prime eligible, but if you are prime you will still get free standard shipping), and it was all wrapped and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was a very competitive price (especially when compared to brick and mortar retailers) while still retaining all of the quality and name of the perfume.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a Bath &amp; Body Works junkie with scents for every season. I thought the original Princess was too potent in the vanilla department, even though I like vanilla. Flower Princess is now my favorite scent to wear. I usually don&#x27;t like flowery scents- my faves from BBW are Mango mandarin, Pumpkin Spice, Vanilla Noel, Midnight Pomegranate... etc. I tried this and loved it right away. It was on my wishlist for a year until my husband got it for me. Made me feel very feminine, which I didn&#x27;t think I would enjoy. I love to spritz it on my pulse points and hair right after showering. In a word: Lovely. I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it. :(</li>
            <li> I am not a girly girl, so when I smelled this product at a make-up counter, I was surprised at how much I liked it!  It&#x27;s not overpowering, makes you feel feminine and actually puts me in a better mood when I wear it.  Great product, and the boyfriend likes it too!</li>
            <li> Usually, when you apply a scent to your wrists, you can catch a whiff throughout the day--not with Vera Wang Princess.  It&#x27;s noticeable for a short while but after the day goes on--totally gone.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this limited edition perfume!  My daughter thought that she had smelled it in a department store and when she went back to purchase it they were all sold out!  I love Vera Wang Perfumes and the price caught my attention!  I LOVE IT!!!! I just wish I would have ordered more than 1!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was a very competitive price (especially when compared to brick and mortar retailers) while still retaining all of the quality and name of the perfume.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent! Very pleased</li>
            <li> This perfume deserves way more love and attention. But I guess that&#x27;s good for me that it doesn&#x27;t, because it means the likelihood of someone else wearing the same perfume is low ;) I suppose the fact that it&#x27;s no longer sold or made in the U.S. contributes to its minimal recognition, which is a shame really because it&#x27;s suuuch a lovely scent. And really, lovely is the perfect word to describe it. If *only* it was a tad bit stronger and had better staying power, it would be the perfect fragrance imo. No other perfume I&#x27;ve tried makes me feel as feminine and just...pretty wearing it. The name is spot on really, as you feel exactly like a ~flower princess~ with it on, as cheesy as that sounds. I like how it&#x27;s fresh and not too heady while not being too masculine/neutral. It&#x27;s super feminine and soft, and I imagine anyone else wearing it would be a dream to hug lol. It&#x27;s not overly sweet either, which you&#x27;ll find with a lot of fruity-floral fragrances aimed at the younger crowd. It&#x27;s more floral than fruity, but without the bitterness or in-your-face quality I find with a lot of other florals. I am obsessed. I slightly want to horde a stash of these before they stop making them forever (God forbid), but #collegelyfe says otherwise. I&#x27;m 21 and have loved this since it came out in &#x27;06, so I&#x27;m guessing an older crowd looking into perfumes probably wouldn&#x27;t have the same opinion-- probably too light and insubstantial. But for me right now, this is one of my favorite--if not my favorite--scents still. I really wish it wasn&#x27;t limited edition, but at least it&#x27;s still sold on the magical wonderland that is the internet.</li>
            <li> I did a LOT of research on all Vera Wang fragrances before purchasing.  I actually accidentally ordered this instead of the original Princess, but I decided to keep it and give it a shot.  Apparently, it was released in Japan because Japanese women prefer a more fresh, airy, floral scent than Americans.  Just to be fair, a limited edition was released here, and thankfully, it&#x27;s still available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very feminine and girly.  I feel like a real princess wearing it!  I am always leery of ordering perfume online, but my boyfriend (very picky and sensitive to smells) gave me the thumbs up when it arrived.  It is very fresh and you will smell great!  Obviously, it is more floral than the original Princess and less vanilla-y, but I personally like floral and fruity a bit more than vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is VERY cute.  Has a diamond cap and even a little ring on it.  It looks gorgeous just sitting in my make-up prep area.  3.4 ounces is huge and this should last you awhile.  This is also a very good deal for the product.  The shipping was decent (all perfumes take longer to ship due to \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; material and are therefore not prime eligible, but if you are prime you will still get free standard shipping), and it was all wrapped and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides?  Well, the first is that Vera Wang fragrances are pretty notorious for not lasting too long.  You&#x27;re going to have to spray yourself a LOT, and don&#x27;t expect the scent to last all day.  I have heard it does for some people, but not me.  I was on spring break when I got it, and was literally sitting around doing nothing.  Within a couple hours it was totally gone.  So prepare to douse yourself in this or at least get a little vial so you can reapply occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, based on the ads and all of the reviews I have read on many sites, this is often seen as a \\&quot;young\\&quot; scent, meaning for the younger generation.  I am 25, so I was fine with this.  But if you are looking for something more sophisticated and mature, I would recommend looking at [[ASIN:B006C6BO38 Vera Wang Princess Night 3.4 oz Eau De Toilette Spray]] or a whole different perfume line altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to getting Glam Princess next, or Night Princess.

            <li> I bought this with out knowing what it would smell like.  But i liked the original princess and thought i would give this a try.  When i got it i thought it smelled great i love it and am going to buy more</li>
            <li> Took longer than anticipated to arrive but exactly what I expected and was the right version of Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail from Amazon.  This exact product as you see, for about $40.00.  The bottle that came in the mail was HALF-FULL.  And then when I opened the cap to smell it, it was not even the vera wang flower princess scent.  I was very disappointed with Amazon&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> Bought for my young daughter, she loves it...</li>
            <li> Smell wonderful! I&#x27;m not normally into floral scents, but I really enjoy this one. Just wish Vera Wang&#x27;s fragrances lasted longer on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the original Vera Wang Princess in the past and have loved it, so I thought I would love this one too. Nope. This is Vera Wang Flower Princess and it is stinky. The scent gives me a headache and just isn&#x27;t pretty. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely, light floral fragrance.  I&#x27;ve ordered it from other sellers and it wasn&#x27;t the same, as if it was a knock-off.  This seller is selling the real scent, as far as I can tell.</li>
