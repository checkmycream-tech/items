    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great item!</li>
            <li>The color does not stay on, but it is a good way to track the path of your kids because it leaves residue and color everywhere they go!</li>
            <li>it would tear my hair and make tangles!&amp;#34;My beautiful hair&amp;#34;!It would also tear the inside of the product.</li>
            <li>If she is happy then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>The colors were great, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li>I think it shows up great in her hair</li>
            <li>Am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>It went in her hair great but by the time I was done it was all over my hands.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Colors are really bright but application method does not work for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so bright</li>
            <li>Good value for good price.</li>
            <li>I loved how it turned out</li>
            <li>And I was happy that the kids can apply this by themselves, since it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>, it works perfectly and is fun with no commitment.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly, and the hair chalk goes on easily and works great!  </li>
            <li>liked this because my hair isn&#x27;t Dow anymore</li>
            <li>and I bought this with my own money that i earned.when</li>
            <li>Hot huez hair dye isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>A great value and super trendy.</li>
            <li>Sponges come off compact very easily.</li>
            <li>And it washes out easily!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and temporary!</li>
            <li>, it has been fine!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and looked nice in her hair.</li>
            <li>Best Costume Site should be ashamed of there selves for even selling them for the price they did, plus Amazon should shut down there seller&#x27;s account for good.</li>
            <li>More of the chalk gets on your clothes and skin than stays in your hair.</li>
            <li>Find a better chalk and brand.</li>
            <li>It gets all over the kids scalp and sticks to your scalp and clothing better than your hair.</li>
            <li>You get more of it on you than you do in your hair.</li>
            <li>But now when I run my finger through mynhsir it comes out even MORE dyed.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my granddaughter, so assuming she&#x27;s pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is in love with this item.</li>
            <li>cute</li>
            <li>but it does take more than one application.  </li>
            <li>It is a better solution than having a temporary hair extension.</li>
            <li>and  my husband tried to make it better in her hair and now his hands are stained.</li>
            <li>Love it it is amazingðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜.</li>
            <li>It totally changed my life.my hair was amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li>The lighter color of your hair, the more the colors show.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed many say that it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair, however we put in a leave in conditioner which made for easy application in my daughters hair and then added hairspray.  </li>
            <li>It went on fairly easily, but then it got in her face, and her shoulders and her favorite shirt.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think it great, the product will last longer that way since I have two girls using it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the bright hues</li>
            <li>but it cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend putting in hair in the bathroom where any chalk that does drop can be easily cleaned up.</li>
            <li>this product is very cheap and broke the first time I used them!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for daughters that want streaks or colors in hair but parents will be happy because it&#x27;s VERY temporary!  </li>
            <li>I would say great for a girls party or sleepover, but not for going to an event outside the house.</li>
            <li>Fun and creative product.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair but still didn&#x27;t show up well.</li>
            <li>We used leave in conditioner to dampen the hair before applying then used hairspray after to help secure it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic turn around time for shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old loved it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful combination for a 9 yo who wants to try different hair colors.</li>
            <li>The commercials on TV make this sound like such a great temporary option for hair color and my daughter was really excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be returning this item.</li>
            <li>She was excited</li>
            <li>I recommend mousse, or perhaps a very light gel prior to using the chalk, and then a spray of some kind after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>Our nine-year old still wanted to spend her own money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not Bad for the Price.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has red hair, think Merida from Brave but straight.</li>
            <li>but it is not too bold.</li>
            <li>I tried nail polish, super glue and gorilla glue and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We used Hot Huez tonight and followed the directions EXACTLY (but added a quick touch with a flat iron after the spray) and so far it&#x27;s awesome....</li>
            <li>The hot huez went every where in the bathroom and all over my face!</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be fun to bring along one day to do the girls hair</li>
            <li>I had read the instructions before trying it, and it said to use a leave in conditioner for the best results, the advertisement says nothing about it, but it was a cause for me to be annoyed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it isnt worth the money,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>My 5 year old &amp; I love the way it works.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a sometime fun look</li>
            <li>This allows her to express herself, yet be appropriate for school and other events where the bight colors are not event appropriate.</li>
            <li>The website wasn&#x27;t very user Friendly.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right???</li>
            <li>as of right now, I give this product 5 stars....</li>
            <li>Because normally after I see it in their hair all day, where it is cute, by the end of the day, I am ready for it to be gone.  </li>
            <li>I have black hair, and the first colour I put into it (the green) was bright and VERY nice on my hair.</li>
            <li>So thanks hot huez you have made the biggest mess I have ever seen, have a great day.</li>
            <li>It worked amazing &amp; stayed in the whole night &amp; the next day!</li>
            <li>It is exactly as the package shows on tv which is exactly what my daughter wanted for her birthday.</li>
            <li>My daughter has really enjoyed the multiple colors in this set.</li>
            <li>Now about the HOT HUES, it&#x27;s just junk.</li>
            <li>But it did exactly what my daughter wanted.  </li>
            <li>Hot Huez doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Only paid 10 bucks at WalMart but its 10 bucks I could have used on better things.</li>
            <li>I first started using hot huez</li>
            <li>First, it is chalk and does not stay in the hair, the dust falls out of the hair and since she had it in her bangs and along the hair framing her face</li>
            <li>Sponges on inside came off with first application.</li>
            <li>I bought hot huez at walmart</li>
            <li>placed the order on the Hot Huez website, the night of 5/29.  </li>
            <li>Also the clasp hot caught in her hair</li>
            <li>Overall a nice temporary product for young girls in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Surprised by how quickly seller shipped product.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I will say that it washes out of darker hair much easier than light hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize my daughter paid $40.00 for these when on TV straight from the manufacture</li>
            <li>I really wish it would have.</li>
            <li>and it does show up much brighter in her hair with just one time applying to her hair.  </li>
            <li>It washes out of my oldest hair with just one washing, however my youngest with the really light blonde hair</li>
            <li>She really likes these and how to apply them.  </li>
            <li>Washed out when I showered and I can&#x27;t wait to try out other colors:)</li>
            <li>The older one has blondish hair, but it didn&#x27;t really show up on hers either.  </li>
            <li>The compact keeps it from spreading over my entire bathroom (although, as with any chalk there is clean up involved after application.)</li>
            <li>The color is OK, but it doesn&#x27;t come out very well in dark hair.</li>
            <li>I only paid ten bucks and was greatly pleased.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is kind of hard and gets tangled because of it and color still comes out onto my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun for the kids but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 7 year old daughter, she absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>, normally I look at reviews before I buy as seen on TV products.</li>
            <li>We have bought hair chalk in the past that didn&#x27;t really work well, but these work much better.  </li>
            <li>I was wearing a brand new t-shirt that day, and it stained it.</li>
            <li>With Hot Huez she can have a different streak of color every day and it washes right out since it is only chalk.</li>
            <li>As long as it is not clumpy it wont transfer to clothing or furniture!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper on the Hot Huez website!</li>
            <li>There was a little residue, but use a towel, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>They make your hair hard as heck, the color will not stay in your hair (but it seems to stain your hands lovely shades).</li>
            <li>The people who gave this product 4 or 5 stars are completely bonkers or have stock in the company.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 11 yr old granddaughter, who didn&#x27;t even try it after she saw my results</li>
            <li>no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have known that before I ordered direct.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m 8 years old</li>
            <li>it takes about 2-3 shampoos to come out completely.  </li>
            <li>does make a mess...great for young ones</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my 8 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I only planned on wearing them when my hair was straight</li>
            <li>WHERE NEAR that bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dampen her hair with de-tangler spray, then slide the color in, but  don&#x27;t press to hard or it will be clumpy, go light</li>
            <li>Product barely worked.</li>
            <li>It will come off on things if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>I was highly annoyed at this, but it was an OK color result for medium-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>daughter used the green and it turned her tank top green</li>
            <li>By the time I took them back to see their mom and dad, it was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 8 year old twin girls who both have long hair....</li>
            <li>I bought Hot Huez while I was working at a camp for Autistic children</li>
            <li>Chalk washes off easily with little mess.</li>
            <li>then very let down.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the younger one who has very dark hair, but it didn&#x27;t really show up.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Surprised by how quickly seller shipped product.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I will say that it washes out of darker hair much easier than light hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my daughter paid $40.00 for these when on TV straight from the manufacture</li>
            <li> I really wish it would have.</li>
            <li> and it does show up much brighter in her hair with just one time applying to her hair.  </li>
            <li> It washes out of my oldest hair with just one washing, however my youngest with the really light blonde hair</li>
            <li> She really likes these and how to apply them.  </li>
            <li> Washed out when I showered and I can&#x27;t wait to try out other colors:)</li>
            <li> The older one has blondish hair, but it didn&#x27;t really show up on hers either.  </li>
            <li> The compact keeps it from spreading over my entire bathroom (although, as with any chalk there is clean up involved after application.)</li>
            <li> The color is OK, but it doesn&#x27;t come out very well in dark hair.</li>
            <li> I only paid ten bucks and was greatly pleased.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is kind of hard and gets tangled because of it and color still comes out onto my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun for the kids but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old daughter, she absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> , normally I look at reviews before I buy as seen on TV products.</li>
            <li> We have bought hair chalk in the past that didn&#x27;t really work well, but these work much better.  </li>
            <li> I was wearing a brand new t-shirt that day, and it stained it.</li>
            <li> With Hot Huez she can have a different streak of color every day and it washes right out since it is only chalk.</li>
            <li> As long as it is not clumpy it wont transfer to clothing or furniture!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper on the Hot Huez website!</li>
            <li> There was a little residue, but use a towel, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> They make your hair hard as heck, the color will not stay in your hair (but it seems to stain your hands lovely shades).</li>
            <li> The people who gave this product 4 or 5 stars are completely bonkers or have stock in the company.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 11 yr old granddaughter, who didn&#x27;t even try it after she saw my results</li>
            <li> no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have known that before I ordered direct.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m 8 years old</li>
            <li> it takes about 2-3 shampoos to come out completely.  </li>
            <li> does make a mess...great for young ones</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 8 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I only planned on wearing them when my hair was straight</li>
            <li> WHERE NEAR that bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dampen her hair with de-tangler spray, then slide the color in, but  don&#x27;t press to hard or it will be clumpy, go light</li>
            <li> Product barely worked.</li>
            <li> It will come off on things if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> I was highly annoyed at this, but it was an OK color result for medium-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> daughter used the green and it turned her tank top green</li>
            <li> By the time I took them back to see their mom and dad, it was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old twin girls who both have long hair....</li>
            <li> I bought Hot Huez while I was working at a camp for Autistic children</li>
            <li> Chalk washes off easily with little mess.</li>
            <li> then very let down.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the younger one who has very dark hair, but it didn&#x27;t really show up.  </li>
            <li> This product should be limited to carnivals and other venues where you know it&#x27;s going to be a mess and is just done for fun.</li>
            <li> I sprayed our hair down with hairspray &amp; it&#x27;s staying in so far</li>
            <li> I applied to dry hair and used a flat iron then hair spray, the color came off as soon as I brushed it.</li>
            <li> I have pink dye in my hair now &amp; the green works really well in covering it.</li>
            <li> the chalk doesnt even stay in for a long time.</li>
            <li> but if you have long hair it gets all over your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Same with pink.</li>
            <li> her entire face turned pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun, but too messy and hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> I take the hair dryer to it, and lightly dry the damp strands spray with hairspray</li>
            <li> but you could definitely see it in my dark hair.</li>
            <li> She is dark blonde and it lasted all day and came out in the shower!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried blue or purple yet, and I didn&#x27;t like how much of a mess it made on my skin (my hair hangs in my face and it was all over my nose)</li>
            <li> Colors are dull and don&#x27;t even last an entire day.</li>
            <li> and it was a huge disappointment for her</li>
            <li> Shipping took a longer time than expected.  </li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has medium brown hair and as some have mentioned it is harder to see in darker hair</li>
            <li> The pink &amp; purple make her look so grown up &amp; prettier.</li>
            <li> and I threw it away and then spent 30 minutes scrubbing it out of my bathroom floor and counter tops.</li>
            <li> Go to a salon and have a strip of pink dye put in instead.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to get out, and it makes your hair get big knots.</li>
            <li> the other two did not.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll be exploring other options.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions which say to add a leave in conditioned or some other primer in your hair</li>
            <li> This one, just like the others, needs other products to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I looked in the bathroom and there was pink and turquoise dust everywhere!</li>
            <li> I mean the colors do show but only the pink and purple show</li>
            <li> and then we tried to press a little harder to make the colors darker in her hair</li>
            <li> I thought it was average</li>
            <li> my hair is fairly dark and nothing ever colored it like hair chalk.</li>
            <li> Anyway, at $10.00 so not worth it.</li>
            <li> It gets on your hands, stains your skin, ruins your clothes and gets all over your furniture and car seats...wherever you put your head.</li>
            <li> My friend and I could not even sleep in the bed because we were COVERED in pink and green dyes.</li>
            <li> I felt really bad because she was so excited</li>
            <li> I bought some for my sister &amp; she used it less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> Boxes slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to deal with the mess they make.</li>
            <li> The results are not worth the mess!</li>
            <li> This product can be a little bit messing</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way to messy.</li>
            <li> (I have an ombre) , I wanted to do my tips green &amp; then braid it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it will make a mess!</li>
            <li> It shows up on my dark brown hair BUT the applicator clamps hard on my hair and will pull it out if I don&#x27;t hold the strand at the roots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another complaint was the chalk mess....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the product cost was so low.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there were several issues.</li>
            <li> Most terrible hair product ever!</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> It is very messy .</li>
            <li> My ten year old daughter was so sad and disappointed after trying this product.</li>
            <li> so, yeah, it&#x27;s a little dusty...</li>
            <li> You know it&#x27;s bad when a 5yr old sayd lets</li>
            <li> I wish I could put negative stars for product and seller.</li>
            <li> The color barely shows up on my med brown hair, so I was disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money my niece was so sad.</li>
            <li> We bought Hot Huez even after the negative reviews on the product and the horrible things we heard about shipping.  </li>
            <li> gray peoples don&#x27;t try hot huez it is horrible</li>
            <li> It just was so frustrating and not as advertised st</li>
            <li> This is just bad, it does not work on my daughter&#x27;s dark hair and it just got all over the place.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so badly and waited a few weeks for it.</li>
            <li> They have showered twice since applying it and their faces are still PINK from this CRAP.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this product so bad and was so disappointed when she used it.&lt;br /&gt;The CHALK (not actual hair dye) got everywhere!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the design.</li>
            <li> As is, fail.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful like other people said it&#x27;s gets on everything you touch even when you walk</li>
            <li> , boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost impossible to see in darker hair</li>
            <li> but if you have curly hair it would be impossible.</li>
            <li> so everyone who didn&#x27;t do that should try doing so before  speaking so badly about a product.</li>
            <li> they also make a horrible horrible mess....</li>
            <li> And I HATE having snarly hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>
            <li> I tested it out on myself before my shift, and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this in the worst way</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The people who gave this product 4 or 5 stars are completely bonkers or have stock in the company. This product is absolutely awful like other people said it&#x27;s gets on everything you touch even when you walk it falls to the floor. Every time we were trying to be used it broke.  Please DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. MADE IN CHINA , ENOUGH SAID !!!!!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as the package shows on tv which is exactly what my daughter wanted for her birthday. If she is happy then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Colors are really bright but application method does not work for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Colors are dull and don&#x27;t even last an entire day. More of the chalk gets on your clothes and skin than stays in your hair. Find a better chalk and brand. Some chalks actually last three to four days. Chalk gets everywhere and compacts fall apart.</li>
            <li> A great value and super trendy. Chalk washes off easily with little mess. My daughter has really enjoyed the multiple colors in this set.</li>
            <li> The color barely shows up on my med brown hair, so I was disappointed with the product.  I bought it for my 11 yr old granddaughter, who didn&#x27;t even try it after she saw my results</li>
            <li> The package was destroyed and the chalk was busted. It is definitely temporary! It gets all over the kids scalp and sticks to your scalp and clothing better than your hair. It&#x27;s fun for the kids but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. May last longer if you sprayed your hair before and after with hairspray?</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. She saw the commercial on tv and it is definitely a lot cheaper on amazon. Good value for good price.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered a while back and it was just junk and waaaaaaay over priced, highway robbery over priced. I didn&#x27;t realize my daughter paid $40.00 for these when on TV straight from the manufacture was only selling them for $15.00. Best Costume Site should be ashamed of there selves for even selling them for the price they did, plus Amazon should shut down there seller&#x27;s account for good. Now about the HOT HUES, it&#x27;s just junk. It falls apart trying to apply it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s almost impossible to see in darker hair and it&#x27;s way to messy. You get more of it on you than you do in your hair. I wish I could put negative stars for product and seller.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Got this for ,&lt;br /&gt;My daughter for her birthday and it was a huge disappointment for her</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old loved it. It was easy to use and looked nice in her hair. The chalk ended up all over her clothes and her pillows. I would say great for a girls party or sleepover, but not for going to an event outside the house.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter ... I have giving it 5 stars because she seems to like it ... no complaints so far.  Fun and creative product.</li>
            <li> This is just bad, it does not work on my daughter&#x27;s dark hair and it just got all over the place.  We followed the instructions and I just threw money away.  Do not buy unless you want that chalk color all over yourself, clothes, furniture.</li>
            <li> Me and my friend were just playing around at a sleep over and started to put these in our hair. No it is on my clothes, my hands, the floor, oh and my hair looks nothing like I put these in. But now when I run my finger through mynhsir it comes out even MORE dyed. My friend and I could not even sleep in the bed because we were COVERED in pink and green dyes. So thanks hot huez you have made the biggest mess I have ever seen, have a great day.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because when I used it it worked all some&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommend  this&lt;br /&gt;I liked this because my hair isn&#x27;t Dow anymore</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the design. The cake of chalk is in a metal pan. The pan&#x27;s rim is taller than the chalk, and its metal edge scrapes the hair as you draw the hair over the chalk. If it were lower, or if the chalk were dome-shaped, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. As is, fail.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly, and the hair chalk goes on easily and works great!  I was skeptical because the product cost was so low.  But it did exactly what my daughter wanted.  And it washes out easily!  Highly recommend for daughters that want streaks or colors in hair but parents will be happy because it&#x27;s VERY temporary!  And I was happy that the kids can apply this by themselves, since it&#x27;s so easy! Surprised by how quickly seller shipped product.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my sister &amp; she used it less than 10 times. Well St. Paddy&#x27;s day was yesterday &amp; with my hair (I have an ombre) , I wanted to do my tips green &amp; then braid it. It worked amazing &amp; stayed in the whole night &amp; the next day! Washed out when I showered and I can&#x27;t wait to try out other colors:)</li>
            <li> Shipping took a longer time than expected.  This was a gift for my granddaughter, so assuming she&#x27;s pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is in love with this item.She will take pic of her hair every morning to show what she looks like.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Toni</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 12 and uses this like a pro, it works perfectly and is fun with no commitment. This allows her to express herself, yet be appropriate for school and other events where the bight colors are not event appropriate. Great item!</li>
            <li> I bought Hot Huez while I was working at a camp for Autistic children and I thought it would be fun to bring along one day to do the girls hair, boy was I wrong! I tested it out on myself before my shift, and it was terrible. I was wearing a brand new t-shirt that day, and it stained it. I had read the instructions before trying it, and it said to use a leave in conditioner for the best results, the advertisement says nothing about it, but it was a cause for me to be annoyed. The instructions then went on to say that in order to make the hair chalk stay, you must use HAIRSPRAY. All of the advertisements state that you need NO sprays for this product to work. I was highly annoyed at this, but it was an OK color result for medium-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> The colors were great, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Even tried using a mascara wand. I really wish it would have.</li>
            <li> Hot Huez doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy them. They make your hair hard as heck, the color will not stay in your hair (but it seems to stain your hands lovely shades). I tried it with damp hair, didn&#x27;t work. I applied to dry hair and used a flat iron then hair spray, the color came off as soon as I brushed it. Now my hair is kind of hard and gets tangled because of it and color still comes out onto my hair. Horrible. I&#x27;m sticking to color extensions.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product online. The website wasn&#x27;t very user Friendly. I wasn&#x27;t given the option to view and confirm My order before it was processed. I was charged double shipping and duplicate orders of two. Leavinge with a $244 charge to My credit card. Priority shipping isn&#x27;t that at all. I was told all that means is that My order goes to the warehouse faster. It still took 4weeks to arrive. I sent it back unopened and was charged $55 for shipping. This Company just rips the consumer off. Wal-Mart sells this product online. I wish I would have known that before I ordered direct.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my two granddaughters, but had a problem.  I put it on the younger one who has very dark hair, but it didn&#x27;t really show up.  The older one has blondish hair, but it didn&#x27;t really show up on hers either.  It also came off somewhat.  By the time I took them back to see their mom and dad, it was barely noticeable.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right???</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read the reviews before i bought it. Only paid 10 bucks at WalMart but its 10 bucks I could have used on better things. Very messy. Sponges come off compact very easily. I have light brown hair but still didn&#x27;t show up well. They say no sprays, but you have to use primer spray and hair spray. Color gets on everything. Might be o.k. if someone did it, but would never recommend it to anyone. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> chalk falls off of your hair,&lt;br /&gt;dont get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it isnt worth the money,&lt;br /&gt;and the chalk doesnt even stay in for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in October and I used the blue hair chalk in my hair. The hot huez went every where in the bathroom and all over my face! and I even followed the directions! Don&#x27;t buy this, it will make a mess!</li>
            <li> The box was damaged. There were no instructions. Product barely worked. We ended buying another one, this one was garbage.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year old twin girls who both have long hair....&lt;br /&gt;Looks cute but if you have long hair it gets all over your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used the green and it turned her tank top green</li>
            <li> It will not stay in . It is very messy . It  is a dud . I do not recommend it .</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this product and wanted to write a review: I&#x27;m 8 years old and I bought this with my own money that i earned.when I first started using hot huez it would tear my hair and make tangles!&amp;#34;My beautiful hair&amp;#34;!It would also tear the inside of the product. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> My daughters as soon as they saw this on tv had to have it.  This product can be a little bit messing but it cleans up easily.  I would recommend putting in hair in the bathroom where any chalk that does drop can be easily cleaned up. I also place a towel around my daughter(s) shoulders when applying to keep from getting on their clothes. Also, I noticed many say that it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair, however we put in a leave in conditioner which made for easy application in my daughters hair and then added hairspray.  The hairspray is meant to keep it from coming off on everything else(clothes, furniture, etc.)and we haven&#x27;t had any problems with that.  My oldest daughter has medium brown hair and as some have mentioned it is harder to see in darker hair however you can apply a couple of applications to make it darker. I think it shows up great in her hair but it does take more than one application.  Now my youngest daughter still has really blonde hair and it does show up much brighter in her hair with just one time applying to her hair.  Honestly, I think it great, the product will last longer that way since I have two girls using it.  Lastly, I will say that it washes out of darker hair much easier than light hair.  It washes out of my oldest hair with just one washing, however my youngest with the really light blonde hair it takes about 2-3 shampoos to come out completely.  Which I normally do back to back when in bath so no big deal. Because normally after I see it in their hair all day, where it is cute, by the end of the day, I am ready for it to be gone.  Overall a nice temporary product for young girls in my opinion.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> this product is very cheap and broke the first time I used them! they also make a horrible horrible mess.... do not buy</li>
            <li> My 5 year old &amp; I love the way it works. I have pink dye in my hair now &amp; the green works really well in covering it. My daughter has red hair, think Merida from Brave but straight. The pink &amp; purple make her look so grown up &amp; prettier. I sprayed our hair down with hairspray &amp; it&#x27;s staying in so far so everyone who didn&#x27;t do that should try doing so before  speaking so badly about a product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was average I mean the colors do show but only the pink and purple show the other two did not. In addition, the color falls off and smudges my shirt and sofa even though I hairspray it to keep the chalk from falling off.</li>
            <li> I have black hair, and the first colour I put into it (the green) was bright and VERY nice on my hair. Same with pink. I haven&#x27;t tried blue or purple yet, and I didn&#x27;t like how much of a mess it made on my skin (my hair hangs in my face and it was all over my nose) but I also didn&#x27;t use the leave in conditioner to prime it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to lock it in with hairspray and then brush the piece of hair that is coloured so that there is a hint of colour but it is not too bold. The hairspray helps to lock it in.</li>
            <li> The commercials on TV make this sound like such a great temporary option for hair color and my daughter was really excited. Unfortunately there were several issues. First, it is chalk and does not stay in the hair, the dust falls out of the hair and since she had it in her bangs and along the hair framing her face her entire face turned pink. The dust also got on her clothes and stained them. I felt really bad because she was so excited but we&#x27;ll be exploring other options.</li>
            <li> Have received as promised. Am happy with the product.  Boxes slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> does make a mess...great for young ones</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this product so bad and was so disappointed when she used it.&lt;br /&gt;The CHALK (not actual hair dye) got everywhere! I had to wash everything including&lt;br /&gt;the bathroom counter,sink and floor. It will stain your skin, clothes and anything else&lt;br /&gt;in comes in contact with! Go to a salon and have strip of your color choice put in&lt;br /&gt;or buy those clip on hair colors. Most terrible hair product ever! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this to play with color in my hair. It shows up on my dark brown hair BUT the applicator clamps hard on my hair and will pull it out if I don&#x27;t hold the strand at the roots. Also, the color will get EVERYWHERE. Do not wear a valuable shirt and watch out for furniture. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be returning this item. It&#x27;s fun, but too messy and hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> Sponges on inside came off with first application. Waste of money my niece was so sad.</li>
            <li> I bought hot huez at walmart my hair is fairly dark and nothing ever colored it like hair chalk. I followed the instructions which say to add a leave in conditioned or some other primer in your hair then you use the chalk and spray hair spray to set it. I loved how it turned out I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so bright but you could definitely see it in my dark hair. I only paid ten bucks and was greatly pleased. The chalk does get on your fingers and face depending on what part of your hair you are using but it simply comes off with soap and water. If you are looking for a sometime fun look this is the way to go</li>
            <li> I use a lot of different kinds of color chalk. This one, just like the others, needs other products to stay in place. I recommend mousse, or perhaps a very light gel prior to using the chalk, and then a spray of some kind after it&#x27;s applied. The color stays in your hair and will not transfer to your shirt/sofa/etc. I really like the bright hues and it&#x27;s ease. The compact keeps it from spreading over my entire bathroom (although, as with any chalk there is clean up involved after application.)</li>
            <li> my daughter used it then five minutes later the one side of her hair was gray peoples don&#x27;t try hot huez it is horrible</li>
            <li> Hot huez hair dye isn&#x27;t very good. It is not easy to get out, and it makes your hair get big knots. And I HATE having snarly hair. The color is OK, but it doesn&#x27;t come out very well in dark hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old daughter, she absolutely loves this product. It is a better solution than having a temporary hair extension. With Hot Huez she can have a different streak of color every day and it washes right out since it is only chalk.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and temporary! Wonderful combination for a 9 yo who wants to try different hair colors.</li>
            <li> My 8 y/o daughter wanted this item, so we got it for her. Anyway, at $10.00 so not worth it. One of the sponges came out of the color, it stained my daughter&#x27;s forehead and then we tried to press a little harder to make the colors darker in her hair and then they tangled her hair and  my husband tried to make it better in her hair and now his hands are stained. Ugh! I wished I read the reviews on this product before wasting money on the item, normally I look at reviews before I buy as seen on TV products. I&#x27;ll remember next time.</li>
            <li> Love it it is amazingðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜. It totally changed my life.my hair was amazing!!!!! I wish I could use it every day</li>
            <li> Not Bad for the Price.  For that price, you don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.  We used leave in conditioner to dampen the hair before applying then used hairspray after to help secure it.  It lasted for the day.  It will come off on things if you&#x27;re not careful.  Definitely wash it out before bed or laying on things.  The lighter color of your hair, the more the colors show.</li>
            <li> color doesn&#x27;t stay on but for an hour maybe!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 8 year old daughter.  She really likes these and how to apply them.  We have bought hair chalk in the past that didn&#x27;t really work well, but these work much better.  She is a blond, so I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference on how the colors stand out.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so badly and waited a few weeks for it. It went in her hair great but by the time I was done it was all over my hands. Within an hour it was all over my furniture. The color does not stay on, but it is a good way to track the path of your kids because it leaves residue and color everywhere they go! By the end of the day I was washing clothes and sofa cushions and you couldn&#x27;t even tell there was any color left in her hair, but if you ran your fingers through it your hands came out colored. This product should be limited to carnivals and other venues where you know it&#x27;s going to be a mess and is just done for fun.</li>
            <li> My ten year old daughter was so sad and disappointed after trying this product. It went on fairly easily, but then it got in her face, and her shoulders and her favorite shirt. I touched her hair and it was all over my fingers!  I looked in the bathroom and there was pink and turquoise dust everywhere! The results are not worth the mess!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this in the worst way so I bought it, it has been fine! I dampen her hair with de-tangler spray, then slide the color in, but  don&#x27;t press to hard or it will be clumpy, go light you can always go over it again! I take the hair dryer to it, and lightly dry the damp strands spray with hairspray and it holds! She is dark blonde and it lasted all day and came out in the shower! As long as it is not clumpy it wont transfer to clothing or furniture!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper on the Hot Huez website!</li>
            <li> They only work for about ten minutes. I only planned on wearing them when my hair was straight but if you have curly hair it would be impossible.</li>
            <li> We bought Hot Huez even after the negative reviews on the product and the horrible things we heard about shipping.  Our nine-year old still wanted to spend her own money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order on the Hot Huez website, the night of 5/29.  We received the product today, even though we were told it could be 2-6 weeks for delivery.  One hurdle, overcome!  Fantastic turn around time for shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used Hot Huez tonight and followed the directions EXACTLY (but added a quick touch with a flat iron after the spray) and so far it&#x27;s awesome....We shall see what the pillowcase looks like in the morning I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint was the chalk mess....well, it&#x27;s chalk.  There was a little residue, but use a towel, it&#x27;s fine...again...it&#x27;s still CHALK so, yeah, it&#x27;s a little dusty...think about the erasers you cleaned as kids (it&#x27;s NO WHERE NEAR that bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all....as of right now, I give this product 5 stars....tomorrow it might drop a bit, depending on that pillow case!  LOL</li>
            <li> We used the product before my daughters bday party. She was excited n then very let down.  You know it&#x27;s bad when a 5yr old sayd lets just forget it.  The sponges that make it work come out instantly.  I tried nail polish, super glue and gorilla glue and nothing worked. We are going to return it. Also the clasp hot caught in her hair and then didn&#x27;t close properly. It just was so frustrating and not as advertised st</li>
            <li> I gave these to my daughter as a birthday gift and after reading reviews decided to sell them to someone else. Didn&#x27;t want to deal with the mess they make.</li>
            <li> This is the messiest stuff on earth. It gets on your hands, stains your skin, ruins your clothes and gets all over your furniture and car seats...wherever you put your head. It is CHALK! NOT DYE! It just falls off all over the damn place. My daughters used it once and I threw it away and then spent 30 minutes scrubbing it out of my bathroom floor and counter tops. Over the course of the day it got all over my kids shirts and faces. They have showered twice since applying it and their faces are still PINK from this CRAP. PLEEEEEEEEASE do not get this for your kids. Go to a salon and have a strip of pink dye put in instead. That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed this weekend!</li>
