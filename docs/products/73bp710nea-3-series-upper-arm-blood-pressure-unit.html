            <li>This monitors need to be accurate to be of any use.</li>
            <li>I knew my BP was up because of what my dentist and cardiologist had confirmed.</li>

            <li>Better than most, but we still occasionally get inconsistent readings.  </li>
            <li>Takes 4 AAA ( not included) batteries which are stated to be adequate for 300 readings.</li>
            <li>It functions adequately well with the reduced voltage of rechargeable AAA cells.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a new Omron  10 Series and hopefully it gives better readings if not close to the manual BP monitor readings at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>one is very affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found it to be easy to use and fast.  </li>
            <li>I quickly got it assembled and batteries installed, and it fired right up.</li>
            <li>i always get this brand cuz this is reliable, as the normal digital blood pressure monitor is, you have to at least take the reading two to three times to make sure you get the best</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the display is clear.</li>
            <li>This works great, is easy to use, and isn&#x27;t bulky or hard to find a near by storage space for it.</li>
            <li>Very accurate, checked with doctors BP monitor on the same day.  </li>
            <li>My home measurement is very very close to the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>just make sure you have a good fit at the distal end near the elbow, especially when someone has a relatively large upper arm vs arm area near elbow</li>
            <li>Still not as accurate as having a reading by a professional, but it helps.</li>
            <li>Performed exactly as I wanted, and checked out when calibrated against doctor&#x27;s office machine.  </li>
            <li>higher than those in my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay when I started using it when I bought this last year in December.</li>
            <li>My resting pulse is pretty inaccurate also but I will not state those numbers as fact because I&#x27;ve never been in a clinical setting to have that number evaluated at a waking</li>
            <li>This is the first arm cuff BP monitor I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The reading is simple and I find it to be more reliable in terms of being correct.  </li>
            <li>and you are in the norm of what you see the first time.... reliable brand</li>
            <li>Be consistent with the time you check your blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and works well!</li>
            <li>It gives consistent results.  </li>
            <li>The monitor is accurate (cross-checked with other devices) and easy to use and read.</li>
            <li>It is also simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is so simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Gives accurate readings not only on the arm but on the wrist too.</li>
            <li>THIS BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR IS SIMPLE AND QUITE ACCURATE...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to purchase a pressure machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed my eating habits (lots of veggies, fruits, whole grains), exercised and avoided stress, done meditation and breathing exercises</li>
            <li>I have a problem with AFIB and this one works really well in detecting it.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient, battery operated so can use it anywhere.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable for my budget and need.</li>
            <li>AS Said Thanks</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to monitor their BP.</li>
            <li>I got this so fast</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but it is accurate, it is also easy and small.</li>
            <li>It is important to know your blood pressure readings as high blood pressure is a silent killer -- which leads to stroke and/or heart attack.</li>
            <li>As long as I follow the instructions to the letter, it&#x27;s reading accurately.</li>
            <li>Instructions are clear and not complicated.</li>
            <li>Mainly because of changing my meds.  </li>
            <li>I like this model in particular because a colleague let me borrow his</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it because of its ease, accuracy, and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had high blood pressure all my life</li>
            <li>But my home reading was still showing high BP.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li>ALL OF THEM GETTING SEVERELY HIGH READINGS...</li>
            <li>Easy to carry due to size, I would buy again</li>
            <li>My first experience with this model was at a doctor&#x27;s office and was pleasantly surprised at how little force it used to get and accurate</li>
            <li>I was told that this didn&#x27;t have all the bells &amp; whistles that other BP monitors had, but it could be counted upon to be accurate.</li>
            <li>Readings are consistent, has useful history function which displays numerous prior readings, and an irregular heartbeat indicator when observed along with pulse reading.</li>
            <li>item arrived as described, new.  </li>
            <li>This is small and seems to do an accurate job checking first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This is very basic and is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li>Very simple to set up-Does not include batteries, so have 3 triple A&#x27;s ready!  </li>
            <li>It may not be full of fancy options, but I only needed a basic pb monitor to track my clients health and fitness level.</li>
            <li>No complains so far.</li>
            <li>But that was at the early part of this year.</li>
            <li>This is an affordable, well made, professional blood pressure monitor.</li>
            <li>and there was no trouble</li>
            <li>and it stores a limited number of past readings which is nice.</li>
            <li>small and compact and easy to store.</li>
            <li>My first reading 165/96, the 2nd 156/95 and the 3rd 176/110</li>
            <li>Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes highly recommended by medical professionals.</li>
            <li>Was always about ten points to high.</li>
            <li>Before you measure your blood pressure be sure to sit down with your feet flat on the floor, breath deeply and relax for about 5 minutes and then use the monitor.  </li>
            <li>I have had machines in the past, but they never seemed to be accurate.</li>
            <li>My hubby developed high blood pressure and we wanted a way to monitor it regularly without having to run to the local CVS.</li>

            <li> I got this so fast</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  </li>

            <li> I like this model in particular because a colleague let me borrow his</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it because of its ease, accuracy, and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had high blood pressure all my life</li>

            <li> Easy to carry due to size, I would buy again</li>

            <li> I was told that this didn&#x27;t have all the bells &amp; whistles that other BP monitors had, but it could be counted upon to be accurate.</li>
            <li> Readings are consistent, has useful history function which displays numerous prior readings, and an irregular heartbeat indicator when observed along with pulse reading.</li>
            <li> item arrived as described, new.  </li>
            <li> This is small and seems to do an accurate job checking first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This is very basic and is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> Very simple to set up-Does not include batteries, so have 3 triple A&#x27;s ready!  </li>
            <li> It may not be full of fancy options, but I only needed a basic pb monitor to track my clients health and fitness level.</li>
            <li> No complains so far.</li>
            <li> But that was at the early part of this year.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable, well made, professional blood pressure monitor.</li>
            <li> and there was no trouble</li>
            <li> and it stores a limited number of past readings which is nice.</li>
            <li> small and compact and easy to store.</li>
            <li> My first reading 165/96, the 2nd 156/95 and the 3rd 176/110</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes highly recommended by medical professionals.</li>
            <li> Was always about ten points to high.</li>
            <li> Before you measure your blood pressure be sure to sit down with your feet flat on the floor, breath deeply and relax for about 5 minutes and then use the monitor.  </li>
            <li> I have had machines in the past, but they never seemed to be accurate.</li>
            <li> My hubby developed high blood pressure and we wanted a way to monitor it regularly without having to run to the local CVS.</li>
            <li> the arm wrap is way too long for me (with a regular size arms)  </li>
            <li> but you may need to take several readings if you get strange results.  </li>
            <li> I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST BECAUSE MY BLOOD PRESSURE HAD BEEN TERRIBLY HIGH FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS;</li>
            <li> I have used three different models taking at least 20 readings per day and they do last long and take a lot of abuse but the BP reading is always between 10 and 20 mm Hg higher compared with other monitors and regular BP cuffs.</li>
            <li> It works well and is something we have needed for a long time.</li>
            <li> The blood pressure readings, compared with the readings at Health Center&#x27;s pressure montior differ by upto 15 points especially systolic pressure.  </li>
            <li> the last two days this machine, specifically the Omron BP710, has consistently provided erroneous results.  </li>
            <li> This little monitor does the same job my doctor&#x27;s does.  </li>
            <li> The readings from this Omron bp monitor itself vary substantially when taken at the same time at the interval of a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been having my blood pressure read by a few different clinicians over the past several months.  </li>
            <li> It confirmed to me that this monitor was giving me wrong and inaccurate BP readings for the past months.</li>
            <li> My other version just seemed way off for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they did not provide a carrying case as my other one did but no big deal.</li>
            <li> So read carefully!</li>
            <li> I use it ever other morning and evening to keep track of my blood pressure.</li>
            <li> The machine was not consistent.</li>
            <li> Also read the return policies very carefully from anyone your purchase from on Amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes highly recommended by medical professionals.</li>
            <li> Works great and compares greatly with doctor&#x27;s office.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This monitor is not only an excellent price but it is accurate, it is also easy and small. My hubby developed high blood pressure and we wanted a way to monitor it regularly without having to run to the local CVS. We are trying to regulate him through homeopathic and diet change rather than medicinal treatment. This monitor will make it easy for us to see us to detect what works and what does not. I highly recommend it because of its ease, accuracy, and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 2013 Update: We have had this model for almost a year now and it still works great! A really good buy lasting and giving accurate readings....</li>
            <li> Not accurate. Just a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Machine is unpredictable. I shouldve returned it.</li>
            <li> I needed a blood pressure monitor to check my blood pressure regularly.  Mainly because of changing my meds.  This is small and seems to do an accurate job checking first thing in the morning.  I am very pleased with this machine.  I have had machines in the past, but they never seemed to be accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had high blood pressure all my life so I always wanted my  own sphygmomanometer.&lt;br /&gt;This one is very affordable and easy to use. It is made by the same company that makes the one my doctor uses.&lt;br /&gt;I think I get more reliable readings than those I get at the doctor&#x27;s office where I may have &amp;#34;white coat hypertension&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works well but, based on previous experiences,  I would rather it had AA battery power instead of AAA for longevity concerns.</li>
            <li> Works as expected,love it, recommend to all , tks for great product.Would recommend this to any body who wants great product</li>
            <li> The monitor is easy to operate and read blood pressure.  Great investment.  I usually take two readings to average values.</li>
            <li> Work very good and for people with vision problem easy to see from far away along with easy to set-up and use.</li>
            <li> After my yearly doctor&#x27;s appointment, my current BP monitor seemed to register too low, (had it for over 10 yrs.)&lt;br /&gt;my nurse practitioner recommended this type of BP monitor...so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use. It was delivered on time! It also store all your readings...awesome! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to purchase a pressure machine.</li>
            <li> From time to time, it fails to report anything. It also feels very tight when the pump works. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, and accurate.  Compared results with tests at Doctor&#x27;s office, and it read BP the same.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.  It is easy to use and the display is clear. Buy it with confidence.</li>
            <li> Performed exactly as I wanted, and checked out when calibrated against doctor&#x27;s office machine.  Easy to use instructions, would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very useful product at great price! My doctor uses same monitor in his office. This was a better bargain than the store brand.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got what I paid for or not.  It is 10 points [?] higher than those in my doctor&#x27;s office. Have to see about having it adjusted .</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my doctor&#x27;s office and seems to be doing the job.  It does what it says it would do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect, it was as expected and as described in the picture. No complains so far. It works great.</li>
            <li> This little monitor does the same job my doctor&#x27;s does.  It is very easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I quickly got it assembled and batteries installed, and it fired right up. It appears to be accurate and gives the heart rate, too.</li>
            <li> Very accurate, checked with doctors BP monitor on the same day.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Easy to read.  Stores readings for quick referral. gives a quick reading.  small and compact and easy to store.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay when I started using it when I bought this last year in December. I knew my BP was up because of what my dentist and cardiologist had confirmed. But that was at the early part of this year. I&#x27;ve changed my eating habits (lots of veggies, fruits, whole grains), exercised and avoided stress, done meditation and breathing exercises but my BP did not budge. On my last visit with my dentist last July, my systolic was 135. my diastolic was in the low 60s. But my home reading was still showing high BP. When I saw a regular family doctor last month, my reading at the doctor&#x27;s office was 132/80. I have started taking a BP med after this visit. When I went back for a follow up check of my BP before Thanksgiving last week, my BP reading was 110/80 - But this blood pressure monitor is still giving me readings up to 150s. It confirmed to me that this monitor was giving me wrong and inaccurate BP readings for the past months. I just ordered a new Omron  10 Series and hopefully it gives better readings if not close to the manual BP monitor readings at my doctor&#x27;s office. It is important to know your blood pressure readings as high blood pressure is a silent killer -- which leads to stroke and/or heart attack. I prefer to prevent it.</li>
            <li> I have been having my blood pressure read by a few different clinicians over the past several months.  My systolic is never below 120.  My diastolic has been slightly elevated (cause for concern since that&#x27;s the pressure being put on your circulatory system inbetween heart contractions while its &#x27;at rest&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last two days this machine, specifically the Omron BP710, has consistently provided erroneous results.  It tells me my Systolic has been between 108-115, and Diastolic 64-74.  My resting pulse is pretty inaccurate also but I will not state those numbers as fact because I&#x27;ve never been in a clinical setting to have that number evaluated at a waking time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credibility of my review?  I am a Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician who is also licensed in three states; California, Colorado, and Pennsylvania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walter Tramontana, NREMT</li>
            <li> I have a problem with AFIB and this one works really well in detecting it.  I wish it had an electric cord as well but I keep on top of changing the batteries.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, battery operated so can use it anywhere. Easy to use can check heart rate alone if need be</li>
            <li> NAME OF ITEM WAS SUGGJESTED BY THE DOCTOR. ITEM ARRIVED&lt;br /&gt;IN GOOD CONDITION AND I WAS VERY PLEASED AND EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> Thank yo the staff loves to use this bp cuff. Easy to carry due to size, I would buy again</li>
            <li> This is the first arm cuff BP monitor I&#x27;ve purchased. But, the 4th BP monitor I&#x27;ve used over the past 2-3 years. I was told that this didn&#x27;t have all the bells &amp; whistles that other BP monitors had, but it could be counted upon to be accurate. As long as I follow the instructions to the letter, it&#x27;s reading accurately. It&#x27;s reading the same that all the prior BP monitors I&#x27;ve used have read. So, this is good. It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent machine! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It created problems because it is very painful with my fat arms.</li>
            <li> It would be better if with a power adaptor.</li>
            <li> Dr. insisted I get one.  This works great, is easy to use, and isn&#x27;t bulky or hard to find a near by storage space for it.</li>
            <li> This blood pressure machine is easy to use push button and you get an read out it is that easy</li>
            <li> it does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;but the arm wrap is way too long for me (with a regular size arms)  that I have to fold half of it</li>
            <li> It works well and is something we have needed for a long time. We got the product that we ordered</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I like this model in particular because a colleague let me borrow his and it worked better than mine! The reading is simple and I find it to be more reliable in terms of being correct.  My other version just seemed way off for some reason.  Not sure why they did not provide a carrying case as my other one did but no big deal. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for simple yet reliable bp readings.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use that I can do it by myself.  It is compact and  is easy to wipe clean.</li>
            <li> Never used the product - the BP cuff was very tight.  The product specs said 13\\&quot; and although I pre-measured, it was way to tight.  Also read the return policies very carefully from anyone your purchase from on Amazon.  \\&quot;Free shipping\\&quot; is not longer free if you decide to return the item.  They will deduct it from your return.  I paid 46.22 and was returned 38.22. (I also paid over 9 bucks to return it back to them! I should of just resold it! Lesson learned for me!) Can&#x27;t dispute the sale or return; it was stated in the fine print - So read carefully!</li>
            <li> Great value, great product. It works for my purposes, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Very good product and perfect seller. Gives accurate readings not only on the arm but on the wrist too. Very happy with it. I would recommend to anybody. Amazon is always perfect. Thank you for good product.</li>
            <li> item arrived as described, new.  just make sure you have a good fit at the distal end near the elbow, especially when someone has a relatively large upper arm vs arm area near elbow</li>
            <li> i always get this brand cuz this is reliable, as the normal digital blood pressure monitor is, you have to at least take the reading two to three times to make sure you get the best and you are in the norm of what you see the first time.... reliable brand</li>
            <li> Better than most, but we still occasionally get inconsistent readings.  Good for monitoring you BP but you may need to take several readings if you get strange results.  Still not as accurate as having a reading by a professional, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Could not get it to work for us so returned and got a different one.</li>
            <li> It appears difficult for any monitor to work as well as within a medical clinic setting.  Perhaps it is more we novice users inability to actually take the readings correctly. My readings were not as consistent as I would have liked at first but are getting better with experience.  This is very basic and is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> Every time I press start, the initial reading errors out and I have to start over.  Every time!  Today, I had to wait through two error starts before it would finally take my blood pressure.  I&#x27;m sure it will eventually error out all the time.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very simple to set up-Does not include batteries, so have 3 triple A&#x27;s ready!  Would definitely recommend.  Good price, seems to be accurate.</li>
            <li> I found it to be easy to use and fast.  The price was reasonable for my budget and need.</li>
            <li> IT SUITS THE PURPOSE.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY PROBLEM IS, WITH THE SHIPPING COST,I CD BUY IT FOR THE SAME PRICE IN WAHLGRENS.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  I use it ever other morning and evening to keep track of my blood pressure.</li>
            <li> The monitor is accurate (cross-checked with other devices) and easy to use and read. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up to time.</li>
            <li> Everything AS Said Thanks ++++++++</li>
            <li> Never gave the correct blood pressure. Was always about ten points to high. The machine was not consistent. Find a better product.</li>
            <li> The blood pressure readings, compared with the readings at Health Center&#x27;s pressure montior differ by upto 15 points especially systolic pressure.  The readings from this Omron bp monitor itself vary substantially when taken at the same time at the interval of a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Its gets the job done.  It may not be full of fancy options, but I only needed a basic pb monitor to track my clients health and fitness level.</li>
            <li> Keeping tabs on your blood pressure outside of the doctor&#x27;s office is essential.  This is an affordable, well made, professional blood pressure monitor.</li>
            <li> My doctor has been monitoring my blood pressure which has been hovering around 140/89 for the past year. She suggested I try to reduce it by diet and to buy a monitor. I had my BP tested last week and it was still around 140/89. I bought this Saturday. My first reading 165/96, the 2nd 156/95 and the 3rd 176/110 (yup, I should probably be having a stroke). It&#x27;s going back. This monitors need to be accurate to be of any use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and seems accurate. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to monitor their BP. Did not come with batteries so be prepared you will need batteries.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems quite accurate. Really handy to have one at home and it stores a limited number of past readings which is nice. Includes heart rate.</li>
            <li> This monitor is compact and light weight.  It is also simple and easy to use.  I would highly recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Instructions are clear and not complicated.</li>
            <li> THIS BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR IS SIMPLE AND QUITE ACCURATE...I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST BECAUSE MY BLOOD PRESSURE HAD BEEN TERRIBLY HIGH FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS; WITH DIFFERENT DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS...ALL OF THEM GETTING SEVERELY HIGH READINGS...I AM NOW ON BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS AND MONITORING MY PRESSURE WITH THIS UNIT...SO GLAD I PURCHASED IT!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my dad, he didn&#x27;t complain so I guess it was okay and there was no trouble</li>
            <li> works good enough, it keeps you in the ballpark for accuracy</li>
            <li> My first experience with this model was at a doctor&#x27;s office and was pleasantly surprised at how little force it used to get and accurate reading.&lt;br /&gt;I got on Amazon as soon as I got home and ordered the same model.</li>
            <li> I got this so fast and i love it.</li>
            <li> It fits my arm nicely and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the machine at all.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  Easy to use.  Ease of being delivered home.  What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2013 because the Omron wrist monitor was not working for me.  Initially the readings were erratic and inconsistent.  This is as a result of user error.  Before you measure your blood pressure be sure to sit down with your feet flat on the floor, breath deeply and relax for about 5 minutes and then use the monitor.  Do not used after a heavy meal or immediately after exercise, even just walking.  Also measure several times after a pause of 2 minutes.  As soon as I started practicing the correct procedure, my readings changed dramatically.  It turned out that as a result of my change in diet and continued exercise and weight loss my numbers became so good and consistent that my doctor lowered my medication from 20 to 10 milligrams and heading for 5. Very satisfied, and highly recommend it!  It is so simple and easy to use.  Be consistent with the time you check your blood pressure.  My home measurement is very very close to the doctor&#x27;s office. Good luck!</li>
            <li> These OMRON BP monitors are not accurate. I have used three different models taking at least 20 readings per day and they do last long and take a lot of abuse but the BP reading is always between 10 and 20 mm Hg higher compared with other monitors and regular BP cuffs.Therefore you can not rely on these monitors.</li>
            <li> Have had this item for about a month now and it works quite well. Takes 4 AAA ( not included) batteries which are stated to be adequate for 300 readings. Readings are consistent, has useful history function which displays numerous prior readings, and an irregular heartbeat indicator when observed along with pulse reading.</li>
            <li> Came on time &amp; easy to use.good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and works well!</li>
            <li> The product functions as advertised.  It gives consistent results.  It functions adequately well with the reduced voltage of rechargeable AAA cells.</li>
            <li> Threw it in the trash. I wanted a plug in. Got tired of bad readings.</li>
