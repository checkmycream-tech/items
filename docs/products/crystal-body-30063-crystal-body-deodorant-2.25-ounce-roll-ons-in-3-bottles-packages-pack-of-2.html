            <li>Now let&#x27;s say you were bedridden--then it would be perfect!</li>

            <li>I ride my bike  all over in humid summer days and never have a problem, great odor protection!  </li>
            <li>This is a great poroduct and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>This item was shipped on time as promised and recieved in great condition.  </li>

            <li>that can&#x27;t have been good.    </li>
            <li>I was first given this as a gift from my mom and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>this is amazing..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to avoid the aluminum in antiperspirants, and this product has been effective for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff works effectively provided you do two things:    1)</li>
            <li>handy</li>
            <li>if you cannot afford it, you can always make your own.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for great customer service!</li>
            <li>no rash , itchiness, and can feel great and safe using it chemicals free...   </li>
            <li>But for somewhat more vigorous activities, like opening a refrigerator door, it&#x27;s just not quite up to sniff.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>

            <li>Covers up wonderfully and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it keeps me fresh, I do not need parfume in it, its just more chemicals..</li>
            <li>, I keep one in my purse but do not have to reuse it all day, put it on in the morning and smell free all day and night..</li>
            <li>We get the same great results with this product as the stick.  </li>
            <li>very effective and low cost</li>

            <li>Crystal Body must be applied to clean skin.  </li>
            <li>it means my pores are able to flow more naturally.</li>
            <li>(Tea Tree Oil soap is a nice natural option).  </li>
            <li>found good value on amazon, always cheaper to buy bigger amounts, you will use it..</li>
            <li>this works perfectly for me (male, computer tech) but not for my friend (female, photographer).</li>
            <li>/&gt;And it&#x27;s very reasonably priced on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I was looking for more than 6 months,went to health stores, bought some natural deodorants, but they all gave me alergic reactions, redness in my underarms..</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t clean and already have bacteria (you already stink), then this isn&#x27;t going to help much.    </li>
            <li>This anti-deoderant (not anti-perspirant) rolls well onto shaved AND hairy arms, covers well enough, lasts a while, and is pretty effective for the first ~10 hours after a shower.  </li>
            <li>So for $20, you get a years worth and the stick costs under $10 and most people say it will last up to 4 years or so.  </li>
            <li>very fast shipping.. will definetely buy again..   </li>
            <li>There is much concern that some of the chemicals used in most deodorants and antiperspirants are linked to major health issues; cancer, Alzheimer, etc.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing it again most likely for the duration of my life.</li>
            <li>I have used it and gone outside for most of the day to do yard work</li>
            <li>that is hot because you will sweat like a pig.</li>
            <li>(e.g. pot of coffee &#x3D; faster b.o. ;)    </li>
            <li>i tried this link, and it looks pretty promising, homemade deodorant  </li>
            <li>(very rarely)when</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell flowery and REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer this...</li>
            <li>who knows, it could be it works well for some people regardless of how much they sweat and for others, not so much.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if it works for you!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for someone who works at an office behind a computer all day or any kind of non-active job but not really for someone who is very active at work.</li>
            <li>The roll-on is better because with the stick it can crack and break and be VERY rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>So if you sweath more than the average person, you probably won&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
            <li>The price is decent, and i would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>super basic ingredients...</li>

            <li>Purified water, natural mineral salts, potassium alum, cellulose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is all natural and does the job..</li>
            <li>plus, it is natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand scented products, don&#x27;t like using anti-perspirants too often (pore clogging), and finally have found unscented, hypo-allergenic product that really works.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time because you get so much</li>
            <li>Downsides include that the roll dries out if you don&#x27;t use it regularly and that it is not effective except on freshly cleaned skin (i.e., right after a shower).  </li>
            <li>Until then I used one of the major antiperspirant solids.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It says clearly in a Chemistry book that alum is harmless and not the same as aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>2) Be very liberal with it putting it all over your armpit and way down.      </li>
            <li>My current guess is that if you must use something in addition to general hygiene and instead of an odor-masking perfume, and if you can use the crystal deodorant without noticeable skin reaction, it is probably safer than regular antiperspirant/deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s hard to find truly hypoallergenic products, and this one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I would put it on every day but on occasion I&#x27;d run out and could go for a long while without reapplying....</li>
            <li> It is not an antiperspirant, so does not keep me dry, but I don&#x27;t mind that for day to day use, as long as I don&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I just keep a stick of regular anti-perspirant/deodorant for when I play sports or need to limit perpiration for other reasons.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this stuff. I will be purchasing it again most likely for the duration of my life. God bless everyone. Peace and prosperity be with you.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, as I&#x27;m all for natural ingredients and products endorsed by cancer treatment centers. But sadly I&#x27;m not quite sedentary enough for the Crystal to work. Now let&#x27;s say you were bedridden--then it would be perfect! But for somewhat more vigorous activities, like opening a refrigerator door, it&#x27;s just not quite up to sniff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now.  It does work!  It is not an antiperspirant!  It will not keep you from sweating.  It only keeps bacteria from causing odor.  It will not last for 24 hours or days or weeks. It must be applied every day. The area it is applied to must be clean and dry.  It works even if one is NOT a couch potato.  I have used it and gone outside for most of the day to do yard work and while I did sweat from the heat and humidity (Louisiana), I did not smell. I began using it after developing fluid cysts in my breasts from blocked pores.  I guess if one doesn&#x27;t allow their body to sweat as designed, the fluid ends up going someplace else. Until then I used one of the major antiperspirant solids.  I could go days without reapplying but did anyway every morning. It was almost impossible to wash off. There is much concern that some of the chemicals used in most deodorants and antiperspirants are linked to major health issues; cancer, Alzheimer, etc.  This is the only product I will use now.  I have other deodorants/antiperspirants (bought for who knows what insane reason overtook me at the moment of purchase) but have never used them.  I would rather run the risk of sweating a little than causing serious damage to my body.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for someone who works at an office behind a computer all day or any kind of non-active job but not really for someone who is very active at work. You still need to keep an antiperspirant deodorant around for playing sports or just going out anywhere that is hot because you will sweat like a pig.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all the normal kinds of antiperspirant/deodorants, so I thought I could try this, and it works great. I don&#x27;t wear antiperspirants because of the aluminum, paraben and PROPYLENE GLYCOL. Crystal Body must be applied to clean skin. I had no allergic reaction to it at all, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very effective and low cost product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Purified water, natural mineral salts, potassium alum, cellulose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says clearly in a Chemistry book that alum is harmless and not the same as aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who knows really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s a person to do? My current guess is that if you must use something in addition to general hygiene and instead of an odor-masking perfume, and if you can use the crystal deodorant without noticeable skin reaction, it is probably safer than regular antiperspirant/deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with your deodorant decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for about 5 years and it has been increasingly harder to find them in the stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon.    He just loves the clean way that it goes on and the fact that there is no annoying smell or liquid to deal with. Definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> This is a great poroduct and it works wonderfully.  Only problem?  As the description shows, this item is sold as 2 packs of 3 bottles.  An order quantity of one means six bottles.  I ordered a quantity of two.  Should have been twelve bottles total.  I received eight bottles.  Amazon can&#x27;t count.  Amazon ignored my request for assistance in making this right, and also did not respond to any further communications.  This level of inaccuracy and absolutely terrible customer service is the reason I&#x27;m not likely to buy from Amazon again.</li>

I had no allergic reaction to it at all, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very effective and low cost product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Purified water, natural mineral salts, potassium alum, cellulose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says clearly in a Chemistry book that alum is harmless and not the same as aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who knows really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s a person to do?  My current guess is that if you must use something in addition to general hygiene and instead of an odor-masking perfume, and if you can use the crystal deodorant without noticeable skin reaction, it is probably safer than regular antiperspirant/deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with your deodorant decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to avoid the aluminum in antiperspirants, and this product has been effective for me.</li>
            <li> Like most I was a bit skeptical on this stuff.  I wanted to move away from rubbing aluminum in my pores everyday.  This stuff works effectively provided you do two things:    1) Wash your armpits in the shower well, preferably with an antibacterial soap (Tea Tree Oil soap is a nice natural option).  This stuff prevents bacteria growth but if you aren&#x27;t clean and already have bacteria (you already stink), then this isn&#x27;t going to help much.    2) Be very liberal with it putting it all over your armpit and way down.      The two drawbacks to this product are:    1) It is NOT an anti-perspirant. So if you sweath more than the average person, you probably won&#x27;t like this product.  Otherwise I just keep a stick of regular anti-perspirant/deodorant for when I play sports or need to limit perpiration for other reasons.    2) I haven&#x27;t used the stick/rock form yet but it appears I&#x27;m going to go through the liquid form at about the rate of 1 bottle every 2 months.  So for $20, you get a years worth and the stick costs under $10 and most people say it will last up to 4 years or so.  I may go with the stick when I run out of the roll-on liquid.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only natural deodorants that keep me feeling and smelling fresh! Other brands that I have tried have left me with peeling skin, or needing to reapply several times a day to \\&quot;keep the stinkies at bay\\&quot;. It is not an antiperspirant, so does not keep me dry, but I don&#x27;t mind that for day to day use, as long as I don&#x27;t have an odor. I do have an antiperspirant that I use (very rarely)when I know I will be in a situation that requires a fight against odor and wetness (like speaking in front of a group of people).</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have found.  I gave my mom and best friend one. I was first given this as a gift from my mom and I was very impressed.  Covers up wonderfully and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Hi all,  I got scared of using body antiperspirants with tons of chemicals in it, maybe linked to breast cancer? I was looking for more than 6 months,went to health stores, bought some natural deodorants, but they all gave me alergic reactions, redness in my underarms.. I was hopeless, then finally one day I tried this one, first the rock version, I didn&#x27;t believe it it would actualy work and suprised I was.. works for 24 hours, I do sweat a lot, but that is naturaly for our bodies.. we need to sweat to regulate temperature, but no smell.. it keeps me fresh, I do not need parfume in it, its just more chemicals.. this is all natural and does the job.. I found the rock heavy and u have to wet it every time, so I started using this roll on version, works well as well, handy, I keep one in my purse but do not have to reuse it all day, put it on in the morning and smell free all day and night.. this is amazing.. no rash , itchiness, and can feel great and safe using it chemicals free...   found good value on amazon, always cheaper to buy bigger amounts, you will use it.. very fast shipping.. will definetely buy again..   good luck everyone, hope it works for you as well..</li>
            <li> Truly hypoallergenic!  This anti-deoderant (not anti-perspirant) rolls well onto shaved AND hairy arms, covers well enough, lasts a while, and is pretty effective for the first ~10 hours after a shower.  Downsides include that the roll dries out if you don&#x27;t use it regularly and that it is not effective except on freshly cleaned skin (i.e., right after a shower).  So for an evening touch-up, you&#x27;ll need another product (e.g., a stick).  Also has no chance against stress-sweat.  But it&#x27;s hard to find truly hypoallergenic products, and this one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell flowery and REALLY works.  I don&#x27;t know about the hypoallergenic stuff cause I wasn&#x27;t allergic to any others anyway, but I&#x27;m on my second order.  It lasts a long time because you get so much but alas not forever.  I ride my bike  all over in humid summer days and never have a problem, great odor protection!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant because it does not leave a sticky residue. plus, it is natural and organic.  The price is decent, and i would recommend it.  if you cannot afford it, you can always make your own.  i tried this link, and it looks pretty promising, homemade deodorant  [...]</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past few years and highly recommend it to anyone, especially if there is some kind of allergy to the usual deodorant products.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped on time as promised and recieved in great condition.  I will shop here again.  Thanks for great customer service!</li>
            <li> We get the same great results with this product as the stick.  The roll-on is better because with the stick it can crack and break and be VERY rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand scented products, don&#x27;t like using anti-perspirants too often (pore clogging), and finally have found unscented, hypo-allergenic product that really works. It&#x27;s close to the power of an anti-perspirant, so I find I can use this almost all the time, even in Florida summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s very reasonably priced on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product... super basic ingredients... this works perfectly for me (male, computer tech) but not for my friend (female, photographer). Granted, I don&#x27;t sweat a lot in my profession/day-to-day and usually only have odor based on what I&#x27;ve eaten/drunk (e.g. pot of coffee &#x3D; faster b.o. ;)    When I used to use the stick stuff, I could literally go a week (including showers) before my pores would open up again... I would put it on every day but on occasion I&#x27;d run out and could go for a long while without reapplying.... even my preferred deoderant/anti-pers -- Ban roll-on (green cap) -- also really lasted for me.     But it seemed unnatural to suddenly have my pores open up a week later and flush what they needed to flush... that can&#x27;t have been good.    With Crystal Body, I probably can go a day (two tops) without reapplying... it works GREAT for the day...I much prefer this... it means my pores are able to flow more naturally. But for someone who sweats/odors profusely, this might not work well for you... who knows, it could be it works well for some people regardless of how much they sweat and for others, not so much.    Highly recommended if it works for you!</li>
