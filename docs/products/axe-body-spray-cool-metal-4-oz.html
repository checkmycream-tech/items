            <li>I do not think it&#x27;s a good choice to mix with the use of cologne when leaving the house.</li>
            <li>recommend Cool Metal :D</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy planning to buy more the reason I&#x27;m giving the four star</li>
            <li>love it, the scent compliments my cologne!</li>
            <li>It is a nice smelling body spray, but it does&lt;br /&gt;seem</li>
            <li>so we were pleased to find it at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Axe products for many years, and loved this fragance.  </li>
            <li>It is good for a quick fix</li>
            <li>I have this in a body wash and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay scent I guess.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite spray from Axe</li>
            <li>My Husbands favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Glad we were able to find it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, could do better job</li>
            <li>You do get what you pay for but for this product the price was very reasonable, so I am very pleased with that.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly fast ship all good</li>
            <li>Strong but not overpowering</li>
            <li>definitely a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;cool&#x27; scent, for lack of a better description.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the first Axe body spray he has had that I can tolerate.</li>
            <li>but definitely not something that is attractive to the ladies.</li>
            <li>say it wears off quickly, which I don&#x27;t find very true.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to go super strong throughout the day.</li>
            <li>, reapplication is quick and easy</li>
            <li>However it works great since I used it in the evening or if I am expected to be home.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and fresh (without making you feel like you just put some laundry detergent on you type of smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it thanks</li>
            <li>Smells really good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and they are right.</li>
            <li>I would have prefer a more moderate projection as opposed to the two extremes.</li>
            <li>Great price @ Amazon and long lasting.</li>
            <li>this item took a little long to arrive but the overall fragrance is good a pretty good deal for 3 pack</li>
            <li>I was expecting a really good smell my fiance likes it but does not love it.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husband as it is the only scent that was available on subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>I recently found this cool metal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complimentary, but not the same as the shower gel.</li>
            <li>He got a three pack which should last him a while, but if this scent is still available when he  runs out I will definitely reorder this for him.</li>
            <li>I very much like the scent, initially is it overpowering</li>
            <li>(I am very sensitive to smell).</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot more than the usual person even indoors</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t feel like paying retail prices in the store and the scents he has had in the past have been too overwhelming and actually gave me a headache</li>
            <li>I bought it via amazon because this particular one was virtually not available in stores in the area where I live.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;ll last very well for at least a couple hours, but it&#x27;s already a pretty subtle smell to begin with</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used axe body spray for quite some time. I recently found this cool metal. It is a nice smelling body spray, but it does&lt;br /&gt;seem like it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some of the other axe body sprays.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have this in a body wash and love it.I like this scent best of any Axe body washes. I read somewhere on here someone stated ,It doesn&#x27;t last long. I ignored the comment and decided to buy it anyway and they are right.It is good for a quick fix but if you plan to spray and stay it won&#x27;t do the trick.Doesn&#x27;t last long.That is why I gave it only three stars.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I like this one. Haven&#x27;t seen it stores before but I really like it. Great price too</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really good smell my fiance likes it but does not love it. It&#x27;s an okay scent I guess.</li>
            <li> I use body spray because my body reacts nasty to anti-perspirants. The smell is light and fresh (without making you feel like you just put some laundry detergent on you type of smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone out there would offer a mix or mix-and-match purcahse option (buying 3 or 6 pack of the same scent is boring)</li>
            <li> Smells like ginger, why would I want to smell like ginger</li>
            <li> This is Axe&#x27;s best scent in my honest opinion.  I&#x27;ve been through a variety of them, and also like the Anarchy For Him scent, but this definitely beats that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it wears off quickly, which I don&#x27;t find very true.  It&#x27;ll last very well for at least a couple hours, but it&#x27;s already a pretty subtle smell to begin with so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to go super strong throughout the day. But that&#x27;s okay, reapplication is quick and easy :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend Cool Metal :D</li>
            <li> My wife usually hates the Axe products, but she likes this scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything else out there.  It&#x27;s a &#x27;cool&#x27; scent, for lack of a better description.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband as it is the only scent that was available on subscribe and save.  This one is a dud.  I think it may have made him sweat more or smell worse, because it was BAD.  Instead of a light fragrance, all we got was bad BO.  Never had this problem with other Axe products, but since using this one, he&#x27;s switched to Degree.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly fast ship all good</li>
            <li> This fragrance is kind of weird considering all the previous axe I have used for years now. Price was much lesser, I guess the weirdness was probably the reason for it low price.</li>
            <li> I very much like the scent, initially is it overpowering (guess it&#x27;s what Axe is) and withing an hour or two it is simply close to the body. I would have prefer a more moderate projection as opposed to the two extremes. However it works great since I used it in the evening or if I am expected to be home. I do not think it&#x27;s a good choice to mix with the use of cologne when leaving the house.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite spray from Axe and I like it a lot too.  It&#x27;s recently become difficult to find in stores so we were pleased to find it at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> excellent have to get your Axe on</li>
            <li> Strong but not overpowering</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot more than the usual person even indoors so it works for me I&#x27;m happy planning to buy more the reason I&#x27;m giving the four star is because I&#x27;m not sure how long it lasts by me they don&#x27;t last too long but that&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> My Husbands favorite fragrance.  Seems to have been discontinued on the shelves.  Very Glad we were able to find it.</li>
            <li> love it, the scent compliments my cologne!</li>
            <li> definitely a strong smell. but definitely not something that is attractive to the ladies. go for the chocolate dark desire one.</li>
            <li> Great price @ Amazon and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Axe products for many years, and loved this fragance.  It has some wooden notes and is persistent (within what you can expect from a regular body spray).  I bought it via amazon because this particular one was virtually not available in stores in the area where I live.</li>
            <li> My teenage son insists on Axe body spray but I really don&#x27;t feel like paying retail prices in the store and the scents he has had in the past have been too overwhelming and actually gave me a headache (I am very sensitive to smell). This is honestly the first Axe body spray he has had that I can tolerate. The scent is not overwhelming to the point of being nauseating. It is actually a very nice and refined scent, something you would find in more expensive colognes. He likes the fact that it lasts all day. Unlike some of the cheaper brands that wear off, you can still smell this when he gets home from school even though he doesn&#x27;t reapply it during the day. You do get what you pay for but for this product the price was very reasonable, so I am very pleased with that. Definitely worth the money. He got a three pack which should last him a while, but if this scent is still available when he  runs out I will definitely reorder this for him.</li>
            <li> Discontinued scent so I&#x27;m happy to find it. love it thanks</li>
            <li> this item took a little long to arrive but the overall fragrance is good a pretty good deal for 3 pack</li>
            <li> Best price I have seen anywhere.</li>
            <li> This bodyspray isn&#x27;t too bad but it doesn&#x27;t have the same citrus notes as the shower gel. It&#x27;s complimentary, but not the same as the shower gel.</li>
            <li> great to find a 3 pack</li>
            <li> Smells really good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, could do better job a keeping me dry though...</li>
