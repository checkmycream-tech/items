            <li>That doesn&#x27;t pose a problem for me as I own a powerstrip with a USB port, but I wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be a \\&quot;not so good\\&quot; surprise for</li>
            <li>Got this in the other day looks good works good very bright  </li>
            <li>Item was bright and beautifully designed, but the cord is incredibly short and has the inconvenience of a USB for a plug.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in good condition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great service.</li>

            <li>Beyond excited to get this today.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!</li>
            <li>i would have liked a switch but its not a deal breaker because this is my second one.  </li>
            <li>First not all the parts were there the stands an the screws were not in the box</li>
            <li>i preferred to buy a tried and true by me without a switch than to test a new brand with a switch.</li>
            <li>The price on this seemed much more reasonable than others of the same size that I&#x27;ve looked at.</li>
            <li>than i thoughtbut works for large tats..</li>
            <li>A lot of these sellers would never survive in the real retail platform.  </li>
            <li>no where near worth 50 bucks.</li>
            <li>only issue with this as a light box is an on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>The table doesn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li>Well what can I say I thought it would have been a different style of light source the way the placed the lights same effect can be made from buying a scaner printer</li>
            <li>i really wanted this product for awhile now, and finally got at decent price, and even though i have, it is still little over price, the machinery is actually pretty simple, there is not even a power button, just plug it up for it to work, i would recommend to anyone who does some kind of tracing especially for tattoos, i can&#x27;t speak for pros though just beginners</li>
            <li>When I plugged it up only top half of the board lit up.</li>
            <li>arrived early could be brighter but is sufficient.</li>
            <li>Upset i wasted my money even more pissed its nothing like what was expected.</li>
            <li>The cable sticking out looks like it&#x27;s been hot glued down.</li>

            <li> And the one that I received does not have the feet as shown in the picture, slipping may be a problem, and it sits flat to the work suface.  </li>

            <li> I got a flimsy piece of plastic with a MAYBE foot long of a cord, which has to be held in a certain spot to even turn on, no \\&quot;table\\&quot; like legs to it just a small thin plastic sheet with lights...and the piece of \\&quot;glass\\&quot; is scratched all over like its been used or slid across gravel...</li>
            <li> Its cracked missing pieces, dirty and out right garbage!</li>
            <li> I was half way through drawing when it did this so it just wasted my money and time</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> it is so sleek and takes up very little room.</li>
            <li> The board still works though not very bright, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Item was poorly cared for during the finishing stages and the packaging.</li>
            <li> The worse thing ever, it looked used and it didn&#x27;t work, waist of money and time!!!</li>
            <li> this is the worst quality item I&#x27;ve ever received from amazon to date.  </li>
            <li> worst 40 dollars</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest piece of crap!</li>

            <li> I bought this unit for my son, who is a tattoo artist and it works great. He loves it and uses it constantly.</li>
            <li> This is the worst cheaply made led light table. First not all the parts were there the stands an the screws were not in the box so it came to me in pieces! Also didn&#x27;t even work this is the worst quality item I&#x27;ve ever received from amazon to date.  So now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a decoration in a land fill. worst 40 dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent in my life. A lot of these sellers would never survive in the real retail platform.  An this is obviously one of them. If I could put 0 stars I would  I do not recommend this seller or there products.</li>
            <li> i really wanted this product for awhile now, and finally got at decent price, and even though i have, it is still little over price, the machinery is actually pretty simple, there is not even a power button, just plug it up for it to work, i would recommend to anyone who does some kind of tracing especially for tattoos, i can&#x27;t speak for pros though just beginners</li>
            <li> Got this in the other day looks good works good very bright  the cord cod have been longer its bit short</li>
            <li> I ordered this light table for my fashion sketching and love it. It is bright and just the right size for my desk top. Fast shipping and great service.</li>
            <li> Does the job but is cheaply made. Make sure to have a USB port to plug into</li>
            <li> Came in on time and works great. No defects, all lights work, just what I was looking for.Thank you again. Jonathan.</li>
            <li> Im a tattoo artis and it turned off and it hasnt turned back on no matter were I plug it in at. I was half way through drawing when it did this so it just wasted my money and time</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest piece of crap! Its cracked missing pieces, dirty and out right garbage! I am so upset at the quality of this!</li>
            <li> The worse thing ever, it looked used and it didn&#x27;t work, waist of money and time!!!</li>
            <li> very nice received in good shape. arrived early could be brighter but is sufficient. would recommend. reason for 4 stars is brightness</li>
            <li> When I plugged it up only top half of the board lit up. The board still works though not very bright, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Could be brighter but it gets the job done, and is portable...I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Item was bright and beautifully designed, but the cord is incredibly short and has the inconvenience of a USB for a plug. Item was poorly cared for during the finishing stages and the packaging. Item is scratched in every corner next to the bolts. either it was USED or quality control isn&#x27;t practiced through this company. Item is an xmas gift so it&#x27;ll have to do. Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it came. I have to be honest I had to press on the back before it worked then it lit up and it was so bright oh my gosh! it is so sleek and takes up very little room. It is just perfect for doing hand drawn animations.</li>
            <li> product was just as described , works just fine.seems to work well for tatoo tracing.was a little smaller than i thoughtbut works for large tats..</li>
            <li> I received this today and its exactly what I wanted and NEEDED :D THANK YOU SO MUCH!! its soo lightweight and perfect size to draw on your lap or anywhere in your room. I can&#x27;t wait to start drawing on it!</li>
            <li> I have wished for a light box for craft projects for some time.  The price on this seemed much more reasonable than others of the same size that I&#x27;ve looked at. I do wish it were a bit brighter. And the one that I received does not have the feet as shown in the picture, slipping may be a problem, and it sits flat to the work suface.  Also, nowhere in the description is it mentioned at the power source for this item is USB. That doesn&#x27;t pose a problem for me as I own a powerstrip with a USB port, but I wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be a \\&quot;not so good\\&quot; surprise for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Light weight&lt;br /&gt;  Portable&lt;br /&gt;  Price&lt;br /&gt;  Arrived quickly and in good condition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No feet as pictured&lt;br /&gt;  USB powered&lt;br /&gt;  Could be brighter</li>
            <li> I love it, it works good, lights are very bright and its well made. Only dislike is the short cord to plug it into an outlet.</li>
            <li> Beyond excited to get this today. open it up and its garbage. I got a flimsy piece of plastic with a MAYBE foot long of a cord, which has to be held in a certain spot to even turn on, no \\&quot;table\\&quot; like legs to it just a small thin plastic sheet with lights...and the piece of \\&quot;glass\\&quot; is scratched all over like its been used or slid across gravel...no where near worth 50 bucks. Upset i wasted my money even more pissed its nothing like what was expected.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say I thought it would have been a different style of light source the way the placed the lights same effect can be made from buying a scaner printer</li>
            <li> The light table was ordered for another person to use as I do not do Tattoos.  Those who use the light table are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. It broke minutes after I pulled it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cable isn&#x27;t long enough to reach an outlet from a desk unless it is immediately below it. The cable sticking out looks like it&#x27;s been hot glued down.</li>
            <li> The table doesn&#x27;t look new. There are several spots and some risks in the glass....</li>
            <li> only issue with this as a light box is an on/off switch.  you have to unplug the connection from the baby pigtail coming out of the box itself.  i would have liked a switch but its not a deal breaker because this is my second one.  i preferred to buy a tried and true by me without a switch than to test a new brand with a switch.</li>
