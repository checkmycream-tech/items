            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>And forget about the bathroom smelling nice after your shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>If I could buy the scent, and add it to my own products of choice, I&#x27;d do that.  </li>

            <li>AND I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for more, you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;m worrying for nothing. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been exceptionally pleased with Philosophy&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this product in the morning.</li>
            <li>If you love the cinnamon buns shampp/body wash/etc then pick up a stick of the lip</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; and the Cinnamon Buns smells just like walking by Cinnabons in the mall.</li>
            <li>OK, so I bought it just to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>detergents\\&quot; that are referred to on most household and beauty products intended to clean.  </li>
            <li>i understand this is true of many philosophy products, i guess they dont want to have the shower gel compete with any perfume one might wear</li>
            <li>I can see myself being a loyal customer for many years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing so, I liked it so much that afterwards I got a couple others too.</li>
            <li>Fabulous lather and foam.</li>
            <li>Great for washing your hair (actually won a shampoo award - so I&#x27;m told).</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is light and creamy and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this product as a shampoo, but enjoy it as a shower gel.</li>
            <li>I have my hair highlighted, and this product actually works great on color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a body wash, although I did try it as a shampoo...</li>
            <li>I feel clean afterwards and smell like cinnamon buns.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quite, quite pleasant while it does last.</li>
            <li>Both spicy and sweet, it&#x27;s no wonder my husband likes this scent on me.  </li>
            <li>Smells super sweet and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>a more personal opinion, I like it much better as a body wash than as a shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>The first notes are soft, warm, and smooth, like the aroma of fresh sweet rolls baking.  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like cinnamon bun icing!</li>
            <li>Worth it, really.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be eating cinnamon buns, but the smell puts you right in a bakery.</li>
            <li>Exactly like cinnamon buns fresh out of the oven.  </li>
            <li>the scent in the shower is strong enough to wake you up and make you smile on a monday morning!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little pricey, but it was a good decision...</li>
            <li>I bought this after much hemming and hawing, and kicked myself for not getting it sooner!</li>
            <li>Just like the real thing!</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will be trying other scents as well!</li>
            <li>The fragrances are all strong and positive experiences, the all-in-one aspect is convenient, and the conditioning it provides for my long hair makes a significant difference I can feel.  </li>
            <li>overall a good product if used as bubble bath or shower gel just dont expect the scent to last.</li>
            <li>However... my HUSBAND loves this stuff as much as I do.</li>
            <li>bought a no brand 3 in one product at Target, it was much cheaper, but not as silky and foamy as this</li>
            <li>My partner loves this scent so much he wants to bathe our dog in it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for shower gel, go for it - the scent is a nice little perk.  </li>
            <li>Great product--you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li>I assume you&#x27;ll like it if your hair&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling soft and nice but i wish the scent lingered a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>These are the \\&quot;natural, coconut based surfactants/</li>
            <li>Instead, I use sodium tallowate (old fashioned soap) for my skin, and baking soda dissolved in water for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh, and has a light conditioner (although I choose to use additional conditioner).</li>
            <li>i love the scent of this product however it did not last much past stepping put of the shower, also do not use this as shampoo if you color your hair-it strips the color out.</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t go for the fancy-schmancy bath products and such but cinnamon buns??!</li>
            <li>I have waist long hair, and haven&#x27;t had much luck with it as a shampoo, I&#x27;d only use it as that if you have short hair)But</li>

            <li> I have waist long hair, and haven&#x27;t had much luck with it as a shampoo, I&#x27;d only use it as that if you have short hair)But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pearly white in color, and the scent permeates the shower, but doesn&#x27;t tend to last long unless you use it as a shampoo and use an unscented conditioner</li>
            <li> you have to squeeze it to get the product out, but the hardness of the plastic makes it crease near the bottom half after repeated squeezings - but mine&#x27;s almost gone, and no leaks,</li>
            <li> , it lathers up rich and thick and works just as well as a shampoo as it does a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> The lather and suds are unbelievable and leave your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This is a soap of average quality that smells like cinnamon - for a moment or two.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the bottle...</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d smelled a few of Philosophy&#x27;s other &amp;quot;food&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> so I will see if this makes a difference in keeping the aroma going a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> With this 3 in one product being $1/ounce it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> products before but nothing as dead on as this one is.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just because my hair is unbelievably curly, frizzy &amp;amp;</li>
            <li> but I found the aroma of the product very faint and non lasting compared to other bath products I have used.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like the icing on a cinnamon bun, and the product itself is thick -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because of the inclusion of a common but irritating ingredient, I no longer purchase or use this product.</li>
            <li> but i found it very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I love this product! I gotta give kudos for the creators of this line at Philosophy. Normally, I don&#x27;t go for the fancy-schmancy bath products and such but cinnamon buns??! I knew I had to try it. After doing so, I liked it so much that afterwards I got a couple others too. They&#x27;re really good to treat yourself once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d smelled a few of Philosophy&#x27;s other &amp;quot;food&amp;quot; products before but nothing as dead on as this one is. It does smell kinda like a bakery. I got it over the holidays which made for lovely winter showers. The smell is amazing. I gotta say, it&#x27;s not as long-lasting as they claim it is but it&#x27;s quite, quite pleasant while it does last. Worth it, really.&lt;br /&gt;On a more personal opinion, I like it much better as a body wash than as a shampoo and conditioner but that&#x27;s just because my hair is unbelievably curly, frizzy &amp;amp; rebellious. I assume you&#x27;ll like it if your hair&#x27;s normal. However, on the occasions that I have used it on my head too, I do smell like cinnamon all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, of all of Philosophy&#x27;s creative-smelling 3-in-1 products I&#x27;d have to say that this is the very best one. I enjoyed the formula and I liked, make that LOVED, the smell. I truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really lathers great and works just as well on the hair as it does as a body wash........but I found the aroma of the product very faint and non lasting compared to other bath products I have used.  I just ordered the Cinnamon Buns body lotion so I will see if this makes a difference in keeping the aroma going a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and you can use it for multiple purposes. I have only used it as a shampoo and body wash and it makes my shower experince so heavenly.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it as a bubble bath but hopefully soon!  It is so rich and makes a great lather.  I feel clean afterwards and smell like cinnamon buns.  This is some good stuff!</li>
            <li> i love the scent of this product however it did not last much past stepping put of the shower, also do not use this as shampoo if you color your hair-it strips the color out. it left my skin feeling soft and nice but i wish the scent lingered a little bit longer. i understand this is true of many philosophy products, i guess they dont want to have the shower gel compete with any perfume one might wear but i found it very disappointing. overall a good product if used as bubble bath or shower gel just dont expect the scent to last.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great idea. Fabulous lather and foam. Great for washing your hair (actually won a shampoo award - so I&#x27;m told). Use all over body. Fabulous. Smells exactly like cinnamon bun icing! This is one of philosophy&#x27;s most popular and I keep one in my guest bathroom at all times and my guests always rave about it and then order their own.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but not like cinnamon buns to me.  I like it, but probably not enough to order it again.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  WE BOTH LOVE THE SCENT AND THE WAY IT LATHERS AND I LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS ON MY SKIN.  I WILL USE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product and the way it smelled. It doesn&#x27;t overpower and smell like chemicals the way others can. It is light and creamy and although I don&#x27;t use it as a shampoo, I like that I can get it on my hair and not worry that it might damage it. Very pleased and will be trying other scents as well!</li>
            <li> The scent of cinnamon buns is true and it smells great while showering. It does not stay on the skin though. They need to make a matching lotion!</li>
            <li> Cinnamon Buns, is by far the very best scent I have ever used!!!!! I will be stocking up on this one!</li>
            <li> Please, if you have any illusions about a cinnamon buns scent that lingers on your skin, forget about it.  This is a soap of average quality that smells like cinnamon - for a moment or two.  The scent is gone before I even finishing rinsing it away.  And forget about the bathroom smelling nice after your shower or bath.  I even tried it in my hair, thinking that would help the scent to stay around.  It didn&#x27;t work.  If you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for shower gel, go for it - the scent is a nice little perk.  But if you&#x27;re looking for more, you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
            <li> I bought this after much hemming and hawing, and kicked myself for not getting it sooner! Oh my god, the wonderfulness is astounding! It smells just like the icing on a cinnamon bun, and the product itself is thick - it&#x27;s like using the consistency of hand lotion for shower gel! It&#x27;s pearly white in color, and the scent permeates the shower, but doesn&#x27;t tend to last long unless you use it as a shampoo and use an unscented conditioner (A Caveat: I have waist long hair, and haven&#x27;t had much luck with it as a shampoo, I&#x27;d only use it as that if you have short hair)But the scent in the shower is strong enough to wake you up and make you smile on a monday morning! This does not strip your skin of moisture, either. My only complaint would be the bottle...you have to squeeze it to get the product out, but the hardness of the plastic makes it crease near the bottom half after repeated squeezings - but mine&#x27;s almost gone, and no leaks, so maybe I&#x27;m worrying for nothing. :)</li>
            <li> Both spicy and sweet, it&#x27;s no wonder my husband likes this scent on me.  The first notes are soft, warm, and smooth, like the aroma of fresh sweet rolls baking.  Then you get a kick of cinnamon in the nose, stronger than even if you were eating a cinnamon bun.  I&#x27;ve been exceptionally pleased with Philosophy&#x27;s products.  The fragrances are all strong and positive experiences, the all-in-one aspect is convenient, and the conditioning it provides for my long hair makes a significant difference I can feel.  I can see myself being a loyal customer for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated May 2010:  I have stopped buying products made with sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, because I have found I&#x27;m allergic to them.  These are the \\&quot;natural, coconut based surfactants/detergents\\&quot; that are referred to on most household and beauty products intended to clean.  They are considered skin irritants;  everyone will have some degree of reaction to them.  Instead, I use sodium tallowate (old fashioned soap) for my skin, and baking soda dissolved in water for my hair.  I do miss the wonderful fragrances of philosophy&#x27;s products.  If I could buy the scent, and add it to my own products of choice, I&#x27;d do that.  Unfortunately, because of the inclusion of a common but irritating ingredient, I no longer purchase or use this product.</li>
            <li> I love to use this product in the morning. I won&#x27;t be eating cinnamon buns, but the smell puts you right in a bakery. It smells like the icing used for cinnamon buns. The scent doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfume that might be used after showering. I don&#x27;t use this product as a shampoo, but enjoy it as a shower gel. The lather and suds are unbelievable and leave your skin feeling soft. This makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent gift for a women. I gave my mother Cinnamon Buns and my sister Pumpkin Pie. It can be used for either shampoo, body wash or a bubble bath. Smells AMAZING! Just like the real thing!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shower gel! Smells super sweet and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the scent would last longer though.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  It smells wonderful, it lathers up rich and thick and works just as well as a shampoo as it does a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells but it gave me a rash! I guess anything spicy just does not work for me. I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Philosophy has always made great products and this is my \\&quot;christmas staple\\&quot; I buy the largest bottle I can find to get me through the winter months and my husband is thankful every year. If you love the cinnamon buns shampp/body wash/etc then pick up a stick of the lip gloss it truly is heaven.</li>
            <li> With this 3 in one product being $1/ounce it&#x27;s a little pricey. However... my HUSBAND loves this stuff as much as I do. We&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; and the Cinnamon Buns smells just like walking by Cinnabons in the mall. I have my hair highlighted, and this product actually works great on color treated hair. It&#x27;s not too harsh, and has a light conditioner (although I choose to use additional conditioner). It&#x27;s great for traveling. One bottle for shampoo, soap, conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a no brand 3 in one product at Target, it was much cheaper, but not as silky and foamy as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought it just to give it a try.  I thought it was a little pricey, but it was a good decision...it gives you a scrumptious, \\&quot;cuddle up with a good book\\&quot; kind of feeling.  I am definitely going to re-order.  I use it primarily as a body wash, although I did try it as a shampoo...I wish they had a matching conditioner.  Great product--you won&#x27;t be sorry.  I am going to order as a gift for a hard-to-buy-for relative.  She&#x27;s going to love it, too!</li>
            <li> Smells fantsatic.  Exactly like cinnamon buns fresh out of the oven.  Also lathers well and produces a wonderful bubble bath.  This is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> I put this in a bathroom soap dispenser for Christmas, and it adds a nice touch during the holiday season.  Smells nice and lathers well.</li>
            <li> My partner loves this scent so much he wants to bathe our dog in it.</li>
