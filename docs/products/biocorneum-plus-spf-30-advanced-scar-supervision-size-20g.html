            <li>Her doctor hadn&#x27;t even recommended it, he recommended ScarGuard MD, which he sells for a markup, but bioCorneum is the best and the 50g size lasts about 2 months depending on how conservative you are with the scars.</li>

            <li>I am very Pleased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li>The surgeon recommended this to and we&#x27;re glad we listened!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very important to have a good routine and products,</li>
            <li>This is amazing I recommend this for everyone that has scars.</li>
            <li>Great product, got it for after my girlfriends surgery, worth the money</li>
            <li>The consistency of it is nice, so it&#x27;s easy and there is no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>The scars are remarkably more faded.  </li>
            <li>Purchases came on time and safe.</li>
            <li>RECOMMENDED BY ALL THE TOP SURGEONS.</li>
            <li>I religiously used it twice a day for about 3 months and my scar looks great!  </li>
            <li>I do think you have to use it religiously for a period of time for the best results.</li>
            <li>My wife recently had breast reduction surgery and this has been the best her scars have improved.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used ScarGuard MD, Bio Oil, and ScarAway scar strips, but the most rapid changes have come from bioCorneum</li>
            <li>many, many times.</li>
            <li>If your Dr. knows what they&#x27;re doing you may be OK.</li>
            <li>This is maybe just somewhat more convenient.</li>
            <li>That works way better</li>
            <li>I bought more and still use it because of the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know I would have paid more buying this from a doctor.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>This stuff may help more quickly flatten it.</li>
            <li>(keep the scar protected and moist for best scar healing), so I did that 24/7 for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with how well this has worked at diminishing the appearance of a large scar.</li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference on my scar.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge scar from hip to hip and a T shape on both breasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally convinced that this removes scars but this is the product my doctor (well-known, great reputation) recommended.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Apparently Angelina Jolie used it after her surgery, so it must be good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in the scar on which I&#x27;ve applied the cream.  </li>
            <li>Has lightened the scar significantly.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product almost everyday for a month and the difference in the scar is incredible, its almost completly unnoticable in some areas.  </li>
            <li>The older one is a lot more faded.  </li>
            <li>This was  highly recommended by my Dermatologist, the price was much better on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Like the title says, it&#x27;s good for new scars, not so good for old and big scars.</li>
            <li>If it was some kind of wonder ointment for scarring, I feel like I would have seen more about it in comparison to other topicals.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this stuff will help mature a scar more quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I was given it as a complimentary treatment for a scar I received in surgery.</li>
            <li>Find somewhere reputable to purchase this, not Savvy Shopping Direct.</li>
            <li>Easy to dispense and no messy clean up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled at the changes I have seen over a short time.</li>
            <li>BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so far.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>So this was worth the bucks.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>They blend right in.</li>
            <li>Right now I am 2 months post-surgery and have been using the product for about a month.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff can&#x27;t get enough</li>
            <li>On my second bottle... So wanting some surgical scars to disappear, but it&#x27;s not looking like this is the magic bullet-</li>
            <li>Read my first comments on this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly as described.</li>
            <li>You are left with a bright red tearing eye.</li>
            <li>Still to early ,only 8 weeks , need longer to honestly judge the outcome</li>
            <li>I am not convinced it any more quickly calms down the redness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure time will tell the long term effects.  </li>
            <li>We keep trying other things to try and avoid spending the extra money on bioCorneum, but this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Great cream I wish it was a little be bigger</li>
            <li>It really helped camouflage the scar.</li>
            <li>The combo is working very well ..</li>
            <li>but it worked really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really did much of anything.  </li>
            <li>For that price, I expected more.  </li>
            <li>As my well-respected surgeon keeps saying, it could be 12-18 months before the scar fades as much as it&#x27;s going to.  </li>
            <li>Product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really lightend up my scar dramatically.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They are healing up very well.</li>
            <li>So I have been using a defective cream for about a week,I&#x27;m very upset as this scar is on my face</li>
            <li>My wife has two lollipop scars on her breasts which are much lighter now</li>
            <li>I wish we would&#x27;ve used this the whole time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement</li>
            <li>Thinner scars are almost invisible and the wider scars are much improved after  about 9 weeks.  </li>
            <li>There is a significant difference in the incisions in the short time she has used it.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work on BIG, OLD, scars, but it does wonders on new ones for sure.</li>
            <li>Thus I can&#x27;t really give you a realistic rating.</li>
            <li>This seller didn&#x27;t even try to make it look new!</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few weeks, so it has not had a fair chance to work</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>This product really works to fade scars, even old ones.</li>
            <li>This works very well on my face and keeps it soft and helps heal scars.  </li>
            <li>It is flat and smooth and barely visible.  </li>
            <li>I will buy a new one</li>
            <li>The bottle I received came with the cap off and clearly used with a crumpled up box that even had dirt on the inside like it&#x27;s been returned at a store and thrown around in a shopping basket before someone ordered it.</li>
            <li>After weeks of using it the cream started coming out clear and the texture was watery</li>
            <li>So far it has taken a lot of the redness out and continues to protect.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My body tends to bounce back fast.  </li>
            <li>Then the return policy for this seller is completely unacceptable as well.</li>
            <li>I had developed keloids on scars I got from and abdominal</li>
            <li>( The universal Dr. &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; is to say scars are like real estate...</li>
            <li>Scar was well - placed but broad and had a lump in it.</li>
            <li>Important to notethat a little bit of this product goes a long way...</li>
            <li>I used bioCorneum for nearly eight months as a topical, as directed, twice a day (morning and night) under a bra (yes, during the day and about 4 months at night).  </li>
            <li>and my scar is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using bioCorneum for a little over a month, and I can definitely see that my scar is healing quickly -</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right, the one who made the mess to start with!)</li>
            <li>One scar is older than the other.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was on the expensive side but after using it I realized that it was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The best secret ever!!!!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions accurately and put on the lightest thin layer.</li>

            <li> I used bioCorneum for nearly eight months as a topical, as directed, twice a day (morning and night) under a bra (yes, during the day and about 4 months at night).  </li>
            <li> and my scar is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bioCorneum for a little over a month, and I can definitely see that my scar is healing quickly -</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right, the one who made the mess to start with!)</li>
            <li> One scar is older than the other.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was on the expensive side but after using it I realized that it was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The best secret ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions accurately and put on the lightest thin layer.</li>
            <li> And to the person who only gave it one star you probably did not use it long enough, scars do not dissapear in a week you need to give it some time.</li>
            <li> using it now, hasn&#x27;t been long enough for results (only been 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past &amp; it works very well</li>
            <li> Little early to determine how well it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey (maybe spent $300 on bioCorneum last year).  </li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re going to have a big, wide scar you&#x27;re still coming out with a big, wide scar.</li>
            <li> I had major surgery on my foot and this stuff works well to keep the wound moist and less prone to scar</li>
            <li> Would dry my hair to give it time to dry before applying make up.</li>
            <li> Our skin turns red from anything: sun, wind, cold, a quick slap, a knife wound,</li>
            <li> Started the cream after 6 weeks as directed and all the red is gone and the scar has drawn together into a fairly narrow line.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for a while if you&#x27;re careful with the locked-in pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Product was sent as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more common and less expensive scare removers (Mederma) and had no success.  </li>
            <li> One is from March 2013 and the other was in June 2013.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have used it on one side and not the other to see if there was a difference with this and just using lotion,</li>
            <li> 11 months later I&#x27;m not sure I can recommend it, as I didn&#x27;t see my scar heal any faster than any other scar I had without using bioCorneum.  </li>
            <li> so I was hoping the product would help me avoid a lumpy dark scar.  </li>
            <li> Because of this I refuse to use it not knowing if it&#x27;s been previously used or tampered with.  </li>
            <li> Maybe just a little.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DIMINISH SCARS AND KEEP THEM PROTECTED FROM THE HARSH SUN.  </li>
            <li> It has taken my scar down a small fraction.  </li>
            <li> no need to waste your money!</li>
            <li> I normally scar really bad.</li>
            <li> I use it as instructed, so at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Used it after mutiple surgeries post bilateral mastectomy w/ reconstruction secondary to breast cancer.</li>
            <li> but over time - it&#x27;s been two weeks on an old ugly scar</li>
            <li> it was like a cream color with a creamy ,thick texture.</li>
            <li> Less expensive through amazon.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than buying it at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;location, location, location.&amp;#34;)  After one really, really nasty, irretrievable scar from skin cancer a woman surgeon (yeah,</li>
            <li> I used this for breast scarring (surgeon&#x27;s advice) after the wound healed, and around crusty area as it decreased in size.  </li>

            <li> Nothing dramatic happened.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was rather expensive, but thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was too expensive</li>
            <li> cream is expensive, 20g.</li>
            <li> I would hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> It is horrible; it burns and you can&#x27;t get rid of it for hours.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Plastic surgeon and dermatologist recommended. Seems to help.</li>
            <li> Great for scars from Mohs surgery on my face. It really helped camouflage the scar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it is great !</li>
            <li> The best secret ever!!!! I love this stuff can&#x27;t get enough</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product for scars, and it is great. I highly recommend. The scars seem to heal faster and soften.</li>
            <li> I have had two melanomas removed and both left five inch scars on my thighs.  My doctor suggested I use biocorneum.  They sold me a 10g tube for $50.  I thought it was rather expensive, but thought I would give it a try.  It seems to be working for me.  The scars are remarkably more faded.  One scar is older than the other.  One is from March 2013 and the other was in June 2013.  The older one is a lot more faded.  Anyway, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  Not every product works for every person.... I read the review of the person that gave it a one star.</li>
            <li> I bought this upon recommendation of my plastic surgeon for post op scar on areola area... I&#x27;m also doing a laser on scar ... The combo is working very well ..</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my plastic surgeon and it woks excellent for scar healing. I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> This product really works to fade scars, even old ones. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in just 2weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks, so it has not had a fair chance to work it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it&#x27;s good for new scars, not so good for old and big scars. Apparently Angelina Jolie used it after her surgery, so it must be good, right? I wish I could have used it on one side and not the other to see if there was a difference with this and just using lotion, oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* No super-visible scars after surgery after using this product. They blend right in. This doesn&#x27;t work on BIG, OLD, scars, but it does wonders on new ones for sure. I&#x27;d recommend. The surgeon recommended this to and we&#x27;re glad we listened!</li>
            <li> I used this for a scar around my eye- and if that&#x27;s what you are looking for stay away. It is horrible; it burns and you can&#x27;t get rid of it for hours. You are left with a bright red tearing eye.</li>
            <li> This product caused no change to my scar whatsoever. I was given it as a complimentary treatment for a scar I received in surgery. I saw no change in my scar after using it. My doctor told me to discontinue its use because he knows of no evidence that it works. I agree.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on scars post-surgery.  So far it has taken a lot of the redness out and continues to protect.  I&#x27;m sure time will tell the long term effects.  Right now I am 2 months post-surgery and have been using the product for about a month.</li>
            <li> Great product to use after surgery to prevent scars. Recommended by my doctor.  Less expensive through amazon. Won&#x27;t irritate skin. I tend to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my plastic surgeon.  At first I thought it was on the expensive side but after using it I realized that it was worth every penny.  I have been using this product almost everyday for a month and the difference in the scar is incredible, its almost completly unnoticable in some areas.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  And to the person who only gave it one star you probably did not use it long enough, scars do not dissapear in a week you need to give it some time.</li>
            <li> used after Mohs. surgery on my nose.  Scar was well - placed but broad and had a lump in it. Started the cream after 6 weeks as directed and all the red is gone and the scar has drawn together into a fairly narrow line.  Amazing! I thought it was too expensive but it worked really well. I don&#x27;t make good scars as a rule but will use this on all wounds from now on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, my surgeon sold it to me for $150 for 50g.  I don&#x27;t think it really did much of anything.  Maybe just a little.  For that price, I expected more.  I&#x27;ve used it for a year now almost every night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I had surgery five months ago that required an incision on the front of my neck. I am more than pleased with how well this has worked at diminishing the appearance of a large scar.</li>
            <li> Purchases came on time and safe.</li>
            <li> I used this for breast scarring (surgeon&#x27;s advice) after the wound healed, and around crusty area as it decreased in size.  I used bioCorneum for nearly eight months as a topical, as directed, twice a day (morning and night) under a bra (yes, during the day and about 4 months at night).  The last time I used it, I saw some advice about putting bioCorneum under Metipac silicone tape and it made some sense based on medical literature reviews (keep the scar protected and moist for best scar healing), so I did that 24/7 for a little over a month.  Nothing dramatic happened.  As my well-respected surgeon keeps saying, it could be 12-18 months before the scar fades as much as it&#x27;s going to.  Yes, the scar faded, 11 months after surgery and all the months before that, but was that my body or the bioCorneum?  My body tends to bounce back fast.  It&#x27;s pricey (maybe spent $300 on bioCorneum last year).  It lasts for a while if you&#x27;re careful with the locked-in pump dispenser.  If I had heard of the tape + bioCorneum combo sooner, I might have tried it from the start.  My surgeon didn&#x27;t recommend them together so...  11 months later I&#x27;m not sure I can recommend it, as I didn&#x27;t see my scar heal any faster than any other scar I had without using bioCorneum.  If it was some kind of wonder ointment for scarring, I feel like I would have seen more about it in comparison to other topicals.  Lots of maybe&#x27;s for $300.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle... So wanting some surgical scars to disappear, but it&#x27;s not looking like this is the magic bullet- even had steroid injections. Just not happening. Can&#x27;t say id recommend? But maybe it&#x27;s just not for everyone?</li>
            <li> Plastic surgeon recommended for scar control after facial stitches.  It has sunscreen zinkoxside to prevent scaring&lt;br /&gt;And discoloration of scar.</li>
            <li> Waiting for final result</li>
            <li> The bottle I received came with the cap off and clearly used with a crumpled up box that even had dirt on the inside like it&#x27;s been returned at a store and thrown around in a shopping basket before someone ordered it. This seller didn&#x27;t even try to make it look new! It was just thrown in the package, cap off and everything. Then the return policy for this seller is completely unacceptable as well. Find somewhere reputable to purchase this, not Savvy Shopping Direct.</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in the scar on which I&#x27;ve applied the cream.  Easy to dispense and no messy clean up.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and nicely packaged.  My dermatologist recommended this for my keloid scar on my shoulder.  I use it as instructed, so at least twice a day.  It has taken my scar down a small fraction.  I read that it does take some time, months.  So I am in the beginning stages.  The consistency of it is nice, so it&#x27;s easy and there is no smell at all.  We will see!</li>
            <li> Still to early ,only 8 weeks , need longer to honestly judge the outcome, dr L say,s 3/6 months for skin to truly heal.but already incision is finer to the touch.</li>
            <li> Have used the product for a year. Has lightened the scar significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month. No results</li>
            <li> It arrived opened and used</li>
            <li> Really lightend up my scar dramatically. I started noticing my scar lighter after about 3 weeks. I used it after washing my face in the morning and again after washing my face before bed.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s success will not be known for at least a month of regular use.  Thus I can&#x27;t really give you a realistic rating. I like the dispenser and the ease of application, but that is all I can comment on at this time.  Get back with me in a month to hear the results. Thanks</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference on my scar.  I&#x27;m thrilled at the changes I have seen over a short time.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past &amp; it works very well</li>
            <li> Way over priced. I purchased a 50g bottle at my doctors office for the same price I paid on Amazon for a 20g bottle.</li>
            <li> This was  highly recommended by my Dermatologist, the price was much better on amazon.  Again the service of Amazon was great, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product, got it for after my girlfriends surgery, worth the money</li>
            <li> THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DIMINISH SCARS AND KEEP THEM PROTECTED FROM THE HARSH SUN.  PRICEY, BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT. RECOMMENDED BY ALL THE TOP SURGEONS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally convinced that this removes scars but this is the product my doctor (well-known, great reputation) recommended.  It&#x27;s expensive and goes by quicker than hoped, but I&#x27;ll continue using, hopefully to better the scars.</li>
            <li> I used this product after having surgery to remove melanoma.  I had developed keloids on scars I got from and abdominal surgery years before so I was hoping the product would help me avoid a lumpy dark scar.  I religiously used it twice a day for about 3 months and my scar looks great!  It is flat and smooth and barely visible.  I could not be happier with my results and will use it again.  I do think you have to use it religiously for a period of time for the best results.</li>
            <li> Used it after mutiple surgeries post bilateral mastectomy w/ reconstruction secondary to breast cancer. IT WORKS!!! Every Physician that has laid eyes on my still diminishing scars asked me what I am using for scar treatment. Very satisfied w/ this product after switching from Mederma. Important to notethat a little bit of this product goes a long way... no need to waste your money! Healing physical and some emotional scars.</li>
            <li> I had major surgery on my foot and this stuff works well to keep the wound moist and less prone to scar</li>
            <li> I had a prophylactic bilateral max and reconstruction. I have a huge scar from hip to hip and a T shape on both breasts. I had some hypertrophic scars... Not all of them, but I notice them.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the cream for 3 weeks and I can see that some of the darkness is gone and is turning red/white.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is expensive, 20g. For $54 at my doctor&#x27;s office, but I&#x27;ll continue buying just in case.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wife had surgery and had multiple incisions. She can actually feel this product working on the scars. There is a significant difference in the incisions in the short time she has used it.  It really works!!</li>
            <li> Biocorneum is  the best!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the doctor&#x27;s office for the same price but it was only a 10g. tube. This item is 20g.  Definitely a bargain. Plus the product works great for healing of scars!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so far. I got it for my scars after surgery. They are healing up very well. I am very Pleased. My surgeon is the one that recommended this product. He was charging $80 in his office which is why I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Product was sent as expected.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this cream,first of all it was recommended to me by my surgeon and that&#x27;s where I bought it, for my big scar that I have on my face from necessary surgery.It has done nothing to my scar I have been using it for 3weeks now,originally when the nurse showed me the color and texture it was like a cream color with a creamy ,thick texture.After weeks of using it the cream started coming out clear and the texture was watery,I called the Dr&#x27;s office and told them about this,they contacted the Biocoreum rep,who said that the healing cream and the SPF must have seperated inside the bottle?!! So I have been using a defective cream for about a week,I&#x27;m very upset as this scar is on my face and it&#x27;s very important to have a good routine and products,Once again Do not buy this cream,waste of money,?!?!</li>
            <li> My wife recently had breast reduction surgery and this has been the best her scars have improved. She&#x27;s used ScarGuard MD, Bio Oil, and ScarAway scar strips, but the most rapid changes have come from bioCorneum. We keep trying other things to try and avoid spending the extra money on bioCorneum, but this is definitely the best. Her doctor hadn&#x27;t even recommended it, he recommended ScarGuard MD, which he sells for a markup, but bioCorneum is the best and the 50g size lasts about 2 months depending on how conservative you are with the scars. My wife has two lollipop scars on her breasts which are much lighter now (5 months post-op). I wish we would&#x27;ve used this the whole time and maybe they&#x27;d be even lighter! Also, the 50g is the best deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bioCorneum for a little over a month, and I can definitely see that my scar is healing quickly - and I believe that in another month or two, there will be almost no evidence of the surgical procedure.</li>
            <li> This works very well on my face and keeps it soft and helps heal scars.  I would hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> Perfection! Read my first comments on this product!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy when need it ..... thank Gawd or Amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NJ VV</li>
            <li> I have had skin cancer many, many times. All I can tell you is, pick your battles. If your Dr. knows what they&#x27;re doing you may be OK. If not, you may come out with something looking like you did it yourself at home. ( The universal Dr. &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; is to say scars are like real estate...&amp;#34;location, location, location.&amp;#34;)  After one really, really nasty, irretrievable scar from skin cancer a woman surgeon (yeah, that&#x27;s right, the one who made the mess to start with!) recommended this product. Bottom line, this stuff will help mature a scar more quickly. But, if you&#x27;re going to have a big, wide scar you&#x27;re still coming out with a big, wide scar. That part will not change. This stuff may help more quickly flatten it. I am not convinced it any more quickly calms down the redness but then I have red hair. Our skin turns red from anything: sun, wind, cold, a quick slap, a knife wound, whatever. Redness is the universal response. So, improvement, yes, miraculous, no. You&#x27;d be just as well off with the silicone sheets. This is maybe just somewhat more convenient.</li>
            <li> Scars are getting lighter as the product claims. Well worth it. Buy the best you can afford. This is it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by an esthetician for an incision scar. I followed the directions accurately and put on the lightest thin layer. Would dry my hair to give it time to dry before applying make up. However it never fully dries. Never. It stays tacky and makes your makeup look a bit gloppy. Use the Scar Away sheets at night. And then just a Mederma cream with SPF during the day. That works way better and my scar is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference with scars.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement</li>
            <li> I received this item yesterday.  The exterior packing box was in proper condition but when I opened it I found the box this product came in was not only opened and ripped but the cap was off too.  Because of this I refuse to use it not knowing if it&#x27;s been previously used or tampered with.  When I tried to return it I&#x27;m getting a notification it&#x27;s not returnable for the reason I stated.  I&#x27;m thoroughly annoyed considering the price of this item and how often I order from Amazon.  I can&#x27;t rate the item because I refuse to use it but if this is their return policy I would not order from here again for anything.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to help heal stitch scars. My facial surgeons had to use 78 stitches. I applied the product sparingly twice daily for 6 months. Although not perfect, people can&#x27;t tell I had so many stitches. I bought more and still use it because of the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This was not sealed when received,so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my plastic surgeon.  And it&#x27;s working.  Not overnight, but over time - it&#x27;s been two weeks on an old ugly scar and it&#x27;s finally beginning to fade.  I&#x27;ve tried the more common and less expensive scare removers (Mederma) and had no success.  So this was worth the bucks.</li>
            <li> Recommended by plastic surgeon.  Just starting my second bottle.  Thinner scars are almost invisible and the wider scars are much improved after  about 9 weeks.  Way less expensive than buying it at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Great product</li>
            <li> This is amazing I recommend this for everyone that has scars.</li>
            <li> Very good, reduce the rise on the scar .Have not used all of it at present.</li>
            <li> I used this 3 times a day after face surgery. After months, my scar is almost non-existent; after one year, it is invisible. Thank you ....I know I would have paid more buying this from a doctor.</li>
            <li> Little early to determine how well it works.</li>
            <li> I see a lil difference but it&#x27;s only been a month</li>
            <li> exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 or so weeks now. It was recommended to me by a plastic surgeon that I work with in the OR. I normally scar really bad. I can tell somewhat if a difference, and I&#x27;ve applied it 2x per day...still waiting to see how it will look months from now.</li>
            <li> using it now, hasn&#x27;t been long enough for results (only been 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> Great cream I wish it was a little be bigger I will buy a new one</li>
    </ol>
