            <li>and I have noticed a great improvement in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with it because I don&#x27;t have to do a separate shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s worked fine but nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li>I love wen</li>
            <li>I found a better cleansing conditioner for under $10 on amazon called &amp;#34;As</li>
            <li>Even better than Wen.</li>
            <li>I shudder to think how much perfectly healthy hair I lost while using this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Not even sure it&#x27;s WEN product.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps you! :)</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>Odor is strong.  </li>
            <li>This is the cheap version that has a lot of alcohol fillers.  </li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite Wen product!  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the regular shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>; Its marketed for ethnic hair and I am Caucasian,  but holy cow it works amazing!</li>
            <li>Style as normal!!!</li>
            <li>it is like any other good shampoo for my hair</li>
            <li>Right now it is so humid out</li>
            <li>I really like this cleansing conditioner, but, man, does it have a medicated smell!  </li>
            <li>First time using this type of product</li>
            <li>I do not use as much as they say.  </li>
            <li>You do not always need that much.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the Cucumber Aloe Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>My hair looks nice and fluffy all day and stays the way I style it.  </li>
            <li>I got the cucumber aloe because I tend to have greasy hair with the normal wen.  </li>
            <li>Normally that would not be an issue except the person I purchased it for takes a medication that the mint Interferes with and can not use the product</li>
            <li>I liked the way this cleaned my hair and left it smoother and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Only it requires so MUCH product for each wash.</li>
            <li>and wow it took 1/3 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The only way to get the real stuff is from chazdean.com or from qvc.com.</li>
            <li>Box was old and taped up.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft.</li>
            <li>I have medium texted hair, but it has changed alot over the years, and especially as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair greasy, but nor does it improve the frizz (I have long, straight, but frizzy hair).</li>
            <li>Even if I try something new I always go back to Wen.</li>
            <li>However, I do use a tiny bit of all natural shampoo on the oily parts of my scalp</li>
            <li>Every time I showered I had to clean my hair out of the drain at least three times.  </li>

            <li> I really like this cleansing conditioner, but, man, does it have a medicated smell!  I was expecting a soothing scent with a name like cucumber and aloe.  Thankfully, after it is rinsed out your hair doesn&#x27;t smell like a cough drop.  I would have given 5 stars if not for the smell.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Love!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> First time using this type of product it&#x27;s ok! I love wen it&#x27;s made my hair so much better!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful when you follow the instructional video on youtube. Only it requires so MUCH product for each wash. I got all of 6 washes with one $30 bottle. If it was a third of the pruce I would definitely give it 5 stars. I found a better cleansing conditioner for under $10 on amazon called &amp;#34;As I am: Coconut cowash.&amp;#34; Its marketed for ethnic hair and I am Caucasian,  but holy cow it works amazing! Even better than Wen.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this cleaned my hair and left it smoother and less frizzy.  BUT!  My hair fell out!  Every time I showered I had to clean my hair out of the drain at least three times.  Now that I&#x27;ve gone to another  suds-less shampoo, I&#x27;m back to cleaning it out just once.  I shudder to think how much perfectly healthy hair I lost while using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I got the cucumber aloe because I tend to have greasy hair with the normal wen.  Right now it is so humid out and normally my hair would be flat and lifeless, curling up in places and not curling up in other places.....looking horrible.  My hair looks nice and fluffy all day and stays the way I style it.  I do not use as much as they say.  My stepdaughter did and wow it took 1/3 of the bottle.  You do not always need that much.  Try just the same amount as you use for conditioner.  Let it in as you shower and than rinse.  Style as normal!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Wen products for some time now.  Even if I try something new I always go back to Wen.</li>
            <li> This is the cheap version that has a lot of alcohol fillers.  The only way to get the real stuff is from chazdean.com or from qvc.com.</li>
            <li> Love Wen, just not that crazy about this scent.</li>
            <li> Box was old and taped up. Not even sure it&#x27;s WEN product.</li>
            <li> It just happens to work well with my hair and the effect is enhanced by another product I use for styling.  I also use a scalp massager which has seemed to also enhance the effect.  The directions say to use a ridiculous number of pumps.  I have short thin hair and use only 2 pumps per shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have watched the infomercials for years and resisted buying it. However, I do use a tiny bit of all natural shampoo on the oily parts of my scalp and then I use this and I have noticed a great improvement in the texture of my hair. It is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> it is like any other good shampoo for my hair</li>
            <li> Odor is strong.  Prefer pomegranate.</li>
            <li> I really do like the Cucumber Aloe Cleanser.  It is by far my favorite Wen product!  I have medium texted hair, but it has changed alot over the years, and especially as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  This is the only Wen product that I have used, that does not leave my head feeling greasy.  It cleanses well.  It does leave my hair feeling soft, as I do have dryer hair and am always trying to heavily moisturize the ends.  For me, I just add it to my hair at the beginning of my shower, leave it in while I do all my other things, and then just rinse it at the end.  But, before I get out, I do add 1 pump of it to the ends of my hair and just leave it in.  That has helped my hair alot.  Hope this helps you! :)</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed with this shampoo. It makes my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> The advertisement for this product is misleading in it&#x27;s ingredients I checked multiple times and places. None of the documentation says there is mint in the product. Normally that would not be an issue except the person I purchased it for takes a medication that the mint Interferes with and can not use the product</li>
            <li> Not as good as the regular shampoo/conditioner. My hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft. The jury is out on whether I like this product or not.</li>
            <li> have used it for overa year. I can really tell the difference. Hair easier to manage..</li>
            <li> Someone gave me a bottle of this to try. I&#x27;ve been happy with it because I don&#x27;t have to do a separate shampoo &amp; conditioner. It&#x27;s worked fine but nothing exceptional. It does not leave my hair greasy, but nor does it improve the frizz (I have long, straight, but frizzy hair). I was about to reorder and started looking at reviews and reading how it makes some people&#x27;s hair fall out. That explained my sudden hair loss. I never thought about it being the Wen, I just assumed it was some phase I was going through. I get hand fulls of hair each time I use this. I will be switching back to regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
