            <li>I have experienced significant improvements in my scalp condition.</li>
            <li>I purchased it as I liked the smell and refreshing tingle.</li>

            <li>you want a great tingling, stimulating shampoo and conditioner that really does do a fantastic job give these a try!</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I always run out of shampoo before I need more conditioner, leaving me with an abundance of conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Gluten Free is a MUST for me, and this shampoo /conditioner works so well for my fine hair!</li>
            <li>I wish it would moisturize as well, but I would rather have a head full of hair. :)</li>
            <li>This stuff ain&#x27;t cheap to have that happen.</li>
            <li>I am actually excited about washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I put hairspray in my hair and it takes it out where my hair feels really clean.</li>
            <li>I lose an occasional stand here or there now, but my hair feels great, is bunch and lively, and I have a heck of a lot more of it sticking around where is belongs on my head!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I have never been good at being a \\&quot;girly-girl\\&quot; and worrying about my hair and so forth, but my hairdresser used this when I was in for a trim, then I used samples and I went back and bought the product because it worked so well.</li>
            <li>I have experienced hair loss due to side effects of a medication I have to take.  </li>
            <li>I know I was pregnant and taking viatmins as well</li>
            <li>An added benefit is that this seller ships out super quick and ensures the product is packed well.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker and looks 100 percent better highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Little did I know how great this shampoo is.</li>
            <li>People were actually commenting on how nice my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I ran out of shampoo and couldn&#x27;t get any right away</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The hair has actually grown back and filled in on it&#x27;s own with the Surface Awaken line.</li>
            <li>And none of them really did anything!</li>
            <li>will most definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li>will most definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li>and it has done nothing but make me sheed more over these several weeks</li>
            <li>I will warn you that it does not smell pretty</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this to me since I was pregnant to jump start the new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shampoo and rinse and then shampoo again, and wait for the full minute before you wash it out and keep your eyes tightly shut.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making such a fine product.  </li>
            <li>I was told this shampoo would increase the volume of my hair by twice as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I lost most of it due to chemo treatments and the shampoo is working.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that was starting to look thin on top.</li>
            <li>In the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed more and more hair falling out constantly in the shower, when I style it, and even if I just run my hands through my hair they would come away coated in strands falling out.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li>My hair stylist changed salons and the new place does not carry this line.</li>
            <li>The product does help with stimulating new hair growth (not gobs &amp; gobs) but new growthy noticed by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>But this is one hair product that did the exact opposite!</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin or happen to get shampoo near eyes, this product is not for you(or me!)</li>
            <li>I mistakenly ordered Surface Awaken Shampoo instead of Surface Bassu Conditioning Shampoo,  which Ihave used for years, and I was surprised to experience  </li>
            <li>Not only is it a vegan and natural hair brand, but it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>Want to feel like you rubbed icy hot on your head?</li>
            <li>has a mild tingling sensation when you massage it on, which I think is a little stronger in the conditioner then the shampoo.</li>
            <li>that is very soft and fine textured, and it used to be so thick and lush when I was younger.</li>
            <li>these are definitely not products for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Apparently some reviewers like it, but</li>
            <li>Or go the cheaper route and actually rub icy hot on your head, although i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed after trying so many other products which were so expensive and disappointing overall.</li>
            <li>I finally got some and within 3 days the amount of hair I was losing decreased significantly!</li>

            <li> hair does seem to be a bit dry even though I am using the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I have fine,color treated, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Only need a very little bit so it does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be growing back this quickly if not for the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products with limited results.  </li>
            <li> It has also helped with filling in an area of hair loss due to alopecia.  </li>
            <li> After my weight loss surgery I lost quite a bit of hair due to lack of protein.  </li>
            <li> I tried at least 10 different products all designed to help with thinning volume and hair loss.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to buy the shampoo and conditioner together.  </li>
            <li> It heals the scalp, thickens thin hair and makes it silky soft.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I feel to young to be bald!!!</li>
            <li> While I was seeing some new hair growth around my hairline, after using these products for about a month developed a bad rash on areas of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to the harsh weather or something in my system.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products you do not have to use a lot and it creates very little lather.</li>
            <li> but these larger sizes aren&#x27;t that bad when I spent 35 dollars each on 8oz bottles of other products that didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I know my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as bad either</li>
            <li> That person who said she didn&#x27;t like it should give herself a 1 star rating for intelligence because she&#x27;s the idiot who ordered the wrong thing!</li>

            <li> I have had terrible itching on my scalp my entire life - am 63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist told me I have seborrheic dermatitis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried every dandruff shampoo made in the US, including prescriptions and NOTHING worked!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after all these years my hair dresser started carrying this product line - IMMEDIATE RELIEF!  This line also helps my thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all the products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awaken Therapeutic Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Awaken Therapeutic Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Awaken Therapeutic Treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use these products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflect Styling Gel&lt;br /&gt;Jump Volume Mousse&lt;br /&gt;Theory Styling Spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never felt or looked better - and the fact that the itchiness on my scalp is GONE is a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every dollar!</li>

            <li> I am an EXTREMLY hard sell when it comes to hair products. Everyone always says to try this and that and it never works and I don&#x27;t have the extra money to be wasting. My stylist recommended this to me since I was pregnant to jump start the new hair growth. I did buy some even though I was skeptical. I know I was pregnant and taking viatmins as well but my hair got so thick which is something I&#x27;ve always dreamed of! I had my baby and was waiting for my hair to fall out like they say it does. Waited...waited...I ran out of shampoo and couldn&#x27;t get any right away and thats when my hair started falling. I finally got some and within 3 days the amount of hair I was losing decreased significantly! I swear by this shampoo and conditioner! I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> I cant believe the difference in  my hair! I have very fine hair that was starting to look thin on top. After about 2 months of use I could see a big difference in my hair!  People were actually commenting on how nice my hair looked. Best product I ever used on my hair!</li>
            <li> I was told this shampoo would increase the volume of my hair by twice as much. I lost most of it due to chemo treatments and the shampoo is working. I don&#x27;t think it would be growing back this quickly if not for the use of this product. I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does seem to be a bit dry even though I am using the conditioner as well. This may be due to the harsh weather or something in my system. Not necessisarily blaming that on the product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great price for these products!My favorite hair product, feels so good on your scalp. I was concerned about the products spilling during shipping but they didn&#x27;t. They were packaged very nicely to avoid spills.</li>
            <li> Excellent product it&#x27;s a miracle  My hair is thicker and looks 100 percent better highly recommend. I&#x27;ve only used it one week.  Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product. I put hairspray in my hair and it takes it out where my hair feels really clean. I know my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as bad either</li>
            <li> While I was seeing some new hair growth around my hairline, after using these products for about a month developed a bad rash on areas of my face and neck.  these are definitely not products for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The product is great!  The packaging for shipping was poorly done.  I just received the bottles in the mail and one had popped open allowing it&#x27;s contents to leak.  This stuff ain&#x27;t cheap to have that happen.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.  My stylist told me about the product and suggested that I try it.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> On month 3 and it seems to be doing its job!  I wish it would moisturize as well, but I would rather have a head full of hair. :)</li>
            <li> This product has done everything it proclaims to do.  It has helped keep my scalp under control from foliculitis since I&#x27;ve been using it.  It make my scalp tingle and feel stimulated.  My daughter-in-law actually comes to shower and wash her hair at times just to use this product.  Thanks so much for making such a fine product.  Would advise others to try it.</li>
            <li> smells like peppermint my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Gluten Free is a MUST for me, and this shampoo /conditioner works so well for my fine hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has a wonderful minty, tingly feeling when using it.  It has also helped with filling in an area of hair loss due to alopecia.  The last time I had this problem, I had to get injections to get the hair to grow back.  This time I decided to try this product.  The hair has actually grown back and filled in on it&#x27;s own with the Surface Awaken line.</li>
            <li> I am literally so impressed with this product I cannot express how much I love it, but I&#x27;m gonna try! I have been working in the beauty industry for 4 years now and I have tried A LOT of products designed to do all sorts of things and often times they over promise and under deliver on results. But this is one hair product that did the exact opposite! Surface calls it a stimulating shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s more like a mini miracle!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 20s, white male with curly hair that is very soft and fine textured, and it used to be so thick and lush when I was younger. In the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed more and more hair falling out constantly in the shower, when I style it, and even if I just run my hands through my hair they would come away coated in strands falling out. Needless to say I feel to young to be bald!!! So I went on the hunt for all kinds of solutions. I tried at least 10 different products all designed to help with thinning volume and hair loss. And none of them really did anything! Some of them tingled on my scalp, but that was about all the results I ever noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Well my sister recommended me this line which she has been having great results with since her post pregnancy hormones have caused her to lose a ton of hair as well! So I thought what could it hurt. Let me tell you am I glad I did! Not only is it a vegan and natural hair brand, but it WORKS!!! After 3 days 95% of my hair fallout had stopped!! I lose an occasional stand here or there now, but my hair feels great, is bunch and lively, and I have a heck of a lot more of it sticking around where is belongs on my head!&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild tingling sensation when you massage it on, which I think is a little stronger in the conditioner then the shampoo. And yes it does have cayenne pepper extract in it to stimulate circulation, so don&#x27;t get it in your eyes cuz like most everything in life that gets in your eyes it will burn! DUH!! That person who said she didn&#x27;t like it should give herself a 1 star rating for intelligence because she&#x27;s the idiot who ordered the wrong thing! Don&#x27;t blame the product for your not paying attention! I hate that!&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS DEFINITELY A 5 STAR PRODUCT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be buying it again! LOVE! It is a little bit more expensive then regular shampoo but these larger sizes aren&#x27;t that bad when I spent 35 dollars each on 8oz bottles of other products that didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great tingling, stimulating shampoo and conditioner that really does do a fantastic job give these a try! I&#x27;m glad I did!erself a 1 star rating for intelligence because she&#x27;s the idiot who ordered the wrong thing! Don&#x27;t blame the product for your not paying attention!

            <li> My Hair Stylist started me on this shampoo and conditioner. I have fine,color treated, dry hair. I purchased it as I liked the smell and refreshing tingle. Little did I know how great this shampoo is. Unlike other products you do not have to use a lot and it creates very little lather. That takes getting used to. I wash my shoulder length hair with an amount the size of a quarter and then use a nickel size amount of conditioner which I comb through. My hair looks great, is shiny and healthy again. I am so impressed after trying so many other products which were so expensive and disappointing overall. My hair stylist changed salons and the new place does not carry this line. I now buy it online and have been using this product for over six months. So happy with Awaken.</li>
            <li> very good service, still evaluating product,&lt;br /&gt;will continue using this product, it does seem to help with the thickness of hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!! I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and cond now for almost 2 months and it has done nothing but make me sheed more over these several weeks and now it&#x27;s gotten to where it&#x27;s worse than ever .</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo!  Smells good, makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner arrived in perfect condition, and met my expectations .I would purchase these items again when needed.</li>
            <li> The tingly sensation you get from using this product makes your scalp feel great.  I am actually excited about washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered Surface Awaken Shampoo instead of Surface Bassu Conditioning Shampoo,  which Ihave used for years, and I was surprised to experience  burningand stinging  of the  eyes and face when I washed my hair. The ingredients list capsaicin, which is the compound that gives the heat to chili peppers and is the irritant used in pepper spray. Apparently some reviewers like it, but if you have sensitive skin or happen to get shampoo near eyes, this product is not for you(or me!)</li>
            <li> This product is for thinning hair or hair loss prevention.  I have experienced significant improvements in my scalp condition. The conditioner acts as an exfoliant and you can feel the pleasant &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; sensation.  However, I ordered the shampoo and conditioner duo but received 2 conditioners-Since they are cumbersome to mail, I decided to keep them.  Worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> I have experienced hair loss due to side effects of a medication I have to take.  I have tried other products with limited results.  My hair stylist recommended Surface Awaken Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have seen I definite reduction in hair loss.  I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel.  My only complaint is that I have to buy the shampoo and conditioner together.  I always run out of shampoo before I need more conditioner, leaving me with an abundance of conditioner.  I would definitely recommend this product to others experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner was recommended to me by a hairdresser.  She prices were much more expensive so I used Amazon to make my purchase.  The product does help with stimulating new hair growth (not gobs &amp; gobs) but new growthy noticed by my hairdresser. The shampoo gives your head a &amp;#34;peppermint&amp;#34; type tingle.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months and my hair has never been prettier, shinier, or thicker. Love love love this stuff! Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes though. It WILL sting a lot!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner delivers! It heals the scalp, thickens thin hair and makes it silky soft. A lot goes a long way. An added benefit is that this seller ships out super quick and ensures the product is packed well.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon... yet. I have never been good at being a \\&quot;girly-girl\\&quot; and worrying about my hair and so forth, but my hairdresser used this when I was in for a trim, then I used samples and I went back and bought the product because it worked so well. It makes my hair look and feel amazing! It feels great on my scalp and there are no sulfates. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The best and well worth the price.  After my weight loss surgery I lost quite a bit of hair due to lack of protein.  My hair is very very thin and brittle.  I am on my second bottle of shampoo and conditioner and I do see the difference.  No more handfuls of hair falling out when I wash my hair.  I will warn you that it does not smell pretty and it does burn if you get it in your eyes and I mean burn.  It tingles on your head.  Make sure you shampoo and rinse and then shampoo again, and wait for the full minute before you wash it out and keep your eyes tightly shut.  Only need a very little bit so it does last a long time.  The bottles last me about 7 months and that Is with washing my hair every day.</li>
