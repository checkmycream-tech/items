            <li> The prints and colors sent were not beautiful, the material of the box is dropping, descosturando, very fragile, one came with a broken mirror, and the other broke easily, the mirror was too thin and broke easily.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long they will last.</li>
            <li> I use mine everyday for the convenience of having my lipstick and a mirror in the same place.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will last very long.  </li>

            <li> I had lost one of the two I had for so long, and was desperate to get another one.</li>
            <li> no one wanted them so you sucker sent them to us?!  </li>
            <li> But you would be a negative stars if I had my way!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t presented them to the group yet as I have been sick for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> Unable to find this product in stores...</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t makke them longer</li>
            <li> The three lipstick cases are badly faded.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These lipstick holders are perfect. Too bad they don&#x27;t makke them longer so you could fit lip glosses.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets.  They came in sheer drawstring gift bags.  As advertised, each set contained cases with different colors and pretty patterns.  The cases were made well for the price.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  I use the cases both for myself and to give as small gifts.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as a birthday gift and I was very pleased when they arrived. Very pretty and not cheap looking, would order again</li>
            <li> Love this great price and quite nice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t carry a makeup bag in my purse and was forever digging&lt;br /&gt;around looking for my lipstick.  These little cases solve the problem&lt;br /&gt;plus I put a couple toothpicks in also.  Gave one to my neighbor and&lt;br /&gt;one to my sister and they were delighted.  So reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> I like that I never lose my lipstick now, with this case, and it has a mirror as well, so very useful. fits easily in cosmetic case or zippered section of purse.</li>
            <li> Feels like cheaply made fabric covered cardboard.  Took over a month to receive this product.  Not sure if it will last very long.  I have owned nicer, better made cases in the past.  You get what you pay for.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> There are very nice lipstick cases!!</li>
            <li> ery nice assortment at a very good price.  I will order again. They make a great little gift for girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Nice patterns for the covering and they arrived quickly. Don&#x27;t think these are available elsewhere. Not sure how long they will last.</li>
            <li> Very cute + girly. Just what I needed -- will use 2 and give one as a gift. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The colors were good and the fabric is thick.&lt;br /&gt;I now have one to go with my regular purse and my evening purse.&lt;br /&gt;Makes it a lot easier now that I have three.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again; make nice stocking stuffer gifts for christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the mirror was larger!</li>
            <li> bought for my young granddaughters who love to play make-up.. these were perfect except that one was frayed on the end, so quality of that one wasn&#x27;t great, but it didn&#x27;t bother the girls.</li>
            <li> These ALWAYS come in handy, and have for me and the women in my family for the past 25 years! Still genius, and still a total necessity. Love getting this 3 pack in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The prints and colors sent were not beautiful, the material of the box is dropping, descosturando, very fragile, one came with a broken mirror, and the other broke easily, the mirror was too thin and broke easily. not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> super perfect . . . more please&lt;br /&gt;great gifts too</li>
            <li> pretty, but a little cheap</li>
            <li> Great little product! Perfect stocking stuffer at Christmas!</li>
            <li> Nice selection of random colors and reasonably well made for the paid price. I wish it would have a free S&amp;H too, but...</li>
            <li> I love the items. Good quality and very pretty. It will be a nice gift for a friend who loves lipstick.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely manner.  Items are great!</li>
            <li> The three lipstick cases are badly faded.</li>
            <li> These are the ugliest cases I have EVER seen!  What happened no one wanted them so you sucker sent them to us?!  Never will that happen again to me.  I learned my lesson. YUK!!!😩. You only got one star cause I had to give it to you.  But you would be a negative stars if I had my way!</li>
            <li> Every woman should own one of these for theyr lipsticks even little girls can use this for theyr chapsticks. Adorbs</li>
            <li> I bought these for little gifts for women I associate with a lot during the year.  Haven&#x27;t presented them to the group yet as I have been sick for the past three weeks and I planned them for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Very nice lipstick cases! Great seller.</li>
            <li> Unable to find this product in stores...My grand-daughter suggested the internet.  I found just exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great! Loved color choices!</li>
            <li> Very cute and large enough for most lipstick cases.  I have only used one and it is already showing signs of fabric deterioration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They would be a cute stocking stuffer or tale setting gift for ladies.</li>
            <li> This are very nice! You can carry your lip gloss or lipstick in one and they don&#x27;t come uncapped and ruined in your purse. They also have a little mirror inside which is convenient.</li>
            <li> The ones I recieved were nothing like the picture! They were fine for what they were...just not right.I was very disapponted!</li>
            <li> I use mine everyday for the convenience of having my lipstick and a mirror in the same place.</li>
            <li> These  holders are lovely.  Would love to have one that would hold 2 lipsticks.  I will not leave home without one.</li>
            <li> These are great. The colors are beautiful. I love them &amp; they make great gifts too! I want to thank you.</li>
            <li> I give high mark to this product. I was so impress with the look and quality  that I didn&#x27;t expect from such inexpensive items. Love all three  styles.</li>
            <li> received in a very timely manner. was very pleased with order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for years and they have held up very well.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this, and was so pleased to find it online!! I will do this again soon!</li>
            <li> I purchased these lipstick cases for Christmas Stocking Stuffers for my daughters!  Everyone needs a lipstick case!</li>
            <li> Very attractive and what I had been looking for. The reason for the low rating is that they have a very strong order. Made in China so I am assuming it is something in the fabric or the clue that was used. I am letting them air out to see if the odor subsides.</li>
            <li> I was bummed at I could not find any of thee types of lips sticks holders any where locally. I had lost one of the two I had for so long, and was desperate to get another one. It is the ONLY thing I love to pt my lipstick in, in my purse. It is the perfect product! It keeps your lipstick secure, and you have a mirror right there to use. They are so pretty, and make a wonderful small gift for any of the ladies you may want to give a gift to. I found them online here one day, put the order in that afternoon, and two lades later, they ARRIVED!!! I was elated. All three of them are beautiful. And the shipping was just excellent!</li>
            <li> I liked everything about these lipstick cases -- the fabric, color, mirror -- and i have one and gave them as gifts!  Everyone loves them!</li>
