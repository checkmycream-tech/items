            <li>I like it but, feels cheap</li>
            <li>I learned an important lesson about checking dimensions on things from this bag.</li>
            <li>such a great price</li>
            <li>It is orange not brown and quite cheap looking</li>

            <li>For the price it&#x27;s nice and it&#x27;s just a go out for a walk or to the mall kind of bag where you don&#x27;t really want to hold all that much.</li>
            <li>It is perfect the way it is, for when you want a small bag to put your phone and keys, heck it can even fit a wallet in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best little bag I ever bought!</li>
            <li>Love my purse very much, can&#x27;t wait to use it for the summer.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>Small purse, perfect for just a couple items, keys, wallet, phone.</li>
            <li>This small bag is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is small but perfect to use to go of picnic, with boots and dresses.</li>
            <li>I love this little purse, great for trips to the farmers market,  the mall or for walks.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re looking for something super cheap, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It came way before the estimated delivery and it is so small and just the perfect size to fit my phone and my huge wallet/keys, and then some, which really I just needed it to hold my keys, wallet and phone for when I don&#x27;t have pockets.</li>
            <li>More of an orange color in real life.</li>
            <li>So overall its it really good.</li>
            <li>The bag came in a case such as you would find for good quality bags, with a outer plastic cover.</li>
            <li>very ufgly but its okay becasue i gave it to my bitch roomate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, biggest complain is the strap since I will have to go out to find a matching strap that is longer.</li>
            <li>Again, this bag is not completely bad even with it&#x27;s imperfections.</li>
            <li>A little smelly out of the package but dryer sheets are a good fix!</li>
            <li>This is a great purse,I mean for the price I bought it for I&#x27;m satisfied with it for the price I got it.</li>
            <li>It has 2 places to put stuff in and is a good size, its not too big, but just right.</li>
            <li>i actually was very satisfied with this bag</li>
            <li>/&gt;And at last it was covered with some kind of oily-weird-sticky liquid that smelled kind of funny &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; but most of it came of with baby wipes and the rest on a daily use</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Cute and good too hold a couple of small items when going out to town or whatever.</li>
            <li>Cute and good too hold a couple of small items when going out to town or whatever.</li>
            <li>It is small but surprisingly spacious!</li>
            <li>Exactly The size I needed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong sturdy adorable purse, enough room for the essentials.</li>
            <li>however very good for a night out when only a few items are needed :) for the price its worth it</li>
            <li>I liked how it was a simple design, but I ordered brown</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>It is a great light weight bag , however , not so much space inside I was only able to fit my phone a pack of cigarettes and a small wallet .</li>
            <li>Just right for my neice.</li>
            <li>So am super satisfied with my cross body bag.</li>
            <li>It is great for carrying a small pen, chap stick, coin purse, &amp; I&#x27;D.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cute purse, not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I think I would rather spend a little more to get something that looks better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But with a good tight knot it&#x27;ll be ok&lt;</li>
            <li>I made a good decision to buy the little bag.</li>
            <li>It is just large enough for all her stuff, Great gift for a girl just starting school.</li>
            <li>it is SUCH a cute purse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally buying more.</li>
            <li>Higher quality than i thought&lt;br /&gt;cute looking bag</li>
            <li>Four stars because it is pretty orange, rather than having that brown leather color.</li>
            <li>And as for the picture the actual item was more of an orange color then brown</li>
            <li>The bag is exactly what my daughter wanted when she ordered it.</li>
            <li>Cute and simple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen same size purses for over $15 better material of course</li>
            <li>I think was more big</li>
            <li>The purse had a funny chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t exactly like the photo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, cute, and stylish.</li>
            <li>This bag is really pretty.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR, IT IS CUTE</li>
            <li>First of all it arrived like two weeks earlier than expected, that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>The other thing is the wax to make it look shiny; It&#x27;s kind of sticky</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really the only problem it is cute</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely and little more orange but is still super cute</li>
            <li>So very convenient, and doesn&#x27;t weigh much at all!  </li>
            <li>but I feel like this would be long for most tall people.</li>
            <li>She loved it and how small it was.</li>
            <li>Good to carry a phone and small things</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than being too small for my purposes, it seems fairly well made for something so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>not so good it is really small</li>
            <li>takes for ever to ship....:(&lt;br /&gt;Its too small and good just to carry mobile.</li>
            <li>is small but fit more stuff.</li>
            <li>No bad smell , felt soft , chains worked very well.</li>
            <li>It looks brown in the picture, but when I received it, the purse was orange, pure orange.</li>
            <li>I personally think smaller the better!  </li>
            <li>My friend had this exact mini bag in high school, I&#x27;m 50</li>
            <li>I love my little purse, it&#x27;s worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>Having recently been injured and having to use a cane these little crossbody bags are wonderful for short errands.  </li>
            <li>the phone ,keys ,credit ,card is very convenient</li>
            <li>so thats great but not happy with the color</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>really s***ty.  </li>
            <li>What I received wasn&#x27;t brown so much as it was burnt</li>
            <li>Much better workmanship than expected (because of the price).</li>
            <li>Recieved it much quicker than expect too.</li>
            <li>Buy without fear really is as seen...</li>
            <li>but I guess for 5 bucks I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I can only fit my wallet and lipgloss or my keys</li>
            <li>thinks she is all grown up when she puts her real cell phone in it, and her change purse.</li>
            <li>Very orange in color.</li>
            <li>But note that it does hold everything a girl REALLY NEEDS.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size - Small enough, but not too small and stylish.</li>
            <li>, I even zoomed in the pic and it looked brown but its actually very orange...</li>
            <li>It fits my Samsung galaxy note 3 very well.</li>
            <li>The purse is cute, what I expected size-wise.  </li>
            <li>In the publication the bag appears Brown color, but really the color is orange</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I remember when it broke she was really bummed.</li>
            <li>So you know the color does not represent it very well.</li>
            <li>very disappoint</li>
            <li>I gave three stars because the color is more orange than tan or brown and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as brown as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s very boho chic.  </li>
            <li>A young girl would love it and it comes in different colors.</li>
            <li>better then any other leather accessories.  </li>
            <li>I really liked that it fit my cellphone, wallet, keys, and glasses very well, and it was very practical and casual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of small</li>
            <li>I love this purse so much, i just got it last night, its small i can barely fit all my stuff in it, but then again i carry a lot of stuff</li>
            <li>No pockets on the inside, and stuff can easily fall out of te front pocket if you move a lot because it doesn&#x27;t zip closed.</li>
            <li>Craftsmanship showed slight imperfections... lining was not properly trimmed and extended beyond the seam stitching and showed on the outside of the bag, I was able to trim most of it off.</li>
            <li>but you can easily just rub that off with a wet paper towel.</li>
            <li>With all the concerns about safety of Chinese products and especially that this item might end up in the hands of children that information is certainly important!</li>
            <li>The space inside is decent for the size.</li>
            <li>So very soft!</li>
            <li>not too high end  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended+++</li>
            <li>This is a cute little purse, but my zipper broke and it took forever to come</li>
            <li>I love this little purse/bag.</li>
            <li>Cute little bag but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an adorable little satchel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>adorable little purse</li>
            <li>And the color is like a light brown not really orange like others say.  </li>
            <li>but it just happened over and over again based on the cheap zipper, which was also expected based on it costing four dollars.</li>
            <li>But cute, strap is unadjustable but long enough.</li>
            <li>After using it a few times it gets better.</li>
            <li>so I transfered purses and carried it normally.</li>
            <li>I only wanted a little bag to carry my small wallet and phone and its perfect!</li>
            <li>The material is not good as respected but its ok to use!</li>
            <li>The material is not good, wish it was better quality!</li>
            <li>Have had it since New Years.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this cute little bag if you are looking to buy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can not hold much if you are into major makeup and brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more oragne than it looks and the size is fairly small</li>
            <li>Small and cute</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s small and cute.</li>
            <li>its so small but cute...</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great little purse for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li>Outer pocket is large enough for a cell phone while the zipper portion can hold quite bit.</li>
            <li>better quality than i thought it would be- holds little things for my in my larger purse.</li>
            <li>Clearly on the picture it shows a peanut butter colored bag.</li>
            <li>Directly to trash</li>
            <li>and I would still have given the bag a 5 star review if it hadn&#x27;t been for that, because it was unexpected.</li>
            <li>This bag arrived extremely early, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I received it in the mail today.</li>
            <li>I wanted soft leather and got vinyl.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of these bags for 8 year old girls.</li>
            <li>The smell eventually completely wore off, which in my experience toughing it out</li>
            <li>Bough this for my 11 year old niece</li>
            <li>I gave it to a young girl.</li>
            <li>oh wow</li>
            <li>very adequate for just a small coinpurse/ credit card holder,cell phone and keys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only did I wait long for this purse it was not even worth it.</li>
            <li>but I fixed that I bought a small coin purse to fit inside  </li>
            <li>It comfortably carries my phone, iPod, small camera, lipstick, and wallet.</li>
            <li>I was in desperate need of a cheap new purse quick</li>
            <li>other thing to note is that the color in the picture doesn&#x27;t exactly match the product.</li>
            <li>and there is no other option for that.</li>
            <li>Besides the smell it has its good,I mean unless you smell the purse its fine.</li>
            <li>The bag came way before the estimated delivery date, however the bag barely holds my phone and wallet.</li>
            <li>And it was actually shipped directly from China.  </li>
            <li>is not great but okay for the price.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, especially considering the price, and you can just snap the top closed to keep everything from falling out.</li>
            <li>kind of small, fits a small wallet and a phone.</li>
            <li>strap did not come attached so you have to tie it yourself, good for being adjustable but looks a little sloppy when you have to knot it yourself.</li>
            <li>Its great only for your cellphone, small wallet and a few small things.</li>
            <li>I guess this is partially my fault for ordering this without reading the other reviews first</li>
            <li>I have a patchwork dress, and no kidding the little bag went really well with it.</li>
            <li>loved this bag too bad it ripped already</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is orange not brown and quite cheap looking</li>
            <li> my cell phone won&#x27;t even fit in it.  </li>
            <li> She can fit all kinds of stuff into it and its not too bulky.</li>
            <li> Easy wipe clean fabric for spills and no staining..</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s nice and it&#x27;s just a go out for a walk or to the mall kind of bag where you don&#x27;t really want to hold all that much.</li>
            <li> It is perfect the way it is, for when you want a small bag to put your phone and keys, heck it can even fit a wallet in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best little bag I ever bought!</li>
            <li> Love my purse very much, can&#x27;t wait to use it for the summer.</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> Small purse, perfect for just a couple items, keys, wallet, phone.</li>
            <li> This small bag is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is small but perfect to use to go of picnic, with boots and dresses.</li>
            <li> I love this little purse, great for trips to the farmers market,  the mall or for walks.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re looking for something super cheap, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It came way before the estimated delivery and it is so small and just the perfect size to fit my phone and my huge wallet/keys, and then some, which really I just needed it to hold my keys, wallet and phone for when I don&#x27;t have pockets.</li>
            <li> More of an orange color in real life.</li>
            <li> So overall its it really good.</li>
            <li> The bag came in a case such as you would find for good quality bags, with a outer plastic cover.</li>
            <li> very ufgly but its okay becasue i gave it to my bitch roomate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, biggest complain is the strap since I will have to go out to find a matching strap that is longer.</li>
            <li> Again, this bag is not completely bad even with it&#x27;s imperfections.</li>
            <li> A little smelly out of the package but dryer sheets are a good fix!</li>
            <li> This is a great purse,I mean for the price I bought it for I&#x27;m satisfied with it for the price I got it.</li>
            <li> It has 2 places to put stuff in and is a good size, its not too big, but just right.</li>
            <li> i actually was very satisfied with this bag</li>
            <li> /&gt;And at last it was covered with some kind of oily-weird-sticky liquid that smelled kind of funny &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; but most of it came of with baby wipes and the rest on a daily use</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Cute and good too hold a couple of small items when going out to town or whatever.</li>
            <li> Cute and good too hold a couple of small items when going out to town or whatever.</li>
            <li> It is small but surprisingly spacious!</li>
            <li> Exactly The size I needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong sturdy adorable purse, enough room for the essentials.</li>
            <li> however very good for a night out when only a few items are needed :) for the price its worth it</li>
            <li> I liked how it was a simple design, but I ordered brown</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> It is a great light weight bag , however , not so much space inside I was only able to fit my phone a pack of cigarettes and a small wallet .</li>
            <li> Just right for my neice.</li>
            <li> So am super satisfied with my cross body bag.</li>
            <li> It is great for carrying a small pen, chap stick, coin purse, &amp; I&#x27;D.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cute purse, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I think I would rather spend a little more to get something that looks better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But with a good tight knot it&#x27;ll be ok&lt;</li>
            <li> I made a good decision to buy the little bag.</li>
            <li> It is just large enough for all her stuff, Great gift for a girl just starting school.</li>
            <li> it is SUCH a cute purse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally buying more.</li>
            <li> Higher quality than i thought&lt;br /&gt;cute looking bag</li>
            <li> Four stars because it is pretty orange, rather than having that brown leather color.</li>
            <li> And as for the picture the actual item was more of an orange color then brown</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly what my daughter wanted when she ordered it.</li>
            <li> Cute and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen same size purses for over $15 better material of course</li>
            <li> I think was more big</li>
            <li> The purse had a funny chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t exactly like the photo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, cute, and stylish.</li>
            <li> This bag is really pretty.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR, IT IS CUTE</li>
            <li> First of all it arrived like two weeks earlier than expected, that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The other thing is the wax to make it look shiny; It&#x27;s kind of sticky</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really the only problem it is cute</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely and little more orange but is still super cute</li>
            <li> So very convenient, and doesn&#x27;t weigh much at all!  </li>
            <li> but I feel like this would be long for most tall people.</li>
            <li> She loved it and how small it was.</li>
            <li> Good to carry a phone and small things</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than being too small for my purposes, it seems fairly well made for something so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> not so good it is really small</li>
            <li> takes for ever to ship....:(&lt;br /&gt;Its too small and good just to carry mobile.</li>
            <li> is small but fit more stuff.</li>
            <li> No bad smell , felt soft , chains worked very well.</li>
            <li> It looks brown in the picture, but when I received it, the purse was orange, pure orange.</li>
            <li> I personally think smaller the better!  </li>
            <li> My friend had this exact mini bag in high school, I&#x27;m 50</li>
            <li> I love my little purse, it&#x27;s worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> Having recently been injured and having to use a cane these little crossbody bags are wonderful for short errands.  </li>
            <li> the phone ,keys ,credit ,card is very convenient</li>
            <li> so thats great but not happy with the color</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> really s***ty.  </li>
            <li> What I received wasn&#x27;t brown so much as it was burnt</li>
            <li> Much better workmanship than expected (because of the price).</li>
            <li> Recieved it much quicker than expect too.</li>
            <li> Buy without fear really is as seen...</li>
            <li> but I guess for 5 bucks I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I can only fit my wallet and lipgloss or my keys</li>
            <li> thinks she is all grown up when she puts her real cell phone in it, and her change purse.</li>
            <li> Very orange in color.</li>
            <li> But note that it does hold everything a girl REALLY NEEDS.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size - Small enough, but not too small and stylish.</li>
            <li> , I even zoomed in the pic and it looked brown but its actually very orange...</li>
            <li> It fits my Samsung galaxy note 3 very well.</li>
            <li> The purse is cute, what I expected size-wise.  </li>
            <li> In the publication the bag appears Brown color, but really the color is orange</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I remember when it broke she was really bummed.</li>
            <li> So you know the color does not represent it very well.</li>
            <li> very disappoint</li>
            <li> I gave three stars because the color is more orange than tan or brown and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as brown as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s very boho chic.  </li>
            <li> A young girl would love it and it comes in different colors.</li>
            <li> better then any other leather accessories.  </li>
            <li> I really liked that it fit my cellphone, wallet, keys, and glasses very well, and it was very practical and casual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of small</li>
            <li> I love this purse so much, i just got it last night, its small i can barely fit all my stuff in it, but then again i carry a lot of stuff</li>
            <li> No pockets on the inside, and stuff can easily fall out of te front pocket if you move a lot because it doesn&#x27;t zip closed.</li>
            <li> Craftsmanship showed slight imperfections... lining was not properly trimmed and extended beyond the seam stitching and showed on the outside of the bag, I was able to trim most of it off.</li>
            <li> but you can easily just rub that off with a wet paper towel.</li>
            <li> With all the concerns about safety of Chinese products and especially that this item might end up in the hands of children that information is certainly important!</li>
            <li> The space inside is decent for the size.</li>
            <li> So very soft!</li>
            <li> not too high end  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended+++</li>
            <li> This is a cute little purse, but my zipper broke and it took forever to come</li>
            <li> I love this little purse/bag.</li>
            <li> Cute little bag but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an adorable little satchel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> adorable little purse</li>
            <li> And the color is like a light brown not really orange like others say.  </li>
            <li> but it just happened over and over again based on the cheap zipper, which was also expected based on it costing four dollars.</li>
            <li> But cute, strap is unadjustable but long enough.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times it gets better.</li>
            <li> so I transfered purses and carried it normally.</li>
            <li> I only wanted a little bag to carry my small wallet and phone and its perfect!</li>
            <li> The material is not good as respected but its ok to use!</li>
            <li> The material is not good, wish it was better quality!</li>
            <li> Have had it since New Years.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this cute little bag if you are looking to buy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can not hold much if you are into major makeup and brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more oragne than it looks and the size is fairly small</li>
            <li> Small and cute</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s small and cute.</li>
            <li> its so small but cute...</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great little purse for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li> Outer pocket is large enough for a cell phone while the zipper portion can hold quite bit.</li>
            <li> better quality than i thought it would be- holds little things for my in my larger purse.</li>
            <li> Clearly on the picture it shows a peanut butter colored bag.</li>
            <li> Directly to trash</li>
            <li> and I would still have given the bag a 5 star review if it hadn&#x27;t been for that, because it was unexpected.</li>
            <li> This bag arrived extremely early, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I received it in the mail today.</li>
            <li> I wanted soft leather and got vinyl.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these bags for 8 year old girls.</li>
            <li> The smell eventually completely wore off, which in my experience toughing it out</li>
            <li> Bough this for my 11 year old niece</li>
            <li> I gave it to a young girl.</li>
            <li> oh wow</li>
            <li> very adequate for just a small coinpurse/ credit card holder,cell phone and keys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only did I wait long for this purse it was not even worth it.</li>
            <li> but I fixed that I bought a small coin purse to fit inside  </li>
            <li> It comfortably carries my phone, iPod, small camera, lipstick, and wallet.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a cheap new purse quick</li>
            <li> other thing to note is that the color in the picture doesn&#x27;t exactly match the product.</li>
            <li> and there is no other option for that.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell it has its good,I mean unless you smell the purse its fine.</li>
            <li> The bag came way before the estimated delivery date, however the bag barely holds my phone and wallet.</li>
            <li> And it was actually shipped directly from China.  </li>
            <li> is not great but okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, especially considering the price, and you can just snap the top closed to keep everything from falling out.</li>
            <li> kind of small, fits a small wallet and a phone.</li>
            <li> strap did not come attached so you have to tie it yourself, good for being adjustable but looks a little sloppy when you have to knot it yourself.</li>
            <li> Its great only for your cellphone, small wallet and a few small things.</li>
            <li> I guess this is partially my fault for ordering this without reading the other reviews first</li>
            <li> I have a patchwork dress, and no kidding the little bag went really well with it.</li>
            <li> loved this bag too bad it ripped already</li>
            <li> Was very small fits very small items only,Looks good far as fashion not for everyday wear</li>
            <li> But large enough to carry needed essentials, ex. driver&#x27;s license, a credit card, small amount of case and keys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok bag not that bad little good will recommended it for small girls who carry little stuff</li>
            <li> It is small and very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like this small shoulder bag  </li>
            <li> So, when I saw this I could&amp;#34;t believe my eyes, seriously it is the same exact one.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot smaller on the inside than expected</li>
            <li> strap is really long</li>
            <li> It even came earlier then it expected, I ordered it on Jan. 19,2014</li>
            <li> buh took long to arrive</li>
            <li> The strap to the purse is extremely long.</li>
            <li> The bag is a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than what I expected</li>
            <li> and instead I was a bit confused whether or not the purse they sent was the right one because the purse appeared a bit orange.</li>
            <li> She is quite big for her age and such a little lady.</li>
            <li> It also has a very strange smell.</li>
            <li> Too bad not American made but so many things aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Same as the Classic Fashion Leather tote - this one is more disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Then we have the sides where you have to tie the knot; It&#x27;s not a big deal if you tie it tightly or maybe put something on there to hold it.</li>
            <li> Just to hold my little objects when I don&#x27;t wanna carry that big purse around...</li>
            <li> I decided to tough that out as well because I really didn&#x27;t want to go through two week hassle for four dollars.</li>
            <li> It looks much more expensive than it actually is - for this reason, I&#x27;d buy it again, broken zipper or not.</li>
            <li> enough to hold a wallet, chap/lipstick, and a few odds &amp; ends...</li>
            <li> but this was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s everything I expected for 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just not quite expected, unless you&#x27;ve read other reviews of the product.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to hang off of the shoulder opposite from where it hangs on your body, but it&#x27;s thin &amp; easily cut by a thief if you aren&#x27;t watching your bad in a crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big</li>
            <li> so it may not exactly be what you want.</li>
            <li> so it may not exactly be what you want.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no big deal because I like small bags .</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Purse will hold your phone and small necessary items - without your feeling &amp;#34;weighted down&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said it was a orange color instead of brown.</li>
            <li> This purse is not one I&#x27;m going to throw away due to this</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this purse I was extremely skeptical, based on other peoples reviews of the product.</li>
            <li> When opening the mail bag I distinctively smelled the &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell other people in the reviews were talking about.</li>
            <li> I will still use it as an extra for small items.</li>
            <li> Serves my purpose small enough that it is not weighing me down.</li>
            <li> not worth the money because im never going to use it.</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the bag for the style but hate the color</li>
            <li> I also like the little front pocket for holding my other mac cords for my Ipod.</li>
            <li> Can hold a small cell phone, personal hygiene products and small makeup case and change purse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The purse was slow boated from Hong Kong which took an extremely long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to try and find something else that lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I needed a little purse to tag along.</li>
            <li> I am in awe with my LITTLE bag.</li>
            <li> My little didn&#x27;t even want the purse cause</li>
            <li> It holds my little wallet, phone and tube of chap stick.  </li>
            <li> Not flimsy, but then again, not designed for heavy use.</li>
            <li> Excellent-use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The handle was in the bag, not attached and the rear panel is not as round as it should be.</li>
            <li> She usually have her small dolls,comb, and other toys stuffed in her bags.</li>
            <li> I looove this little bag!</li>
            <li> However, the shipping is a little slow.</li>
            <li> Very little...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a person like me, who prefers small purses because you&#x27;ll fill whatever space</li>
            <li> , this is too small for you.</li>
            <li> Fits my keys my small wallet.</li>
            <li> i need a small bag to take to Disenyland.</li>
            <li> Definitely not convincing as leather, but I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This bag is SMALL so do not be fooled by the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to small</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> The purse size fits my small wallet, iPhone six, gum, headphones, Chapstick, and medicine nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> purse was extremely small.  </li>
            <li> carries my inhaler prescription bottle identification a small notebook and pen now</li>
            <li> When I received the bag, it had this weird smell, but I mean, it&#x27;s coming from a different place, so no biggie.</li>
            <li> (At least not on my computer.)</li>
            <li> I mean it looks like someone broke the zipper off.</li>
            <li> I mean I guess I got what I paid for I</li>
            <li> The style is very usual, and you can go with anything.</li>
            <li> It is cheap , poorly made and color is awful .</li>
            <li> I realized after I got the little bag that Pu means fake.</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> I bought the Brown bag and there&#x27;s a few things that were wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Poor quality busted 1st day</li>
            <li> I open the box and was very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the zipper broke immediately.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not THAT annoyed, but it&#x27;s inconvenient to have to repurchase so often</li>
            <li> unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but I care about the look not how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> It is a weird orange color.</li>
            <li> but the color is awful, its not brown in the least bit</li>
            <li> Bad purchase</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I bought it but didn&#x27;t expect it to look this bad.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not to bad</li>
            <li> And yes it does have an orange tint to it, but it&#x27;s not unforgivable or ugly.</li>
            <li> Took forever to receive and it is an ugly orange color.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Annoying,</li>
            <li> it is a TERRIBLE ORANGE COLOR.</li>
            <li> Whatever this is made of smells awful.</li>
            <li> They have a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too terribly overpowering</li>

            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my friend. She loved it and how small it was. Good to carry a phone and small things</li>
            <li> it is SUCH a cute purse but the color is awful, its not brown in the least bit it is a TERRIBLE ORANGE COLOR. not worth the money because im never going to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute it&#x27;s a perfect size you can put the phone ,keys ,credit ,card is very convenient</li>
            <li> Great purse for young girls/Tweens but it took forever to receive. It took a month. Otherwise bey nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute, and small it&#x27;s perfect now that my kid takes a backpack with his stuff. I&#x27;m totally buying more.</li>
            <li> Higher quality than i thought&lt;br /&gt;cute looking bag</li>
            <li> It came way before the estimated delivery and it is so small and just the perfect size to fit my phone and my huge wallet/keys, and then some, which really I just needed it to hold my keys, wallet and phone for when I don&#x27;t have pockets. :b</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look how it looks in photos. More of an orange color in real life. But cute, strap is unadjustable but long enough. Cute and small, but not too small.</li>
            <li> The bag is really nice but it&#x27;s not even brown it looks kind of orange it came before it&#x27;s time so thats great but not happy with the color</li>
            <li> Cute! Perfect for when you don&#x27;t want to carry too much.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected it.</li>
            <li> Cute and good too hold a couple of small items when going out to town or whatever. The color is deceiving in the picture thought, it&#x27;s not a brown leather, it&#x27;s orange so it may not exactly be what you want.</li>
            <li> The material is not good as respected but its ok to use!</li>
            <li> It looks brown in the picture, but when I received it, the purse was orange, pure orange. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Whatever this is made of smells awful. Directly to trash</li>
            <li> Cute purse! I really liked that it fit my cellphone, wallet, keys, and glasses very well, and it was very practical and casual. I liked how it was a simple design, but I ordered brown and instead I was a bit confused whether or not the purse they sent was the right one because the purse appeared a bit orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is so cute, it is exactly what I wanted! I only wanted a little bag to carry my small wallet and phone and its perfect! A little smelly out of the package but dryer sheets are a good fix! I recommend this cute little bag if you are looking to buy! So worth it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good material and beautiful color, perfect size, I&#x27;m happy, very good product,Excellent product, very good material and beautiful color, perfect size, I&#x27;m happy, very good product.Excellent product, very good material and beautiful color, perfect size, I&#x27;m happy, very good product</li>
            <li> This purse is so cute, stylish, and.... convenient. I love it. Four stars because it is pretty orange, rather than having that brown leather color.</li>
            <li> It works well for holding my Mac laptop charger!  I also like the little front pocket for holding my other mac cords for my Ipod.</li>
            <li> Small purse, perfect for just a couple items, keys, wallet, phone. Strap is perfect length for wearing across your body. Some off-gassing, it came with a plastic-y death smell. I left it on the porch where the sun could hit it and heat it up, a couple days of sun and open air and the smell was gone. While wearing it I had to convince a friend it wasn&#x27;t leather.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be cute for my daughter . It&#x27;s NOT . It is cheap , poorly made and color is awful . You get what you pay for .</li>
            <li> This looks really nice, super stylish, very practical. Unfortunately, the zipper broke immediately. Not a huge deal, especially considering the price, and you can just snap the top closed to keep everything from falling out. It looks much more expensive than it actually is - for this reason, I&#x27;d buy it again, broken zipper or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more oragne than it looks and the size is fairly small but it&#x27;s good and mobile</li>
            <li> So very convenient, and doesn&#x27;t weigh much at all!  Freedom from big purses and everything in them!</li>
            <li> Cute and good too hold a couple of small items when going out to town or whatever. The color is deceiving in the picture thought, it&#x27;s not a brown leather, it&#x27;s orange so it may not exactly be what you want.</li>
            <li> Super cute it even matches perfect a new pair of sandals I just bought. So am super satisfied with my cross body bag.</li>
            <li> The leather colored purse option was purchased.  Do not purchase this color if you want a leather style purse.  The overall quality and construction of the purse was as desired, yet dyed orange.  Would match a Miami Dolphins jersey better then any other leather accessories.  I ended up returning this item.</li>
            <li> it broke.  really s***ty.  not worth it.</li>
            <li> loved this bag too bad it ripped already i actually was very satisfied with this bag</li>
            <li> Note the word &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; in the description. This purse is really only big enough to hold a wallet and a tube of chapstick. If you&#x27;re a person like me, who prefers small purses because you&#x27;ll fill whatever space you&#x27;re give and don&#x27;t need to be lugging 40 pounds of crayons, but has a huge Otterbox on her phone, this is too small for you. It is the perfect size for my daughter to play dress up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing to note is that the color in the picture doesn&#x27;t exactly match the product. (At least not on my computer.) What I received wasn&#x27;t brown so much as it was burnt orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than being too small for my purposes, it seems fairly well made for something so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Really nice, very good quality. Much thicker , with excellent stitching. Much better workmanship than expected (because of the price). Recieved it much quicker than expect too. Just all around great experience</li>
            <li> Got this purse today i love it. Fits my keys my small wallet. This small bag is awesome. Bring it to work with me to.</li>
            <li> Great bag, very cute. Kind of more orange than brown, but still cute. No pockets on the inside, and stuff can easily fall out of te front pocket if you move a lot because it doesn&#x27;t zip closed. But I am pleased and carry it everywhere I go!</li>
            <li> I like it. It is so lovely. And it so cheap. I made a good decision to buy the little bag. However, the shipping is a little slow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter. It is just large enough for all her stuff, Great gift for a girl just starting school.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations! Excellent presentation and in perfect condition. Buy without fear really is as seen... Me encanta! I Love it</li>
            <li> better quality than i thought it would be- holds little things for my in my larger purse. feels like leather</li>
            <li> Serves my purpose small enough that it is not weighing me down. But large enough to carry needed essentials, ex. driver&#x27;s license, a credit card, small amount of case and keys.</li>
            <li> It was a okay bag, but it is orange. Clearly on the picture it shows a peanut butter colored bag. I gave it three stars bc its not the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This item arrived within the month of ordering it . When I received it , it had some kind of funky smell . I assumed it was from the packaging and he fact that it was shipped from China . It is a great light weight bag , however , not so much space inside I was only able to fit my phone a pack of cigarettes and a small wallet . That&#x27;s no big deal because I like small bags . It&#x27;s a cross body over the shoulder bag . And as for the picture the actual item was more of an orange color then brown</li>
            <li> Met my expectation, very cute! Love the color and strap. Ideally holds exactly what I need on the go. Great!</li>
            <li> You do have to air them out. They have a terrible smell. After two weeks, the odor dissipates. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> just what you see is what you get!&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something this simple. After using it a few times it gets better.</li>
            <li> The color was not what I hoped it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the days you don&#x27;t feel like carrying around A really big purse and looks exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Love love love reordered for mother in law will order more in all colors</li>
            <li> It lasted through about 4 months of regular use before one of the tabs that holds the strap broke. Annoying, but I guess for 5 bucks I can&#x27;t complain too much. Other than that though I really liked it. Good size for my wallet, keys and cell phone, which a lot of the time is all I need.   Edit: 11/5/15  I bought another one and again after about 4 months it&#x27;s breaking in the same spot. Again, you get what you pay for so I&#x27;m not THAT annoyed, but it&#x27;s inconvenient to have to repurchase so often so I&#x27;m going to try and find something else that lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> i love it. It was just what i was looking for. Small and cute i need a small bag to take to Disenyland. and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it for shopping and I can carry just what I need.</li>
            <li> Nice nice recomend this!</li>
            <li> meets expectations, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> The bag is exactly what my daughter wanted when she ordered it. The color is more orange than the brown shown on the site, but it&#x27;s not neon orange. It&#x27;s not bad. Just not quite expected, unless you&#x27;ve read other reviews of the product. It seems well-made. Not flimsy, but then again, not designed for heavy use. The cord is long enough to hang off of the shoulder opposite from where it hangs on your body, but it&#x27;s thin &amp; easily cut by a thief if you aren&#x27;t watching your bad in a crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big enough to hold a wallet, chap/lipstick, and a few odds &amp; ends...you know, girl stuff for those times you need them.</li>
            <li> Best little bag I ever bought!</li>
            <li> very adequate for just a small coinpurse/ credit card holder,cell phone and keys.&lt;br /&gt;Can not hold much if you are into major makeup and brush.  I personally think smaller the better!  Would recommend for a no frills holds necessities purse.  Looks of faux leather not too high end  unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Definitely my go to purse.</li>
            <li> Not enough time to use the item.</li>
            <li> This purse is beautiful. The material is leather. is not great but okay for the price. is small but fit more stuff.</li>
            <li> Comes damage don&#x27;t buy&lt;br /&gt;Is not good</li>
            <li> It is small and very convenient. Ideal if u only want to carry some money, cards and cell phone with u... its sturdy and looks durable. the color is lovely! its a cute nice purse..very handy</li>
            <li> The strap is so short that you cannot wear the purse as a crossover.  It also has a very strange smell. Not bad for the price, biggest complain is the strap since I will have to go out to find a matching strap that is longer. Perfect size and color though.</li>
            <li> YKS bag  material does not looks like leather the quality of the bag looks cheap. Not impress by the quality.</li>
            <li> His bag is cute ilove it and have been using it all the time it&#x27;s definitely and little more orange but is still super cute it&#x27;s a lot smaller on the inside than expected I can only fit my wallet and lipgloss or my keys but I still love it</li>
            <li> Give this product a 3 cause it&#x27;s comes frm china n it take a month 2 come n the color it&#x27;s not the same as the pic (brown) that&#x27;s really the only problem it is cute n roomy 4 ur lip gloss keys n ect</li>
            <li> I used this purse on a trip &amp; it was the perfect size. It is great for carrying a small pen, chap stick, coin purse, &amp; I&#x27;D.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little purse, but my zipper broke and it took forever to come</li>
            <li> I love it.. It serves it&#x27;s purpose of the reason I bought.... Just to hold my little objects when I don&#x27;t wanna carry that big purse around...</li>
            <li> I love this little purse/bag.This bag is so cute and goes with anything. It has 2 places to put stuff in and is a good size, its not too big, but just right.I love it and would recommend it to anyone, although it took a while to get to my house. Other than that its a great little purse for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li> Love my purse very much, can&#x27;t wait to use it for the summer. Nice an roomy inside for your accessories. Thinking about buying more colors. An mainly, a very great price !!!!!</li>
            <li> This item ships from China! I think that should have been included in the description of the item. With all the concerns about safety of Chinese products and especially that this item might end up in the hands of children that information is certainly important!</li>
            <li> OMG I didn&#x27;t expect this quality. It&#x27;s so cute. It&#x27;s actually more to orange compared to picture. Inside in nice and comfy. Really nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cute purse, not what I expected. Strap is too short for me for a messager bag.......... Keeping it though</li>
            <li> My granddaughter love it.she thinks she is all grown up when she puts her real cell phone in it, and her change purse.</li>
            <li> Cute little bag but the color is some what off..I would say more orange than brown..but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This bag is so cheap but good quality. I wanted the same color that in the picture but it is as orange, not brown. It is small but perfect to use to go of picnic, with boots and dresses. It is perfect to use when we don&#x27;t want to carry a lot of things.</li>
            <li> Definitely not convincing as leather, but I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments. Very orange in color. Would be perfect for a teenager.</li>
            <li> Purse will hold your phone and small necessary items - without your feeling &amp;#34;weighted down&amp;#34;.  A young girl would love it and it comes in different colors.</li>
            <li> Love this bag!!! So cute!!! Got one for me and my daughter.  Perfect for outdoor outings!!! Plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Roomful despite its size. My go-to bag it is.</li>
            <li> The strings were not attached to the purse and the stitching is off in the front.  The purse will serve its purpose while on vacation and I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li> Very good! but so big!!</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and it smells a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cute purse and looks like it holds slit</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an adorable little satchel.&lt;br /&gt;your mascara, phone, ID, things like that will fit.&lt;br /&gt;the strap is really long and i&#x27;m 5&#x27;5, so i just undid one end, cut it, stuck it through the hole and tied it back up again. a perfect fit now, and it was an easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;oh, the only thing i guess i don&#x27;t like about it is the fact that it&#x27;s more orange than &#x27;tan&#x27;</li>
            <li> Smells like plastic poison death. Bad purchase</li>
            <li> very cute bag. love it.</li>
            <li> I looove this little bag! However it does ship from China so it WILL take like 3 weeks or so to get to its destination. I read other reviews that said it was a orange color instead of brown. Mine came as the color I ordered, brown! Overall great bag!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! It does hold more than it may seem. It&#x27;s a strong sturdy adorable purse, enough room for the essentials. And yes it does have an orange tint to it, but it&#x27;s not unforgivable or ugly. Very good deal especially for the price</li>
            <li> It took quite a while for it to come in, but it quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;It kind of small, fits a small wallet and a phone. Not to spaceish.&lt;br /&gt;The strap looks like it could come off easily if you don&#x27;t tighten the knot.</li>
            <li> Same as the Classic Fashion Leather tote - this one is more disgusting.  Smells of cheap leather and I know it&#x27;s cheap that&#x27;s why I bought it but didn&#x27;t expect it to look this bad.  Now, I don&#x27;t even know if I could give it as a give.</li>
            <li> The bag is really cute. I got it for a friend for her birthday. The only thing is you have to tie in the shoulder strap yourself.  Even so it&#x27;s and adorable little purse and I would still have given the bag a 5 star review if it hadn&#x27;t been for that, because it was unexpected.</li>
            <li> First of all it arrived like two weeks earlier than expected, that&#x27;s great&lt;br /&gt;Second not so good it is really small xD but that&#x27;s what makes it so cute&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that you have to tie the cord because it is not attached :/&lt;br /&gt;But with a good tight knot it&#x27;ll be ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at last it was covered with some kind of oily-weird-sticky liquid that smelled kind of funny &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; but most of it came of with baby wipes and the rest on a daily use</li>
            <li> I go bike riding a lot and I needed a little purse to tag along. This bag is SMALL so do not be fooled by the picture. But note that it does hold everything a girl REALLY NEEDS. I am in awe with my LITTLE bag.</li>
            <li> i did not like that, i had to put the strap together, when it should of had them on the bag already</li>
            <li> Love this cute tote,perfect size for keys and stuff</li>
            <li> This bag arrived extremely early, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I received it in the mail today. And one word for this bag......&lt;br /&gt;Adorable!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of small but it is a mini shoulder bag, what do you expect. It is perfect the way it is, for when you want a small bag to put your phone and keys, heck it can even fit a wallet in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag itself is very beautiful, its a nice brown that will match with many types and color of clothing, and not to mention it looks very well crafted and looks like it should be worth much more that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> really cute and i like that its not oversized (:</li>
            <li> My daughter loved her bag. Cute and simple.</li>
            <li> Just right for my neice.</li>
            <li> Waaay more orange than leather colored but suuuper cute. I really like it. one thing though is that the front pocket doesnt close so the things put in it arent safe. however very good for a night out when only a few items are needed :) for the price its worth it</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase, excellent product quality is described, thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this purse. It is the perfect size - Small enough, but not too small and stylish. Neutral color. Plus, she can wear it cross-body which helps her to keep up with it. She&#x27;s a preteen.</li>
            <li> I love my little purse, it&#x27;s worth what I paid. Remember it&#x27;s only $6. I can fit my phone, keys, ID &amp; cards &amp; a couple more things. Cute summer purse. I got what I paid for... I&#x27;ve seen same size purses for over $15 better material of course but I care about the look not how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> I love this purse so much, i just got it last night, its small i can barely fit all my stuff in it, but then again i carry a lot of stuff BUT!, this is so cute and adorable, i have gotten so many complements on just the first day of wearing it, i plan to buy another one just so that i have more then one color of these purses.</li>
            <li> I like it but, feels cheap</li>
            <li> Enough to carry ya mobile</li>
            <li> I guess this is partially my fault for ordering this without reading the other reviews first but this was not what I had expected. It had a 4 star rating so I thought it&#x27;d be safe but when I ordered this I thought I was purchasing a brown purse, I even zoomed in the pic and it looked brown but its actually very orange...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to small I think was more big</li>
            <li> I like or love the song or item. I do not know what else to type after I rate it.</li>
            <li> I learned an important lesson about checking dimensions on things from this bag. I can use it, but not as intended. Also, faulty zipper.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day and have had no problems with the cheapness of it. It is shiney, faux leather but it&#x27;s everything I expected for 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> Looks orange not brown, and flips over a lot while wearing</li>
            <li> Gorgeous !! it could have came quicker but such a great price</li>
            <li> This is a great purse,I mean for the price I bought it for I&#x27;m satisfied with it for the price I got it. It even came earlier then it expected, I ordered it on Jan. 19,2014 and it was supposed to come on Feb. 4,2015 at 8pm, but it came a week before Jan.19,2015 so I feel happy. Besides the smell it has its good,I mean unless you smell the purse its fine. Anyway the smell will go away eventually. Also they&#x27;ll give you the strap inside the purse and you have to tie it on yourself but that&#x27;s not to bad also there is no adjusting strap or anything. And the color is like a light brown not really orange like others say.  The space inside is decent for the size. So overall its it really good. I&#x27;m reviewimg this from my dad account</li>
            <li> Took forever to receive and it is an ugly orange color.</li>
            <li> Poor quality busted 1st day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my grand daughter will love it.If it ever gets here</li>
            <li> It is orange not brown and quite cheap looking</li>
            <li> You have to assemble bag if not for that it would be a good bag.there is no  handle</li>
            <li> Ripped almost instantly.</li>
            <li> The purse had a funny chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. I gave it my granddaughter to play with.</li>
            <li> Excellent-use it everyday.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The bag came way before the estimated delivery date, however the bag barely holds my phone and wallet. And this bag is ORANGE.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t exactly like the photo but it&#x27;s small and cute.</li>
            <li> Not only did I wait long for this purse it was not even worth it. The purse is a nice size but its orange not brown. My purse also came without a working zipper.  I mean it looks like someone broke the zipper off. I mean I guess I got what I paid for I but I would not reccommend this to anyone. Go to target or something and see what your actually buying.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Did not notice the ties on the side, so they will come lose. But it does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> Product as described. The purse is a beautiful light brown color. It fits my Samsung galaxy note 3 very well. Highly recommended+++</li>
            <li> Did not care for this purse. The color was too orange. I think I would rather spend a little more to get something that looks better.</li>
            <li> very nice good product</li>
            <li> Cute bag more orange than tan but I can make it work</li>
            <li> Adorable bag, love it.</li>
            <li> strap did not come attached so you have to tie it yourself, good for being adjustable but looks a little sloppy when you have to knot it yourself.</li>
            <li> This Mini Shoulder bag was purchased for a three years. She is quite big for her age and such a little lady. She carries a bag where ever she goes. She usually have her small dolls,comb, and other toys stuffed in her bags. This was quite a surprise because it is well made and the quality of leather was exceptional. The bag came in a case such as you would find for good quality bags, with a outer plastic cover. This was a great find, I can see myself using this bag.  Outer pocket is large enough for a cell phone while the zipper portion can hold quite bit. Great Price, great craftsmanship and color.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting my purse, but it took over 3 weeks to arrive. Before ordering the purse I zoom in to view the size of the item and thought it would be perfect when I decided to leave my larger purse. I open the box and was very, very disappointed. The purse was sure a MINI handbag. It can not hold nothing but a pack cigarettes and lighter or money and keys. My little didn&#x27;t even want the purse cause it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> It is not leather--it&#x27;s PVC.  The handle was in the bag, not attached and the rear panel is not as round as it should be. Having recently been injured and having to use a cane these little crossbody bags are wonderful for short errands.  Phone, keys and room for a bit more.  It will do.</li>
            <li> Fits my iPhone 4s, lipsticks, and walled just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute purse BUT this isn&#x27;t a tan looking purse at all... If anything the color is orangy. This purse is not one I&#x27;m going to throw away due to this but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This bag looks like brown leather in the picture but it is actually bright orange. Love the bag for the style but hate the color and there is no other option for that.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED MY MINI PURSE AND I *LOVE* IT. GLAD I MADE THE CHOICE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM!! THANK YOU YKS!!! :)</li>
            <li> I realized after I got the little bag that Pu means fake. I wanted soft leather and got vinyl. Disappointed</li>
            <li> The purse is cute, what I expected size-wise.  Craftsmanship showed slight imperfections... lining was not properly trimmed and extended beyond the seam stitching and showed on the outside of the bag, I was able to trim most of it off.</li>
            <li> In the publication the bag appears Brown color, but really the color is orange</li>
            <li> Love ittt its not that brown but it matches my shoes that i baught it goes perfect thank u buh took long to arrive buh still came i love it</li>
            <li> pequeño y cómodo, sirve para llevar el teléfono, la plata y las tarjetas</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these bags for 8 year old girls. It was priced around $5. I really liked the way it looked. No bad smell , felt soft , chains worked very well. And of course nice finish!!&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy to know that both of them enjoyed carrying it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Brown bag and there&#x27;s a few things that were wrong with it. For one, it&#x27;s not brown, it&#x27;s orangey, but it&#x27;s still a very nice color and can easily pass for a bright brown. When I received the bag, it had this weird smell, but I mean, it&#x27;s coming from a different place, so no biggie. The other thing is the wax to make it look shiny; It&#x27;s kind of sticky but you can easily just rub that off with a wet paper towel. Then we have the sides where you have to tie the knot; It&#x27;s not a big deal if you tie it tightly or maybe put something on there to hold it. Again, this bag is not completely bad even with it&#x27;s imperfections. For the price it&#x27;s nice and it&#x27;s just a go out for a walk or to the mall kind of bag where you don&#x27;t really want to hold all that much. What more can you expect from a $4 bag? Fits your phone(IPhone or smaller), makeup and money.</li>
            <li> The purse is soo amazing! I love it, its super cute. It&#x27;s small, cute, and stylish. I wanna buy another :D!! Also good material quality</li>
            <li> like the size,but it&#x27;s more orange than brown</li>
            <li> I love it but the brown was more of an orange color.</li>
            <li> small,beautiful and practical</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this purse I was extremely skeptical, based on other peoples reviews of the product. I was in desperate need of a cheap new purse quick so u budged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purse was slow boated from Hong Kong which took an extremely long time to arrive. It still came about 4 days early which was a pleasant surprise. When opening the mail bag I distinctively smelled the &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell other people in the reviews were talking about. It wasn&#x27;t too terribly overpowering so I transfered purses and carried it normally. The smell eventually completely wore off, which in my experience toughing it out is the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival the bag was basically in four dollar condition as you would expect. I ordered the purse in brown but it arrived orange. I decided to tough that out as well because I really didn&#x27;t want to go through two week hassle for four dollars. Eventually I grew to like the Orange. The strap to the purse is extremely long. Im a short person but I feel like this would be long for most tall people. I tied a knot with lead way to make it shorter and that worked well. The zipper to the purse began to go off track the day after I recieved it. I got it back on but it just happened over and over again based on the cheap zipper, which was also expected based on it costing four dollars. I eventually gave up on the zipper and just used the magnetic flap. The purse size fits my small wallet, iPhone six, gum, headphones, Chapstick, and medicine nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good purse considering it cost 4 dollars and if you&#x27;re looking for something super cheap, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Just like in the picture, you can put inside many things for the size, y love the color and the material is very good... I recommend it</li>
            <li> The material is not good, wish it was better quality! takes for ever to ship....:(&lt;br /&gt;Its too small and good just to carry mobile.</li>
            <li> This bag is adorable! Well worth the money and I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments. It comfortably carries my phone, iPod, small camera, lipstick, and wallet. It is small but surprisingly spacious!</li>
            <li> i regret purchasing this...it&#x27;s probably my own fault...i ignored the &amp;#34;cute girl&amp;#34; part...it&#x27;s really rather a bright orange and it is tiny TINY...i&#x27;m just going to give it to a friend&#x27;s kid or something...</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe I found a real leather purse such a perfect size and good price.  And it was actually shipped directly from China.  Too bad not American made but so many things aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> excellent seller highly recommend</li>
            <li> The purse is very lovely, Made very well, andit was packaged really good. The color is very pretty. I am well pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a cute bag with a great price. It feels and looks like leather and it holds all my necessary items such as my phone, money, and pepperspray.</li>
            <li> My friend had this exact mini bag in high school, I&#x27;m 50 haha. I remember when it broke she was really bummed. So, when I saw this I could&amp;#34;t believe my eyes, seriously it is the same exact one. So you know the color does not represent it very well. It is a weird orange color. I bought 2, one for me and one for her. I have a patchwork dress, and no kidding the little bag went really well with it. Yeh I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok bag not that bad little good will recommended it for small girls who carry little stuff not bad ok one</li>
            <li> So very soft! Roomy too!</li>
            <li> Very cute and compact, but cheaply made.  What can you expect for 5 dollars though.</li>
            <li> purse was extremely small.  my cell phone won&#x27;t even fit in it.  Its more like a coin purse.  very disappoint</li>
            <li> its so small but cute...</li>
            <li> !!!!!!!!!!COULD SOMEONE UPLOAD A PHOTO OF THIS BAG?! I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN PERSON OKAY</li>
            <li> The bag is a bit smaller than I expected. I will still use it as an extra for small items.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVED IT MATCHED HER SANDALS PERFECT AMAZON ROCKS</li>
            <li> I like then item it was perfect until the strap of it broke off.. not even 2 weeks until I got it.. now I can&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> I love this little purse, great for trips to the farmers market,  the mall or for walks.  It holds my little wallet, phone and tube of chap stick.  Great for hands free shopping when you don&#x27;t want to lug around a large purse or leave it in the shopping cart.  Perfect for just the essentials</li>
            <li> Love the style and quality of this bag. I gave three stars because the color is more orange than tan or brown and wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as brown as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s very boho chic.  Perfect size for going out and just taking the necessary cell phone, ID, $$, even a special place for your smokes!</li>
            <li> Bough this for my 11 year old niece and she loves it. She can fit all kinds of stuff into it and its not too bulky. Can hold a small cell phone, personal hygiene products and small makeup case and change purse. Easy wipe clean fabric for spills and no staining.. Have had it since New Years.  Great buy for a preteen girl.</li>
            <li> very ufgly but its okay becasue i gave it to my bitch roomate.</li>
            <li> Exactly The size I needed! Its great only for your cellphone, small wallet and a few small things. The color seems like brownish but its more orange!!</li>
            <li> it is convenient for going out placing cellphone and credit card in it. The style is very usual, and you can go with anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this small shoulder bag  carries my inhaler prescription bottle identification a small notebook and pen now the coin purse in front could use a zipper  but I fixed that I bought a small coin purse to fit inside  the middle of purse has a zipper so no problem there I use it when I am shopping</li>
            <li> On time delivery...Worth for the price...Will recommend to buy.....Elegant shape, good leather, receieved the product on time. Good one. Happy !!!</li>
            <li> Color is actually orange, it looks tan in the picture.</li>
