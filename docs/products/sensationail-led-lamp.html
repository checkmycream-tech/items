            <li>Definitely a good deal for a lamp for doing gel nails.</li>
            <li>A timer would&#x27;ve been good</li>

            <li>So that can&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li>This is the best LED light I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m becoming so good at doing my own nails at home, it&#x27;s priceless!</li>

            <li>i do my own nails</li>
            <li>Good investment:))</li>
            <li>I just started doing my own nails</li>
            <li>but you can do your own nails and are guaranteed a salon finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to spend hours in a salon.  </li>
            <li>I can get my nails does beautifully on my own time in my own home.</li>
            <li>Liked it</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this if you do your own nails.  </li>
            <li>which was nice.</li>
            <li>I had one of these lamps that came with a starter gel kit that Sensationai sales, and i really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because I wanted to start doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>But I found it on my own...</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about this lamp because of how cheap it was, but I bought it anyways because of how many great reviews there were.</li>
            <li>Works well and super great price</li>
            <li>Its a good UV Lamp easy to handle and to move it.</li>
            <li>Love this light!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, compact to travel with it, very good product for the price ...</li>
            <li>The light is bright and doesn&#x27;t flicker.</li>
            <li>The light is maybe a bit bright</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing nails for over 10 years and this is by far the quickest way to do them and get flawless results, and you also save about 40 bucks by not going to the salon every 2-3 weeks to get backfills, etc.</li>
            <li>Works great....very easy to use for a person doing their own nails on their own time.</li>
            <li>Compact easy to take anywhere you travel!</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find out that it was available without having to purchase a whole starter kit again.  </li>
            <li>Quality is great and it saves me so much money to be able to do my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Okay for the price.</li>
            <li>so I can do my families nails while I&#x27;m home :)</li>
            <li>This is really a great, affordable product that is way more effective than my old UV lamp.</li>
            <li>Have purchased a replacement that works much better and faster.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>1 or 2 minutes more - just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t forget to buy the GEL NAIL POLISH to go along with it :)</li>

            <li>I love that the machine shuts off after 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>This one is better than the one that came with my kit.</li>
            <li>Many more but too many to list.</li>
            <li>OK home gels are magic, and I will never get another gel manicure at the salon.</li>

            <li>I am soooo glad I did.  </li>

            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>It would be very easy to fit your toes</li>
            <li>And at this price, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>Yes you have to dry your thumbs separately however for the price I am very very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this Led light.</li>
            <li>good price, and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Purchased this due to excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>This nail dryer does what it is supposed to and is compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to travel with and carry around.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s size makes it easy to store and carry around.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Lamps can run up to $600 easily.</li>
            <li>I just apply sunscreen to the tops and sides of my hands before I polish, and then I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>and they tell me it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and there are easy how to videos available online.</li>
            <li>HAVE NO IDEA what he did, but works fine.</li>
            <li>Which is fine for me as I prefer gelish or Sensationail..</li>
            <li>It works fine on my feets.</li>
            <li>Love it for the quick drying time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this little powerfull LED lam.</li>
            <li>..D light not a uv</li>
            <li>The UV light has been bothering me</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift, but felt I couldn&#x27;t give it as one because the light wasn&#x27;t in any packaging.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money, and its also compact enough to not take up an ungodly amount of space.</li>
            <li>It is set at a fantastic price</li>
            <li>, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various brands of gel polishes with it and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li>Beeps to alert every minute and the light goes off after two minutes</li>
            <li>I received my light yesterday.</li>
            <li>A free polish came with mine.</li>
            <li>If all you need is a gel polish light, this is the one.</li>
            <li>- I think that&#x27;s the brand not the light.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Somehow I lost the cord that goes with my light.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s say I gave my UV light away.</li>
            <li>Do not spend lots of money on a uv light.</li>
            <li>It has a timer feature built-in, and will comfortably fit 4 fingers at a time.</li>
            <li>This light was relatively cheap and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>This really makes you a pro in your own home.</li>
            <li>they included a couple more things but not $50.00 worth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the non-UV lamps but this is far superior.  </li>
            <li>haha!!!</li>
            <li>thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>It World fine - I use it with Gelish and is 100% satisfied;-)</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use the special gloves to protect my hands from the uv light or use sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have this lamp.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I received this lamp about a month ago and after using it for my mom and I, I have to say it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>The only one that doesn&#x27;t seem to always cure perfectly is the Red Carpet Manicure, but once you put a top coat on</li>
            <li>I loved the price of this one (half the price of the one I was looking at in the store) &amp; saw that it got pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>Then gel coat again (capping) with some acrylic powder on top, cured for a minute, gently sanded the hardened acrylic/gel to shape, repeated process two more times (each time curing a minute), then finished with a simple gel top coat, cured again for a minute, and voila!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave feedback, but because the seller went an extra mile and put a smile on my face, I will take the time to leave a great review!</li>
            <li>I Love, Love, Love this little Led light!</li>
            <li>Hard perfect</li>
            <li>(It was a gorgeous deep red/berry color)</li>
            <li>This lamp is able to cure my gelish polish in 30 seconds, there&#x27;s a button on top that turns on light, it stays on for one minute but chirps at you at the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is good enough for home use.</li>
            <li>Does a good job and is half the cost of most.</li>
            <li>Great little light.</li>
            <li>Other then that  the machine is great .</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind because it works so quickly.</li>
            <li>received quickly, already using it.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t tried a different brand nail polish, I have the sensational gel polish.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>so for a starter and back up lamp until I generate addtl funds for a larger one this is perfect!</li>
            <li>,I use my LED Lamp by SesationNail for my own nails,I  have Clear Gel (Gelish) overlay over my own natural nails ,helps stop the peeling ,so I can grow my own nails and regular nail polish+nailart</li>
            <li>LED light is much quicker than my UV light I bought before.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this system and gel polish to anyone who wants a perfect manicure that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used this for half a year and it works great.</li>
            <li>It was in great condition and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is easier to take with me than the larger, full hand, lamp I own.</li>
            <li>A half an inch more would do fine for most of us.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Amazing little easy to store LED light.</li>
            <li>You can fit your whole hand in it.</li>
            <li>this light really works.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...packaged well &amp; even got a free sample of gel nail polish with it.  </li>
            <li>One thing I can say is that I can&#x27;t comfortably put my whole hand under the lights.</li>
            <li>Works great ,30 sec burps,1min beeps ,very compact ,cures all 4 fingers then</li>
            <li>Not bad for a first LED light, but I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for better ones on the market.</li>
            <li>I actually had this and spilled something on the top and couldn&#x27;t push the button to turn the light on</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel nails for about the last 6 years with a UV lamp</li>
            <li>Good shipper..came as expected.</li>
            <li>its smaller than I expected nut works perfectly.</li>
            <li>So much better than my UV light and much smaller to store.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend applying a high SPF sun screen (35-50), or the manicure protective gloves before use.</li>
            <li>Small and compact in size but really bright, fits four fingers easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and very affordable compared to other LED lamps.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>This lamp was right for the price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>if something (like paper) gets under the nail polish it will peel right off</li>
            <li>they will not be available if I need to purchase a new one!</li>
            <li>Works great for the first few uses.</li>
            <li>This was my first ever DIY gel manicure and it cured as expected and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>but it would be good to have a a backup lamp (doesn&#x27;t need much space for storage) or for single nail curing (like repairs or nail art).</li>
            <li>This is just so cool and works fast.</li>
            <li>It is very portable and even comes with some foundation, red polish, and top coat!</li>
            <li>so I had to order a new light.</li>
            <li>I top it with a regular cheap nail polish top coat and also use my hairdryer to dry it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but it cures my Gelish Polish perfectly.</li>
            <li>I can fit my whole hand, but this really design for four fingers at a time and then the thumbs.</li>
            <li>I use several different brands of UV gel, and it works great with all of them.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to do their own nails at-home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little led gel lamp, I bought it for my cousins</li>
            <li>The curing time is fast and thorough!</li>
            <li>This lamp is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know about the long term use and how it will hold up, so far now it is good.</li>
            <li>but it stop working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>First I borrowed my cousins and was pleased enough to get me one for me.</li>
            <li>Wish it was bigger but can&#x27;t complain with the price :)</li>
            <li>I recommend watching a video first.</li>
            <li>You should also get the PH Bond to use first -- it helps.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t measure it but overall size couldn&#x27;t have been more that 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I do my thumbs first.  </li>
            <li>This works exactly as it describes - it hardens gel polish in minutes.  </li>
            <li>some videos of how to do it the first time or two</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending money on a lamp I know will work, but since it&#x27;s my first time doing gel nails at home, I just wanted something to start with to see if it&#x27;s something I wanted to stick with.</li>
            <li>but I would pay a bit more to get this baby up to ten watts and to fit my entire hand.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use a dark color, I used a mauve color and it set really nicely.</li>
            <li>Gel polish can crack occasionally and I was able to fix one such damaged nail within minutes with this great little</li>
            <li>It is compact, easy to use &amp; definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>This light will fit your hand less thumb.  </li>
            <li>and I keep thinking I&#x27;m going to develop melanoma with how much I do my nails.</li>
            <li>The light was simply thrown in a brown packing box with 2 polishes and bent up directions.</li>
            <li>This lamp works very well.</li>
            <li>This is Sooooo much faster.</li>
            <li>This light has yet to give me any technical issues.  </li>
            <li>No broken bulbs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a quiet pain when the light has been on for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Also much safer/healthier than UV lamps.</li>
            <li>The only cons is that all your fingers won&#x27;t fit at once.</li>
            <li>The lamp is very compact</li>
            <li>Have had no problems and would recommend to anyone who wants an affordable lamp.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely everything it claims.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used those yet because I bought Gellish.</li>
            <li>The picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>The lamp was so tiny four fingers would barely fit.</li>
            <li>Works very well and compact for my needs.</li>
            <li>You can fit all 5 fingers in at once; the same with toes.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lamp itself is very sleek.</li>
            <li>Works well, and received fast.  </li>
            <li>amazing little lamp!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care much for the gel base and top coat that came with this product, but the lamp itself works great.  </li>
            <li>I bought two more for my friends and do all of my friends&#x27; nails every other week!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Total only 7 watts, but lots of little lights so good nail coverage from all angles</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing to the polish, it was still wet after 15 mins sitting under the light.</li>
            <li>I use my hair dryer on cool setting and on high, and fast dry my nails with it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gelish top and base coats and IBD and Gelish polish and the lamp cures them all very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is portable and weighs little to nothing...</li>
            <li>Love this little LED lamp.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit small, but that is one of the things I love about it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much storage space.  </li>
            <li>I packed it up and sent it right back.</li>
            <li>Much better than spending as much as $300.00 on a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; led lamp like OPI when it works exactly the same, if not better.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were a little bit bigger, but it does the job well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m traveling to New York in December</li>
            <li>Where I live, it&#x27;s $25.00 every two weeks to get gel nails at a salon, so after using this once it paid for itself.</li>
            <li>This lamp doesn&#x27;t work with gel builders only gel polish they should have that in the description I would like to give the company 5 stsrs because the first lamp I purchased didn&#x27;t work and they sent me a second one out right away</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>I did not realize how small it was and when it arrived I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that it takes longer to do because only 4 fingers fit in comfortably.</li>
            <li>I do have small hands though, so I would assume most everyone would need to do thumbs separate, too.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said they could not fit their thumb in along with the other 4 fingers, but I have large hands for a woman and could fit my entire hand in just fine.</li>
            <li>I was so happy that I could just purchase the lamp separately and even happier with the little gift that came with it!!!!!</li>
            <li>this one is super tiny, so you have to do thumbs separately, but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s a space saver and works just as well as big ones.</li>
            <li>I usually do a little longer than the 90 second timer just to make sure my nails are set.</li>
            <li>so far did 3 manicures with it and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>It says LED lights, but if feel like UV to my sun sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am a professional manicurist/nail technician and product educator licensed in 2 states.</li>
            <li>The lamp is completely lined with reflective surfaces for an even cure.</li>
            <li>So far it does the job</li>
            <li>I have been getting my nails done professionally for years and wanted to start doing my nails myself..</li>
            <li>It cured my uv polish to a professional finish..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bit small for all 5 fingers on each hand, so I normally have to do the thumb separately (just to make sure my thumb doesn&#x27;t hit the side walls inside</li>
            <li>I really wanted to starting doing my gel polish at home since its a life saver of keeping my thing nails from breaking.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on a UV light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve so far used it with</li>
            <li>Better than the big lamps I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li>I previously wrote that the lamp did not work, but I contacted the seller, and they responded quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Plus I dont have to spend $35 or more on my nails per month thanks to this small machine and gel polish and other gel and nail products.</li>
            <li>Great lamp for gel nail polish beginners, I have had it for a couple of months now and have used it a few times with a few different led gel nail brands such as ibd, gelish, fingerpaints, and lechat.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical after reading how small the lamp is, but I have small hands and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Cutting my cure time in half is awesome!</li>
            <li>Small, light and compact to bring around.</li>
            <li>Much smaller than expected, so only four fingers fit at a time.  </li>
            <li>Why is it only large enough for four fingers.</li>
            <li>It sets all of my polishes well and fast; no wondering if all is dry.</li>
            <li>The lamp helps dry nails dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I can fit all of my fingers + my thumb in here no problem, and I would say I have larger than larger than average hands (although my fingers are quite slender).</li>
            <li>the LED light is not strong enough.</li>
            <li>The lamp does not dry in the time specified; takes much too long.  </li>
            <li>I love this lamp - wasn&#x27;t as expensive as others on the market, yet it&#x27;s powerful and large enough to do a hand all at once (less the thumb of course).</li>
            <li>Its a Powerful little thing. .</li>
            <li>and like I said powerful little thing give it a try you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li>This little lamp is so powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is large enough for 4 fingers but not quit enough for the entire hand (which you wouldn&#x27;t do with gel nail polish anyway).&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li>Only 1 small hand can fit at a time.</li>
            <li>Not exactly as I expected it would arrive.</li>
            <li>builder gel which apparently LED lamps don&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>It can be completely shut off with a switch on the back.</li>
            <li>The same starter kit I received would&#x27;ve cost almost 60 dollars direct from the Sensationail website.</li>
            <li>Have to insert my thumbs as a last action.</li>
            <li>I can not see myself going back to the old ways.</li>
            <li>It might be small, but it works way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>did not dry my gel nail polish at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy little unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the buttons are confusing -- my other ones turn on when you plug them in and press the button on top.  </li>
            <li>My nails would have never lasted this long unless they were professionally done.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> i do my own nails</li>
            <li> Good investment:))</li>
            <li> I just started doing my own nails</li>
            <li> but you can do your own nails and are guaranteed a salon finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to spend hours in a salon.  </li>
            <li> I can get my nails does beautifully on my own time in my own home.</li>
            <li> Liked it</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this if you do your own nails.  </li>
            <li> which was nice.</li>
            <li> I had one of these lamps that came with a starter gel kit that Sensationai sales, and i really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted to start doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> But I found it on my own...</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this lamp because of how cheap it was, but I bought it anyways because of how many great reviews there were.</li>

            <li> Its a good UV Lamp easy to handle and to move it.</li>

            <li> The light is bright and doesn&#x27;t flicker.</li>
            <li> The light is maybe a bit bright</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing nails for over 10 years and this is by far the quickest way to do them and get flawless results, and you also save about 40 bucks by not going to the salon every 2-3 weeks to get backfills, etc.</li>
            <li> Works great....very easy to use for a person doing their own nails on their own time.</li>
            <li> Compact easy to take anywhere you travel!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find out that it was available without having to purchase a whole starter kit again.  </li>
            <li> Quality is great and it saves me so much money to be able to do my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> so I can do my families nails while I&#x27;m home :)</li>
            <li> This is really a great, affordable product that is way more effective than my old UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Have purchased a replacement that works much better and faster.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> 1 or 2 minutes more - just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t forget to buy the GEL NAIL POLISH to go along with it :)</li>

            <li> It would be very easy to fit your toes</li>
            <li> And at this price, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> Yes you have to dry your thumbs separately however for the price I am very very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this Led light.</li>
            <li> good price, and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Purchased this due to excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer does what it is supposed to and is compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so it is easy to travel with and carry around.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s size makes it easy to store and carry around.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lamps can run up to $600 easily.</li>
            <li> I just apply sunscreen to the tops and sides of my hands before I polish, and then I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> and they tell me it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and there are easy how to videos available online.</li>
            <li> HAVE NO IDEA what he did, but works fine.</li>
            <li> Which is fine for me as I prefer gelish or Sensationail..</li>
            <li> It works fine on my feets.</li>
            <li> Love it for the quick drying time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this little powerfull LED lam.</li>
            <li> ..D light not a uv</li>
            <li> The UV light has been bothering me</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift, but felt I couldn&#x27;t give it as one because the light wasn&#x27;t in any packaging.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, and its also compact enough to not take up an ungodly amount of space.</li>
            <li> It is set at a fantastic price</li>
            <li> , I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands of gel polishes with it and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> Beeps to alert every minute and the light goes off after two minutes</li>
            <li> I received my light yesterday.</li>
            <li> A free polish came with mine.</li>
            <li> If all you need is a gel polish light, this is the one.</li>
            <li> - I think that&#x27;s the brand not the light.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Somehow I lost the cord that goes with my light.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say I gave my UV light away.</li>
            <li> Do not spend lots of money on a uv light.</li>
            <li> It has a timer feature built-in, and will comfortably fit 4 fingers at a time.</li>
            <li> This light was relatively cheap and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This really makes you a pro in your own home.</li>
            <li> they included a couple more things but not $50.00 worth.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the non-UV lamps but this is far superior.  </li>
            <li> haha!!!</li>
            <li> thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> It World fine - I use it with Gelish and is 100% satisfied;-)</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use the special gloves to protect my hands from the uv light or use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have this lamp.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I received this lamp about a month ago and after using it for my mom and I, I have to say it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> The only one that doesn&#x27;t seem to always cure perfectly is the Red Carpet Manicure, but once you put a top coat on</li>
            <li> I loved the price of this one (half the price of the one I was looking at in the store) &amp; saw that it got pretty good reviews</li>
            <li> Then gel coat again (capping) with some acrylic powder on top, cured for a minute, gently sanded the hardened acrylic/gel to shape, repeated process two more times (each time curing a minute), then finished with a simple gel top coat, cured again for a minute, and voila!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave feedback, but because the seller went an extra mile and put a smile on my face, I will take the time to leave a great review!</li>
            <li> I Love, Love, Love this little Led light!</li>
            <li> Hard perfect</li>
            <li> (It was a gorgeous deep red/berry color)</li>
            <li> This lamp is able to cure my gelish polish in 30 seconds, there&#x27;s a button on top that turns on light, it stays on for one minute but chirps at you at the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is good enough for home use.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and is half the cost of most.</li>
            <li> Great little light.</li>
            <li> Other then that  the machine is great .</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind because it works so quickly.</li>
            <li> received quickly, already using it.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t tried a different brand nail polish, I have the sensational gel polish.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> so for a starter and back up lamp until I generate addtl funds for a larger one this is perfect!</li>
            <li> ,I use my LED Lamp by SesationNail for my own nails,I  have Clear Gel (Gelish) overlay over my own natural nails ,helps stop the peeling ,so I can grow my own nails and regular nail polish+nailart</li>
            <li> LED light is much quicker than my UV light I bought before.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this system and gel polish to anyone who wants a perfect manicure that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for half a year and it works great.</li>
            <li> It was in great condition and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is easier to take with me than the larger, full hand, lamp I own.</li>
            <li> A half an inch more would do fine for most of us.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Amazing little easy to store LED light.</li>
            <li> You can fit your whole hand in it.</li>
            <li> this light really works.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...packaged well &amp; even got a free sample of gel nail polish with it.  </li>
            <li> One thing I can say is that I can&#x27;t comfortably put my whole hand under the lights.</li>
            <li> Works great ,30 sec burps,1min beeps ,very compact ,cures all 4 fingers then</li>
            <li> Not bad for a first LED light, but I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I actually had this and spilled something on the top and couldn&#x27;t push the button to turn the light on</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nails for about the last 6 years with a UV lamp</li>
            <li> Good shipper..came as expected.</li>
            <li> its smaller than I expected nut works perfectly.</li>
            <li> So much better than my UV light and much smaller to store.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend applying a high SPF sun screen (35-50), or the manicure protective gloves before use.</li>
            <li> Small and compact in size but really bright, fits four fingers easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and very affordable compared to other LED lamps.  </li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> This lamp was right for the price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> if something (like paper) gets under the nail polish it will peel right off</li>
            <li> they will not be available if I need to purchase a new one!</li>
            <li> Works great for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> This was my first ever DIY gel manicure and it cured as expected and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li> but it would be good to have a a backup lamp (doesn&#x27;t need much space for storage) or for single nail curing (like repairs or nail art).</li>
            <li> This is just so cool and works fast.</li>
            <li> It is very portable and even comes with some foundation, red polish, and top coat!</li>
            <li> so I had to order a new light.</li>
            <li> I top it with a regular cheap nail polish top coat and also use my hairdryer to dry it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but it cures my Gelish Polish perfectly.</li>
            <li> I can fit my whole hand, but this really design for four fingers at a time and then the thumbs.</li>
            <li> I use several different brands of UV gel, and it works great with all of them.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to do their own nails at-home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little led gel lamp, I bought it for my cousins</li>
            <li> The curing time is fast and thorough!</li>
            <li> This lamp is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know about the long term use and how it will hold up, so far now it is good.</li>
            <li> but it stop working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> First I borrowed my cousins and was pleased enough to get me one for me.</li>
            <li> Wish it was bigger but can&#x27;t complain with the price :)</li>
            <li> I recommend watching a video first.</li>
            <li> You should also get the PH Bond to use first -- it helps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t measure it but overall size couldn&#x27;t have been more that 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I do my thumbs first.  </li>
            <li> This works exactly as it describes - it hardens gel polish in minutes.  </li>
            <li> some videos of how to do it the first time or two</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending money on a lamp I know will work, but since it&#x27;s my first time doing gel nails at home, I just wanted something to start with to see if it&#x27;s something I wanted to stick with.</li>
            <li> but I would pay a bit more to get this baby up to ten watts and to fit my entire hand.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a dark color, I used a mauve color and it set really nicely.</li>
            <li> Gel polish can crack occasionally and I was able to fix one such damaged nail within minutes with this great little</li>
            <li> It is compact, easy to use &amp; definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> This light will fit your hand less thumb.  </li>
            <li> and I keep thinking I&#x27;m going to develop melanoma with how much I do my nails.</li>
            <li> The light was simply thrown in a brown packing box with 2 polishes and bent up directions.</li>
            <li> This lamp works very well.</li>
            <li> This is Sooooo much faster.</li>
            <li> This light has yet to give me any technical issues.  </li>
            <li> No broken bulbs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a quiet pain when the light has been on for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Also much safer/healthier than UV lamps.</li>
            <li> The only cons is that all your fingers won&#x27;t fit at once.</li>
            <li> The lamp is very compact</li>
            <li> Have had no problems and would recommend to anyone who wants an affordable lamp.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely everything it claims.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used those yet because I bought Gellish.</li>
            <li> The picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> The lamp was so tiny four fingers would barely fit.</li>
            <li> Works very well and compact for my needs.</li>
            <li> You can fit all 5 fingers in at once; the same with toes.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lamp itself is very sleek.</li>
            <li> Works well, and received fast.  </li>
            <li> amazing little lamp!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for the gel base and top coat that came with this product, but the lamp itself works great.  </li>
            <li> I bought two more for my friends and do all of my friends&#x27; nails every other week!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total only 7 watts, but lots of little lights so good nail coverage from all angles</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to the polish, it was still wet after 15 mins sitting under the light.</li>
            <li> I use my hair dryer on cool setting and on high, and fast dry my nails with it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish top and base coats and IBD and Gelish polish and the lamp cures them all very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is portable and weighs little to nothing...</li>
            <li> Love this little LED lamp.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit small, but that is one of the things I love about it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much storage space.  </li>
            <li> I packed it up and sent it right back.</li>
            <li> Much better than spending as much as $300.00 on a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; led lamp like OPI when it works exactly the same, if not better.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it were a little bit bigger, but it does the job well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m traveling to New York in December</li>
            <li> Where I live, it&#x27;s $25.00 every two weeks to get gel nails at a salon, so after using this once it paid for itself.</li>
            <li> This lamp doesn&#x27;t work with gel builders only gel polish they should have that in the description I would like to give the company 5 stsrs because the first lamp I purchased didn&#x27;t work and they sent me a second one out right away</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> I did not realize how small it was and when it arrived I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it takes longer to do because only 4 fingers fit in comfortably.</li>
            <li> I do have small hands though, so I would assume most everyone would need to do thumbs separate, too.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said they could not fit their thumb in along with the other 4 fingers, but I have large hands for a woman and could fit my entire hand in just fine.</li>
            <li> I was so happy that I could just purchase the lamp separately and even happier with the little gift that came with it!!!!!</li>
            <li> this one is super tiny, so you have to do thumbs separately, but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s a space saver and works just as well as big ones.</li>
            <li> I usually do a little longer than the 90 second timer just to make sure my nails are set.</li>
            <li> so far did 3 manicures with it and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It says LED lights, but if feel like UV to my sun sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a professional manicurist/nail technician and product educator licensed in 2 states.</li>
            <li> The lamp is completely lined with reflective surfaces for an even cure.</li>
            <li> So far it does the job</li>
            <li> I have been getting my nails done professionally for years and wanted to start doing my nails myself..</li>
            <li> It cured my uv polish to a professional finish..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit small for all 5 fingers on each hand, so I normally have to do the thumb separately (just to make sure my thumb doesn&#x27;t hit the side walls inside</li>
            <li> I really wanted to starting doing my gel polish at home since its a life saver of keeping my thing nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on a UV light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve so far used it with</li>
            <li> Better than the big lamps I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I previously wrote that the lamp did not work, but I contacted the seller, and they responded quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Plus I dont have to spend $35 or more on my nails per month thanks to this small machine and gel polish and other gel and nail products.</li>
            <li> Great lamp for gel nail polish beginners, I have had it for a couple of months now and have used it a few times with a few different led gel nail brands such as ibd, gelish, fingerpaints, and lechat.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading how small the lamp is, but I have small hands and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Cutting my cure time in half is awesome!</li>
            <li> Small, light and compact to bring around.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, so only four fingers fit at a time.  </li>
            <li> Why is it only large enough for four fingers.</li>
            <li> It sets all of my polishes well and fast; no wondering if all is dry.</li>
            <li> The lamp helps dry nails dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I can fit all of my fingers + my thumb in here no problem, and I would say I have larger than larger than average hands (although my fingers are quite slender).</li>
            <li> the LED light is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> The lamp does not dry in the time specified; takes much too long.  </li>
            <li> I love this lamp - wasn&#x27;t as expensive as others on the market, yet it&#x27;s powerful and large enough to do a hand all at once (less the thumb of course).</li>
            <li> Its a Powerful little thing. .</li>
            <li> and like I said powerful little thing give it a try you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> This little lamp is so powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is large enough for 4 fingers but not quit enough for the entire hand (which you wouldn&#x27;t do with gel nail polish anyway).&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> Only 1 small hand can fit at a time.</li>
            <li> Not exactly as I expected it would arrive.</li>
            <li> builder gel which apparently LED lamps don&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> It can be completely shut off with a switch on the back.</li>
            <li> The same starter kit I received would&#x27;ve cost almost 60 dollars direct from the Sensationail website.</li>
            <li> Have to insert my thumbs as a last action.</li>
            <li> I can not see myself going back to the old ways.</li>
            <li> It might be small, but it works way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> did not dry my gel nail polish at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty sturdy little unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the buttons are confusing -- my other ones turn on when you plug them in and press the button on top.  </li>
            <li> My nails would have never lasted this long unless they were professionally done.  </li>
            <li> It is a little small but for home use it is fine.</li>
            <li> gently buffed off the shine off my natural nails, cleansed with some isopropyl alcohol from my local super market, then I put the gel base coat on thinly, making sure I coat the sides and under the tip of my nails (</li>
            <li> I initially shopped for one at my local beauty supply store &amp; was discouraged by the price &amp; limited options.  </li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for heavy professional use at the salon</li>
            <li> The timer is helpful, I tend to stay under way too long.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the UV lamp I had was just taking so long to cure the gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I finially have long nails.  </li>
            <li> my experience - 30 sec for clear, 60 sec for color or thick clear</li>
            <li> It works just as well if not better, than the more expensive lamps on the market with the same results.</li>
            <li> When used with SallyHansen gel polish, it does  take about 5 cycles to completely dry.</li>
            <li> It will dry them</li>
            <li> It pays for itself doing yourself at home one time, fingers and toes done and dry in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have to do it over and over to let my nails to dry</li>
            <li> I have brittle thin soft nails and have always had a difficult time keeping nail polish/hardener on my nails for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not what I really expected, It takes a while for your nails to dry with this lamp</li>
            <li> I have only had this lamp for a little over a week, and have used it about three time.</li>
            <li> after 30 sec mt nail still wet</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> 3 7/8 inches wide</li>
            <li> so you know when the 30 sec are up&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I am currently using the Sally Hansen gel top coat and base coat</li>
            <li> This lamp cures the polish in less than half the time and it is so much smaller.  </li>
            <li> It IS small, so you can only do 4 nails at a time</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I received my lamp way sooner than expected and they even included a base/top coat and a colored polish that I wasn&#x27;t expecting to receive!</li>
            <li> I purchased this led lamp due to the compact size.</li>
            <li> This lamp is small, just enough room to put one hand in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the need to buy an expensive one, especially since I&#x27;m only doing nails on myself, I&#x27;ll only use the lamp once every week or two.</li>
            <li> Then, I usually do both thumbs at the same time.  </li>
            <li> So, I had to cure them for at least 2 mins to have them last longer.</li>
            <li> It even came with gel polish top and base coat.</li>
            <li> I use the Harmony GELISH brand gel polish, and it takes 10sec for base coat, 30sec for color coat, 20sec for top coat.</li>
            <li> I used Gelish Ph Bond, Base Coat &amp; Top Coat along with Sally Hansen&#x27;s Gel Nail Color.  </li>
            <li> However, the lamp takes 4-6 rounds of lighting for the nails to be at least 85% dry.</li>
            <li> Even if it was a little longer, I wouldn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Picked this little gem up</li>
            <li> This is a little lamp with a lot of power.</li>
            <li> The lamps could be a little stronger but they did the job in the end.</li>
            <li> I just had to use them a little longer.</li>
            <li> I like that the lights are part of the unit and sturdy little plastic bumps.</li>
            <li> This little machine will cure your gel nail polish with no time.</li>
            <li> If little is what you want then this ones for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using gel nail polish for a few years.</li>
            <li> I am also told that it uses less electricity, not sure about that (&amp; not a HUGE issue for me).</li>
            <li> I have been using a different led lamp for awhile now and it was taking too long to cure and was kinda awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Small sample sent with lamp.</li>
            <li> It is so small and lightweight, I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small</li>
            <li> I purchased this item so I could have a small, lightweight, fast-curing LED lamp at home....</li>
            <li> Why SO small?</li>
            <li> too small.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something small</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s small i will still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was spending $60 at least per month to get my nails done.  </li>
            <li> and I put the gel builder on a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> and it costs me very little!</li>
            <li> I sent it back as well. :-(</li>
            <li> It does occassionally omit a weird squeak when I plug it in and/or turn it on, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when this arrived.</li>
            <li> No need to pay for expensive ones</li>
            <li> then randomly stopped working, gave it to my dad to look at.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I find the chirp at 30 seconds to be really annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a Powerful little thing. . I absolutely love it. Not only did  i do my own nails i did my daughters..my moms...and my friend for her graduation gift and ohh ohh her daughters nails as well work amazing its a L.E..D light not a uv so it drys quicker and like I said powerful little thing give it a try you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> good price, and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I use it with regular polish as well because it helps to speed up their drying time. When used with SallyHansen gel polish, it does  take about 5 cycles to completely dry. Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> amazing little lamp! so far did 3 manicures with it and it works like a charm. I hope it&#x27;ll last a long time. no need for the big lamps when you&#x27;re still only putting one hand it. this one is super tiny, so you have to do thumbs separately, but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s a space saver and works just as well as big ones.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! Cutting my cure time in half is awesome! Even if it was a little longer, I wouldn&#x27;t mind. The UV light has been bothering me and I keep thinking I&#x27;m going to develop melanoma with how much I do my nails. Picked this little gem up and it&#x27;s putting my mind at ease. It IS small, so you can only do 4 nails at a time and then your thumb last, but it&#x27;s not that bad. I&#x27;m traveling to New York in December and I plan on bringing this with me so I can do my families nails while I&#x27;m home :)</li>
            <li> Shipping was good. The price is right. However, the lamp takes 4-6 rounds of lighting for the nails to be at least 85% dry. Not bad for a first LED light, but I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift, but felt I couldn&#x27;t give it as one because the light wasn&#x27;t in any packaging. The light was simply thrown in a brown packing box with 2 polishes and bent up directions. Not exactly as I expected it would arrive. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great! Small sample sent with lamp. Thx!</li>
            <li> This is a little lamp with a lot of power. The lamp helps dry nails dry quickly. For the price I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I can fit all of my fingers + my thumb in here no problem, and I would say I have larger than larger than average hands (although my fingers are quite slender). This is really a great, affordable product that is way more effective than my old UV lamp. It does occassionally omit a weird squeak when I plug it in and/or turn it on, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with it. Great value for the money, and its also compact enough to not take up an ungodly amount of space.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good investment:))</li>
            <li> Purchased this due to excellent reviews. It is so small and lightweight, I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Have purchased a replacement that works much better and faster. It could be mistaken for a toy and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Haven&#x27;t had time to return it yet.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this lamp because of how cheap it was, but I bought it anyways because of how many great reviews there were. It arrived before the day it was scheduled and also included a mini base/top coat and one polish, which I didn&#x27;t expect. (It was a gorgeous deep red/berry color) It might be small, but it works way better than I expected. Where I live, it&#x27;s $25.00 every two weeks to get gel nails at a salon, so after using this once it paid for itself. Much better than spending as much as $300.00 on a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; led lamp like OPI when it works exactly the same, if not better. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have used it four times since purchasing. So far so good!  Works well. It is a bit small and I have to do my thumbs separately but I don&#x27;t mind because it works so quickly. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing to the polish, it was still wet after 15 mins sitting under the light. Skip it!!</li>
            <li> This little lamp is so powerful. I use the special gloves to protect my hands from the uv light or use sunscreen. It works great! My manicure lasts 2 weeks if I cure my layers for 1.5 min. I love it and I&#x27;m becoming so good at doing my own nails at home, it&#x27;s priceless!</li>
            <li> Works as good as the reviews say it does.  I just started doing my own nails and I put the gel builder on a bit thick.  So I let my nails stay under 1 or 2 minutes more - just to be sure.  Can&#x27;t believe how good this works.  I wish I found this sooner.  Was spending $60 at least per month to get my nails done.  I do them myself and they look great and it costs me very little!</li>
            <li> after 30 sec mt nail still wet</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when this arrived. I did not realize how small it was and when it arrived I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work. Yes you have to dry your thumbs separately however for the price I am very very happy with this product. This was my first ever DIY gel manicure and it cured as expected and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Saves me a ton of money. Gel nails at the salon cost $25+ but you can do your own nails and are guaranteed a salon finish. Just don&#x27;t forget to buy the GEL NAIL POLISH to go along with it :)</li>
            <li> This lamp works very well. I would strongly recommend applying a high SPF sun screen (35-50), or the manicure protective gloves before use. It says LED lights, but if feel like UV to my sun sensitive skin. I just apply sunscreen to the tops and sides of my hands before I polish, and then I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and is half the cost of most. Some reviewers said they could not fit their thumb in along with the other 4 fingers, but I have large hands for a woman and could fit my entire hand in just fine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Works great with LED curable gels.  Didn&#x27;t care much for the gel base and top coat that came with this product, but the lamp itself works great.  Cures in the 30 seconds it says with no problem.  I am currently using the Sally Hansen gel top coat and base coat and it worked great.  I have brittle thin soft nails and have always had a difficult time keeping nail polish/hardener on my nails for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gently buffed off the shine off my natural nails, cleansed with some isopropyl alcohol from my local super market, then I put the gel base coat on thinly, making sure I coat the sides and under the tip of my nails (called capping), cured for 30 seconds. Then gel coat again (capping) with some acrylic powder on top, cured for a minute, gently sanded the hardened acrylic/gel to shape, repeated process two more times (each time curing a minute), then finished with a simple gel top coat, cured again for a minute, and voila! Hard perfect shiny nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then pick a regular nail polish color, not gel color, and I apply it over the glossy nails, also &amp;#34;capping&amp;#34;.  I use my hair dryer on cool setting and on high, and fast dry my nails with it.  I top it with a regular cheap nail polish top coat and also use my hairdryer to dry it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails lasted me about 5 days!  I made the bed, vacuumed, did dishes several times during the day, did laundry, cleaned the bathroom, shoveled snow...  My nails would have never lasted this long unless they were professionally done.  In my area, gel nails go for $55.</li>
            <li> Works great, never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this lamp. It truly works. I can&#x27;t believe the price. It even came with gel polish top and base coat.</li>
            <li> received quickly, already using it.  love it</li>
            <li> I am a professional manicurist/nail technician and product educator licensed in 2 states. I purchased this item so I could have a small, lightweight, fast-curing LED lamp at home....this lamp is all of those things. I use it to cure Famous Names IBX nail strengthener on my toenails. If you are looking for an LED lamp specifically for curing gel polish on your toenails, this is the lamp for you. It is the perfect size to slip your foot into. The lamp is completely lined with reflective surfaces for an even cure. I would not recommend this for heavy professional use at the salon but it would be good to have a a backup lamp (doesn&#x27;t need much space for storage) or for single nail curing (like repairs or nail art). Overall, the perfect LED lamp for toenails!</li>
            <li> Love it! I was a bit skeptical after reading how small the lamp is, but I have small hands and they fit perfectly. The curing time is fast and thorough! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This lamp is exactly what I needed. It&#x27;s compact and cures way faster than my UV lamp. The timer is helpful, I tend to stay under way too long. The noise from the timer doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Why is it only large enough for four fingers. A half an inch more would do fine for most of us. Why SO small? Why???????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is set at a fantastic price but I would pay a bit more to get this baby up to ten watts and to fit my entire hand.&lt;br /&gt; Other than that, I enjoy it. It sets all of my polishes well and fast; no wondering if all is dry. Gel polish can crack occasionally and I was able to fix one such damaged nail within minutes with this great little lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE give a second version that fits and just tack on another ten bucks. I am sure that most polish wearers will agree.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a kit to get started doung gel manicures at home. It&#x27;s a great lamp. I&#x27;ve used various brands of gel polishes with it and have gotten great results. I find the chirp at 30 seconds to be really annoying. I only gave this 4 stars because you can&#x27;t turn it off.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer does what it is supposed to and is compact and easy to use.  Good price on it too.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this lamp it&#x27;s awesome! It even cures builder gel which apparently LED lamps don&#x27;t do.  I love this lamp and the price was great!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  I may never go back to regular nail polish again!  I&#x27;m thrilled that I don&#x27;t have to spend hours in a salon.  I can get my nails does beautifully on my own time in my own home.</li>
            <li> Not what I really expected, It takes a while for your nails to dry with this lamp so product is just o.k. It will dry them but it takes a while</li>
            <li> The LED lamp works well. I did think it would be bigger. So far so good. I would recommend it as a good buy for the money,</li>
            <li> I have used it just twice and for now it works great, I haven&#x27;t tried a different brand nail polish, I have the sensational gel polish. I will try eventually with gelish or another brand to check how good my nails do.</li>
            <li> I actually had this and spilled something on the top and couldn&#x27;t push the button to turn the light on so I had to order a new light. I was so happy that I could just purchase the lamp separately and even happier with the little gift that came with it!!!!! I normally don&#x27;t leave feedback, but because the seller went an extra mile and put a smile on my face, I will take the time to leave a great review! I love gifts!!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Small and compact in size but really bright, fits four fingers easily. Definitely a good deal for a lamp for doing gel nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and really easy to use. Beeps to alert every minute and the light goes off after two minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little led gel lamp, I bought it for my cousins and they tell me it works just fine. The price and quality can not be beat. A timer would&#x27;ve been good but as is for the price it works well enough.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Better than the big lamps I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Compact easy to take anywhere you travel! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I Love, Love, Love this little Led light! I have been doing my own gel nails for about the last 6 years with a UV lamp and I will never ever go back haha!!! This is Sooooo much faster. It used to take 1 hour for two hands now only 20-30 mins. I use the Harmony GELISH brand gel polish, and it takes 10sec for base coat, 30sec for color coat, 20sec for top coat. Best part is now my back doesn&#x27;t kill when I&#x27;m done :)</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t beep it would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the UV lamp I had was just taking so long to cure the gel nail polish.  This lamp cures the polish in less than half the time and it is so much smaller.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have only had this lamp for a little over a week, and have used it about three time. So far it does the job and I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the long term use and how it will hold up, so far now it is good.</li>
            <li> Liked it but it stop working after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The lamps could be a little stronger but they did the job in the end. I just had to use them a little longer.</li>
            <li> Love my led lamp. It takes no time to do my gel manicure at home. I use it once a week and have no problems with it. I love it. Best purchase.</li>
            <li> I am hooked. I loved getting gel manis in the salon but pricey. It pays for itself doing yourself at home one time, fingers and toes done and dry in 20 minutes. Follow the directions and there are easy how to videos available online.</li>
            <li> First I borrowed my cousins and was pleased enough to get me one for me. You can fit your whole hand in it. It would be very easy to fit your toes in if you wanted. Obviously not at the same time... I like that the lights are part of the unit and sturdy little plastic bumps. I have no desire to change bulbs on a gel lamp and for this price you could just buy another. It has the 30 second beep (My cousin&#x27;s chirps) and shuts off at 1 minute. It can be completely shut off with a switch on the back. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy little unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have this lamp. I received my lamp way sooner than expected and they even included a base/top coat and a colored polish that I wasn&#x27;t expecting to receive! The same starter kit I received would&#x27;ve cost almost 60 dollars direct from the Sensationail website.</li>
            <li> Good shipper..came as expected. Great light.  I have been getting my nails done professionally for years and wanted to start doing my nails myself..this light really works. 30 second s cures gellish polish. .I love it..This light will fit your hand less thumb.  It cured my uv polish to a professional finish..its smaller than I expected nut works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It World fine - I use it with Gelish and is 100% satisfied;-)</li>
            <li> The lamp does not dry in the time specified; takes much too long.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t purch&#x27;d it.</li>
            <li> My nails look lovely, and great to save on cash! My biggest complaint is that it takes longer to do because only 4 fingers fit in comfortably.</li>
            <li> I saved $140 a month by switching to doing my own nails!!! Wish it was bigger but can&#x27;t complain with the price :)</li>
            <li> I received my light yesterday. I am so excited to use it. It will even fit your toes! They&#x27;re customer service were very nice and accommodating too.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Works well and super great price</li>
            <li> too small.  Only 1 small hand can fit at a time.</li>
            <li> This light has yet to give me any technical issues.  The light is bright and doesn&#x27;t flicker. No broken bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;It is large enough for 4 fingers but not quit enough for the entire hand (which you wouldn&#x27;t do with gel nail polish anyway).&lt;br /&gt;there is a quiet pain when the light has been on for 30 seconds so you don&#x27;t need a watch or timer. Convenient.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...packaged well &amp; even got a free sample of gel nail polish with it.  The lamp worked great &amp; I highly recommend this product!  I used Gelish Ph Bond, Base Coat &amp; Top Coat along with Sally Hansen&#x27;s Gel Nail Color.  I did 4 fingers at a time and then did my thumbs separate.  My nails look great!  I love that the machine shuts off after 1 minute.  No timer needed.  I watched a You Tube video for Gelish products and that helped a lot...I recommend watching a video first.</li>
            <li> Its great and I&#x27;m happy to be doing my own nails at home.  This one is better than the one that came with my kit.</li>
            <li> Works great....very easy to use for a person doing their own nails on their own time.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Super easy to use. I usually do a little longer than the 90 second timer just to make sure my nails are set. It&#x27;s a tiny bit small for all 5 fingers on each hand, so I normally have to do the thumb separately (just to make sure my thumb doesn&#x27;t hit the side walls inside or I&#x27;d have to start again). I do have small hands though, so I would assume most everyone would need to do thumbs separate, too. Amazing little easy to store LED light. Also much safer/healthier than UV lamps.</li>
            <li> Efficient. This little machine will cure your gel nail polish with no time. The only cons is that all your fingers won&#x27;t fit at once. Your thumb has to go separate. Other then that  the machine is great .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I sent it back. The lights are bright. A free polish came with mine. I sent it back as well. :-(</li>
            <li> If all you need is a gel polish light, this is the one. No need to pay for expensive ones this is all you need.</li>
            <li> Cures gel polishes in 30 seconds! I have used this for half a year and it works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this led lamp due to the compact size. It is easier to take with me than the larger, full hand, lamp I own. It has cured several different brands of gel polish with no issues.</li>
            <li> Great lamps that work for a perfect price!!</li>
            <li> Works great for the first few uses. then randomly stopped working, gave it to my dad to look at.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NO IDEA what he did, but works fine.</li>
            <li> Love this light!! It&#x27;s easy to use and not too expensive. My nails stay in great condition.</li>
            <li> This lamp doesn&#x27;t work with gel builders only gel polish they should have that in the description I would like to give the company 5 stsrs because the first lamp I purchased didn&#x27;t work and they sent me a second one out right away but because they did not place in their description that this lamp only working on gel polish theres the 3 stars good lamp for gel polish not for gel nail builders</li>
            <li> Perfect LED lamp. Works with all my gel products that require UV. Does NOT cure Shellac tho. Which is fine for me as I prefer gelish or Sensationail..I also use ur with couture gel polish and red carpet gel. Many more but too many to list.</li>
            <li> I received this lamp about a month ago and after using it for my mom and I, I have to say it is worth every penny!  It&#x27;s great and very affordable compared to other LED lamps.  I have been using Gelish top and base coats and IBD and Gelish polish and the lamp cures them all very nicely.  The lamp is very compact so it is easy to travel with and carry around.  Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This lamp is small, just enough room to put one hand in. But it&#x27;s size makes it easy to store and carry around.</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent lamp.  I&#x27;ve tried the non-UV lamps but this is far superior.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this if you do your own nails.  Good size.</li>
            <li> Product arrived sooner than expected which was nice. I have been using a different led lamp for awhile now and it was taking too long to cure and was kinda awkward to use. This lamp is able to cure my gelish polish in 30 seconds, there&#x27;s a button on top that turns on light, it stays on for one minute but chirps at you at the 30 second mark. Good price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how cheap this is and how AWESOME it is. I really wanted to starting doing my gel polish at home since its a life saver of keeping my thing nails from breaking. This works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Its a good UV Lamp easy to handle and to move it. not that big .</li>
            <li> OK home gels are magic, and I will never get another gel manicure at the salon. This thing gets it done. But it also zaps my hands in a way that feels like lasers or some sort of lightsaber 9 times out of 10. So that can&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li> This is the best LED light I&#x27;ve used in a while. I love the fact that it is portable and weighs little to nothing...I bought an extra one just in case as a back-up too scare they will not be available if I need to purchase a new one!</li>
            <li> the LED light is not strong enough. I have to do it over and over to let my nails to dry</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  Can get all four fingers in at once and do thumbs separate.  I can get all my toes in at once. I tried the SensatioNail polish that came with it and it&#x27;s horrible.  I use Kiss polish and it worked just as great as when I used my friends gelish lamp. His they are a bit tacky feeling after the process put run a cotton ball with fingernail polish over it and they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Great lamp for gel nail polish beginners, I have had it for a couple of months now and have used it a few times with a few different led gel nail brands such as ibd, gelish, fingerpaints, and lechat. I cure each brands and layers for 1min. Have had no problems and would recommend to anyone who wants an affordable lamp.</li>
            <li> I love this lamp - wasn&#x27;t as expensive as others on the market, yet it&#x27;s powerful and large enough to do a hand all at once (less the thumb of course). Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Does absolutely everything it claims. Love it for the quick drying time.</li>
            <li> Works as great as I was hoping it would</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve used it with gelish and ibd gel polishes and it works really good! Defiantly better than going to the nail salon</li>
            <li> I wanted something small so I could take it with me on trips just in case. This does the trick. It is very portable and even comes with some foundation, red polish, and top coat! I haven&#x27;t really used those yet because I bought Gellish. You should also get the PH Bond to use first -- it helps. The light is maybe a bit bright so I put something over my hand to shield from it.</li>
            <li> The picture is very deceiving. The lamp was so tiny four fingers would barely fit. I packed it up and sent it right back. If little is what you want then this ones for you. I didn&#x27;t measure it but overall size couldn&#x27;t have been more that 2&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This lamp was right for the price and gets the job done. I have only used it a few times but it cures my Gelish Polish perfectly. I will update if anything changes. I am pleased with this lamp and the lights are aesthetically pleasing. One thing I can say is that I can&#x27;t comfortably put my whole hand under the lights. I do my thumbs first.  It works fine on my feets.</li>
            <li> Works very well and compact for my needs.</li>
            <li> I can not get this lamp to cure my nails at all abd yes i use only thier product... Any suggestions???</li>
            <li> I finially have long nails.  Plus I dont have to spend $35 or more on my nails per month thanks to this small machine and gel polish and other gel and nail products.</li>
            <li> works great and great price I use it all the time and would buy it all over again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on a UV light. This LED works just as well and there is no replacing the bulbs. Works great with all my gel polishes!</li>
            <li> I bough one of this six months ago and just bought one for my mom. It seems to work well with all the brands I buy for my nails - Sensationail, Red Carpet Manicure, and OPI. The only one that doesn&#x27;t seem to always cure perfectly is the Red Carpet Manicure, but once you put a top coat on it&#x27;s perfect - I think that&#x27;s the brand not the light. I can fit my whole hand, but this really design for four fingers at a time and then the thumbs. Overall, it works well and I like it.</li>
            <li> Tutto perfetto! Grazie!</li>
            <li> omg sooo happy I listened to the good reviews!!!</li>
            <li> The light is great, works with all brands but the brand of nail polish or sometimes any gel nail polish if something (like paper) gets under the nail polish it will peel right off</li>
            <li> Works great!  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as it describes - it hardens gel polish in minutes.  And at this price, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.  Just youtube some videos of how to do it the first time or two so you don&#x27;t miss a step.  You can fit all 5 fingers in at once; the same with toes.  The timer does beep after 30 seconds, then it just shuts off after 1 minute.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> i love it!!! thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> great price and works perfectly !</li>
            <li> I love this Led light. It works perfectly with my uv Gel. I have my clients in and out. Even though it&#x27;s small i will still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using gel nail polish for a few years. Somehow I lost the cord that goes with my light. I bought this as a replacement. I would highly recommend this system and gel polish to anyone who wants a perfect manicure that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this lamp! Super easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li> I had one of these lamps that came with a starter gel kit that Sensationai sales, and i really liked it.  So when I broke it and had to look for a replacement I was very happy to find out that it was available without having to purchase a whole starter kit again.  Still happy with the lamp.  I use several different brands of UV gel, and it works great with all of them.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this lamp for about a month off and on. I am a licensed nail tech that got away from the uv lamp....so for a starter and back up lamp until I generate addtl funds for a larger one this is perfect! Lamps can run up to $600 easily. It cures the polish perfect,...&lt;br /&gt;Happy nail technician.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work as they said.. nothing to compared.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted to start doing my own gel nails at home. It had good reviews and it was a great price! I don&#x27;t mind spending money on a lamp I know will work, but since it&#x27;s my first time doing gel nails at home, I just wanted something to start with to see if it&#x27;s something I wanted to stick with. I used this for the first time last night and I didn&#x27;t realize the timer is automatically set for 60 seconds (i.e. didn&#x27;t read the instructions). I had read plenty of tutorials about how to apply the polish, but I know every lamp&#x27;s timers are different. It just has one setting - 60 seconds. I didn&#x27;t use a dark color, I used a mauve color and it set really nicely. Just used some alcohol after the top coat to wipe of all the stickiness! Love this lamp. I don&#x27;t see the need to buy an expensive one, especially since I&#x27;m only doing nails on myself, I&#x27;ll only use the lamp once every week or two.</li>
            <li> Fulfills its promise!</li>
            <li> I bought two more for my friends and do all of my friends&#x27; nails every other week!</li>
            <li> Great little light. Cures your nails in no time at all! I Love it! It would be nice if it were a little bit bigger, but it does the job well!</li>
            <li> Works great ,30 sec burps,1min beeps ,very compact ,cures all 4 fingers then your thumbs ,I use my LED Lamp by SesationNail for my own nails,I  have Clear Gel (Gelish) overlay over my own natural nails ,helps stop the peeling ,so I can grow my own nails and regular nail polish+nailart last up to 2weeks on my nails</li>
            <li> Excellent product! A++</li>
            <li> Love this little LED lamp.  It is compact, easy to use &amp; definitely gets the job done.  I initially shopped for one at my local beauty supply store &amp; was discouraged by the price &amp; limited options.  So... of course, I came home &amp; logged onto Amazon to see what they had.  I loved the price of this one (half the price of the one I was looking at in the store) &amp; saw that it got pretty good reviews so I ordered it.  I am soooo glad I did.  It is a bit small, but that is one of the things I love about it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much storage space.  That being said, you can only do your four fingers at once.  I do not mind this at all.  Then, I usually do both thumbs at the same time.  Another thing, I am so glad I purchased an LED lamp vs. a UV lamp.  I didn&#x27;t realize until after I already did all of the reasons why this is the best choice.  LED cures gel polish faster that UV and it doesn&#x27;t damage your skin like the UV one does.  I am also told that it uses less electricity, not sure about that (&amp; not a HUGE issue for me).</li>
            <li> 4 stars b/c I&#x27;ve only used it once</li>
            <li> LED light is much quicker than my UV light I bought before. Let&#x27;s say I gave my UV light away. It&#x27;s awesome!! Buy! Buy! Buy!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to do their own nails at-home. It works just as well if not better, than the more expensive lamps on the market with the same results. I&#x27;ve been doing nails for over 10 years and this is by far the quickest way to do them and get flawless results, and you also save about 40 bucks by not going to the salon every 2-3 weeks to get backfills, etc. This lamp is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this little powerfull LED lam. It&#x27;s fast, compact to travel with it, very good product for the price ... I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with my lamp. The only problem was I didn&#x27;t get any explanations about its use. But I found it on my own...</li>
            <li> Works perfect with ANY uv gel polish I use from OPI to fingerprint. Do not spend lots of money on a uv light. This is awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent lamp! Works great! I can do my nails by myself...</li>
            <li> It is a little small but for home use it is fine.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt. Small, light and compact to bring around. However, the curing time of 30 secs is not enough to hold the gel. They start to peel after 3 days. So, I had to cure them for at least 2 mins to have them last longer. Otherwise, it is good enough for home use.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for an at-home lamp!  No complaints at all!  I&#x27;ve so far used it with the Gelish and the China Glaze soak off polishes and it has worked great!</li>
            <li> I previously wrote that the lamp did not work, but I contacted the seller, and they responded quite quickly. They replaced the lamp, and were very kind about the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp itself is very sleek. It has a timer feature built-in, and will comfortably fit 4 fingers at a time. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. :)</li>
            <li> This light was relatively cheap and arrived promptly. I&#x27;ve used it to do my gel nail polish at home and I&#x27;m so very happy with it.  You have to do your thumbs separate but that isn&#x27;t a big hardship.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had one before.  They work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> lOVE my light! Great value and product- I have recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li> 4 5/8 in wide&lt;br /&gt;3 5/8 in deep&lt;br /&gt;3&amp;#34; tall&lt;br /&gt;opening 3 7/8 inches wide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in my experience - 30 sec for clear, 60 sec for color or thick clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the buttons are confusing -- my other ones turn on when you plug them in and press the button on top.  This one has a switch on the back that you have to deal with -- only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars.  but it makes a squeak so you know when the 30 sec are up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total only 7 watts, but lots of little lights so good nail coverage from all angles</li>
            <li> did not dry my gel nail polish at all. do not buy</li>
            <li> Item came sooner than expected. It was in great condition and exactly what I expected. They even though in a polish!!! I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! Does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this LED lamp!!  I even bought another one as a gift for my mom.  Quality is great and it saves me so much money to be able to do my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> Works well, and received fast.  Much smaller than expected, so only four fingers fit at a time.  Have to insert my thumbs as a last action.</li>
            <li> Love this make it cheaper than going to a salon</li>
            <li> So much better than my UV light and much smaller to store.</li>
            <li> buy a more expensive one  makes the gel nails last for a very short time 2 days max</li>
            <li> This is just so cool and works fast. I love it. This item got me on the path of gel nails. I can not see myself going back to the old ways. This really makes you a pro in your own home. Saw item at Target for almost $50.OO they included a couple more things but not $50.00 worth.</li>
