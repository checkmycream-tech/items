            <li>Good price also.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li>THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT WAS FAIR.</li>
            <li>For its price, it is quite good.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>

            <li>can understand that kind of situation.and</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li>Good makeup isn&#x27;t cheap and cheap makeup isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>I knew the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>it works great, very high quality and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am going to be getting many applications out of it.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSH FELL APART BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li>For starters, the brush is more like a children&#x27;s watercolor paint brush than a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner sludge is nothing more than repackaged cheap-o Halloween makeup.</li>
            <li>When I was first looking at this it had good reviews</li>
            <li>but it does a good job, the brush is kind of messy and not of good quality</li>
            <li>this is such a good eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The eyeliner I received was M.A.C. brand, however it smears quite easily.</li>
            <li>It (Like all gel eyeliner) applies to your eyelid &amp; water line easily.</li>
            <li>THEREFORE IT RUBS OFF EASILY.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s beautiful and gonna last forever</li>
            <li>so it was fine</li>
            <li>I was expecting some knock of cheap dollar store stuff</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and does not come off by itself.</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson in buying cheap gel eyeliners.</li>
            <li>MAC is usually more pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was so excited and it works so well.</li>
            <li>exactly what most teenagers want</li>
            <li>Smears so quickly and sooo cheap</li>
            <li>It took so long to get too :p</li>
            <li>I guess it was an okay eyeliner but wouldn&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to apply.</li>
            <li>very nice and cheap the only thing about this i would have to say is that it doesnt last that long but its very good for what you pay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much artistic ability.</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t call it high quality more like dollar store</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and easy to take off</li>
            <li>but totally this is okay</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love this liner its stays long ans</li>
            <li>they really shipped this eye liner ?????????????</li>
            <li>but you pay for what you get the brush really isnt an eyeliner brush</li>
            <li>Although it printed MAC on, I doubt it is real one.</li>
            <li>it was okay though,even though that is a little bit small,the product is cheaper.i</li>
            <li>but if you are careful and precise with your make up it will work anyway.</li>
            <li>I normally have a hard time with eyeliners, but this one goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really hard for it to actually look good.</li>
            <li>After waiting a long time for delivery this is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but the brush needs to be a little thinner.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t last very long and smears really quick.</li>
            <li>Very greasy, smudges easily, impossible to make it look good.</li>

            <li> It has only been a couple days after that, but that is still a LONG wait.</li>
            <li> i have waited this for a long time..</li>
            <li> I had to wait so long for this product</li>
            <li> The brush it came with is too long to apply any pressure from the brush to the gel.</li>
            <li> Waterproof eyeliner should not smear all day long.  </li>
            <li> Luckily for me I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, but it&#x27;s still very disappointing when you wait so long</li>
            <li> really dark and mysterious.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time and I am getting highly annoyed with it.</li>
            <li> Not real Mac product.&lt;br /&gt;Bought for an effects makeup kit so I can&#x27;t complain&lt;</li>
            <li> brush is not a real eyeliner brush but will do.</li>
            <li> When used with other eyeliner brushes it still clumped up and would not apply to my eye lid.</li>
            <li> Had raccoon eyes and black arches in eye creases with in an hour.</li>
            <li> it also fits in to a little purse just in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviers received</li>
            <li> It is, however, VERY dark...</li>
            <li> Came in the mail completely dried and cracked.</li>
            <li> dried in two time use</li>
            <li> I knew not to expect anything spectacular, but this stuff is beyond awful.</li>
            <li> and the brush is so tiny it allows me to properly draw the line that otherwise is very difficult for me.</li>
            <li> the brush also small for me.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay cheap nasty smells like oil for cars!!</li>
            <li> Would put negative if I could</li>
            <li> The jar is very small.</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> Not Mac, poor quality and smears as soon as you&lt;br /&gt;put</li>
            <li> The brush may be weird</li>
            <li> the brush sucks and the gel smears everywhere ugh!!!</li>
            <li> and now it has bad.</li>
            <li> Smudges really bad.</li>
            <li> I am just extremely frustrated.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product, for one I never even received it, and I would give this product a 0 star.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend to no one worst thing I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The eyeliner I received was M.A.C. brand, however it smears quite easily. It also did not come with a brush. Poor product.</li>
            <li> The brush may be weird but if you cut it it&#x27;s perfect! I totally recommend this! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Product works like it&#x27;s supposed to. Good buy for the money. I&#x27;d recommend it. Good amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been happy with it and I will but it again.  Plus it&#x27;s beautiful and gonna last forever</li>
            <li> i love it! it works great, very high quality and very smooth. 100% waterproof. last for over 11 hours. great job</li>
            <li> it was okay though,even though that is a little bit small,the product is cheaper.i can understand that kind of situation.and the brush also small for me. but totally this is okay</li>
            <li> I love this liner its stays long ans it also fits in to a little purse just in case you want to put nore on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviers received but I received a MAC fluid line. I was so excited and it works so well. I was expecting some knock of cheap dollar store stuff but I ended up with MAC!</li>
            <li> Not real Mac product.&lt;br /&gt;Bought for an effects makeup kit so I can&#x27;t complain&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not a real eyeliner brush but will do.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Goes on smoothly and does not come off by itself. Great buy for anyone. Good price also.</li>
            <li> I normally have a hard time with eyeliners, but this one goes on very easily. Love, love, love it!! Would recommend this one!</li>
            <li> really dark and mysterious. It (Like all gel eyeliner) applies to your eyelid &amp; water line easily. I recommend this as a gift or for yourself. It is, however, VERY dark... exactly what most teenagers want</li>
            <li> this is not waterprof.....the brush sucks and the gel smears everywhere ugh!!! I would not recommend this to a friend or anyone!!!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay cheap nasty smells like oil for cars!! don&#x27;t recommend to no one worst thing I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> this is such a good eyeliner! and the brush is so tiny it allows me to properly draw the line that otherwise is very difficult for me.</li>
            <li> The brush broke .. and seemed used and stuck together&lt;br /&gt;So I haven&#x27;t even bothered putting on the make up.. it said &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;lol but you pay for what you get so it was fine I just needed some cheap&lt;br /&gt;eyeliner anyways</li>
            <li> Smears so quickly and sooo cheap it&#x27;s really hard for it to actually look good. It took so long to get too :p</li>
            <li> The brush is fallin off &amp; it&#x27;s not waterproof . I guess it was an okay eyeliner but wouldn&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li> i have waited this for a long time..&lt;br /&gt;are they really shipped this eye liner ?????????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do i have to still wait for this??</li>
            <li> Came in the mail completely dried and cracked. Would put negative if I could</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I thought it was just a generic brand but it ended up being MAC. I was very happy, and it is wonderful to use</li>
            <li> Not Mac, poor quality and smears as soon as you&lt;br /&gt;put it on! The rush looked used and messed up though it away. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t call it high quality more like dollar store but you pay for what you get the brush really isnt an eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and easy to take off but it does a good job, the brush is kind of messy and not of good quality but if you are careful and precise with your make up it will work anyway.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product, for one I never even received it, and I would give this product a 0 star. I had to wait so long for this product and it never even came. I have written the sellers and never heard back. Luckily for me I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, but it&#x27;s still very disappointing when you wait so long and you never get it.</li>
            <li> The brush it came with is too long to apply any pressure from the brush to the gel. When used with other eyeliner brushes it still clumped up and would not apply to my eye lid. 5 minutes later it would wear off. Never again. I learned my lesson in buying cheap gel eyeliners.</li>
            <li> During the winter I would of gave this a 5. Living in Florida during the summer one touch and this eyeliner will smudge. Almost like its melting.</li>
            <li> No puedo calificarlo xq nunca yego .</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on nice and smooth. Pretty easy to apply. I don&#x27;t have much artistic ability. So it&#x27;s good for me. The jar is very small. I don&#x27;t think I am going to be getting many applications out of it.</li>
            <li> dried in two time use</li>
            <li> very nice and cheap the only thing about this i would have to say is that it doesnt last that long but its very good for what you pay.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff MAC eyeliner. MAC is usually more pricey but worth every penny. This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t last very long and smears really quick. I knew the price was too good to be true. Well, you get what you pay for. Good makeup isn&#x27;t cheap and cheap makeup isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT WAS FAIR. THE BRUSH FELL APART BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO USE IT. AND THE PRODUCT IS WATERPROOF, BUT IT NEVER FULLY DRIES AND STAYS GEL LIKE. THEREFORE IT RUBS OFF EASILY.</li>
            <li> For its price, it is quite good. Not quite water proof. Although it printed MAC on, I doubt it is real one. The brush you can just forget about it and find or use another one.</li>
            <li> I still have YET to get this. I ordered it on February 4th and it was supposed to arrive March 3rd-March 19th. It has only been a couple days after that, but that is still a LONG wait. When I was first looking at this it had good reviews and now it has bad. I am just extremely frustrated. For some reason 1 item out of my orders ALWAYS never makes it to me. I have the correct address, it says shipped, but where is the product?! This isn&#x27;t the first time and I am getting highly annoyed with it.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. I knew not to expect anything spectacular, but this stuff is beyond awful. For starters, the brush is more like a children&#x27;s watercolor paint brush than a makeup brush. The eyeliner sludge is nothing more than repackaged cheap-o Halloween makeup. Very greasy, smudges easily, impossible to make it look good. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Waterproof eyeliner should not smear all day long.  It should go on and stay on.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> After waiting a long time for delivery this is exactly what I wanted! Easy to apply but the brush needs to be a little thinner.</li>
            <li> Smudges really bad. Had raccoon eyes and black arches in eye creases with in an hour.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! Especially for the price!!!!</li>
