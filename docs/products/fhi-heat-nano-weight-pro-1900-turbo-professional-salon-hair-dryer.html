            <li>This is a GREAT hairdryer!!</li>
            <li>hair, it is perfect!</li>
            <li>but I honestly have never known why you would need it anyway.</li>
            <li>I was excited because the reviews said it was a good product.</li>
            <li>ha :)</li>
            <li>I have used many hair dryers before, but this one just blows them all away in quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think its good but nothing I will go gaga about!</li>
            <li>and it has been reliable and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine hair</li>
            <li>However I noticed that my hair is a lot shinier and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was great, but then it STOPPED WORKING AFTER 8 MONTHS out of the blue.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this dryer just based on the fact it was going to reduce drying time.  </li>
            <li>As someone who washes their hair about every other day, this has added so much time to do more fun things and with beautiful hair!  </li>
            <li>This dryer is light and powerful.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time buying this dryer because I loved the first one so much.</li>
            <li>Of course finding this dryer listed at this price I jumped to buy it right away but just a heads up to all...</li>
            <li>Purchased this hair dryer for my wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It gets the hair so smooth and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets so hot that it singes the hair.</li>
            <li>so I have used many different dryers.</li>
            <li>Two problems I have is when it gets hot</li>
            <li>the diffuser and concentrater pop off and they are really hot.  </li>
            <li>I have made other purchases from Amazon with great success, this must have been one of the odd ones.  </li>
            <li>It is awesome for professional hairstylists having to do multiple blowdrys everyday (As I am a professional).</li>
            <li>It really hasnt cut my drying time.</li>
            <li>Did you really think someone would spend over $100 on a hair dryer and accept this?  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the drying time.  </li>
            <li>I really like the temperature settings on this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping that the attachment included a comb, but it did not.</li>
            <li>She states it is very light weight with several different settings allowing her to choose the exact condition she wants to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver around in the bathroom (or wherever you dry your hair..)</li>
            <li>And, it gets hot enough to blow my hair completely straight!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She recommends this to anyone looking for a high quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li>They should have sent me out a new one</li>
            <li>They sent me a new dryer, which stopped working after 10 months.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, I turned it on, and absolutely NO HEAT came out of it.  </li>
            <li>this dryer should have a blue button for a cool shot and a red button for a heat shot.</li>
            <li>It can get very hot, quickly, so be careful.  </li>
            <li>Clearly this item had been purchased and returned before</li>
            <li>Nano Weight Pro 1900 Turbo Professional Salon Hair Dryer]]Shame on you, Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as though the high setting became the low setting.</li>
            <li>and I was told to send the hair dryer back, once received they would send me out a new one.  </li>
            <li>However after the fourth time using the dryer it completely broke and wouldn&#x27;t put out any heat whatsoever!</li>

            <li> Product started out fine, but after less than a year and a half, I noticed that the motor was dying down and losing it&#x27;s power.</li>
            <li> and it is less than 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> I paid $120 for this dryer and expected it to last me years, not break TWICE after only 1.5 years!!  </li>
            <li> Whether you have straight, curly, frizzy, dull, etc.</li>
            <li> There was a weird sound</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the cord for it is very long</li>
            <li> but it takes about 15 mins or so to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer and I really don&#x27;t dry my hair often.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, and wavy hair, and what used to take upwards of 30 mins to dry completely with other dryers now takes about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> Amazon offered me a partial return (I think it ended up being 80%).</li>
            <li> After 4 months of normal use, the air flow decreased to almost half.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Stay away, shame on this company for making such an expensive product that is such garbage!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer went out after about 5 months of use (and I don&#x27;t use it everyday).  </li>
            <li> AND THEN YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH A BROKEN DRYER.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that I wasted my money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because it was light weight, but obviously poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Ive always used drugstore blow dryers in the past like Conair and Revlon.</li>
            <li> So I finally decided to invest in a salon dryer as my hair started falling a lot and thought maybe an expensive product may reduce the problem.</li>
            <li> Too bad, as I had high hopes for this model, after doing quite a lot of research.  </li>
            <li> The cord is insanely long and annoying to recoil, but I guess that&#x27;s for salon purposes.</li>
            <li> I am so upset and frustrated that I wasted per $100 on this.</li>
            <li> because I purchased it from an online retailer, she was unable to do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> It is an expensive dryer</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely useless!  </li>
            <li> and then I would have returned the bad one.</li>
            <li> But the really annoying part is that the attachments don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy, you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible Blow Dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dryer ever, plus FHI Heat has the worst customer service.  </li>

            <li> My hair dresser uses this dryer and it is rated as one of the best.  I bought this dryer from Amazon and it never ever worked or even turned on.  I called FHI warranty and they would not replace it because Amazon is not a certified dealer.  My warranty paper work in the box did not state the item had to be from a certified dealer however the web site did.  I have made other purchases from Amazon with great success, this must have been one of the odd ones.  The item was returned.</li>
            <li> Ive always used drugstore blow dryers in the past like Conair and Revlon. So I finally decided to invest in a salon dryer as my hair started falling a lot and thought maybe an expensive product may reduce the problem.After a lot of research I decided for FHI or Babyliss. This dryer received an award so I decided to purchase it. I use the dryer in its highest heat and speed setting. I have medium length, fine hair but it takes about 15 mins or so to dry my hair. It really hasnt cut my drying time. However I noticed that my hair is a lot shinier and frizz free. Overall I think its good but nothing I will go gaga about!</li>
            <li> Purchased this hair dryer for my wife and she absolutely loves it! She states it is very light weight with several different settings allowing her to choose the exact condition she wants to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She recommends this to anyone looking for a high quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer went out after about 5 months of use (and I don&#x27;t use it everyday).  I called the manufacturer about the problem.  The rep informed me that because I purchased it from an online retailer, she was unable to do anything for me.  She suggested that I contact Amazon and tell them that the manufacturer was not going to cover it under the warranty for this reason. I did. Amazon offered me a partial return (I think it ended up being 80%).</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0015KDH36 FHI Heat  Nano Weight Pro 1900 Turbo Professional Salon Hair Dryer]]Shame on you, Amazon.  I received my FHI Heat Nano Weight 1900 dryer yesterday.  When I took it out of the box, it looked like it had been opened before.  Sure enough, I turned it on, and absolutely NO HEAT came out of it.  Clearly this item had been purchased and returned before--how dare you try to sell it again??  Did you really think someone would spend over $100 on a hair dryer and accept this?  Too bad, as I had high hopes for this model, after doing quite a lot of research.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and several years ago I ordered the FHI Nano 1900 hair dryer through my sales rep. When That dryer quit working I got online looking to replace it. Of course finding this dryer listed at this price I jumped to buy it right away but just a heads up to all... this dryer should have a blue button for a cool shot and a red button for a heat shot. The item that this company sends does not have the red button for a heat shot! The box this dryer comes in is the same picture as the dryer in it but the picture on this item listing is incorrect. I purchased two so it wasn&#x27;t just a fluke.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT hairdryer!! This is my 2nd time buying this dryer because I loved the first one so much. The picture for this is incorrect however. Everything is the same except it does not have the red heat button.. but I honestly have never known why you would need it anyway. This dryer is so lightweight! It is awesome for professional hairstylists having to do multiple blowdrys everyday (As I am a professional). It gets the hair so smooth and makes it so soft. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer to ANYONE! Whether you have straight, curly, frizzy, dull, etc. hair, it is perfect! Not to mention, the cord for it is very long so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver around in the bathroom (or wherever you dry your hair..) ha :)</li>
            <li> This dryer gets so hot that it singes the hair. I am a stylist so I have used many different dryers. This one burned the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer and I really don&#x27;t dry my hair often. I was excited because the reviews said it was a good product. However after the fourth time using the dryer it completely broke and wouldn&#x27;t put out any heat whatsoever! I am so upset and frustrated that I wasted per $100 on this. Please don&#x27;t buy, you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was great, but then it STOPPED WORKING AFTER 8 MONTHS out of the blue.  FHI won&#x27;t honor the warranty because it&#x27;s purchased through Amazon.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Horrible Blow Dryer.  Started sparking and it is less than 6 months old.  Customer service was no help, said it was my fault and warranty would not cover it.  Will never purchase FHI again.</li>
            <li> This dryer is light and powerful. Two problems I have is when it gets hot the diffuser and concentrater pop off and they are really hot.  Also, I didn&#x27;t know that because I purchased this from Amazon, FHI does not honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this dryer just based on the fact it was going to reduce drying time.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the drying time.  My hair was frizzy.  I would say within 2 weeks I noticed a burning smell nut it went away.  The same smell came back and I could see smoke.  Contacted the vendor because and I was told to send the hair dryer back, once received they would send me out a new one.  I thought forget it.  Chalk this one up to a loss.  They should have sent me out a new one and then I would have returned the bad one. Lessons learnt.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair dryers before, but this one just blows them all away in quality.  I have been using it since 2012 and it has been reliable and easy to maintain.  I have long, thick, and wavy hair, and what used to take upwards of 30 mins to dry completely with other dryers now takes about 10 mins.  And, it gets hot enough to blow my hair completely straight!  As someone who washes their hair about every other day, this has added so much time to do more fun things and with beautiful hair!  Thank you FHI!</li>
            <li> I was expecting  is gonna come with two bottoms  (red)&amp;(blue) as it looks in the pic .. Lil disapointed .</li>
            <li> I really like the temperature settings on this hair dryer.  It can get very hot, quickly, so be careful.  I was really hoping that the attachment included a comb, but it did not.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER!!  IT WILL NOT LAST AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BREAK ON YOU.  EVENTUALLY YOUR WARRANTY WILL EXPIRE AND THEN YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH A BROKEN DRYER.  This is the worst hair dryer ever, plus FHI Heat has the worst customer service.  I bought the Nano from my hair salon.  After 4 months of normal use, the air flow decreased to almost half.  I sent the dryer into FHI to get repaired/exchanged, which costed me another $15 plus shipping.  They sent me a new dryer, which stopped working after 10 months.  There was a weird sound and then the air no longer flowed through the dryer.  I talked to OSCAR at FHI&#x27;s customer service department, who told me that he reports to the CEO.  Oscar told me that there was nothing they could do, then proceeded to blame me as if I had dropped the dryer.  FHI would not replace or repair the dryer.  I paid $120 for this dryer and expected it to last me years, not break TWICE after only 1.5 years!!  I had to go back to using my $19 REVLON hair dryer that is lasting 10 times longer than the FHI Nano.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon and could not return it to the manufacturer.  After two months the heat setting only works on low and it&#x27;s completely useless!  Stay away, shame on this company for making such an expensive product that is such garbage!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and after using for about a month, the product sparked and stopped working.  Too bad, because it was light weight, but obviously poorly made.  It is an expensive dryer and I feel that I wasted my money with this purchase.</li>
