            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and manageable and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, a good shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s does not require that I use more products for full looking, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>but, that being said, I LOVE the way it makes my hair smell and feel.</li>
            <li>Received on time and was pleased with the products.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Love the smell...</li>
            <li>authentic.</li>
            <li>my hair are healthy, no split ends.</li>
            <li>I love this product and decided to save some money buy ordering from this seller...</li>
            <li>great for my hair which is normal</li>
            <li>This is one of the best shampoo &amp; conditioners for dry hair..</li>
            <li>I bought this for the first time and love these products!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner add volume and manageability to my hair.</li>
            <li>, it was secure.  </li>
            <li>and I felt like that the bottle was filled with another type of conditioner, and after a week a pump on the shampoo broke as well....</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of moisturizing ingredient to make my hair look better for longer.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I buy at the beauty supply at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my husband because of the ingredients that are supposed to help regrow hair, but now he has to share with me.</li>
            <li>I had the full blast spray mode on the shower head and rinsed it for a full minute....</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these products, I live in Tallahassee Florida,  and it is 100 degrees and 90 percent  humidity.  </li>
            <li>It lathered much more (the real stuff has almost no lather), and my hair color faded much faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it does not lather much but that does not affect the product performance!.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>Nothing really gives my hair any life (no volume)...</li>
            <li>&quot; but the detergents they put in cheap shampoo to make it lather actually damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Texturizers, root boot, moisturizing spray are great for an afternoon, then my hair gets heavy goes flat from product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a strong perfumery scent but a clean light scent.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need a lot just a small portion to do the job and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner, the shampoo is not worth the price.</li>
            <li>The pumps don&#x27;t seem big enough for the thickness of the shampoo -- takes more effort than it should.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This will be my new hair care line, please don&#x27;t ever change it.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner but a little expensive</li>
            <li>Just opened package to find a broken pump on conditioner and both bottles full of tape which when I removed left the bottles very sticky...</li>
            <li>However, my fine baby thin hair feels fuller , looks thicker,  and smells  </li>

            <li> Just opened package to find a broken pump on conditioner and both bottles full of tape which when I removed left the bottles very sticky...</li>
            <li> However, my fine baby thin hair feels fuller , looks thicker,  and smells  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling like sticky and weighed down (opposite of what a volume conditioner should do), like I didn&#x27;t rinse it out enough.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin straight hair</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner regularly and I usually purchase it from a salon.</li>
            <li> this product is not cheap.  </li>
            <li> However, I ordered these 2 bottles because I&#x27;d save a few dollars compared to buying them from my salon.</li>
            <li> This arrived with the pump broken, packing tape covering the tops of both bottles, and some unidentified sticky stuff all over the outside of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product, my hair growth has increased and they fall out very less.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very difficult to lather and is very drying.</li>
            <li> I received my shampoo and conditioner with taped pumps in a postal ENVELOPE, which is certainly not appropriate packaging for two heavy bottles.  </li>
            <li> The product I received was not Moroccanoil, the shampoo had a horrible smell and texture and the pump broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> 1/4 of its contents, and the pump is broken.  </li>
            <li> 3/4&#x27;s of the shampoo leaked in the box and the pump from the conditioner was broken.  </li>
            <li> I got them both the conditioner pump was broken and taped when arrived.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Very poor packaging from NY SUPPLY.  </li>
            <li> Not okay for the amount of money.. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a lot of lather - it&#x27;s caused by detergent which is bad for hair.  </li>
            <li> Horrible experience.</li>

            <li> This is not the real product.</li>
            <li> What an awesome value!  Item came without any problems - I did read some reviews where the item was not packaged well or leaking and this was not the case for me, it was secure.  The product is exactly what I buy at the beauty supply at a much better price.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, a good shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s does not require that I use more products for full looking, healthy hair. It has just the right amount of moisturizing ingredient to make my hair look better for longer.

            <li> Very good product. My hair had niceee volume</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner, the shampoo is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several months and like the results.</li>
            <li> love it  always makes hair shiny and smells great</li>
            <li> The pumps don&#x27;t seem big enough for the thickness of the shampoo -- takes more effort than it should.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting at all. The shampoo is very difficult to lather and is very drying. The conditioner is everything that I have come to expect from this brand but I will never buy the volume shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Nothing really gives my hair any life (no volume)... but, that being said, I LOVE the way it makes my hair smell and feel.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and adds tons of body to fine hair. You must use the shampoo and conditioner together for the best results.</li>
            <li> Received on time and was pleased with the products. Great price for both the shampoo and conditioner. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I received my shampoo and conditioner with taped pumps in a postal ENVELOPE, which is certainly not appropriate packaging for two heavy bottles.  The shampoo had lost appr. 1/4 of its contents, and the pump is broken.  If they rectify the problem, I will change my review.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner but a little expensive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a lot of lather - it&#x27;s caused by detergent which is bad for hair.  They add lather so you can \\&quot;sense that it&#x27;s working\\&quot; but the detergents they put in cheap shampoo to make it lather actually damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Oil shampoo is one of two hair washing products I will use.  It was recommended to me almost 3 salons ago and I still use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin straight hair but I have a LOT of it.  This conditioner is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t tangle me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot just a small portion to do the job and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> this product is not cheap.  DO NOT ORDER FROM NY SUPPLY.  Very poor packaging from NY SUPPLY.  3/4&#x27;s of the shampoo leaked in the box and the pump from the conditioner was broken.  NY SPPLY did not want to replace the products after I sent pictures.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these products, I live in Tallahassee Florida,  and it is 100 degrees and 90 percent  humidity.  However, my fine baby thin hair feels fuller , looks thicker,  and smells  Awesome!  This will be my new hair care line, please don&#x27;t ever change it. Highly recommend!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> excellent shampoo, good place to order from</li>
            <li> I got them both the conditioner pump was broken and taped when arrived. The shampoo was the extra volume shampoo, but the conditioner wasn&#x27;t the same thing as I used before and I felt like that the bottle was filled with another type of conditioner, and after a week a pump on the shampoo broke as well....</li>
            <li> great for my hair which is normal</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the same product bought at a salon, nor does it make my hair feel silky.  Is it truly the same product and not a fraud?</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time and love these products! my hair is soft and manageable and smells wonderful. Not a strong perfumery scent but a clean light scent. I originally purchased this for my husband because of the ingredients that are supposed to help regrow hair, but now he has to share with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and LOVE it! However, I ordered these 2 bottles because I&#x27;d save a few dollars compared to buying them from my salon. The shampoo is exaclty the same and I have no issues with. However, the condition just doesn&#x27;t seem the same to me. It left my hair feeling like sticky and weighed down (opposite of what a volume conditioner should do), like I didn&#x27;t rinse it out enough. But I know this is not the case. I had the full blast spray mode on the shower head and rinsed it for a full minute....I&#x27;m wondering if there was something different in the bottle.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The product I received was not Moroccanoil, the shampoo had a horrible smell and texture and the pump broke the first time I used it. Horrible experience.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing on my fine hair. I was worried it would make my hair greasy but it actually does give a lot of volume. Love the smell...it does not lather much but that does not affect the product performance!. Great value and handy pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> FAKE&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t deserve one star</li>
            <li> authentic. well packaged. Nothing was broken. recommend</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoo &amp; conditioners for dry hair.. It smells so good too! Very pleased with these 2 hair products</li>
            <li> By using Moroccan oil my hair are healthy, no split ends. I was loosing my hair. Since I started using this product, my hair growth has increased and they fall out very less. You have to use it regularly to see it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner regularly and I usually purchase it from a salon. I decided to save some money. This arrived with the pump broken, packing tape covering the tops of both bottles, and some unidentified sticky stuff all over the outside of the bottles. The product was not the same as the one I buy from the salon. It lathered much more (the real stuff has almost no lather), and my hair color faded much faster. I bit the bullet and bought from the salon again.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, as I see this same situation from others. Sad.</li>
            <li> I love this product and decided to save some money buy ordering from this seller... Just opened package to find a broken pump on conditioner and both bottles full of tape which when I removed left the bottles very sticky... Not okay for the amount of money.. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I have fine hair and this shampoo and conditioner add volume and manageability to my hair. It actually makes it look and feel fuller. Highly recommend this product.</li>
