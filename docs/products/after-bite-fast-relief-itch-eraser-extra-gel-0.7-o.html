            <li> absolutely no effect, if so it was psychological and lasted very shortly, DONT BUY!</li>
            <li> However it can leave a burning feeling if  your skin is sensitive from scratching but the feeling goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Helps for minor bites.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit weak - better than nothing but weak.</li>
            <li> Having just returned from Costa Rica and been bitten badly by mosquitos on a couple of occasions (huge bites)</li>
            <li> waste of money, it felt like it was just ammonia gel...</li>
            <li> Burns a lot as soon as it is applied which then subsides after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> I applied the gel a couple of times and had no more soreness or itching.  </li>
            <li> I used to go mad with any mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is an ammonia base, it has quite the noxious smell and the fumes could sting your eyes when it is being applied.  </li>

            <li> Not as good as the roll-on After-Bite.  Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Works well, works fast.  My son and I get immediate reactions that welt up and last a month or so before finally disappearing.  I used to go mad with any mosquito bites.  Works if applied at any time, but if you carry it with you, and use it as soon as you notice it, the reaction stays minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is an ammonia base, it has quite the noxious smell and the fumes could sting your eyes when it is being applied.  Avoid inhaling it and have children turn away when applying it and until it soaks in.  We have no issues when our kids do that.  Once it soaks in, there is no issue with the scent or fumes.</li>
            <li> When I run into some mosquitoes, they always feast on me.  This is the only thing that will take the itching away for me and i never go anywhere in the world without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product consistently for several years for bug bites during the summer months. It really works!</li>
            <li> waste of money, it felt like it was just ammonia gel...absolutely no effect, if so it was psychological and lasted very shortly, DONT BUY!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  When attacked by single minded mosquitos, even straight ammonia right out of the bottle will not kill the itch.  this is nice and easy to apply and is great when attacked while sipping a smart cocktail at an outside venue - you can descretely hide the fact you are about to tear through your skin but it is a bit weak - better than nothing but weak.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t offer me relief and smells like ammonia (which I realize is what it is, but the fact remains). I&#x27;ll be sticking to Caladryl.</li>
            <li> No match for the sand flea bites of Honduras.</li>
            <li> After trying many after bite products over many years I have found After Bite Fast Relief Itch Eraser Gel to be the best product to relieve pain and itching.    Having just returned from Costa Rica and been bitten badly by mosquitos on a couple of occasions (huge bites) I applied the gel a couple of times and had no more soreness or itching.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I live in the Wisconsin Northwoods and the bugs can carry you away at times in the summer.  In particular, we have something called \\&quot;no seeums\\&quot; that you really can&#x27;t see but will cause you pain for days. The AfterBite Xtra will have all the bites under control within minutes. This stuff is so good the stores can&#x27;t keep it in stock here so I order 5-6 tubes at a time from Amazon. The regular After Bite does not work nearly as well for my family as this.</li>
            <li> We live in Atlanta and the mosquitos are horrendous.  After Bite Xtra relieves the itch for a while better than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t last for hours but it does provide effective relief for a awhile which is blissful.  Reapplication brings back the relief.</li>
            <li> I get a lot mosquitoes during the summer. This product works the best in stopping the itchiness right away. However it can leave a burning feeling if  your skin is sensitive from scratching but the feeling goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This really does relieve the itch better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Did the job very well</li>
            <li> Works great on insect bites. Had several fire ant bites, very soothing. Takes away the itch</li>
            <li> This does not completely relieve the itch, but it works better than any other product that I&#x27;ve tried (mosquitoes love me).</li>
            <li> Have only had 1 bite since I purchased this.  It helped better than other products I have used in the past.  The itch came back a few hours later, and I just dabbed more on.  Does have an initial ammonia smell which quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> This product dries to a shield. Burns a little but by far the best stuff for bites poisonous rashes etc</li>
            <li> best ointment I have found to stop the itch and hurt from all different types of bug bites.</li>
            <li> Helps for minor bites. Burns a lot as soon as it is applied which then subsides after a few minutes. Small bites significantly reduce after a while after one application.</li>
            <li> awesome delivery and excellent product</li>
