            <li>Works amazingly well with Gelish polish (that&#x27;s all I use it for).  </li>
            <li>, this is AMAZING</li>
            <li>The nail nipper was a nice add-in.</li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>Fits one whole hand in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It came packaged nicely with no scratches or dings.</li>
            <li>I did receive this one from the company for review, but my opinions are honest and my experience with the item.</li>
            <li>I knew the lights were strong when my gel polish got warm under the lights!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this lamp!!</li>
            <li>Never thought I would be able to do my own nails so nicely out of the salon.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this light!!</li>
            <li>Most lamps dont fit our thumbs but this one does!!</li>
            <li>The light worked for Gel nail polish and had good cure time.</li>
            <li>I have purchased led lights before this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The timer is by far the best for the price.</li>
            <li>So far Melodysusie Impressed</li>
            <li>The LED light lamps are not as good as the UV.  </li>
            <li>It works great and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Easy operate!</li>
            <li>Beautiful design and fast curing time when applying gel.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Unit is very light weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives amazing results.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap 9 watt lamp that works better than this!</li>
            <li>Has an accurate timer with 4 time selections !</li>
            <li>With all the functionality (including different timer options), I&#x27;m also very happy with the price I paid for the value.</li>
            <li>I just fall in love with this lamp.</li>
            <li>and I decided to replace the lamp for something better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I think I need more.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>This LED lamp works great and fast.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you buy gel polish that is compatible with LED lamps as some are not.  </li>
            <li>use GELISH products. : )</li>
            <li>However, it worked perfectly and the curing times are only 10 seconds for foundation and 30 seconds for all coats after that!</li>
            <li>Bought this after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>I redo my&lt;br /&gt;thumbs to make sure I got the sides.</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times already and is better than the uv lamps</li>
            <li>Over all I am satisfied with the lamp.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I did use top quality gel nail products to start.</li>
            <li>The one I bought for $25 is better than this one</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>love that the cord is detachable for storing</li>
            <li>once you put a top coat on and cure it - THEN use rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball, and wipe any residue off, just like you&#x27;re wiping polish off.</li>
            <li>Love this light!</li>
            <li>wonderful!I was able to place all five fingers in light as well with no problem!</li>
            <li>ok,  I tried it again</li>
            <li>Looks much better</li>
            <li>I have used it with several brands of gel polish and it has always worked great!  </li>
            <li>But I do love the lamp otherwise.</li>
            <li>Mostly requires to cure for 2 minutes, and cures with smudges at times (sort of looks wavy).</li>
            <li>Tried with Gelish, Ez Flow, Gelaze, Red Carpet - all gel polish were perfectly cured.</li>
            <li>I daughters love this and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I love it and it excepts all 5 fingers and has adjustments for time drying.!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It even cures my UV top coat.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just okay to use sometimes...</li>
            <li>It okay for home use.</li>
            <li>Love this light for gel nail polish!  </li>
            <li>love this.  </li>
            <li>Love this lamp</li>
            <li>so I am still trying different things to see what works best.</li>
            <li>My nails look better than if I went to the salon.  </li>
            <li>but I find it works better attached to an extension cord.</li>
            <li>For the price, the adapter should have been better quality.</li>
            <li>Love this lamp.</li>
            <li>: If you have problems curing your thumb, put your thumb on top of your index finger so it may cure efficiently.</li>
            <li>Just got it today and love it.</li>
            <li>a month at most.</li>
            <li>Would probably advise spending a bit more for something better.</li>
            <li>Love the timer.</li>
            <li>I love my MelodySusie lamp</li>
            <li>I love this light !</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Led is way better and faster than UV.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this lamp.</li>
            <li>Go for it, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this LED lamp.  </li>
            <li>I love this item,  </li>
            <li>Can fit whole hand in great.</li>
            <li>I just love this LED lamp; it is so easy to use and does everything for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a 36W UV light, and a MelodySusie 6W LED light.  </li>
            <li>Have used it a couple times, and has worked great so far!</li>
            <li>Works great do far!</li>
            <li>So - I cannot give a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; opinion, but for me this thing is working great so far!</li>
            <li>Excellent value-works very quickly and all of my fingers fit perfectly so individual nails not required.  </li>
            <li>Its light very light wait, a good size for the whole hand.</li>
            <li>I used it once, and was successful in giving myself my first ever gel pedicure (my foot fit fine).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail light.</li>
            <li>I love the timing options and I can comfortably fit all four of my fingers in the unit.</li>
            <li>Love saving money and this light helped.</li>
            <li>Love this light.</li>
            <li>I love this light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend saving up for a better quality light.</li>
            <li>does a good job and is fast</li>
            <li>Do not cure the thumbnail  good when doing a whole hand.</li>
            <li>I own a salon-grade UV lamp (36W) for home use and the curing time (60s-120s in between each coat) was just not cutting it for me.</li>
            <li>Dries nails really quickly, and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very compact does great job drying nails quickly.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for those who are short on space and want to do gel manicures quickly 30 seconds LED \\&quot;cure time\\&quot; vs 2 min UV \\&quot;cure time\\</li>
            <li>With this little lamp, I will be able to have great looking nails all the time, and save a TON of $$$ by not having to go to a salon!</li>
            <li>This product works perfectly and would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to do their own gel nails, Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and use.</li>
            <li>easy to change and turn on.  </li>
            <li>Easy settings to choose from.</li>
            <li>so easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works well, and compact in size.  </li>
            <li>I am by far no nail expert, but was successful at my 1st try on my gel nails.</li>
            <li>I have a high priced UV curing light but decided the exposure to the UV rays wasn&#x27;t a good idea</li>
            <li>This product was too cheap to be true!</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>It fits just fine inside this lamp, no need to cure thumb</li>
            <li>, mine fits just fine with rim to spare.</li>
            <li>Using one that came with a pair shoes and that works fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>&quot; It is very light and easy to carry around, works very well with Gelish and LeChat gel, I do suggest, that you look at your gel polishes to make sure that they are LED curable.  </li>
            <li>It fits one hand comfortably for me, curing power seems fine</li>
            <li>: All 5 of my fingers fit just fine.</li>
            <li>This little nail dryer works perfectly.</li>
            <li>perfect to put 1 hand in with a little spreading space between fingers; no concern with drying my feet nails.</li>
            <li>However, for its awesome performance, I can overlook a little annoyance.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect size and isn&#x27;t huge I can fit all 5 figures in but it is tight.</li>
            <li>Very good lamp, I be been doing shilac at home for the past year, save so much money instead of going to the salon, definitely worth to buy, and the size is excellent, my whole hand fits in it!</li>
            <li>Light itself works great just not very big</li>
            <li>The timer is accurate and goes off automatically when time is up.  </li>
            <li>You cannot beat the price for this quality nail light.</li>
            <li>Fantastic time saver.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try a LED curing light.</li>
            <li>That is fantastic compared to 1-2 min per coat with my UV light.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Everyyyy light weight like a feather.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have gotten a stronger led light.</li>
            <li>this light won&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li>So, can anyone shed some light here?  </li>
            <li>I can turn the light off by pressing the button again, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>My cheaper light was stronger.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a UV bulb lamp from another company and it was cheap and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have goggles that I use in the tanning salon, but I&#x27;ve been covering the opening with my free hand when in use, so I don&#x27;t have the rays from the bulbs coming out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like the reflective light misses it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>This is great for doing at home regular or gel manicures.</li>
            <li>I purchased this light after I found out</li>
            <li>But fortunately this lamp survives the shipment and it works well.</li>
            <li>Item came securely packed and  prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot, ir really cures</li>
            <li>I can fit all 5 fingers under the light at one time</li>
            <li>The edges of my nails do not get the light to cure the polish.  </li>
            <li>Eventually figured out how to get results with this light but not convienient at all.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quick and easy to do my nails.</li>
            <li>Great light, nails were completely dry after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>(although I rarely have to touch up my nails, the gel stays like a dream!).</li>
            <li>Do thumbs seperalty for success!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I thought it didn&#x27;t, but it was more my misunderstanding about how Gel nail polish works.</li>
            <li>love the size, fits whole hand and the price is great for that product but timer is off by 1/2 on each setting, when I contacted seller they wanted me to send it back for service, I won&#x27;t pay for shipping when it is a defective product</li>
            <li>its totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, works like a charm!</li>
            <li>Mirror wipes clean with a damp paper towel.  </li>
            <li>It works great, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Gel polish because my other light wasn&#x27;t working that great.  </li>
            <li>Great product,  very small and effective.  </li>
            <li>Anything is better than waiting on regular polish to dry on your nails, but 30 seconds is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I had to pull out my tried and true UV lamp (not LED).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care about the appearance much, more about function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the correct replacement adaptor (unusual size), so I guess I&#x27;ll have to try to return it.</li>
            <li>Love that you can do a whole hand at a time.</li>
            <li>Love that my whole hand fits so that saves time.</li>
            <li>Love my new light.....</li>
            <li>This lamp is nice and light weight and a lot more compact than my other lamp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty for manicuring, and made drying time a lot easy.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and works , however there is a 30m setting on the lamp that does not work when clicked on.  </li>
            <li>It came highly recommended to me and I am glad it purchased it.</li>
            <li>In order to get my gelish foundation to cute I had to light 30sec then alcohol then light another 30sec then apply a second coat and repeat.</li>
            <li>After much research, I&#x27;m glad I purchased a reasonably priced LED curing light.</li>
            <li>I have used the CND UV lamp for years, and love it, but don&#x27;t love how long it takes to set.</li>
            <li>Led is in My opinion the better choice &amp; this little beauty of a system is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Only con for me is that it does not have the 15s setting (for nail art), otherwise my favorite Lamp!</li>
            <li>You save so much money!!</li>
            <li>Very good but would have liked a larger opening was hard to get thumb in</li>
            <li>it cures them so fast it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this version because your whole hand can fit in at once instead of doing the thumbs separately.  </li>
            <li>idea why some are saying they can&#x27;t fit their whole hand in</li>
            <li>Love this light, Has 30, 60 and 90 second timed setting as well as a 30 minute setting.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>Is this 12 watt LED lamp as powerful as a 36 way uv lamp?  </li>
            <li>Economical price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i wanted to buy my own LED lamp so save me some $$$ instead of having to go back every 2 weeks to  a salon</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a pro dryer, but what do you expect for the price?  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you want to do this at home on your own.  </li>
            <li>So far I love it</li>
            <li>Bought to use with Shebanails gelcrylic system and it works super well super fast.</li>
            <li>If I need to I can touch them up right before work, or right before bed when I get home</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>right hand fingers, then both thumbs together.</li>
            <li>Everything appears to cure in the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It also fits a full hand or foot while most drugstore ones are much smaller.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend the gel polish and the LED light.</li>
            <li>3 of my black french tips that had peeled (had been on a while) and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Cures fast and looks cool.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I tested the timer against my iPhone timer to make sure it was ACTUALLY 30 seconds since some people seem to complain about.</li>
            <li>No issues with thumbs curing funny or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came fast!</li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>but my fault always get a higher waltz if you want it to speed up the process</li>
            <li>Works well if you do 4 fingers first and then the thumbs.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Gelish nails.  </li>
            <li>love that this lamp has different time settings.  </li>
            <li>I can fit my full hand in the unit, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting since I have larger hands.</li>
            <li>I have a UV lamp that cures much better and in around the same time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this dryer to anyone interested in doing gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li>Had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>I bought a OPI which was expensive but works great!</li>
            <li>Has saved me so much money from going to the nail salon!</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It will save you so much on manicures!</li>
            <li>The lamp is made well, is pretty to look at and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>And, there is more than enough room inside this lamp for all 4 fingers at once and some wiggle room too.  </li>
            <li>is the first time I&#x27;m using nail polish that requires lamp for curing</li>
            <li>I wish i could have checked the size of it first but</li>
            <li>its ok i can keep this mini lamp for personal use.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>can reccommend to others who may be interested.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is the rather flimsy cord, however, it&#x27;s replacable and wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a replacement if ever this one decids to give out.</li>
            <li>First led/uv lamp I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Does not get hot like the UV lamps do.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a lamp with higher watts.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t try it at the 30sec since I was short on time and wanted to be sure it was done in one shot.</li>
            <li>I love this, and would DEFINITELY buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it&#x27;s worked nicely and it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li>The package is full of poorly written english, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s taken a couple of tries to get this to work perfect for me, but it does work just fine as long as I am careful to make sure my nails get light directly from the bulbs as the light reflected from the mirrored surface doesn&#x27;t work for parts of my thumb and pinky that face down when I put my whole hand in.</li>
            <li>I love the various timer settings - it makes the gel application that much easier.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about it at first.</li>
            <li>i go so long without being able to go into a salon.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li>Try to avoid getting it on your skin/cuticles, but if you do, just wipe it off with your opposite thumb nail (the color wipes off easily from your thumb).</li>
            <li>Once I put the top coat, cured it, and then wiped it with the cleaner, it felt dry.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims; I can fit my entire hand in and am finished with my nails in record time!</li>
            <li>Although This one doesnt have the LED along the sides(only on top) but it has mirrors that quickly dry every corner of the nail.</li>
            <li>Also, my hand does fit in the lamp, but the inside of my thumbs do not dry at all when the whole hand is in there.</li>
            <li>I was leary though because this is a third of the price of my UV light and the curing times were much shorter.</li>
            <li>:  don&#x27;t expect to fit your whole hand in here unless you have tiny hands.  </li>
            <li>My whole hand fits</li>
            <li>It is a bit cramped for whole hand but can be done.  </li>
            <li>LED is so much faster...</li>
            <li>Can fit your entire hand (including thumb).  </li>
            <li>Mines didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Technically you CAN fit your thumb in here, but it may or may not cure correctly.  </li>
            <li>You can fit your entire hand in at once, but it is tricky to get my thumb to cure</li>
            <li>I have used this light with OPI gel color, Fingerpaint gel and Red Carpet gels.</li>
            <li>really fast</li>
            <li>Very even drying on each nail.</li>
            <li>Inside dimensions are great for my avg/medium length nails; approx comfortable inside space is 5.5&amp;#34; wide by 4.5&amp;#34; deep in center.</li>
            <li>I was never one to really go</li>
            <li>Fits whole hand.</li>
            <li>You cannot put your whole hand in to cure.</li>
            <li>Plug it in, hit the button, ready to go.</li>
            <li>reflexion of the light does not cover the sides of the thumb nails if you place the entire hand.</li>
            <li>was really looking forward to this lamp but had to return it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this lamp to anyone who wants to do gel manicures at home  </li>
            <li>I like it except the very bottom edge of the nail when you put ALL five fingers in, doesn&#x27;t cure.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this light twice</li>
            <li>My whole hand fits, but the thumb doesn&#x27;t always cure fully and polish comes off when I remove the tacky layer.</li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like that feature as some lamps I viewed</li>
            <li>There are various time settings available.  </li>
            <li>Does not take up too much on the table so convenient to use.</li>
            <li>We have used quite a bit in last two months and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Much faster than the UV lamp I had.</li>
            <li>I shipped the light back.</li>
            <li>After you have had your hand inside the machine, even for 5 minutes, the gel polish is still very tacky.</li>
            <li>If you are prepared to spend around $20 a bottle for gel polish do yourself a favor and invest in a much nicer product.  </li>
            <li>However it is so fast, compared to a uv lamp.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I spent good money on it and it didn&#x27;t even last a month...</li>
            <li>I have also recommended to 3 other friends whom have bought it and love it as well.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to finally have time to do my nails again.  </li>
            <li>I am not a professional, I just do my own fingers and toes since I refuse to pay $35 for gelish/shellac at a salon, plus they take forever, and the polish peels (probably because their lights are worn out) and when it peels I can&#x27;t just simply fix it myself.</li>
            <li>I am new to at home gel manicures and bought this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Helps my gel polish dry so quickly!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use thin coats of polish to make sure it dries completely.</li>
            <li>True there is enough space for all five fingers</li>
            <li>Came with all the right parts, big enough to fit hands or feet.</li>
            <li>I left my nails in 30 seconds longer than needed, but for a first timer I had to make sure my nails were dry.</li>
            <li>but it is not true that you can cure 5 fingers, I mean you can put them inside perfectly</li>
            <li>Also, my hands were able to fit in, all 5 fingers at once, several buyers said they couldn&#x27;t, the only way I think you would g be a me to is if you have really long fingers.</li>
            <li>The lamp lasts much to perform proper drying, it is nothing so powerful as the description says.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a defective unit, but I have experimented with the time settings and cannot seem to get a decent curing.</li>
            <li>Very compact yet whole adult hand fits in sturdy</li>
            <li>Cord is a decent length</li>
            <li>and I decided to purchase this particular LED lamp.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s different timing buttons on the top that you can press (as topcoats and colors cure at different rates).</li>
            <li>The machine sets only the top of the polish and the polish next to the nail does not set.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer, as it is affordable and practical.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this LED lamp for your gel manicure</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space but big enough to fit your whole hand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this little lamp.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fits all 5 fingers/toes for people with normal size digits.</li>
            <li>But this dryer,  I can fit my whole hand and run each layer for less than 60sec</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this lamp for over a month, and it still does not dry as well as my tiny RCM LED light does.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would warn that make sure your thumbs and pinkies are pointing upwards for drying or else it will not fully dry or will lift.</li>
            <li>The only positive attribute this item has is that it is large enough for your entire hand to fit in.  </li>
            <li>Brought other led light .</li>
            <li>New product</li>
            <li>I live in south east asia</li>
            <li>It is plenty big enough for a hand or foot to easily fit-</li>
            <li>I got it as a Christmas gift and am finally getting to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time last night, experimenting with tips and Gelish products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked at others and the wats were 36 and higher, this has only 12.</li>
            <li>This was my first dryer, ordered a second after my daughter took possession of this one.  </li>
            <li>(my first time trying led light and wanted to make sure it dried) entire manicure in less than 30minutes!  </li>
            <li>and they quickly fixed my problem and a new one is on its way now.</li>
            <li>Although it is small, it&#x27;s plenty large enough to allow a whole hand, including thumbs, to fit in the opening.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to cut down on the curing time but find that 30 sec doesn&#x27;t work w/ most polishes.</li>
            <li>This lamp worked fine for a few weeks and now some of the led lights have gone out and it does not evenly cure, if it cures at all.</li>
            <li>It dried my China glaze Gelaze quickly!</li>
            <li>other than that they were quick to respond.</li>
            <li>Love this little unit!!</li>
            <li>I love having this little lamp now!!</li>
            <li>(I know, professional term)</li>
            <li>The device itself feels like it was made by Hasbro for 6 year old girls.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only really ready</li>
            <li>After nearly a year&#x27;s use (which included doing my nails on a weekly basis and family members)</li>
            <li>This lamp worked really well to cure my Madam Glam gel polish, and is made to cure any gel polish that will cure under 12watts...such as Gelish and Red Carpet.</li>
            <li>I used it with ge lush OPI and Essie gel polishes</li>
            <li>Switched from my old UV lamp.  </li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>and sometimes i get so busy</li>
            <li>Still longer than common phone charger cable, so no complaints for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is fuctioning ok, never tried the 90sec or the 30min</li>
            <li>I really like the product, cheaper than the others that were similar.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what you need to dry the your nails faster.</li>
            <li>The first time I did it, I thought everything was supposed to be completely dry, but come to find out through trial and error</li>
            <li>I have not found that 30secs is enough time to dry anything - we always do 90secs just to be sure it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, because the polish is so tacky imprints are still easily made in it and small pieces of fuzz or hair can get stuck to the polish.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is supposedly 12W, it has to be less than my RCM LED light because it does not dry after 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or even 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Product was very small, it&#x27;s more like mini uv machine...</li>
            <li>Despite others&#x27; reviews of their gel polish not curing, I highly doubt those users were using a bonder prior to application of the base/foundation gel.</li>
            <li>I have been using a mini uv light for my gels for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li>If the polish holds up as well as it usually does I will be chucking my UV light in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does last for two weeks, but since I&#x27;m not paying a salon I can afford to change my color weekly and keep my manicure looking new without all the growth showing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for the whole hand</li>
            <li>There is a major difference in the time it takes to cure gel polish with LED vs. UV lights.</li>
            <li>Still after using UV light hard for me to just use 30 seconds .....</li>
            <li>The lamp was packaged well and is small and light enough for travel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional, and just use this at home for personal use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent over 100 dollars on a uv and needed to upgrade but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much again.</li>
            <li>Used 6 times so far on my nails for both hands and feet with Gelish soak off Gel Polish; only needed to use the 30sec or 60sec settings btwn coats.</li>
            <li>I recently had a gel polish manicure done professionally.</li>
            <li>With the UV I can do an entire french set on myself in under 40 minutes, so with this light I should cut that almost in half!</li>
            <li>If you see reviewers complaining that it didn&#x27;t cure their polish, they have likely used the wrong kind.  </li>
            <li>I had to put it on the 30 minute setting and even then they were not dry.  </li>
            <li>I have bought numerous brands of led nail polishes to see if that was the issue as well as making sure to use thin coats.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get an LED lamp to cut down on setting time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as I did on the CND lamp, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I have never written a negative review before but this is a first!</li>

            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well with Gelish polish (that&#x27;s all I use it for).  </li>
            <li> , this is AMAZING</li>
            <li> The nail nipper was a nice add-in.</li>
            <li> Nice size.</li>
            <li> Fits one whole hand in perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It came packaged nicely with no scratches or dings.</li>
            <li> I did receive this one from the company for review, but my opinions are honest and my experience with the item.</li>
            <li> I knew the lights were strong when my gel polish got warm under the lights!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this lamp!!</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be able to do my own nails so nicely out of the salon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this light!!</li>
            <li> Most lamps dont fit our thumbs but this one does!!</li>
            <li> The light worked for Gel nail polish and had good cure time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased led lights before this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The timer is by far the best for the price.</li>
            <li> So far Melodysusie Impressed</li>
            <li> The LED light lamps are not as good as the UV.  </li>
            <li> It works great and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Easy operate!</li>
            <li> Beautiful design and fast curing time when applying gel.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Unit is very light weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gives amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap 9 watt lamp that works better than this!</li>
            <li> Has an accurate timer with 4 time selections !</li>
            <li> With all the functionality (including different timer options), I&#x27;m also very happy with the price I paid for the value.</li>
            <li> I just fall in love with this lamp.</li>
            <li> and I decided to replace the lamp for something better.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I think I need more.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This LED lamp works great and fast.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you buy gel polish that is compatible with LED lamps as some are not.  </li>
            <li> use GELISH products. : )</li>
            <li> However, it worked perfectly and the curing times are only 10 seconds for foundation and 30 seconds for all coats after that!</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> I redo my&lt;br /&gt;thumbs to make sure I got the sides.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times already and is better than the uv lamps</li>
            <li> Over all I am satisfied with the lamp.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I did use top quality gel nail products to start.</li>
            <li> The one I bought for $25 is better than this one</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> love that the cord is detachable for storing</li>
            <li> once you put a top coat on and cure it - THEN use rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball, and wipe any residue off, just like you&#x27;re wiping polish off.</li>
            <li> Love this light!</li>
            <li> wonderful!I was able to place all five fingers in light as well with no problem!</li>
            <li> ok,  I tried it again</li>
            <li> Looks much better</li>
            <li> I have used it with several brands of gel polish and it has always worked great!  </li>
            <li> But I do love the lamp otherwise.</li>
            <li> Mostly requires to cure for 2 minutes, and cures with smudges at times (sort of looks wavy).</li>
            <li> Tried with Gelish, Ez Flow, Gelaze, Red Carpet - all gel polish were perfectly cured.</li>
            <li> I daughters love this and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love it and it excepts all 5 fingers and has adjustments for time drying.!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even cures my UV top coat.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just okay to use sometimes...</li>
            <li> It okay for home use.</li>
            <li> Love this light for gel nail polish!  </li>
            <li> love this.  </li>
            <li> Love this lamp</li>
            <li> so I am still trying different things to see what works best.</li>
            <li> My nails look better than if I went to the salon.  </li>
            <li> but I find it works better attached to an extension cord.</li>
            <li> For the price, the adapter should have been better quality.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp.</li>
            <li> : If you have problems curing your thumb, put your thumb on top of your index finger so it may cure efficiently.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and love it.</li>
            <li> a month at most.</li>
            <li> Would probably advise spending a bit more for something better.</li>
            <li> Love the timer.</li>
            <li> I love my MelodySusie lamp</li>
            <li> I love this light !</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a 36W UV light, and a MelodySusie 6W LED light.  </li>

            <li> Works great do far!</li>
            <li> So - I cannot give a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; opinion, but for me this thing is working great so far!</li>

            <li> Love this light.</li>
            <li> I love this light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend saving up for a better quality light.</li>
            <li> does a good job and is fast</li>
            <li> Do not cure the thumbnail  good when doing a whole hand.</li>
            <li> I own a salon-grade UV lamp (36W) for home use and the curing time (60s-120s in between each coat) was just not cutting it for me.</li>
            <li> Dries nails really quickly, and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very compact does great job drying nails quickly.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those who are short on space and want to do gel manicures quickly 30 seconds LED \\&quot;cure time\\&quot; vs 2 min UV \\&quot;cure time\\</li>
            <li> With this little lamp, I will be able to have great looking nails all the time, and save a TON of $$$ by not having to go to a salon!</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly and would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to do their own gel nails, Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and use.</li>
            <li> easy to change and turn on.  </li>
            <li> Easy settings to choose from.</li>
            <li> so easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works well, and compact in size.  </li>
            <li> I am by far no nail expert, but was successful at my 1st try on my gel nails.</li>
            <li> I have a high priced UV curing light but decided the exposure to the UV rays wasn&#x27;t a good idea</li>
            <li> This product was too cheap to be true!</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> It fits just fine inside this lamp, no need to cure thumb</li>
            <li> , mine fits just fine with rim to spare.</li>
            <li> Using one that came with a pair shoes and that works fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> &quot; It is very light and easy to carry around, works very well with Gelish and LeChat gel, I do suggest, that you look at your gel polishes to make sure that they are LED curable.  </li>
            <li> It fits one hand comfortably for me, curing power seems fine</li>
            <li> : All 5 of my fingers fit just fine.</li>
            <li> This little nail dryer works perfectly.</li>
            <li> perfect to put 1 hand in with a little spreading space between fingers; no concern with drying my feet nails.</li>
            <li> However, for its awesome performance, I can overlook a little annoyance.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect size and isn&#x27;t huge I can fit all 5 figures in but it is tight.</li>
            <li> Very good lamp, I be been doing shilac at home for the past year, save so much money instead of going to the salon, definitely worth to buy, and the size is excellent, my whole hand fits in it!</li>
            <li> Light itself works great just not very big</li>
            <li> The timer is accurate and goes off automatically when time is up.  </li>
            <li> You cannot beat the price for this quality nail light.</li>
            <li> Fantastic time saver.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try a LED curing light.</li>
            <li> That is fantastic compared to 1-2 min per coat with my UV light.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Everyyyy light weight like a feather.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have gotten a stronger led light.</li>
            <li> this light won&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li> So, can anyone shed some light here?  </li>
            <li> I can turn the light off by pressing the button again, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> My cheaper light was stronger.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a UV bulb lamp from another company and it was cheap and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have goggles that I use in the tanning salon, but I&#x27;ve been covering the opening with my free hand when in use, so I don&#x27;t have the rays from the bulbs coming out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like the reflective light misses it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> This is great for doing at home regular or gel manicures.</li>
            <li> I purchased this light after I found out</li>
            <li> But fortunately this lamp survives the shipment and it works well.</li>
            <li> Item came securely packed and  prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot, ir really cures</li>
            <li> I can fit all 5 fingers under the light at one time</li>
            <li> The edges of my nails do not get the light to cure the polish.  </li>
            <li> Eventually figured out how to get results with this light but not convienient at all.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quick and easy to do my nails.</li>
            <li> Great light, nails were completely dry after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> (although I rarely have to touch up my nails, the gel stays like a dream!).</li>
            <li> Do thumbs seperalty for success!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought it didn&#x27;t, but it was more my misunderstanding about how Gel nail polish works.</li>
            <li> love the size, fits whole hand and the price is great for that product but timer is off by 1/2 on each setting, when I contacted seller they wanted me to send it back for service, I won&#x27;t pay for shipping when it is a defective product</li>
            <li> its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Mirror wipes clean with a damp paper towel.  </li>
            <li> It works great, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Gel polish because my other light wasn&#x27;t working that great.  </li>
            <li> Great product,  very small and effective.  </li>
            <li> Anything is better than waiting on regular polish to dry on your nails, but 30 seconds is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and I had to pull out my tried and true UV lamp (not LED).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care about the appearance much, more about function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the correct replacement adaptor (unusual size), so I guess I&#x27;ll have to try to return it.</li>
            <li> Love that you can do a whole hand at a time.</li>
            <li> Love that my whole hand fits so that saves time.</li>
            <li> Love my new light.....</li>
            <li> This lamp is nice and light weight and a lot more compact than my other lamp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty for manicuring, and made drying time a lot easy.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works , however there is a 30m setting on the lamp that does not work when clicked on.  </li>
            <li> It came highly recommended to me and I am glad it purchased it.</li>
            <li> In order to get my gelish foundation to cute I had to light 30sec then alcohol then light another 30sec then apply a second coat and repeat.</li>
            <li> After much research, I&#x27;m glad I purchased a reasonably priced LED curing light.</li>
            <li> I have used the CND UV lamp for years, and love it, but don&#x27;t love how long it takes to set.</li>
            <li> Led is in My opinion the better choice &amp; this little beauty of a system is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Only con for me is that it does not have the 15s setting (for nail art), otherwise my favorite Lamp!</li>
            <li> You save so much money!!</li>
            <li> Very good but would have liked a larger opening was hard to get thumb in</li>
            <li> it cures them so fast it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this version because your whole hand can fit in at once instead of doing the thumbs separately.  </li>
            <li> idea why some are saying they can&#x27;t fit their whole hand in</li>
            <li> Love this light, Has 30, 60 and 90 second timed setting as well as a 30 minute setting.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> Is this 12 watt LED lamp as powerful as a 36 way uv lamp?  </li>
            <li> Economical price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i wanted to buy my own LED lamp so save me some $$$ instead of having to go back every 2 weeks to  a salon</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a pro dryer, but what do you expect for the price?  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you want to do this at home on your own.  </li>
            <li> So far I love it</li>
            <li> Bought to use with Shebanails gelcrylic system and it works super well super fast.</li>
            <li> If I need to I can touch them up right before work, or right before bed when I get home</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> right hand fingers, then both thumbs together.</li>
            <li> Everything appears to cure in the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It also fits a full hand or foot while most drugstore ones are much smaller.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend the gel polish and the LED light.</li>
            <li> 3 of my black french tips that had peeled (had been on a while) and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Cures fast and looks cool.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I tested the timer against my iPhone timer to make sure it was ACTUALLY 30 seconds since some people seem to complain about.</li>
            <li> No issues with thumbs curing funny or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came fast!</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> but my fault always get a higher waltz if you want it to speed up the process</li>
            <li> Works well if you do 4 fingers first and then the thumbs.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Gelish nails.  </li>
            <li> love that this lamp has different time settings.  </li>
            <li> I can fit my full hand in the unit, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting since I have larger hands.</li>
            <li> I have a UV lamp that cures much better and in around the same time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer to anyone interested in doing gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> Had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought a OPI which was expensive but works great!</li>
            <li> Has saved me so much money from going to the nail salon!</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It will save you so much on manicures!</li>
            <li> The lamp is made well, is pretty to look at and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> And, there is more than enough room inside this lamp for all 4 fingers at once and some wiggle room too.  </li>
            <li> is the first time I&#x27;m using nail polish that requires lamp for curing</li>
            <li> I wish i could have checked the size of it first but</li>
            <li> its ok i can keep this mini lamp for personal use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> can reccommend to others who may be interested.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the rather flimsy cord, however, it&#x27;s replacable and wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a replacement if ever this one decids to give out.</li>
            <li> First led/uv lamp I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Does not get hot like the UV lamps do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a lamp with higher watts.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try it at the 30sec since I was short on time and wanted to be sure it was done in one shot.</li>
            <li> I love this, and would DEFINITELY buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it&#x27;s worked nicely and it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li> The package is full of poorly written english, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taken a couple of tries to get this to work perfect for me, but it does work just fine as long as I am careful to make sure my nails get light directly from the bulbs as the light reflected from the mirrored surface doesn&#x27;t work for parts of my thumb and pinky that face down when I put my whole hand in.</li>
            <li> I love the various timer settings - it makes the gel application that much easier.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about it at first.</li>
            <li> i go so long without being able to go into a salon.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li> Try to avoid getting it on your skin/cuticles, but if you do, just wipe it off with your opposite thumb nail (the color wipes off easily from your thumb).</li>
            <li> Once I put the top coat, cured it, and then wiped it with the cleaner, it felt dry.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims; I can fit my entire hand in and am finished with my nails in record time!</li>
            <li> Although This one doesnt have the LED along the sides(only on top) but it has mirrors that quickly dry every corner of the nail.</li>
            <li> Also, my hand does fit in the lamp, but the inside of my thumbs do not dry at all when the whole hand is in there.</li>
            <li> I was leary though because this is a third of the price of my UV light and the curing times were much shorter.</li>
            <li> :  don&#x27;t expect to fit your whole hand in here unless you have tiny hands.  </li>
            <li> My whole hand fits</li>
            <li> It is a bit cramped for whole hand but can be done.  </li>
            <li> LED is so much faster...</li>
            <li> Can fit your entire hand (including thumb).  </li>
            <li> Mines didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Technically you CAN fit your thumb in here, but it may or may not cure correctly.  </li>
            <li> You can fit your entire hand in at once, but it is tricky to get my thumb to cure</li>
            <li> I have used this light with OPI gel color, Fingerpaint gel and Red Carpet gels.</li>
            <li> really fast</li>
            <li> Very even drying on each nail.</li>
            <li> Inside dimensions are great for my avg/medium length nails; approx comfortable inside space is 5.5&amp;#34; wide by 4.5&amp;#34; deep in center.</li>
            <li> I was never one to really go</li>
            <li> Fits whole hand.</li>
            <li> You cannot put your whole hand in to cure.</li>
            <li> Plug it in, hit the button, ready to go.</li>
            <li> reflexion of the light does not cover the sides of the thumb nails if you place the entire hand.</li>
            <li> was really looking forward to this lamp but had to return it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this lamp to anyone who wants to do gel manicures at home  </li>
            <li> I like it except the very bottom edge of the nail when you put ALL five fingers in, doesn&#x27;t cure.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this light twice</li>
            <li> My whole hand fits, but the thumb doesn&#x27;t always cure fully and polish comes off when I remove the tacky layer.</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really like that feature as some lamps I viewed</li>
            <li> There are various time settings available.  </li>
            <li> Does not take up too much on the table so convenient to use.</li>
            <li> We have used quite a bit in last two months and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Much faster than the UV lamp I had.</li>
            <li> I shipped the light back.</li>
            <li> After you have had your hand inside the machine, even for 5 minutes, the gel polish is still very tacky.</li>
            <li> If you are prepared to spend around $20 a bottle for gel polish do yourself a favor and invest in a much nicer product.  </li>
            <li> However it is so fast, compared to a uv lamp.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I spent good money on it and it didn&#x27;t even last a month...</li>
            <li> I have also recommended to 3 other friends whom have bought it and love it as well.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to finally have time to do my nails again.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional, I just do my own fingers and toes since I refuse to pay $35 for gelish/shellac at a salon, plus they take forever, and the polish peels (probably because their lights are worn out) and when it peels I can&#x27;t just simply fix it myself.</li>
            <li> I am new to at home gel manicures and bought this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Helps my gel polish dry so quickly!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use thin coats of polish to make sure it dries completely.</li>
            <li> True there is enough space for all five fingers</li>
            <li> Came with all the right parts, big enough to fit hands or feet.</li>
            <li> I left my nails in 30 seconds longer than needed, but for a first timer I had to make sure my nails were dry.</li>
            <li> but it is not true that you can cure 5 fingers, I mean you can put them inside perfectly</li>
            <li> Also, my hands were able to fit in, all 5 fingers at once, several buyers said they couldn&#x27;t, the only way I think you would g be a me to is if you have really long fingers.</li>
            <li> The lamp lasts much to perform proper drying, it is nothing so powerful as the description says.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a defective unit, but I have experimented with the time settings and cannot seem to get a decent curing.</li>
            <li> Very compact yet whole adult hand fits in sturdy</li>
            <li> Cord is a decent length</li>
            <li> and I decided to purchase this particular LED lamp.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s different timing buttons on the top that you can press (as topcoats and colors cure at different rates).</li>
            <li> The machine sets only the top of the polish and the polish next to the nail does not set.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer, as it is affordable and practical.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this LED lamp for your gel manicure</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space but big enough to fit your whole hand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this little lamp.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fits all 5 fingers/toes for people with normal size digits.</li>
            <li> But this dryer,  I can fit my whole hand and run each layer for less than 60sec</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lamp for over a month, and it still does not dry as well as my tiny RCM LED light does.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would warn that make sure your thumbs and pinkies are pointing upwards for drying or else it will not fully dry or will lift.</li>
            <li> The only positive attribute this item has is that it is large enough for your entire hand to fit in.  </li>
            <li> Brought other led light .</li>
            <li> New product</li>
            <li> I live in south east asia</li>
            <li> It is plenty big enough for a hand or foot to easily fit-</li>
            <li> I got it as a Christmas gift and am finally getting to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time last night, experimenting with tips and Gelish products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at others and the wats were 36 and higher, this has only 12.</li>
            <li> This was my first dryer, ordered a second after my daughter took possession of this one.  </li>
            <li> (my first time trying led light and wanted to make sure it dried) entire manicure in less than 30minutes!  </li>
            <li> and they quickly fixed my problem and a new one is on its way now.</li>
            <li> Although it is small, it&#x27;s plenty large enough to allow a whole hand, including thumbs, to fit in the opening.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to cut down on the curing time but find that 30 sec doesn&#x27;t work w/ most polishes.</li>
            <li> This lamp worked fine for a few weeks and now some of the led lights have gone out and it does not evenly cure, if it cures at all.</li>
            <li> It dried my China glaze Gelaze quickly!</li>
            <li> other than that they were quick to respond.</li>
            <li> Love this little unit!!</li>
            <li> I love having this little lamp now!!</li>
            <li> (I know, professional term)</li>
            <li> The device itself feels like it was made by Hasbro for 6 year old girls.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only really ready</li>
            <li> After nearly a year&#x27;s use (which included doing my nails on a weekly basis and family members)</li>
            <li> This lamp worked really well to cure my Madam Glam gel polish, and is made to cure any gel polish that will cure under 12watts...such as Gelish and Red Carpet.</li>
            <li> I used it with ge lush OPI and Essie gel polishes</li>
            <li> Switched from my old UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> No problems so far.</li>
            <li> and sometimes i get so busy</li>
            <li> Still longer than common phone charger cable, so no complaints for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is fuctioning ok, never tried the 90sec or the 30min</li>
            <li> I really like the product, cheaper than the others that were similar.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what you need to dry the your nails faster.</li>
            <li> The first time I did it, I thought everything was supposed to be completely dry, but come to find out through trial and error</li>
            <li> I have not found that 30secs is enough time to dry anything - we always do 90secs just to be sure it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, because the polish is so tacky imprints are still easily made in it and small pieces of fuzz or hair can get stuck to the polish.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is supposedly 12W, it has to be less than my RCM LED light because it does not dry after 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or even 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> Product was very small, it&#x27;s more like mini uv machine...</li>
            <li> Despite others&#x27; reviews of their gel polish not curing, I highly doubt those users were using a bonder prior to application of the base/foundation gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using a mini uv light for my gels for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> If the polish holds up as well as it usually does I will be chucking my UV light in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does last for two weeks, but since I&#x27;m not paying a salon I can afford to change my color weekly and keep my manicure looking new without all the growth showing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough for the whole hand</li>
            <li> There is a major difference in the time it takes to cure gel polish with LED vs. UV lights.</li>
            <li> Still after using UV light hard for me to just use 30 seconds .....</li>
            <li> The lamp was packaged well and is small and light enough for travel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional, and just use this at home for personal use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent over 100 dollars on a uv and needed to upgrade but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much again.</li>
            <li> Used 6 times so far on my nails for both hands and feet with Gelish soak off Gel Polish; only needed to use the 30sec or 60sec settings btwn coats.</li>
            <li> I recently had a gel polish manicure done professionally.</li>
            <li> With the UV I can do an entire french set on myself in under 40 minutes, so with this light I should cut that almost in half!</li>
            <li> If you see reviewers complaining that it didn&#x27;t cure their polish, they have likely used the wrong kind.  </li>
            <li> I had to put it on the 30 minute setting and even then they were not dry.  </li>
            <li> I have bought numerous brands of led nail polishes to see if that was the issue as well as making sure to use thin coats.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get an LED lamp to cut down on setting time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as I did on the CND lamp, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have never written a negative review before but this is a first!</li>
            <li> It is small enough that it can be stored away when not in use, but large enough to do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got the chance to use other brand of SoG, but so far my mani cures well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first few attempts at using this device, she noticed that it took twice as long to dry her nail polish than just using regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and has a decent length on the cord, but it&#x27;s not super long.</li>
            <li> I do agree with the short chord, it&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s maybe 3 feet long.</li>
            <li> Polish seems as hard as it usually does with my UV light.</li>
            <li> how long I had my fingers in it</li>
            <li> I found it did not cure the nails evenly and took a long time.  </li>
            <li> I waited so long to upgrade.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t take as long with a 36w.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to cure the nails and sometimes it never does even if you leave them for a long time.  </li>
            <li> take too long to get dry jel nails</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to purchasing a double wide for my salon!</li>
            <li> This product is not made to dry gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I do not have a lot of time to sit and wait for my nails to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the product so far.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the lights shine down onto the mirrored surfaces in the lamp, so you should learn from my mistake and avoid looking at your nails when you turn the lamp on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the lights don&#x27;t come down on the sides.</li>
            <li> I cannot get my nails to dry with this lamp!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the lamp is too strong and it feels hot--like getting a sun burn in a bad tanning bed--particularly on faster settings, such as 30 to 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink and girly.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> like the 30 and 60 sec timer feature.room for all 5 fingers</li>
            <li> The 30, 60, 90 sec settings do work and cure all my gel polishes within the 30sec time frame.  </li>
            <li> I used with finger paints gel polish and the 30 sec timer and my nails are</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Product works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Item arrived days before expected.  </li>
            <li> I have fluorescent lamp to use with other polishes.  </li>
            <li> pointer through pinky on one hand, pointer through pinky on the other, then both thumbs.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that zero complaints</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s small enough to take on the road with you.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work right, or if my nails would really be dry.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to dry than a pro dryer, but end results are identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I spent $53 on this LED lamp and at their suggestion purchased Orly GelFX primer, base, color, and top coat and spent well over $100 to do gel nails at home all for nothing!</li>
            <li> and I spent way less time.</li>
            <li> I have average sized hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth $99.99.</li>
            <li> but I had to for this because it is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product does not work very well.</li>
            <li> I have used TruGel (Base, Color, Top), and it&#x27;s all 30sec cure time.</li>
            <li> I use OPI Base and top coat and Gelish color.  </li>
            <li> The next day the polish peeled right off :(  </li>
            <li> Gets the job down with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re doing this by yourself, do one hand from start to finish before you start on your other hand!</li>
            <li> Heck I even cheat sometimes and stack one hand over the other to cure both at once!</li>
            <li> Dried each coat for 60 sec and it worked with one shot!</li>
            <li> The lamp is small and therefore, takes up less space (which I am limited on).  </li>
            <li> It took me an hour and a half with the mini uv (30min each hand and 30min for thumbs).</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever gonna need to cure for that long as long as I&#x27;m applying thin coat of gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, unless I am doing something wrong, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s a little wider inside.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a little dust bag for storage.</li>
            <li> Got it sooner than expected!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the buttons to turn on the light beep every time you use them...which gets a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> This LED lamp dried my nails in 30 seconds per coat.  </li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I had to do two base coats because the light does not cure evenly.</li>
            <li> but I usually do my four fingers</li>
            <li> Too small for 5 fingers</li>
            <li> Too small.  </li>
            <li> It works for Gelish polish and no more UV drying.</li>
            <li> Size is too small for one or 2 hands.&lt;br /&gt;Great size for traveling.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a defective piece.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 4 times in this past week</li>
            <li> But you need to cure 4-4-2 fingers and not very good sizing for pedicure.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry unfortunately</li>
            <li> This lamp does the job, cures my hard gel and gel polish</li>
            <li> I would &#x27;highly&#x27; recommend you try this lamp; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The little beep freaks my one dog out for some reason is the only bad thing thing.</li>
            <li> No more watching the clock!</li>
            <li> looked very small inside.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I had a very hard time curing my nails.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I expected the lamp to work on all gel products.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> for the item itself, since I shipped it half way around the world (my carrier using water transport), I was prepared for the worst when it arrives.</li>
            <li> nothing is wrong with it but have not tested it yet!</li>
            <li> Now It is functioning so badly that I cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed in all the video reviews everyone got a cuticle nipper with their purchase, I didn&#x27;t receive one :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this LED lamp.  It fits one hand comfortably for me, curing power seems fine and I&#x27;d have no problem traveling with it if I needed to. With all the functionality (including different timer options), I&#x27;m also very happy with the price I paid for the value.</li>
            <li> I just fall in love with this lamp. I used to have uv lamp, it was time to replace the bulbs and I decided to replace the lamp for something better. And it&#x27;s really much much better, it&#x27;s saving my time and just doing everything perfectly. Plus looks so cute and the size is just perfect!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail light. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;ve had it almost a year with zero problems. I have also recommended to 3 other friends whom have bought it and love it as well. You cannot beat the price for this quality nail light.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly and would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to do their own gel nails, Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Love it</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use. Lots of settings too</li>
            <li> I have this in white. I got it as a Christmas gift and am finally getting to use it for the first time. I was really nervous about it at first. I was so afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work right, or if my nails would really be dry. Well it worked great!! I left my nails in 30 seconds longer than needed, but for a first timer I had to make sure my nails were dry. I absolutely love this dryer, and would recommend it to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> Have used it a couple times, and has worked great so far! Will update in a couple months with how it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Cuticle nippers were not included</li>
            <li> The light worked for Gel nail polish and had good cure time. However, when I used the lamp to cure nails for a gel overlay, it did not work at all and I had to pull out my tried and true UV lamp (not LED). I was disappointed because I expected the lamp to work on all gel products.</li>
            <li> Till know is good work</li>
            <li> Function:&lt;br /&gt;Timer: Works perfectly. I tested the timer against my iPhone timer to make sure it was ACTUALLY 30 seconds since some people seem to complain about. It was exactly 30 seconds, so not sure what they&#x27;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail Polishes: Worked perfectly with Gelish Foundation coat, Meet the King color, and Top it Off top coat. It also worked great with IBD All that Glitters. I just followed the instructions on the back of the bottle for the LED time requirement (all 30 seconds or under).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: All 5 of my fingers fit just fine. I have average sized hands. No issues with thumbs curing funny or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance:&lt;br /&gt;Cute I suppose. It&#x27;s pink and girly. I didn&#x27;t really care about the appearance much, more about function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;Item was well-packed with custom shaped styrofoam. The nail nipper was a nice add-in.</li>
            <li> Works great. I like the preset buttons. My whole hand fits but I usually do my four fingers and then my thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> Came fast! New product</li>
            <li> I love this lamp! Helps my gel polish dry so quickly! I would definitely recommend this to others. um yup</li>
            <li> Fantastic time saver.  Still after using UV light hard for me to just use 30 seconds .....in  my head I think I need more.  It is a bit cramped for whole hand but can be done.  .great space saver!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Works well with the gel products I use (Gelish). It came highly recommended to me and I am glad it purchased it.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t get hot. I use with Gelish!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional, and just use this at home for personal use and it&#x27;s fantastic! I&#x27;ve spent over 100 dollars on a uv and needed to upgrade but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much again. Glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift after buying one for myself.  There is a major difference in the time it takes to cure gel polish with LED vs. UV lights. LED is so much faster... I highly recommend this dryer, as it is affordable and practical.  It is small enough that it can be stored away when not in use, but large enough to do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry unfortunately but my fault always get a higher waltz if you want it to speed up the process</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it! No complaints here.</li>
            <li> This LED lamp works great and fast.  Cures LED gel polish in 30 seconds.  Make sure you buy gel polish that is compatible with LED lamps as some are not.  If you see reviewers complaining that it didn&#x27;t cure their polish, they have likely used the wrong kind.  I&#x27;ve used Gelish and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Can fit your entire hand (including thumb).  Love it!</li>
            <li> I only used it twice with Gelish brand polish and it wouldn&#x27;t cure it no matter how long I had my fingers in it</li>
            <li> Came with all the right parts, big enough to fit hands or feet.</li>
            <li> Nice size. Easy to use. Dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My gel manicures look great &amp; lasts longer than when I went to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;I use GELISH products. : )</li>
            <li> Dries nails really quickly, and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it&#x27;s worked nicely and it&#x27;s very easy. Make sure you use thin coats of polish to make sure it dries completely. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the lights shine down onto the mirrored surfaces in the lamp, so you should learn from my mistake and avoid looking at your nails when you turn the lamp on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick and easy to do my nails. If I need to I can touch them up right before work, or right before bed when I get home (although I rarely have to touch up my nails, the gel stays like a dream!). The lamp also comes with instructions if you haven&#x27;t used gel nail polish before, which I found helpful.</li>
            <li> This works just as described.  The polish stays on for weeks.  The LED is safer then the U V lamps.  This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> works great fits one hand at a time</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! Got it sooner than expected!!!</li>
            <li> This little nail dryer works perfectly. For the price I was skeptical, but I love it. I highly recommend. Never thought I would be able to do my own nails so nicely out of the salon. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Mines didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and tried it immediately!  It worked great on Harmony Gelish polish. I have a high priced UV curing light but decided the exposure to the UV rays wasn&#x27;t a good idea so I wanted to try a LED curing light. I was leary though because this is a third of the price of my UV light and the curing times were much shorter. However, it worked perfectly and the curing times are only 10 seconds for foundation and 30 seconds for all coats after that! That is fantastic compared to 1-2 min per coat with my UV light. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Too small for 5 fingers</li>
            <li> As pictured. As described. Works great with the gel polishes. I love the various timer settings - it makes the gel application that much easier.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Thumbs have to be done separately.  Too small.  Still not convinced that it&#x27;s actually LED and not UV even though it says it is.</li>
            <li> Delivery is very good and to now satisfied with all my orders</li>
            <li> Excellent LED lamp. Used for the first time last night, experimenting with tips and Gelish products. Bought this after reading many reviews. Fits one whole hand in perfectly.  This pic if from the second time using lamp.</li>
            <li> Have used this LED gel nail dryer 3xs...does a good job and is fast&lt;br /&gt;I like the 30 and 60 sec timer feature.room for all 5 fingers alltho I redo my&lt;br /&gt;thumbs to make sure I got the sides. Recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a good size and not bulky.  Does what it is suppose to do.  I have used it 3 times already and is better than the uv lamps</li>
            <li> This unit is a good choice for curing my gelish gel polish. I have purchased led lights before this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Cured the foundation gelish but the gelish red color didn&#x27;t cure it even after 10 min.Brought other led light .</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Technically you CAN fit your thumb in here, but it may or may not cure correctly.  No big deal, we end up doing the thumbs last anyway.</li>
            <li> Great light, works wonderfully, only&lt;br /&gt;Negative is you need to cure thumbs separately. You can put all 5 in, but the thumbs don&#x27;t cure well when they are turned sideways.</li>
            <li> Best LED LAMP! The timer is by far the best for the price. I do gel polish on my nails a lot and this lamp cures my nails faster than my traditional uv lamp. Beautiful design and fast curing time when applying gel. Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> Works well! Love it, great price!</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was ordering. This product is not made to dry gel. Haven&#x27;t found what I need yet.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works , however there is a 30m setting on the lamp that does not work when clicked on.  The 30, 60, 90 sec settings do work and cure all my gel polishes within the 30sec time frame.  I figure i will not be using the 30min setting ever so why complain.  It came packaged nicely with no scratches or dings. Over all I am satisfied with the lamp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this light!! It is a perfect size and isn&#x27;t huge I can fit all 5 figures in but it is tight. I usally do my thumb and then I will do my 4 figures not a big deal!!</li>
            <li> This lamp does the job, cures my hard gel and gel polish just fine. It&#x27;s roomy enough for my big hands and it packs away nicely.&lt;br /&gt; I just wish I could turn off the damn beeping.</li>
            <li> Love this light, Has 30, 60 and 90 second timed setting as well as a 30 minute setting. The lights are on the ceiling of unit only. You can fit your entire hand in at once, but it is tricky to get my thumb to cure (I give my thumbs an additional 30 seconds at the end of my manicure by themselves). I have used this light with OPI gel color, Fingerpaint gel and Red Carpet gels. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> The price is right. It works for Gelish polish and no more UV drying. Saving my skin for a tan :) LOL</li>
            <li> Very good but would have liked a larger opening was hard to get thumb in</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Its exactly what you need to dry the your nails faster.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on another users review.  LOVE IT.  Works amazingly well with Gelish polish (that&#x27;s all I use it for).  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great LED Lamp for the money. I researched to find the best machine for the price. This is it ! I have now done my own gel nails !! I am by far no nail expert, but was successful at my 1st try on my gel nails. I did use top quality gel nail products to start. I did each layer at 60 seconds even though the product packaging said 30 seconds. Buy this !!!</li>
            <li> Works great! really fast</li>
            <li> Works well if you do 4 fingers first and then the thumbs. Light itself works great just not very big</li>
            <li> Great product,  very small and effective.  I&#x27;m using with Harmony Gellish and it&#x27;s a 40 second cure for each layer.  Do thumbs seperalty for success!</li>
            <li> Product was very small, it&#x27;s more like mini uv machine... the person can not fit whole hand inside. You would have to place 4 fingers inside to cure than let the thumb cure alone. It&#x27;s Everyyyy light weight like a feather. It&#x27;s not worth $99.99. The one I bought for $25 is better than this one it&#x27;s just wasn&#x27;t an LED lamp, just uv.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Girlfriend for her birthday. She has been using Gel nail polish for quite some time, so i decided i would get her a second nail dryer thing. (I know, professional term) After the first few attempts at using this device, she noticed that it took twice as long to dry her nail polish than just using regular nail polish. She is using the correct nail gel polish, too. She finally gave up wanting to use the dryer and we returned the product. The device itself feels like it was made by Hasbro for 6 year old girls.</li>
            <li> Cures my polish ok. I wish I would have gotten a stronger led light. My polish chips within a couple days</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Gel polish because my other light wasn&#x27;t working that great.  You have to use with Gel polish or this light won&#x27;t work for you.  I have fluorescent lamp to use with other polishes.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and all 3 times it has worked great.  I do 60 seconds per coat and 2 minutes for the final coat.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Gelish nails.  This LED lamp dried my nails in 30 seconds per coat.  My nails were done in eight minutes (I did my thumbs separate)!  I went back and forth between this lamp and the UV lamps.  Drying time would have been two minutes per coat.  Anything is better than waiting on regular polish to dry on your nails, but 30 seconds is wonderful.  I would recommend this lamp to anyone just starting to use Gelish products!</li>
            <li> After looking at all the reviews, I thought this would be a really good investment. Wrong. I&#x27;ve had this lamp for over a month, and it still does not dry as well as my tiny RCM LED light does. I always give these sort of items room for improvement (user error, etc). This lamp did not improve at all. Even though it is supposedly 12W, it has to be less than my RCM LED light because it does not dry after 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or even 90 seconds. I always end up wiping away a good portion of my polish when I&#x27;m at the cleaning step. Also, my hand does fit in the lamp, but the inside of my thumbs do not dry at all when the whole hand is in there. I have to put my thumbs separately in order for that part to stay on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall? Don&#x27;t bother, ladies. This is the type of product where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for any brand gel polish. Easy to store and use.</li>
            <li> love that this lamp has different time settings.  easy to change and turn on.  love that the cord is detachable for storing</li>
            <li> Love this little unit!! Works perfect have had it for months and have No issues at all. Perfect size for hands and feet!!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but I had to for this because it is not worth the money.  This lamp worked fine for a few weeks and now some of the led lights have gone out and it does not evenly cure, if it cures at all. I have a cheap 9 watt lamp that works better than this! Please save your money and buy something that will last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this lamp!! Most lamps dont fit our thumbs but this one does!! Would FOR SURE recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great with OPIGEL polish and Gelish.  very happy with the product and price point.</li>
            <li> The lamp lasts much to perform proper drying, it is nothing so powerful as the description says. I would like a refund of any part of the article, as it is not as shown.</li>
            <li> It works great, I haven&#x27;t had a single problem. I can fit my full hand in the unit, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting since I have larger hands.</li>
            <li> MelodySusie 2013 12w LED Gel Nail Dryer. Used 6 times so far on my nails for both hands and feet with Gelish soak off Gel Polish; only needed to use the 30sec or 60sec settings btwn coats. Perfect settings for this product. Very even drying on each nail. Inside dimensions are great for my avg/medium length nails; approx comfortable inside space is 5.5&amp;#34; wide by 4.5&amp;#34; deep in center. perfect to put 1 hand in with a little spreading space between fingers; no concern with drying my feet nails. Actual opening on my unit measures 5 1/8th inches then it&#x27;s a little wider inside. Unit is very light weight.</li>
            <li> This works great! The first time I used it, I thought it didn&#x27;t, but it was more my misunderstanding about how Gel nail polish works. Here&#x27;s a tip... take your time as you polish each nail. Try to avoid getting it on your skin/cuticles, but if you do, just wipe it off with your opposite thumb nail (the color wipes off easily from your thumb). Also, if you&#x27;re doing this by yourself, do one hand from start to finish before you start on your other hand! This will just make things easier all around! I have used TruGel (Base, Color, Top), and it&#x27;s all 30sec cure time. The first time I did it, I thought everything was supposed to be completely dry, but come to find out through trial and error, it&#x27;s only really ready once you put a top coat on and cure it - THEN use rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball, and wipe any residue off, just like you&#x27;re wiping polish off. Don&#x27;t worry! You won&#x27;t wipe any color off! I love having this little lamp now!! I was never one to really go an get my nails done because of how costly it is, and I rarely did them at home because regular nail polish only looked good for about 1-2 days for me, and I HATED that! With this little lamp, I will be able to have great looking nails all the time, and save a TON of $$$ by not having to go to a salon!</li>
            <li> Love this light! Fits whole hand. Easy operate!</li>
            <li> I have never written a negative review before but this is a first! I spent $53 on this LED lamp and at their suggestion purchased Orly GelFX primer, base, color, and top coat and spent well over $100 to do gel nails at home all for nothing! I cannot get my nails to dry with this lamp! I have looked at videos, followed their directions, researched from here to kingdom come and it just doesn&#x27;t work! It is going back in the morning!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a defective unit, but I have experimented with the time settings and cannot seem to get a decent curing. I have a UV lamp that cures much better and in around the same time. I used Shellac brand gel polish.</li>
            <li> Perfect light for beautiful manicures at home! I used with finger paints gel polish and the 30 sec timer and my nails are wonderful!I was able to place all five fingers in light as well with no problem! Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this lamp based on the good reviews.  I used it for the 1st time and it took me forever to cure my nails.  Is this 12 watt LED lamp as powerful as a 36 way uv lamp?  Is it comparable?  The reviews said that this lamp is compatible with Gelish nail polish.  Yet, I had a very hard time curing my nails.  So, can anyone shed some light here?  What should be sufficient tine to cure the nails?  I had to put it on the 30 minute setting and even then they were not dry.  I&#x27;m not satisfied with the product so far.  So, unless I am doing something wrong, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the reviews stated.  ok,  I tried it again and I cured each layer only 2 1/2 minutes each time despite how tacky it felt.  Once I put the top coat, cured it, and then wiped it with the cleaner, it felt dry.  Looks much better and I spent way less time.</li>
            <li> You cannot put your whole hand in to cure. Did not cure my gel polish evenly. I don&#x27;t recommend at all</li>
            <li> Works great! I am new to at home gel manicures and bought this based on the positive reviews. I love the timing options and I can comfortably fit all four of my fingers in the unit. I cure my thumb separately. It&#x27;s lightweight and has a decent length on the cord, but it&#x27;s not super long. I can turn the light off by pressing the button again, which is a plus.  June 15, 2016 Update: After nearly a year&#x27;s use (which included doing my nails on a weekly basis and family members) my 30 second button stopped working. I contacted to company to see if I could get a replacement and they quickly fixed my problem and a new one is on its way now. All I had to do was complete a warranty extension (which is located on their website) and they fixed my problem within a few days. I am very happy with their level of customer service!</li>
            <li> No directions on how to change the bulbs if they burn out, but it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I bought this gel nail dryer. It has exceeded my expectations. I have used it with several brands of gel polish and it has always worked great!  I would recommend this dryer to anyone interested in doing gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> Had higher expectations. My cheaper light was stronger.</li>
            <li> This lamp worked really well to cure my Madam Glam gel polish, and is made to cure any gel polish that will cure under 12watts...such as Gelish and Red Carpet. Easy settings to choose from. I love the colors it comes in, too! I did receive this one from the company for review, but my opinions are honest and my experience with the item.</li>
            <li> This lamp works great. The only problem is that the lights don&#x27;t come down on the sides. It&#x27;s big enough for the whole hand but the thumbs are at an angle that they don&#x27;t cure so they have to be done separately. But I do love the lamp otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!! Cures fast and looks cool. Fits entire hand in there.</li>
            <li> Disappointed! Does not cure nails evenly. Mostly requires to cure for 2 minutes, and cures with smudges at times (sort of looks wavy). Hands feel like they are on fire when curing too. This product was too cheap to be true!</li>
            <li> I recently had a gel polish manicure done professionally. I found out I can do these at home myself so I set out to find the perfect curing lamp. My initial search was uv vs led. Led is in My opinion the better choice &amp; this little beauty of a system is phenomenal! It&#x27;s perfect if you are like me &amp; prefer to DIY most things. I like the reflective surface inside.</li>
            <li> love the size, fits whole hand and the price is great for that product but timer is off by 1/2 on each setting, when I contacted seller they wanted me to send it back for service, I won&#x27;t pay for shipping when it is a defective product so will just use 90s setting when using.  other than that they were quick to respond.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had purchased a UV bulb lamp from another company and it was cheap and didn&#x27;t work. I ordered this one the same day and received it this afternoon. The package is full of poorly written english, but it works perfectly. Plug it in, hit the button, ready to go. My only concern is that the bottom of the lamp says to &amp;#34;use the protective goggles provided&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t come with any. I have goggles that I use in the tanning salon, but I&#x27;ve been covering the opening with my free hand when in use, so I don&#x27;t have the rays from the bulbs coming out.</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Size is too small for one or 2 hands.&lt;br /&gt;Great size for traveling. Have to place 4 nails, then the two thumb nails and then the last four nails.&lt;br /&gt;The reflexion of the light does not cover the sides of the thumb nails if you place the entire hand.</li>
            <li> I like it! Tried with Gelish, Ez Flow, Gelaze, Red Carpet - all gel polish were perfectly cured. Recommended for home manicure. But you need to cure 4-4-2 fingers and not very good sizing for pedicure.</li>
            <li> I found it did not cure the nails evenly and took a long time.  The side of the thumbs never would cure properly.  I tried it on several brands of gel polish. I bought a OPI which was expensive but works great!</li>
            <li> I daughters love this and use it all the time. It&#x27;s easy to use and gives amazing results.</li>
            <li> I love it and it excepts all 5 fingers and has adjustments for time drying.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great addition for my home manicures and home pedicures!</li>
            <li> Works great no complaints</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Had it for a few weeks now. And it is being used by everyone in the house and still no problems</li>
            <li> Great light, nails were completely dry after 30 seconds. Can fit whole hand in great.</li>
            <li> Im a licensed cosmetologist who specializes in nails and color services.  This LED light has been very good to me.  I have used name brand &amp; off brand gel polish with no problems.  It even cures my UV top coat.  Fits all 5 fingers/toes for people with normal size digits.</li>
            <li> Very compact yet whole adult hand fits in sturdy</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims; I can fit my entire hand in and am finished with my nails in record time!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a defective piece. I tried to cure my led gel polish multiple times but it just won&#x27;t cure them. I had to go back to my 9 watt lamp which worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to this lamp but had to return it.  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Do not cure the thumbnail  good when doing a whole hand. Have to do the fingers then the thumb by itself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in November of 2014 and tried to return it on February 12 of 2015 but &amp;#34;it was not eligible for return&amp;#34; per amazons website. Over this time I had been trying to like the product and I kept blaming the incomplete curing on my getting accustomed to the lamp. I have bought numerous brands of led nail polishes to see if that was the issue as well as making sure to use thin coats. Nothing has worked and now I am out of the money I paid to purchase this. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Im very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love saving money and this light helped. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Love my new light.....</li>
            <li> I have been using a mini uv light for my gels for the past 3 years.  So glad I upgraded! It took me an hour and a half with the mini uv (30min each hand and 30min for thumbs). But this dryer,  I can fit my whole hand and run each layer for less than 60sec (my first time trying led light and wanted to make sure it dried) entire manicure in less than 30minutes!  I am so excited to finally have time to do my nails again.  I used this with the gelish nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Since I have larger hands it&#x27;s taken a couple of tries to get this to work perfect for me, but it does work just fine as long as I am careful to make sure my nails get light directly from the bulbs as the light reflected from the mirrored surface doesn&#x27;t work for parts of my thumb and pinky that face down when I put my whole hand in. So, I do three stages: pointer through pinky on one hand, pointer through pinky on the other, then both thumbs. I use Gelish system products exclusively for now and I have the best manicure of all the women at the office. It does last for two weeks, but since I&#x27;m not paying a salon I can afford to change my color weekly and keep my manicure looking new without all the growth showing. My best birthday gift to myself ever!</li>
            <li> Gets the job down with no problem.  Economical price.  Fits your entire hand including the thumb.  Very satisfied with price and performance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just okay to use sometimes...&lt;br /&gt;small size is good but 12 watts... take too long to get dry jel nails</li>
            <li> This does not cure the gel polish even after 2 minutes. I think it may be the low wattage. I&#x27;ve looked at others and the wats were 36 and higher, this has only 12.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Quality lamp at a great price!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Has saved me so much money from going to the nail salon!</li>
            <li> Works great! Love it! I do however find that it doesn&#x27;t always cure the thumbs all the way. So I have to cure thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> It okay for home use.</li>
            <li> Love this light for gel nail polish!  The little beep freaks my one dog out for some reason is the only bad thing thing. I would recommend this lamp to anyone who wants to do gel manicures at home  I used it with ge lush OPI and Essie gel polishes and it works great!</li>
            <li> love this.  Works great.  Used it with Gelish &amp; gelaze gel polish.  1st time using led lamp.  Switched from my old UV lamp.  Love this lamp</li>
            <li> I like it except the very bottom edge of the nail when you put ALL five fingers in, doesn&#x27;t cure.  it&#x27;s like the reflective light misses it. Also I noticed in all the video reviews everyone got a cuticle nipper with their purchase, I didn&#x27;t receive one :(</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly and is as was advertised.  This was my first dryer, ordered a second after my daughter took possession of this one.  She likes it, too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to cut down on the curing time but find that 30 sec doesn&#x27;t work w/ most polishes. I have only used this light twice so I am still trying different things to see what works best. My whole hand fits, but the thumb doesn&#x27;t always cure fully and polish comes off when I remove the tacky layer.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! Works as expected. Bought this to replace the flimsy one from my Gelish kit and I regret I waited so long to upgrade. My nails look better than if I went to the salon.  I knew the lights were strong when my gel polish got warm under the lights! The cost is reasonable. Cord is a decent length but I find it works better attached to an extension cord.</li>
            <li> I just started using China glaze gelaze and this lamp works great!</li>
            <li> Works great! I gave this item a four because you do have to cure twice one you apply foundation and color @ 90min. This is only a 12w lamp. It wouldn&#x27;t take as long with a 36w.  Other than that, the product does what it says, and the nail nipper as a nice touch to include!  It was delivered in a timely manner, so I do  recommend t his product!!</li>
            <li> Received on time.  Product works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Wanted an LED vs UV for sun damage. Very compact does great job drying nails quickly. Would recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Gelish products. Love this little lamp. Perfect!</li>
            <li> After doing quite a bit of research, I chose this model. I used it once, and was successful in giving myself my first ever gel pedicure (my foot fit fine). However, when I unplugged it, one of the prongs broke off in my outlet. I have not been able to find the correct replacement adaptor (unusual size), so I guess I&#x27;ll have to try to return it. I&#x27;m disappointed. For the price, the adapter should have been better quality.</li>
            <li> Bought to use with Shebanails gelcrylic system and it works super well super fast. I plan to test it out with gelish polish soon so I will update this review but for now it does what I need it to so that&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this lamp. It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> After about six months the mirror on the sides became worn out and no longer cured the nails on the sides. Good for use on toes if you do pedicures.</li>
            <li> Product is good for the price. The only thing I would warn that make sure your thumbs and pinkies are pointing upwards for drying or else it will not fully dry or will lift.</li>
            <li> I own a salon-grade UV lamp (36W) for home use and the curing time (60s-120s in between each coat) was just not cutting it for me. Also, I did not like the fact that I had to re-purchase the bulbs a couple of times a year! Enough was enough and I decided to order an LED lamp. I did some research and I decided to purchase this particular LED lamp. Despite others&#x27; reviews of their gel polish not curing, I highly doubt those users were using a bonder prior to application of the base/foundation gel. This LED lamp works and works well and efficiently. I use Gelish, Fingerpaints and IBN gel polishes and they&#x27;ve all cured like a charm! I also like how lightweight and compact it is so it makes storing a breeze. I highly recommended this LED lamp for your gel manicure needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you have problems curing your thumb, put your thumb on top of your index finger so it may cure efficiently.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and love it. I read that some buyers said they didnt get the nippers, however mine did include them. Also, my hands were able to fit in, all 5 fingers at once, several buyers said they couldn&#x27;t, the only way I think you would g be a me to is if you have really long fingers. Even if you did have to do thumbs separately it cures them so fast it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Had to change me review because this just broke. Went to turn it on and...nothing. It&#x27;s cheap but I&#x27;d still expect it to last longer than it did considering I use it once a month at most. Would probably advise spending a bit more for something better.</li>
            <li> best idea ever. It will save you so much on manicures!</li>
            <li> love it! works great! you do not need to go and spend hundreds of dollars for at home gel mani&#x27;s. Great product!</li>
            <li> Works well. Only thing is I have to do my thumbs separate.</li>
            <li> This is great for doing at home regular or gel manicures. No problems so far. I like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this !&lt;br /&gt;i wanted to buy my own LED lamp so save me some $$$ instead of having to go back every 2 weeks to  a salon and sometimes i get so busy i go so long without being able to go into a salon.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, this is AMAZING it&#x27;s small so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space but big enough to fit your whole hand. and the 30sec. works so well, ( i use GELISH gel nail polish ) is sets in 30sec. it goes perfect with this lamp. and you can buy the gelish nail polish on amazon too SO BUNDLE ! its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the timer. No more watching the clock!</li>
            <li> I just love this LED lamp; it is so easy to use and does everything for you.  The timer is accurate and goes off automatically when time is up.  The lamp is small and therefore, takes up less space (which I am limited on).  The lamp is made well, is pretty to look at and works like a charm. And, there is more than enough room inside this lamp for all 4 fingers at once and some wiggle room too.  I really like that feature as some lamps I viewed looked very small inside.  I would &#x27;highly&#x27; recommend you try this lamp; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love my MelodySusie lamp it&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> I purchased this light after I found out I was not allergic to gel nail color !!!! It is excellent ! Has an accurate timer with 4 time selections ! I love this light !</li>
            <li> Item arrived days before expected.  Product is awesome and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and great price. Works awesome for my gelish Polish!</li>
            <li> I am using this led dryer to cure the OPI gel polishes. It is working wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I live in south east asia and I ordered mine to be delivered to Sarasota, Florida. From there it goes with shipping to my country. The delivery to florida was on schedule, so kudos for the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the item itself, since I shipped it half way around the world (my carrier using water transport), I was prepared for the worst when it arrives. But fortunately this lamp survives the shipment and it works well. I&#x27;ve been using it 4 times in this past week (yes, I change my mani quite often!) for my hands and feet. It fits just fine inside this lamp, no need to cure thumb separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;m using nail polish that requires lamp for curing so I don&#x27;t have any comparison. But this lamp does what it says, it cures gelish. Haven&#x27;t got the chance to use other brand of SoG, but so far my mani cures well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people complaining about the cord length, but I think it&#x27;s not that short at all! Still longer than common phone charger cable, so no complaints for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is fuctioning ok, never tried the 90sec or the 30min but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever gonna need to cure for that long as long as I&#x27;m applying thin coat of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great to do gel nails.</li>
            <li> Very good lamp, I be been doing shilac at home for the past year, save so much money instead of going to the salon, definitely worth to buy, and the size is excellent, my whole hand fits in it!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those who are short on space and want to do gel manicures quickly 30 seconds LED \\&quot;cure time\\&quot; vs 2 min UV \\&quot;cure time\\&quot; It is very light and easy to carry around, works very well with Gelish and LeChat gel, I do suggest, that you look at your gel polishes to make sure that they are LED curable.  True there is enough space for all five fingers but if you find your thumb is not curing properly..I suggest you put in your thumb alone.</li>
            <li> Satisfactory on all counts including timely delivery. Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> This lamp is truly a step up from the ones you buy at a drugstore. There&#x27;s different timing buttons on the top that you can press (as topcoats and colors cure at different rates). It also fits a full hand or foot while most drugstore ones are much smaller.</li>
            <li> Works great do far! Love how compact it is! Very nice for grabbing on the go and throwing my purse!</li>
            <li> Nail polish looks great and easy to use! would highly recommend the gel polish and the LED light. so easy</li>
            <li> I love This Lamp! It dried my China glaze Gelaze quickly! Led is way better and faster than UV. Although This one doesnt have the LED along the sides(only on top) but it has mirrors that quickly dry every corner of the nail. I wish i could have checked the size of it first but its ok i can keep this mini lamp for personal use. Im looking forward to purchasing a double wide for my salon! So far Melodysusie Impressed me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was within 3 days!</li>
            <li> I use this for gel manicures, it works great.  Not as powerful as a pro dryer, but what do you expect for the price?  It pays for itself in a just a couple uses.  Takes a little longer to dry than a pro dryer, but end results are identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  don&#x27;t expect to fit your whole hand in here unless you have tiny hands.  I do left hand fingers, right hand fingers, then both thumbs together.</li>
            <li> I bought this version because your whole hand can fit in at once instead of doing the thumbs separately.  You can also do your toes!  I have not found that 30secs is enough time to dry anything - we always do 90secs just to be sure it&#x27;s dry.  But the timer feature is awesome as well so you don&#x27;t have to keep track yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, works like a charm! Perfectly cures gel polish in 60 seconds! I do agree with the short chord, it&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s maybe 3 feet long. Other than that zero complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea why some are saying they can&#x27;t fit their whole hand in, mine fits just fine with rim to spare. Heck I even cheat sometimes and stack one hand over the other to cure both at once!</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s pretty and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It&#x27;s pretty for manicuring, and made drying time a lot easy.</li>
            <li> Great product, and easy to use! Kids loved it</li>
            <li> Works great, 30 seconds is all it takes to cure.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, cheaper than the others that were similar. can reccommend to others who may be interested.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp. I have used the CND UV lamp for years, and love it, but don&#x27;t love how long it takes to set. I wanted to get an LED lamp to cut down on setting time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as I did on the CND lamp, so I decided to give this a try. This lamp is nice and light weight and a lot more compact than my other lamp. It sets the nails just as well as a hight priced lamp. My only gripe is the rather flimsy cord, however, it&#x27;s replacable and wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a replacement if ever this one decids to give out.</li>
            <li> Love that you can do a whole hand at a time.</li>
            <li> First led/uv lamp I&#x27;ve tried.  Mirror wipes clean with a damp paper towel.  Everything appears to cure in the right amount of time.  I&#x27;ve used it with Sensationail, following their cure times; Red Carpet, following their cure times; Bundle Monster, guessing at cure times but using shorter suggested times, and Fingerpaints, 30-60 seconds per coat.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works well, and compact in size.  Although it is small, it&#x27;s plenty large enough to allow a whole hand, including thumbs, to fit in the opening.  There are various time settings available.  Well priced and does a great job.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I used it this morning to re-do 3 of my black french tips that had peeled (had been on a while) and it worked great! 30 seconds per coat....imagine that! Polish seems as hard as it usually does with my UV light. With the UV I can do an entire french set on myself in under 40 minutes, so with this light I should cut that almost in half! So far, I really like it. If the polish holds up as well as it usually does I will be chucking my UV light in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I am not a professional, I just do my own fingers and toes since I refuse to pay $35 for gelish/shellac at a salon, plus they take forever, and the polish peels (probably because their lights are worn out) and when it peels I can&#x27;t just simply fix it myself. So - I cannot give a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; opinion, but for me this thing is working great so far!</li>
            <li> Great LED Lamp! Its light very light wait, a good size for the whole hand. Does not take up too much on the table so convenient to use. Does not get hot like the UV lamps do. Works all my gel polishes.  Almost everything cures in 30s (with the exception of some nail art where I do 45s. Only con for me is that it does not have the 15s setting (for nail art), otherwise my favorite Lamp!</li>
            <li> We looked a several LED lamps.  This one had a great reviews and really good price.  We have used quite a bit in last two months and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love this light. It is easy to use and perfect for nails.</li>
            <li> This lamp worked great for setting gel nails. Much faster than the UV lamp I had. Great Lamp for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this light. It works perfectly and I can fit all fingers and thumb inside with room to spare yet it&#x27;s small enough to take on the road with you.</li>
            <li> I like this lamp! It is plenty big enough for a hand or foot to easily fit- and it has worked great with both Gelish and SensatioNail gel polishes.</li>
            <li> The LED light lamps are not as good as the UV.  The next day the polish peeled right off :(  I shipped the light back.</li>
            <li> Great light, works great. For the price, its a steal. Go for it, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to cure the nails and sometimes it never does even if you leave them for a long time.  I would recommend a lamp with higher watts.</li>
            <li> I love this lamp! It&#x27;s perfect for using at home! I&#x27;ve only used gelish products with it but I love the results!</li>
            <li> The only positive attribute this item has is that it is large enough for your entire hand to fit in.  Unfortunately, the product does not work very well. I had each hand inside of the machine for 5 minutes and the polish still did not set. After you have had your hand inside the machine, even for 5 minutes, the gel polish is still very tacky. The machine sets only the top of the polish and the polish next to the nail does not set.  This causes wave-like ripples or smudges in the polish.  Additionally, because the polish is so tacky imprints are still easily made in it and small pieces of fuzz or hair can get stuck to the polish.  I bought this because I do not have a lot of time to sit and wait for my nails to dry.  Additionally, the lamp is too strong and it feels hot--like getting a sun burn in a bad tanning bed--particularly on faster settings, such as 30 to 60 seconds.  If you are prepared to spend around $20 a bottle for gel polish do yourself a favor and invest in a much nicer product.  I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this LED lamp.  I purchased to use for myself at home. Although my entire hand fits, I still do my thumb separate because I noticed that the side of my thumb wasnt curing properly.  I also do it for 60 seconds, and it works so good!!! Perfect for pedicures as well! Definitely recommend if you want to do this at home on your own.  You save so much money!! Just takes time and patience!</li>
            <li> So far I love it it works nothing is wrong with it but have not tested it yet! Will post back with my thoughts   So after me using it several times as i go to cosmetology school. The lights quit working, and it didn&#x27;t cure all types of polishes which is upsetting. I spent good money on it and it didn&#x27;t even last a month... I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, this one is already on the curb for pick up...</li>
            <li> Used with gellish basics set and red carpet nail color. Dried each coat for 60 sec and it worked with one shot! Didn&#x27;t try it at the 30sec since I was short on time and wanted to be sure it was done in one shot. Love that my whole hand fits so that saves time. Wish it came with a little dust bag for storage. Using one that came with a pair shoes and that works fine. Great item!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So cute and portable!</li>
            <li> Excellent value-works very quickly and all of my fingers fit perfectly so individual nails not required.  I use OPI Base and top coat and Gelish color.  Item came securely packed and  prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot, ir really cures gel un 30 seconds but it is not true that you can cure 5 fingers, I mean you can put them inside perfectly but the thomb doesn&#x27;t cure evenly so I have to put it another 30 seconds. However it is so fast, compared to a uv lamp.</li>
            <li> The lamp was packaged well and is small and light enough for travel.  It also gave me a great gel pedicure!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> this is the best for drying nails  90 seconds and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the polish running</li>
            <li> awesome results i love this product</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Get it! After much research, I&#x27;m glad I purchased a reasonably priced LED curing light.</li>
            <li> I love this item,  It works great and just the right size.  I can fit all 5 fingers under the light at one time</li>
            <li> Great value!  Works great with Gelish polishes!</li>
            <li> I have to do my thumbs separately or otherwise one side of the thumb will not cure.  Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> This item has never worked well.  Now It is functioning so badly that I cannot use it.  The edges of my nails do not get the light to cure the polish.  I have not changed anything in the process.  I will be contacting the manufacturer.  I hope they are receptive to replacing it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a 36W UV light, and a MelodySusie 6W LED light.  This blows them both out of the water...It&#x27;s awesome!  Since I&#x27;ve had it, I haven&#x27;t had ANY gel lifting problems, after 3 weeks on each of several different manicures.  I love this, and would DEFINITELY buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, though...I don&#x27;t like that the buttons to turn on the light beep every time you use them...which gets a little annoying.  However, for its awesome performance, I can overlook a little annoyance.</li>
            <li> In order to get my gelish foundation to cute I had to light 30sec then alcohol then light another 30sec then apply a second coat and repeat. I had to do two base coats because the light does not cure evenly. Eventually figured out how to get results with this light but not convienient at all. I would recommend saving up for a better quality light.</li>
