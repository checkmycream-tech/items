            <li> Using just a little, your hair gets shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Takes the frizz out of your hair and leaves it smooth and shiny!  My hair has color added and I use a straight iron on it, so after using this product my hair is smooth and soft not dry or brittle.  I have tried other products  that say they leave your hair smooth,but instead are too harsh and dry out your hair.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that!  GREAT PRODUCT!!!  I only wish it cost less!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it.  I get compliments on how shiny and beautiful my blond/now white hair is.  I like the product even more when I can order it from Amazon at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> Definitely adds moisture to my hair and also some styling capabilities so my hair looks great when I use this stuff.</li>

            <li> I started to exclusively buy organic hair products this year, but I haven&#x27;t found anything that can replace this Redken product!  It gives my hair outrageous shine, and my hair feels wonderful from when I first dry and brush my hair in the morning until I jump into the shower later in the evening.  I swim in a chlorinated pool every other day, so my hair isn&#x27;t in very good condition at all, but this product helps in keeping it manageable.  -starlightjulian.yelp.com</li>
