            <li>I am delighted with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Too smelly!!&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as Angel&#x27;s Essence oil.</li>
            <li>I love Egyptian Musk and this is the best by far that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again and again, because I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing  Egyptian Musk oil for many years.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten so many compliments on my fragrant as I have gotten with this.  </li>
            <li>My sister who is now deceased bought this oil for me years ago and to this day is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I guess I will use it as a burning oil if its not to strong.</li>
            <li>It has a soft but pointed smell that anyone would find pleasant.</li>
            <li>, I will order again, when its available</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this cheap fragrance/oil to any soul...</li>
            <li>And this is NOT the original scent of Egyptian musk.</li>
            <li>Excellent , this product is exactly what I wanted, the smell was dead on its scent.....</li>
            <li>I have difficulty finding true Egyptian musk.</li>
            <li>for some reason the first bottle i got was fine.</li>
            <li>no where near what the original one smells like,I could of saved my money went to a Dollar Store and received better results.</li>
            <li>Overall I would probably buy this again because to be totally honest</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking at right now.</li>
            <li>can tell you right now if you bought my first purchase as a starter, you would want to upgrade to this one.</li>
            <li>the first one i bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase a 3rd one to see if it&#x27;s better than my first 2</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dare leaving my house with this scent on smelling like cheap perfume if only I knew Egyption musk oil would become distinct Lord</li>
            <li>the first one is the Civet blend and it has this fleeting high note that comes and goes throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Is there any company out here who sells the Real Deal Egyption</li>
            <li>knows I would&#x27;ve stocked up years ago from the Muslum guys selling the real deal..</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the closest to the real thing I&#x27;ve had in awhile.</li>
            <li>But for what I paid for it, and the fact that it&#x27;s 4 whole ounces, it&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a cheap plastic bottle (it was shown in a glass bottle with a nice lid) and the fragrance is so weak I can barely tell it is Egyptian Musk.</li>
            <li>I never new real musk oil smelled so clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a fantastic deal for not very much money at all.</li>
            <li>A nice thick oil to work with</li>
            <li>I also mix it with a small vaseline container thats already 1/4 used (for easy mixing purposes) to extend its use.</li>
            <li>The reason why I like Egyptian must is because it is classic and the scent of the oil is strong and long lasting even in small amounts.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but not very strong or long lasting like the other EM  </li>
            <li>The scent is not exactly what I thought it would be (not strong enough) but it will be fine.  </li>

            <li> Very difficult to know smell through the internet. :)</li>
            <li> It was what I expected..</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was different from the usual Egyptian Musk.  </li>
            <li> However i then ordered it again, and gave me and the other people</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> the civet blend is lighter in color and just a tad less viscous.</li>
            <li> Last all day,  Remember a little dab will do !!!</li>

            <li> The oil  was placed in a plastic bottle inside a zip lock bag that was too small.</li>
            <li> the base is not as subtle but just subtle enough that passing by people especially co-workers, they&#x27;ll notice but won&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Also it is way too thick to wear as a perfume, which is what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> Too thick!  </li>
            <li> It is a rip-off...</li>
            <li> Poor quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was told that it was an unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this egpytion</li>
            <li> Musk Oil please let me know,I&#x27;m so disgusted with this</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very disappointed with this egpytion musk oil no where near what the original one smells like,I could of saved my money went to a Dollar Store and received better results. Is there any company out here who sells the Real Deal Egyption Musk Oil please let me know,I&#x27;m so disgusted with this now it&#x27;s only used as a oil burner around the house I wouldn&#x27;t dare leaving my house with this scent on smelling like cheap perfume if only I knew Egyption musk oil would become distinct Lord knows I would&#x27;ve stocked up years ago from the Muslum guys selling the real deal..</li>
            <li> This oil has no fragrance in the bottle or on the skin. It is a ripp off and should not be sold.</li>
            <li> the product was not as described and has no fragrance whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again and again, because I love the scent.  It is wonderful. I am delighted with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Too thick!  No smell!</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast.  The scent is not exactly what I thought it would be (not strong enough) but it will be fine.  Very difficult to know smell through the internet. :)</li>
            <li> When I received the product, it was not in a glass bottle but in one that is plastic.  The fragrance was different from the usual Egyptian Musk.  When I wore it I was told that it was an unpleasant odor (while I was at work!!).</li>
            <li> for some reason the first bottle i got was fine. However i then ordered it again, and gave me and the other people i got it for RASH. It came in a different bottle. I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing  Egyptian Musk oil for many years. I have difficulty finding true Egyptian musk. And this is NOT the original scent of Egyptian musk. I am unsure of what this is. It is not in a glass bottle like it is pictured, which helps to preserve the scent. The shipping wasn&#x27;t done with care. The oil  was placed in a plastic bottle inside a zip lock bag that was too small. Oil spilled in the envelope and all over he bottle. Will not be purchasing in the future. I guess I will use it as a burning oil if its not to strong.</li>
            <li> Egyptain Musk have been an musk of choice in our family of men. An will be for years to come...</li>
            <li> I like to burn this oil and have the scent go throughout my home. It has a soft but pointed smell that anyone would find pleasant.</li>
            <li> This scent is NOT what I anticipated!!! Was delivered with in the 4 days. The scent is not at all what I was use to getting at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> This is not the quality I desired.  I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a cheap plastic bottle (it was shown in a glass bottle with a nice lid) and the fragrance is so weak I can barely tell it is Egyptian Musk. Also it is way too thick to wear as a perfume, which is what I purchased it for. I&#x27;m extremely unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Egyptian musk!!! I get tons of compliments when I wear it, I will order again, when its available</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 different egyptian musk oil from 2 different sellers on amazon. the first one i bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Egyptian-Civet-Imported-Natural-Cosmetics/dp/B009BXCVAE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1406042389&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;egyptian+musk+oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the second is this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you right now if you bought my first purchase as a starter, you would want to upgrade to this one. the first one is the Civet blend and it has this fleeting high note that comes and goes throughout the day. I also mix it with a small vaseline container thats already 1/4 used (for easy mixing purposes) to extend its use. the civet blend is lighter in color and just a tad less viscous. this musk is actually deeper and richer in color almost like the star rating colour you&#x27;re looking at right now. and it&#x27;s thicker. the base is not as subtle but just subtle enough that passing by people especially co-workers, they&#x27;ll notice but won&#x27;t mind. it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; type of smell. It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;mmmmmm&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only bought the 1oz just in case I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m going to purchase a 3rd one to see if it&#x27;s better than my first 2 so i&#x27;ll be returning to update soon.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected..although to me it seems it may have been cut just a little. Overall I would probably buy this again because to be totally honest it&#x27;s the closest to the real thing I&#x27;ve had in awhile.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not very strong or long lasting like the other EM  I&#x27;ve bought in the last 20 years.  But for what I paid for it, and the fact that it&#x27;s 4 whole ounces, it&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent , this product is exactly what I wanted, the smell was dead on its scent.....I&#x27;d recommend this company if u like oils........</li>
            <li> I have never gotten so many compliments on my fragrant as I have gotten with this.  I love Egyptian Musk and this is the best by far that I have ever purchased.  A little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> A nice thick oil to work with</li>
            <li> Got this for my roommate and it smells great on her and it&#x27;s a fantastic deal for not very much money at all.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this cheap fragrance/oil to any soul... It is a rip-off... No claim to fame... I am sending it back... The seller needs to know that there are connoisseur of this stuff-Ships from and sold by NPS - Bottles - Fragrances - Supplies.</li>
            <li> The reason why I like Egyptian must is because it is classic and the scent of the oil is strong and long lasting even in small amounts. The Egyptian musk I purchased from Hairsofly just does not make the cut. Neither does the African musk. Their Kush, China Musk, Frankincense, Arabian Sandalwood are awesome.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Great quality and smell.  Get compliments that I smell great and I can&#x27;t smell it at all as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> Poor quality! The scent is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and I cannot wear it. Too smelly!!&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as Angel&#x27;s Essence oil.</li>
            <li> My sister who is now deceased bought this oil for me years ago and to this day is my all time favorite. I get compliments all the time when i wear it and feels shes around me when I do. Last all day,  Remember a little dab will do !!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. One drop under each arm and it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I have never smelled anything like it. I never new real musk oil smelled so clean.</li>
