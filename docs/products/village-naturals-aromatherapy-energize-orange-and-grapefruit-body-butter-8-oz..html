            <li>After using this body butter the first time I fell in love with if.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like an orange nice soft scent</li>
            <li>, I decided to try Orange and Grapefruit and am glad I did, same creamy texture going on, same smooth and silky feel, and the added Grapefruit makes this body butter the best I&#x27;ve tried and will definitely order again when this runs out.</li>
            <li>I discovered this body butter at WalMart the first time, but when I went back for more, I couldn&#x27;t find it any more.</li>
            <li>The smell Is perfect, it&#x27;s just the right amount of sweetness; not overwhelming and the citrus is energizing and stimulating, making this stuff really give me a fresh mind.</li>

            <li>I have used many different brands and flavors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also edible and keeps your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>this lotion does leave your skin extremely soft the smell is fantastic</li>
            <li>Have used many different shea and body butters over the years</li>
            <li>Compared to many other body butters, this one absorbs quickly on your skin.  </li>

            <li>This has that kind of citrusy smell, but it&#x27;s weak compared to The Body Shop&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>Only issue is that it does not leave my skin real hydrated.</li>
            <li>Very thick and good moisturizer, but has a bitter smell to it.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves your skin moisturized and soft, especially if you live in a dry area.</li>

            <li> Okay product.  Works fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite body butter I&#x27;ve ever tried. The price is around the $5 mark. It has a nice, thick consistency to it. It hydrates my skin &amp; softens scars I have. The smell is fantastic. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the aroma of orange and grapefruit, originally I was looking for Orange body butter but didn&#x27;t find any , I decided to try Orange and Grapefruit and am glad I did, same creamy texture going on, same smooth and silky feel, and the added Grapefruit makes this body butter the best I&#x27;ve tried and will definitely order again when this runs out.</li>

            <li> I Love it but not the price.</li>
            <li> I discovered this body butter at WalMart the first time, but when I went back for more, I couldn&#x27;t find it any more. I was disppointed until it dawned on me to go online.  It comes in other scents but the orange and grapefruit is the best and, for me, it&#x27;s far superior to lotions. It lasts longer and the fresh scent lasts, too.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy texture but lacking in scent.  So looking forward to orange and grapefruit aroma...my favorites.  This product does not deliver.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body moisturizer for dry skin.  Compared to many other body butters, this one absorbs quickly on your skin.  The citrus fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> For those of you who has very dry skin this product is great. After using this body butter the first time I fell in love with if. My skin is very soft and no longer dry. You must try this. Love Love Love</li>

            <li> Love this body butter. Great for dry skin and the fragrance is marvelous. Not overpowering, and very pleasant, could be used by men or women.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be as good as The Body Shop&#x27;s body butters.  The consistency isn&#x27;t nearly as smooth and moisturizing.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.  I love pink grapefruit, lemon and orange fragrances.  This has that kind of citrusy smell, but it&#x27;s weak compared to The Body Shop&#x27;s version.  I was hoping to get something really similar to Body Shop body butter at a lower price, but I guess I&#x27;ll return to the pricier stuff.  I&#x27;m using it up, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> Love the product as it is not greasy yet keeps your skin moisturized. It arrived on time &amp; in excellent condition.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Smells great smooth and creamy.  Fragrance is not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;What more can be said but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that makes your skin very smooth and silky.  If you are looking for a natural product that really works, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I work in an office where the air conditioning is on blast.  This product kept my skin from feeling tight at work.</li>
