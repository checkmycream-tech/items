            <li>Great shampoo.</li>

            <li>Most awesome shampoo ever for a girl IMO!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo feels good once you apply it.</li>
            <li>but, it is good snot (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li>It also smells so good.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Love the way this feels &amp; smells!</li>
            <li>A great shampoo for hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, non-stripping, smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves have feeling moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Honest review.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, Aunt Jackie had me hooked for a couple months, but once I decided to splurge on my hair with Miss Jessie&#x27;s I have not looked back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice and has the most unique texture that I have ever experienced in a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is a good clarifying shampoo, but note that as a true clarifying shampoo it has sulfate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to wash the top of my hair, then get more to do my scalp to get a really good clean</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li>like the cleansing lotion better.</li>
            <li>and I am able to pre-detangle my hair with my fingers as I wash it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for cleaning my hair without stripping and without buildup.</li>
            <li>even the 8 oz bottle lasts for longer than most shampoos.</li>
            <li>I just love this shampo.</li>
            <li>The smell and slip are okay, and I do feel that it cleansed my hair well,</li>
            <li>The texture is... interesting.</li>
            <li>I use with many of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Relaxed and transitioning ladies will love Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo....</li>
            <li>Otherwise another product may be better.</li>
            <li>But with this I was able to comb my fingers through without them being snagged in my hair.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started this my hair has grown so much more, is able to retain great amounts of length, and is much stronger than it used to be.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li>No struggling, no hair snapping off in the teeth of the comb, no yanking, no sobbing :-)</li>
            <li>Love Miss Jessies products and this shampoo works wonders.</li>
            <li>This product works more like a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am in love and can&#x27;t stop telling people about this stuff</li>
            <li>My hair is looking better</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, really does leave your hair clean, without stripping</li>
            <li>I have baby fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>, I feel it&#x27;s also important to let you all know that I am on a no heat, no comb regimen.</li>
            <li>and I am buying the full size bottle right now!!</li>
            <li>It suds up on the first wash, is gentle, lightly scented and it feels so good in your hands.  </li>
            <li>yummy, slick, and soapy, the best shampoo I have  ever used.</li>
            <li>rich in moisture</li>
            <li>This is the first detangling shampoo I&#x27;ve used and its ok.</li>
            <li>Sure if you have other type of hair, I&#x27;m sure you can use it and benefit, too, but I&#x27;m specifically talking to the 4b&#x27;s and 4c&#x27;s because of my own hair type.</li>
            <li>but if you want a great detangling shampoo, I have had success with this with my daughter&#x27;s fine, long, curly hair along with the Miss Jessie Creme de la Creme conditioner and Leave In Condish.</li>
            <li>Do a repeat just to feel that clean again.  </li>
            <li>I feel my hair gets clean</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and clean without feeling stripped of its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Really lathers and makes your hair feel clean :)</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for my thick, curly/kinky hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s has never detangled so quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Super Slip.</li>
            <li>Super Sudsy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, very easily breakable hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, get&#x27;s my hair clean and my natural curls do not tangle!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s slippery, creamy, sudsy and really makes my hair fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair is tangle free and so much softer after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair clean, moisturized, soft &amp; easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>I love this lines styling gels but have not had equal love for the whole line.  </li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
            <li>I have natural type 4zzzz hair :-)</li>
            <li>Not tear free, but for older children, really fun.  </li>
            <li>As I said in my review of the Creme de la Creme conditioner, I love love the product for my long, very curly hair as it is not weighty.</li>
            <li>Left my hair so easy to comb!</li>
            <li>buy sample sizes before you commit to the large tub!</li>
            <li>Does not sud up a ton but does not dry my hair out like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>Surpassed my expectations and does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>For the first time in awhile It is soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>PLUS I bought it expecting it to be cruelty free like pillow soft curls</li>
            <li>What was once just wet hair is now bouncy and full of life with a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it, now I&#x27;ll be a regular buyer!</li>
            <li>But this is the only product that makes my hair super soft and detangle easily.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos make your hair feel dry and you can&#x27;t comb through your hair.</li>
            <li>It has enough slip that you feel like you&#x27;re getting clean on the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchase again because a good shampoo is hard to come by.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle and I could even detangle with it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, with this product I don&#x27;t need to use much of it and it keeps my hair moisturized while also cleansing,</li>
            <li>Yes, it is pricey but you really don&#x27;t need much per shampoo.</li>
            <li>This really detangles</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m ready to give it away to someone.</li>
            <li>I really like Miss Jessie&#x27;s products a lot.</li>
            <li>The texture is very slippery, but my hair is still tangled afterwards.</li>
            <li>IMO, we kinky haired ladies don&#x27;t really NEED combs, we just need to detangle.</li>
            <li>It melted my tangles away like butter, my hair and scalp were very clean and my hair was soft soft soft.</li>
            <li>Smells great, breaks down heavy product buildup &amp; leaves my hair very soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Since my natural hair journey started, I&#x27;ve tried several reputable products (Aunt Jackie&#x27;s, Taliah Wahjid, Curly Girl, etc) and out of all of the others, the only thing worth the money was Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Though I tried many other brands, this one really does wonders on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleanser that leaves my hair really soft</li>
            <li>Suds very well and leaves hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the key to growing long healthy hair for me; even my hair dresser noticed my healthier hair.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the extra money you pay for hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo because I only need a dime amount( my hair is short and curly) and it lathers my whole head.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and soft ready for conditioner and other products.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair soft which is RARE for a shampoo but its way too pricey for the tiny amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today after taking out my braids, and the knots and tangles simply melted away!!!</li>
            <li>I use this product regularly &amp; as usual, I&#x27;m pleased w/ this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great if you have crazy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and takes the frizz away</li>
            <li>Ii really snaps back the curls for me and DOES NOT STRIP OR FEEL STRIPED.</li>
            <li>That is a big plus in a shampoo, It&#x27;s apart of my once a week regimen and it s gentle to my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Try the shea moistures line if you want moisture, slip, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a detangling shampoo that leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it is so thick and slippery</li>
            <li>I only use it every other shampoo, or so, but it always leaves my hair clean but soft.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, curly hair not sure I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on a lot of products over the years, but the first time I used this shampoo, I knew I had a winner.  </li>
            <li>What I do like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair too much.</li>
            <li>recommend for all hair types, mine is straight and loose curls.</li>
            <li>Usually regular shampoo makes my hair really dry which requires me to use twice as much conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, curly hair that usually doesn&#x27;t require much maintenance other than serious moisturizer and detangler.</li>

            <li> It melted my tangles away like butter, my hair and scalp were very clean and my hair was soft soft soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great, breaks down heavy product buildup &amp; leaves my hair very soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Since my natural hair journey started, I&#x27;ve tried several reputable products (Aunt Jackie&#x27;s, Taliah Wahjid, Curly Girl, etc) and out of all of the others, the only thing worth the money was Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Though I tried many other brands, this one really does wonders on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that leaves my hair really soft</li>
            <li> Suds very well and leaves hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the key to growing long healthy hair for me; even my hair dresser noticed my healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Its well worth the extra money you pay for hair care products.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo because I only need a dime amount( my hair is short and curly) and it lathers my whole head.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and soft ready for conditioner and other products.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair soft which is RARE for a shampoo but its way too pricey for the tiny amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today after taking out my braids, and the knots and tangles simply melted away!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly &amp; as usual, I&#x27;m pleased w/ this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great if you have crazy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and takes the frizz away</li>
            <li> Ii really snaps back the curls for me and DOES NOT STRIP OR FEEL STRIPED.</li>
            <li> That is a big plus in a shampoo, It&#x27;s apart of my once a week regimen and it s gentle to my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Try the shea moistures line if you want moisture, slip, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a detangling shampoo that leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it is so thick and slippery</li>
            <li> I only use it every other shampoo, or so, but it always leaves my hair clean but soft.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, curly hair not sure I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on a lot of products over the years, but the first time I used this shampoo, I knew I had a winner.  </li>
            <li> What I do like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair too much.</li>
            <li> recommend for all hair types, mine is straight and loose curls.</li>
            <li> Usually regular shampoo makes my hair really dry which requires me to use twice as much conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, curly hair that usually doesn&#x27;t require much maintenance other than serious moisturizer and detangler.</li>
            <li> but afterwards my hair felt a little more coarse/dry than usual, not super soft like how it is when I use cheaper products.</li>
            <li> A little of it really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s is gentle, doesn&#x27;t smell like a fruit cup or perfumerie, and just plain takes care of my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is about 6 inches long and a bottle lasted me almost six months with 2 washes per week.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair you appreciate the results after just a few weeks of using this hair care line.</li>
            <li> I just finished a year long transition</li>
            <li> I finger-detangle in the shower on WET HAIR ONLY and style when I get out...</li>
            <li> I had been going through hormonal issues for months which caused my hair to become very dry, brittle, and tangled.</li>
            <li> which is a problem since it will get wet</li>
            <li> Was not really helpful for me as i do not tend to use products that lead to buildup.  </li>
            <li> It stripped my hair leaving it in a tangled dry mess.  </li>
            <li> It is similar to a lower cost Suave, but it feels less harsh.  </li>
            <li> I consider this to be a luxury shampoo due to the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Miss Jessie products, but this is one of my favs.</li>
            <li> I guess it didn&#x27;t work for my type of hair because, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this shampoo or any other.</li>
            <li> no crisp apple smell here nor any perfume or floral essences.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the sticker placed for warehouse storing, it is paper based</li>
            <li> Also had slight chemical smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> If you have trouble taming your crown, try this.</li>
            <li> It is slippery but the it lathers into the hair, and rinses, it feels hard, not a detangling shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I also have hard water which may be why although I&#x27;ve never had that issue before.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, kinky- curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean yours will though.</li>
            <li> I find it really difficult to get out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> It did detangle my hair and my strands did not get the weird ropey/matted feeling while I was washing it.</li>
            <li> my curls hated this shampoo.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this stuff... it&#x27;s slippery, creamy, sudsy and really makes my hair fabulous.</li>
            <li> I find it really difficult to get out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I like the cleansing lotion better.</li>
            <li> This is great on my daughters hair!  If you have curly hair I recommend this It leaves your hair soft and takes the frizz away</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I have extremely thick, kinky- curly hair and this works wonders for me.  It detangles and leaves my hair shiny.  A little of it really goes a long way.  My hair is about 6 inches long and a bottle lasted me almost six months with 2 washes per week.</li>
            <li> Very impressive shampoo.  It&#x27;s thicker than it appears.  Moisturizing, non-stripping, smells nice.  If you&#x27;re into suds, it provides plenty.  This shampoo is gentle and I could even detangle with it in my hair.  I consider this to be a luxury shampoo due to the price.  I think it&#x27;s pricey but it also works well with it&#x27;s conditioner.   I&#x27;d purchase again because a good shampoo is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels good once you apply it. It is slippery but the it lathers into the hair, and rinses, it feels hard, not a detangling shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, curly hair that usually doesn&#x27;t require much maintenance other than serious moisturizer and detangler. This is a gentle cleanser that leaves my hair really soft and I am able to pre-detangle my hair with my fingers as I wash it. Usually regular shampoo makes my hair really dry which requires me to use twice as much conditioner. However, with this product I don&#x27;t need to use much of it and it keeps my hair moisturized while also cleansing,</li>
            <li> Most awesome shampoo ever for a girl IMO!  Not tear free, but for older children, really fun.  It looks like liquid pearls, smells amazing and boy, does it remove tangles!  It is sudsy, I realize that&#x27;s a choice - but if you want a great detangling shampoo, I have had success with this with my daughter&#x27;s fine, long, curly hair along with the Miss Jessie Creme de la Creme conditioner and Leave In Condish.</li>
            <li> Best de-tangling shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for the curly kinky girls!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It always leaves my hair clean, moisturized, soft &amp; easy to detangle. I&#x27;ve tried other Miss Jessie products, but this is one of my favs.</li>
            <li> Im a product junky i use them all. But this is the only product that makes my hair super soft and detangle easily. I absolutely love this. A must have!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for cleaning my hair without stripping and without buildup. I only use it every other shampoo, or so, but it always leaves my hair clean but soft. It&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way, so even the 8 oz bottle lasts for longer than most shampoos.</li>
            <li> I just love this shampo. Yes, it is pricey but you really don&#x27;t need much per shampoo. I have naturally curly, very easily breakable hair. Miss Jessie&#x27;s is gentle, doesn&#x27;t smell like a fruit cup or perfumerie, and just plain takes care of my hair!</li>
            <li> yummy, slick, and soapy, the best shampoo I have  ever used. recommend for all hair types, mine is straight and loose curls.</li>
            <li> This really detangles well but it does have parabens. I would have given it 5 stars if that wasn&#x27;t the case.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day.  Mixed chicks and WEN detangles well too.</li>
            <li> my curls hated this shampoo.  doesn&#x27;t mean yours will though. I love this lines styling gels but have not had equal love for the whole line.  buy sample sizes before you commit to the large tub!</li>
            <li> Looks and feels like snot. Did not give my hair any slip, nor did it detangle it. I have 2b/2c wurly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my processed hair for years and it is the best! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine wavy hair. I love this shampoo, it is so thick and slippery I often dilute it with water to make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;It conditions my hair so well that often I don&#x27;t need conditioner.  I paid $18, while that is a lot for me, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo. I guess it didn&#x27;t work for my type of hair because, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between using this shampoo or any other. I thought it would help me with my curls but, I been using it for a couple of weeks now and I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Surpassed my expectations and does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Got this for my gf and here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of this shampoo. The smell and slip are okay, and I do feel that it cleansed my hair well, but afterwards my hair felt a little more coarse/dry than usual, not super soft like how it is when I use cheaper products. I used it once and now I&#x27;m ready to give it away to someone.</li>
            <li> Suds very well and leaves hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo for curly hair!! My daughter&#x27;s has never detangled so quickly. Thanks for such a great shampoo. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I really like Miss Jessie&#x27;s products a lot. Miss Jessie&#x27;s products are the only ones on the market that can deliver on my 3c/4a hair.I really like the Super Slip Sudsy Shampoo because I only need a dime amount( my hair is short and curly) and it lathers my whole head. Ii really snaps back the curls for me and DOES NOT STRIP OR FEEL STRIPED. That is a big plus in a shampoo, It&#x27;s apart of my once a week regimen and it s gentle to my color treated hair. Got to try a bottle you Curlies out there!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It&#x27;s the key to growing long healthy hair for me; even my hair dresser noticed my healthier hair. The texture is... interesting. Because I have longer hair I&#x27;ve noticed that I have to wash the top of my hair, then get more to do my scalp to get a really good clean but I also have hard water which may be why although I&#x27;ve never had that issue before.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. I use with many of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. Excellent results. Relaxed and transitioning ladies will love Miss Jessie&#x27;s. Leaves hair clean and soft ready for conditioner and other products.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo....rich in moisture</li>
            <li> As I said in my review of the Creme de la Creme conditioner, I love love the product for my long, very curly hair as it is not weighty. My only complaint is the sticker placed for warehouse storing, it is paper based which is a problem since it will get wet</li>
            <li> This product does produce a lot of lather and suds.  I would recommend using it as clarifying shampoo to remove product buildup.  Was not really helpful for me as i do not tend to use products that lead to buildup.  Was looking for a shampoo that provided lather, slip and moisture.  Did not deliver for me in that regard.  Also had slight chemical smell no crisp apple smell here nor any perfume or floral essences.  Purchase if you need clarifying and suds.  Otherwise another product may be better.</li>
            <li> All my Christmas shopping could be found on Amazon.  What a great deal on a great product! Try it, you will like it (if you have curly hair).</li>
            <li> Its well worth the extra money you pay for hair care products.  It smells nice and leaves have feeling moisturized.  If you have naturally curly hair you appreciate the results after just a few weeks of using this hair care line.</li>
            <li> This is the first detangling shampoo I&#x27;ve used and its ok. The texture is very slippery, but my hair is still tangled afterwards. What I do like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair too much.</li>
            <li> Expensive but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
            <li> Does not sud up a ton but does not dry my hair out like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on a lot of products over the years, but the first time I used this shampoo, I knew I had a winner.  It suds up on the first wash, is gentle, lightly scented and it feels so good in your hands.  It has enough slip that you feel like you&#x27;re getting clean on the first shampoo.  Do a repeat just to feel that clean again.  It is similar to a lower cost Suave, but it feels less harsh.  I just finished a year long transition and this was just what my hair needed as a reward.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels a bit like shampooing your hair with snot but, it is good snot (if that makes sense).  It did detangle my hair and my strands did not get the weird ropey/matted feeling while I was washing it. My hair feels nice and clean without feeling stripped of its natural oils.  It smells nice and has the most unique texture that I have ever experienced in a shampoo.  I will repurchase this again and again.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for curly hair! I use it everyday and my hair looks amazing. The days I do not use this shampoo, I regret it because my hair is not as bouncy and curly as it is when I do use this product.</li>
            <li> Honest review. I had been going through hormonal issues for months which caused my hair to become very dry, brittle, and tangled. In some areas my hair actually dread. I felt like giving up on my hair and just wanted to cut it into a very short style. A friend recommended Miss Jessie and I promise you it worked wonders for me. As I was shampooing, I could feel it softening the tangles as I worked it through my hair. My hair has life again. For the first time in awhile It is soft and tangle free. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos make your hair feel dry and you can&#x27;t comb through your hair. But with this I was able to comb my fingers through without them being snagged in my hair. It also smells so good. My hair felt nice and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It did make my hair soft which is RARE for a shampoo but its way too pricey for the tiny amount of product you get. PLUS I bought it expecting it to be cruelty free like pillow soft curls but I didn&#x27;t see the cruelty-free logo so that and the product being way over priced I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:90fb0af8e5d9a170dd1529978f115393]] Since my natural hair journey started, I&#x27;ve tried several reputable products (Aunt Jackie&#x27;s, Taliah Wahjid, Curly Girl, etc) and out of all of the others, the only thing worth the money was Miss Jessie&#x27;s. I&#x27;ll be honest, Aunt Jackie had me hooked for a couple months, but once I decided to splurge on my hair with Miss Jessie&#x27;s I have not looked back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo...idk how to describe it...  I have thick 4c hair and I can feel the shampoo defining my curls as it suds up. What was once just wet hair is now bouncy and full of life with a healthy shine. If you have 4b-c hair, this is for you. Sure if you have other type of hair, I&#x27;m sure you can use it and benefit, too, but I&#x27;m specifically talking to the 4b&#x27;s and 4c&#x27;s because of my own hair type. I can&#x27;t speak for others. If you have trouble taming your crown, try this. You won&#x27;t regret it &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I feel it&#x27;s also important to let you all know that I am on a no heat, no comb regimen. Since I&#x27;ve started this my hair has grown so much more, is able to retain great amounts of length, and is much stronger than it used to be. IMO, we kinky haired ladies don&#x27;t really NEED combs, we just need to detangle. I finger-detangle in the shower on WET HAIR ONLY and style when I get out... .. that&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Really lathers and makes your hair feel clean :)</li>
            <li> A great shampoo for hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a detangling shampoo -but my search continues. I like the shampoo well enuf tho. I like how it suds up. I feel my hair gets clean</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?!?!? To say that my hair gets tangled and knotted is an understatement. I have natural type 4zzzz hair :-) I used this for the first time today after taking out my braids, and the knots and tangles simply melted away!!! Left my hair so easy to comb! No struggling, no hair snapping off in the teeth of the comb, no yanking, no sobbing :-) This is a must for me from now on! Thank you to the Miss Jessie family!!</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly &amp; as usual, I&#x27;m pleased w/ this purchase. Smells great, breaks down heavy product buildup &amp; leaves my hair very soft &amp; clean. This is a wonderful product for my thick, curly/kinky hair. Product arrived in new/excellent condition. No disappointments here!!!</li>
            <li> Love Miss Jessies products and this shampoo works wonders.</li>
            <li> This product works more like a clarifying shampoo.  It stripped my hair leaving it in a tangled dry mess.  It does have sulfate in it which is a no no for kinky curly girls, especially if you plan on using it on a regular basis.  Try the shea moistures line if you want moisture, slip, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product was overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> Yep just what she wanted thank you</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo.  I received a sample at my college homecoming #GoCAU last year.  Though I tried many other brands, this one really does wonders on my naturally curly hair.  My hair is tangle free and so much softer after using this shampoo.  So glad I tried it, now I&#x27;ll be a regular buyer!</li>
            <li> I just used the sample size version of this stuff last night and I am buying the full size bottle right now!! I have been looking for a detangling shampoo that leaves my hair soft. This is heaven sent. It melted my tangles away like butter, my hair and scalp were very clean and my hair was soft soft soft. I am in love and can&#x27;t stop telling people about this stuff</li>
            <li> My hair is looking better</li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s products are the ishhh!!!! Love it, get&#x27;s my hair clean and my natural curls do not tangle!</li>
            <li> This is a good clarifying shampoo, but note that as a true clarifying shampoo it has sulfate.</li>
            <li> Super Slip. Super Sudsy. Great if you have crazy, curly hair. If you have fine, curly hair not sure I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels &amp; smells!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not listed on the website, but when I received it I saw there were parabens so I sent it  back.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, really does leave your hair clean, without stripping it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
