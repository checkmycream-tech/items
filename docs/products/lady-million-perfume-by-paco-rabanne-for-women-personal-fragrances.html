            <li>I liked its originality</li>
            <li>cologne/perfume&#x27;s scent depends upon each individuals unique scent, so it might smell great on some people and just okay on others.</li>
            <li>STILL couldn&#x27;t buy it--because I would NEVER be able to admit that I own (and love)</li>

            <li>A friend gave me this perfum one christmas, my mom and i love it.</li>
            <li>and I saw this perfume with its over the top gold packaging and the name \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>This is a spicy scent that&#x27;s very unique, but I am not fond of it.</li>
            <li>it is very Sexy and pretty at a great&lt;br</li>

            <li>This perfume is nice, it smells a little strong at first but softens thruout my day</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this perfume!!</li>
            <li>I first noticed this scent when I was coming up the elevator at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product in the store and after decided to order it online, since it was much cheaper on Amazon.com.</li>

            <li>its real not&lt;br /&gt;Old</li>
            <li>I liked it so much did an online search and came up with Amazon as they had it for less than other sites</li>
            <li>I first purchased this cologne at a local retailer.  </li>
            <li>immediately must smell this (ONLY for comic relief, of course).  </li>
            <li>The smell is not very sweet, not very cold, I would say neutral.</li>
            <li>Its mysterious and complex and sweet and musky but light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> So I&#x27;ve been eyeing this perfume for a few months now. I had seen it in sephora but hating spending the money....long story short I love this perfume it&#x27;s more of a sexy smell that ever since I&#x27;ve been wearing it I haven&#x27;t stopped getting compliments!!! Highly recommend this perfume!! And it&#x27;s a few bucks cheaper than sephora is selling it for!</li>
            <li> This is a spicy scent that&#x27;s very unique, but I am not fond of it. It&#x27;s a little too masculine for me. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, enchanting, wonderful fragrance!!!&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m a very ruthless critic.&lt;br /&gt;The Best I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable, seriously&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance is ....... I can&#x27;t even describe.&lt;br /&gt;UPLIFTING, that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;I try to find something similar, but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> quality product and recommend this seller</li>
            <li> I first purchased this cologne at a local retailer.  I liked it so much did an online search and came up with Amazon as they had it for less than other sites did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of complements when I wear this cologne. SMELLS GREAT and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in the store and after decided to order it online, since it was much cheaper on Amazon.com. The delivery was very quick and the product was just amazing, as I expected. The smell is not very sweet, not very cold, I would say neutral. I received a lot of compliments from my friends and they all said that this perfume has a smell of an independent woman and I agree with them. It makes you feel very sexy!!! So girls, I definitely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Paco Rabanne Lady Million by Paco Rabanne Eau De Parfum Spray for Women,..., my girl friend love it, would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> It is the perfect give to a mom. She loved the colonne and also said the scent last for a long time</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE  MUY  BUENA  ATENCI&amp;Oacute;N  Y  EL ARTICULO DE BUENA CALIDAD LOS RECOMIENDO :D PUNTUAL TODO BIEN RESPONSABLE  Y Y Y</li>
            <li> This perfume is nice, it smells a little strong at first but softens thruout my day</li>

            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> First time using it and its great</li>
            <li> My mom loves this thing no wonder.. It smells so darn good. Had to get it</li>
            <li> Amazing Perfum!!!!! i just love it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell as good as the men&#x27;s cologne. I should have known better; never assume. It&#x27;s not bad, it just not for me</li>
            <li> I first noticed this scent when I was coming up the elevator at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. I had no idea what it was and it required a couple more trips to figure out what it was. I bought a bottle there and have loved it since. So does my boyfriend. I was happy to be able to buy it on Amazon for even less than in the duty free shops.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this perfum one christmas, my mom and i love it. It is a strong perfum so u do not need to spray it ten times to have an effect. It last the entire day and then some. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was in duty-free heading to Costa Rica and I saw this perfume with its over the top gold packaging and the name \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was thinking on the inside: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Lady Million??  Who would buy this stuff?!?!?!?!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately must smell this (ONLY for comic relief, of course).  I spray...and I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much I can&#x27;t reconcile the name with the smell.  Its mysterious and complex and sweet and musky but light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have the nerve to buy it that day in the duty-free shop.  I have to stop in and smell it again upon my return from Costa Rica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL couldn&#x27;t buy it--because I would NEVER be able to admit that I own (and love) a perfume called \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I can&#x27;t stop thinking about it....so 2 months later, I break down and buy it from Amazon.  I&#x27;ve only confessed to one other person...who told her 10-year old daughter. They both now call me \\&quot;Lady Million\\&quot;....which is awful but great.  Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> Great smell....Recommend you buy it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife with never smelling it before.  I have the mens version and love it figuring the womens would be as good.  Now mind you, cologne/perfume&#x27;s scent depends upon each individuals unique scent, so it might smell great on some people and just okay on others.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, muy bueno el despacho, EXACTAMENTE el perfume que quer&amp;iacute;a y totalmente original y muy bien especificado en los detalles del producto</li>
            <li> I liked its originality</li>
            <li> This product is a fake!!! It is not a fragrance, it stinks like nothing even close to the original.</li>
