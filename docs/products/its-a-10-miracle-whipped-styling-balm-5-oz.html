            <li> Soft, silky hair like never before.  </li>
            <li> no mess or residue either.</li>
            <li> but at the same time not make my hair greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> And you only need just a drop (I have very long hair)</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> the product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 products; this works wonders with my frizzy, unruly, long hair.</li>
            <li> so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use it after I towel dry my hair and after I blow dry my hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Also, the product dispenser is not great, it shoots out really liquidy, not like a mousse</li>
            <li> I have spent months trying to find a product to replace it</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and only use very little</li>
            <li> other products I&#x27;ve used- like from Bed Head or Macadamia...will not purchase again, but will try to finish product-</li>
            <li> The winters are harsh here, so my hair feels limp and my scalp is really dry; lots of products I use irritate my skin and cause severe itching.</li>
            <li> Unlike anti-frizz oil products, this is gel-like and does not weigh your hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Down</li>
            <li> I dispense the product in the palm of my hand to about the size of a quarter (for shoulder-length hair), comb it through and then blow dry and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I had to order on Amazon because it was not available in the stores yet.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried it, you&#x27;re missing out.  </li>
            <li> My only annoyance is the mouse pump is really delicate, the stuff is thick so pushing it out takes some force.</li>
            <li> so I need something to tame the frizz</li>
            <li> It was a mess!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not an airy product - it&#x27;s thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> but this was not what they usually produce!  </li>
            <li> I will say it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> and I was greatly disappointed when they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  Received on time and does the job I need it to do!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by my hair stylist. Most of the time if I buy products that work for THEM, they still don&#x27;t work for ME. This one lives up to expectation. It leaves my hair full of body, ready to style, soft and manageable. I love it! It&#x27;s not a mousse as the bottle might look, ... it&#x27;s a creme. Goes on smooth, not greasy, no flaking, just a great product.</li>
            <li> If you have curly, CURLY hair, this product will do wonders on keeping the frizzy hairs at bay.</li>
            <li> nothing like the ad that lead me to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I am now a fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle hair care products.  I love the keratin line of products.  My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Ok for curly hair, doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I&#x27;ve used- like from Bed Head or Macadamia...will not purchase again, but will try to finish product- Also, the product dispenser is not great, it shoots out really liquidy, not like a mousse would from the same type of spout.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use a fair amount on my fine, curly hair after shampooing for blow drying my hair into a smooth style. My hair appears to have more volume, is manageable and stays smooth with no frizzies regardless of how hot and humid the days are. Unlike anti-frizz oil products, this is gel-like and does not weigh your hair down or make it look greasy. The product gives your hair a shine and bounce making it look healthy and supple.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I makes my hair so smooth and shiney!!! I use it every day before blowdrying and it is amazing!! I have frizzy hair and it definately takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s a 10 products but this was not what they usually produce!  This was sticky and did not give desired results - frizzy and crunchy hair were what I got instead of sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Retailer great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle in a can! I use it after I towel dry my hair and after I blow dry my hair feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it - but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  You have to be careful and only use very little the product goes a long way.  My hair is processed with color and this product just seemed to drying.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and hoped this would make straight.  It helped but wasn&#x27;t a miracle product.  Shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> Great product for everyday use and keeps your hair shiny and tame even at the beach!</li>
            <li> John Frieda used to make a product called Frizz-Ease Wind Down that was the perfect product for my hair and I was greatly disappointed when they discontinued it.  I have spent months trying to find a product to replace it and I finally did with this.  I have naturally curly (i.e, frizzy) hair that does not do well in any kind of humidity so I need something to tame the frizz but at the same time not make my hair greasy and flat.  This product does exactly that.  I did have to experiment with the amount.  It has a mousse-type nozzle but it&#x27;s not an airy product - it&#x27;s thick and creamy.  I dispense the product in the palm of my hand to about the size of a quarter (for shoulder-length hair), comb it through and then blow dry and style as usual.  I will say it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side and it&#x27;s difficult to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.h Hghly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but I do like all the Miracle 10 products - makes my hair shiny and very  easy to comb through - need to use it more for a full evaluation but so far it does what it promised</li>
            <li> Worked great on my color treated hair. Had great hold without feeling sticky or stiff</li>
            <li> Love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is really awesome for my processed hair to keep it soft and shiny. i go to hair school now and i will definitely recommend this product to my clients. i will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting something to hold your hair in place, this is not it.  It is soupy and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It was a mess!  Applicator didn&#x27;t work, stuff was like glue that came out.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish this was easier to find -- big fan of It&#x27;s a 10 products; this works wonders with my frizzy, unruly, long hair. The winters are harsh here, so my hair feels limp and my scalp is really dry; lots of products I use irritate my skin and cause severe itching. This is probably the only styling product I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp or hair to freak out. I love the smell and texture, goes on easy, no mess or residue either. I was exposed to this product from my hair dresser who used it on my hair during my annual cut and it just worked so well.  My only annoyance is the mouse pump is really delicate, the stuff is thick so pushing it out takes some force.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, can really use damp or dry. No greasy feel. It really improves the look and feel of scorched ends.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist. It truly help with the frizzy ends. I had to order on Amazon because it was not available in the stores yet.</li>
            <li> This is one of he best styling products if you have natural curl; just comb some in and scrunch and you&#x27;re on your way to shiny and soft hair.  It&#x27;s fantastic stuff no matter which way you style your hair, it&#x27;s definitely my #1 go-to.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! If you&#x27;ve never tried it, you&#x27;re missing out.  Soft, silky hair like never before.  And you only need just a drop (I have very long hair) so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and holds style!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  It holds the style very well.  A little bit goes a long way so it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> smells great and it works good for me</li>
