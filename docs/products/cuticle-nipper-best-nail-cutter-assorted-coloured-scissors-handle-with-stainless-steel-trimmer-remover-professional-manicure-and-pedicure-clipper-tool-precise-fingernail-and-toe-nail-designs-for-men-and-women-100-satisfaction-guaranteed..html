            <li>I have problems with being able to get the cuticle clipped before this pair (even after applying cuticle oil).  </li>
            <li>I was able to hold this one better as well as</li>
            <li>When i have time, I will seek out a better one.</li>
            <li>I love the colors of these clippers.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to have been given the chance to purchase these at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review...</li>
            <li>you can easily cut yourselves with these.  </li>
            <li>The grips make them easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>And the color is very pretty!</li>
            <li>They cut smoothly without tearing my skin.</li>
            <li>This cuticle nipper is cheaply made (like something you&#x27;d buy at a dollar store) and doesn&#x27;t clip your cuticles.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but in between I get the occasional cuticle that needs to be clipped and these worked great..</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic with no grip.</li>
            <li>They are so light-weight and cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic handles w a paperclip tension arm.</li>
            <li>However, I found with this set because they are light weight, that I can squeeze them with no problem.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to clean, and store.</li>
            <li>really cheap, but you get what you pay for,</li>
            <li>It was easy to clean after use.  </li>
            <li>Cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I got an excellent pair of all stainless Trim brand for the same price I paid for these.  </li>
            <li>They are small and light  weight and do the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am so excited I was chosen to test this for quality and express my opinion about the product.</li>
            <li>Very well made and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very well made and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it cut cuticles cleanly; almost felt like it was tearing the cuticles off.  </li>
            <li>the non-slip grip gives me an accurate, quick cut.  </li>
            <li>The spring action is amazing, it makes using these with one hand a lot easier.</li>
            <li>Looks durable and sharp and shaped to do a great job.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel blade looks nice and sharp for a clean and precise cut, also makes them easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I bought Tweezerman Power Hangnail Clippers which were well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I also love the pink to keep it feminine for me, fits in with all my other girly products lol.</li>
            <li>These are more for nails, since the blades are large, and not sharp.</li>
            <li>I love that these are smaller than others I have had.</li>
            <li>but I ended up with pretty raggedy cuticles that I&#x27;m just going to have to let heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut cleaning and broke the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>These are also very sturdily built!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of times from amazon and this is my first review bc</li>
            <li>its okay, just seems like it will break after a couple uses, and the blades a aligned crooked.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>The blades on the cuticle clipper are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>These do as good a job if not better, than the sets that are heavier in weight.  </li>
            <li>I like the non-slip grip as opposed to regular metal clippers &amp; they also have a hook which makes for easy and convenient storage.  </li>
            <li>set is of course one of my favorite colors, pretty pink.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp, and non slip grip on the handles makes them very easy to use.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only accurate description of this item.</li>
            <li>does nor work very well</li>
            <li>Do not be fooled by the cute pink color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plastic,  very \\&quot;CHEAP\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Very convenient size for throwing in your purse or</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, fingernail clippers aren&#x27;t the best at cutting hangnails.</li>
            <li>They are so flimsy that when you squeeze them to cut, no cutting takes place but the handles nearly squeeze together.</li>
            <li>Yes they were only $8.99 but really are worth about 25 cents!</li>
            <li>colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>She said they are lightweight, easy to use and extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li>My neice would love these Pink Cutters!!!  </li>
            <li>They can be used on both Men and Women and look like they can be used either right or left handed; also, fingers or toes.  </li>
            <li>my new found</li>
            <li>Complete junk!</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and the clippers are sharp enough to cut my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order it expecting anything extremely grand, but I figured it would at least be more than just dull metal held together by plastic.</li>
            <li>I am a professional nail tech</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the different between a real Barbie doll and some no name made in China</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a spring like action when you are using this nipper.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, plastic, and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t help thinking the &#x27; good&#x27; reviews here are fake.</li>
            <li>Super sharp so there is no ripping!</li>
            <li>The blades on them are super sharp!  </li>
            <li>Super sharp so there is no ripping!</li>
            <li>They are not sharp and they won&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li>They are light weight and small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>Also good for cutting your nails if you need to.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp at all.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; to help them open and close is stiff and chintzy, a total piece of junk.</li>
            <li>These are plastic and not not sharp enough to cut cuticles</li>
            <li>The get right down to the skin, and are sharp enough to cut with out pulling.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t order it expecting anything extremely grand, but I figured it would at least be more than just dull metal held together by plastic.</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the different between a real Barbie doll and some no name made in China</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a spring like action when you are using this nipper.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, plastic, and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help thinking the &#x27; good&#x27; reviews here are fake.</li>
            <li> Super sharp so there is no ripping!</li>
            <li> The blades on them are super sharp!  </li>
            <li> Super sharp so there is no ripping!</li>
            <li> They are not sharp and they won&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> They are light weight and small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Also good for cutting your nails if you need to.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; to help them open and close is stiff and chintzy, a total piece of junk.</li>
            <li> These are plastic and not not sharp enough to cut cuticles</li>
            <li> The get right down to the skin, and are sharp enough to cut with out pulling.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut sharply so in order to complete the cut you have to pull the cuticle.</li>
            <li> They are light weight so great for me since I have bad wrist and holding things make my hands go numb.</li>
            <li> The clippers are quite difficult to maneuver and it is so hard to get a good cut with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received them quickly but I&#x27;m soooo not happy with the look of them.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are pink and have the rubber grippers instead of just metal because I have a hard time holding on to the metal ones and they are real heavy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is light weight, but difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It is sharp on the outside of the blade rather than inside.</li>
            <li> These cutters are a complete waste of your money!  </li>
            <li> I really look forward to using them on my cuticles for they are long and tough.</li>
            <li> This item is not nearly as high quality as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Returned - not very well made.</li>
            <li> I am  beauty professional and have never seen a product of such poor quality.</li>
            <li> In fact, so sharp, I warn you to be careful....</li>
            <li> They are sharp.</li>
            <li> Nipper is not even sharp</li>
            <li> With the 100% satisfaction guaranteed and money back if not happy, I would definitely buy the cuticle nipper.</li>
            <li> They should be sharp enough to cut the cuticles without tearing the skin and leaving little sores all over my fingers like some I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The blades on it are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give less stars, I was sent a cpearly defective product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> am disabled now and have severe problems with my hands.  </li>
            <li> Thank Goodness they are not cheap ones either.</li>
            <li> Take it from me &amp; don&#x27;t waste your time on these plastic, flimsy nippers.</li>
            <li> I like that these clippers can be hung up out of reach from small children.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am not normally able to use a tool like this because my hands don&#x27;t have the ability to squeeze them.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping this because I am too lazy to return, but....</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are great at cutting those nasty little things!</li>
            <li> These other reviews must be fake.</li>
            <li> Awful, not sharp, and &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; bar continues to work its way up with each squeeze until it doesn&#x27;t spring open anymore.  </li>
            <li> I would compare them to the little useless scissors that come in small emergency sewing kits.</li>
            <li> My other set of nippers is basically useless to me.  </li>
            <li> Not good in the add</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars I would!</li>
            <li> absolutely the worst cuticle nipper I have ever seen or used.  </li>
            <li> These are the worse nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li> the handles stick a bit causing you to push down harder and will eventually case me to make a painful mistake :(</li>
            <li> Not good for ANYTHING!</li>
            <li> The tension bar in the middle catches horribly.  </li>
            <li> These cutters are totally useless.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very poorly made.</li>
            <li> The product is of very poor quality, the nipper blade is numb and it does not slide.</li>
            <li> These are laughable!</li>
            <li> I have purchased some very expensive ones at the drug store that lasted like a week..</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Cannot use I product like this at the risk of cutting someone and it does not work like anything it should!</li>
            <li> This cuticle nipper is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> They must have changed the product they are shipping out as this is a bad product!</li>
            <li> The worst cuticle nipper I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible terrible quality...</li>
            <li> These are horrible!</li>
            <li> Hang nails are the worst.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> they are that bad!!</li>
            <li> Is awful.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!!!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!! It couldn&#x27;t even cut paper!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great and nifty product. I always travel with it</li>
            <li> The product is of very poor quality, the nipper blade is numb and it does not slide. The worst cuticle nipper I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> does nor work very well</li>
            <li> I love that these are smaller than others I have had. I love the color. They are light weight so great for me since I have bad wrist and holding things make my hands go numb.They look kinda flimsy but surprisingly durable. They are sharp. They cut smoothly without tearing my skin. I even use them to cut my hangnails.</li>
            <li> This cuticle nipper is cheaply made (like something you&#x27;d buy at a dollar store) and doesn&#x27;t clip your cuticles. I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t cut butter!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like that these clippers can be hung up out of reach from small children. The non slip grip is perfect for getting rid ilof pesky hangnails without incident. I also appreciate the option of getting different colors.</li>
            <li> This cuticle nipper is worthless.  It does not cut anything.  I am disappointed with this product.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> About as effective as teeth in cutting cuticles.  Do not be fooled by the cute pink color.  Made from the cheapest and lightest plastic you can imagine.  The tension bar in the middle catches horribly.  Look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money. The quality is of something you can find in the dollar store!!!!  I am  beauty professional and have never seen a product of such poor quality. These other reviews must be fake.</li>
            <li> This item is not nearly as high quality as it claims to be. I didn&#x27;t order it expecting anything extremely grand, but I figured it would at least be more than just dull metal held together by plastic. The clippers are quite difficult to maneuver and it is so hard to get a good cut with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use them as best I could, but I ended up with pretty raggedy cuticles that I&#x27;m just going to have to let heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely do not buy.</li>
            <li> These cutters are a complete waste of your money!  They don&#x27;t cut sharply so in order to complete the cut you have to pull the cuticle.</li>
            <li> absolutely the worst cuticle nipper I have ever seen or used.  don&#x27;t buy this product, you will regret it.  I got an excellent pair of all stainless Trim brand for the same price I paid for these.  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut cleaning and broke the first time I used them.  I threw them away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Luckily I bought Tweezerman Power Hangnail Clippers which were well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best nipper I have ever used! It fits perfectly in my hand and easy to use</li>
            <li> These are great quality.. I get my nails done with Acrylic every two weeks but in between I get the occasional cuticle that needs to be clipped and these worked great.. I even used them for my unconditional pulling at the nail where it was lifting...  I have purchased some very expensive ones at the drug store that lasted like a week.. these are better quality then that.. I was lucky to have been given the chance to purchase these at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review... I love them and the colors are great :-)</li>
            <li> Terrible terrible quality...I am getting my money back. Please don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Not good in the add it looks like a quality tool but is not. It&#x27;s plastic,  very \\&quot;CHEAP\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These are great. They are small and light  weight and do the job perfectly. Very convenient size for throwing in your purse or in you car for those times you need something</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars I would! These are horrible! They don&#x27;t cut well, the blades overlap when you squeeze, and there is no spring for them to reopen.</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech and I cannot believe that I bought this! I know I have to spend alot of money to get quality implements, but I was looking for something for just getting by while my good ones are getting sharpened, or for clipping acrylic. Not good for ANYTHING! You will find better at the dollar store for a dollar.</li>
            <li> As a Licensed Cosmetologist I can tell by looking at these Cuticle Clippers that they are a Salon Quality tool.  I like the non-slip grip as opposed to regular metal clippers &amp; they also have a hook which makes for easy and convenient storage.  The stainless steel blade looks nice and sharp for a clean and precise cut, also makes them easy to clean.  They can be used on both Men and Women and look like they can be used either right or left handed; also, fingers or toes.  Can’t beat the price especially with a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Hang nails are the worst. They appear out of no where, and bug you until you take care of them. These clippers are great at taking care of the issue. Let&#x27;s face it, fingernail clippers aren&#x27;t the best at cutting hangnails. They pull at your skin, and might even make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;These are great at cutting those nasty little things! The get right down to the skin, and are sharp enough to cut with out pulling. Also good for cutting your nails if you need to. The spring action is amazing, it makes using these with one hand a lot easier. These are also very sturdily built!</li>
            <li> These are more for nails, since the blades are large, and not sharp.</li>
            <li> My neice would love these Pink Cutters!!!  They look compact and very stylish... I&#x27;ll have to let her know</li>
            <li> These cuticle clippers seem to be real light weight and easy to use. I really look forward to using them on my cuticles for they are long and tough. They should be sharp enough to cut the cuticles without tearing the skin and leaving little sores all over my fingers like some I&#x27;ve used in the past. I love the fact that they are pink and have the rubber grippers instead of just metal because I have a hard time holding on to the metal ones and they are real heavy. Thank You</li>
            <li> GREAT Product. Got that hangnail that was hurting me all day.</li>
            <li> Returned - not very well made. Keep searching.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Works as listed and keeps the nails looking good</li>
            <li> With the 100% satisfaction guaranteed and money back if not happy, I would definitely buy the cuticle nipper. Looks durable and sharp and shaped to do a great job.</li>
            <li> I received them quickly but I&#x27;m soooo not happy with the look of them. I haven&#x27;t even opened the package. The handles are plastic and they look very cheaply made. I&#x27;m a nail tech and it needed steel nippers to sanitize an autoclave not plastic this is what I get for not picking some up in persons these will be sent back ASAP!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it cut cuticles cleanly; almost felt like it was tearing the cuticles off.  It didn&#x27;t feel like a sturdy instrument.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic with no grip. They must have changed the product they are shipping out as this is a bad product!</li>
            <li> The blades on the cuticle clipper are nice and sharp. I used it on myself and my two kids and it was easy to use very lightweight. You can see everything you are doing this way you don&#x27;t knick the kids hands. They were actually ok with me using the cuticle nippers on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are vibrant. Fits right into my make up bag, which is great so if I ever get a pesky cuticle that I need to clip when I am away from home. Now I don&#x27;t have to bite at it or use a nail clipper and cause some pain or draw blood when clipping at them. So far a wonderful product. Hopefully more come in stock so I can order them for gifts.</li>
            <li> I definitely did not get what everyone else got. These cutters are totally useless. They&#x27;re very poorly made. It&#x27;s like the different between a real Barbie doll and some no name made in China plastic Barbie look-a-like named Pinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!! Cheap, plastic, and a complete waste of money. Came in packaging that said &amp;#34;0% satisfaction guaranteed&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> RUTURNED!  Awful, not sharp, and &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; bar continues to work its way up with each squeeze until it doesn&#x27;t spring open anymore.  I dont recommend AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Best tool ever to use with doing your own nails and cleaning up the cuticles..</li>
            <li> What you can&#x27;t see in the picture is the cheapness of the plastic handles. They bend. It&#x27;s a very cheap plastic. Some reviewers stated that these were salon/spa quality....definitely not. These might be a good deal if they were sold in a dollar store. I would compare them to the little useless scissors that come in small emergency sewing kits.</li>
            <li> These are great! Works perfectly! Very well made and easy to use! Super sharp so there is no ripping! Great Product! I received this FREE or DISCOUNTED product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU for a good quality cuticle nipper.  The product was recieved in a timely manor and is a good quality nipper. I put it to use immediately and was pleased with the ease of use and the sharpness of the clippers. I will be recomending these to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> These are the worse nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.  They are so light-weight and cheap. They are not sharp and they won&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> It is extremely low quality product. I don&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Junk!! Complete junk! Cheap plastic handles w a paperclip tension arm. The best part is that the sticker on the back says 0% satisfaction gaurentee! That&#x27;s the only accurate description of this item. I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of times from amazon and this is my first review bc they are that bad!!</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend of mine who works in a beauty shop and does pedicures and manicures for a living.  She loves these nippers.  She said they are lightweight, easy to use and extremely sharp.  They will even trim acrylic nail tips.  She bought 3 pairs to give as gifts to her coworkers.  She&#x27;s very satisfied with them.  I am so excited I was chosen to test this for quality and express my opinion about the product.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  They are so flimsy that when you squeeze them to cut, no cutting takes place but the handles nearly squeeze together.</li>
            <li> These Cuticle Nippers are great!  I have owned a couple of different styles over the years, and I think these are going to be my new found favorites.&lt;br /&gt;This set is of course one of my favorite colors, pretty pink.  Which means when I am looking for them in my cluttered bathroom drawer, they stand out and I can see them easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am disabled now and have severe problems with my hands.  I am not normally able to use a tool like this because my hands don&#x27;t have the ability to squeeze them.  My other set of nippers is basically useless to me.  However, I found with this set because they are light weight, that I can squeeze them with no problem.  The blades on them are super sharp!  In fact, so sharp, I warn you to be careful.... you can easily cut yourselves with these.  These do as good a job if not better, than the sets that are heavier in weight.  Overall I was very happy with these!</li>
            <li> These clippers are absolutely wonderful! They are very sharp, and non slip grip on the handles makes them very easy to use. They are easy to clean, and store. And the color is very pretty! Makes it easy to find in my purse for when I need to remove a hang nail or a scratched cuticle!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give less stars, I was sent a cpearly defective product. The blades are chipped.</li>
            <li> really cheap, but you get what you pay for, its okay, just seems like it will break after a couple uses, and the blades a aligned crooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought anything like this to cut my cuticles. I always bought nail clippers to trim my cuticles. I&#x27;m so glad I did get these! They are light weight and small enough to carry in your purse. The blades on it are very sharp. This is a great girf for someone who likes to clip their cuticles. I absolutely love mine!</li>
            <li> These are great! Works perfectly.  Very well made and easy to use! Super sharp so there is no ripping! Great Product.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp at all.  I would not recommend these to anyone I like.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle nipper I have ever used!  I have problems with being able to get the cuticle clipped before this pair (even after applying cuticle oil).  I was able to hold this one better as well as the non-slip grip gives me an accurate, quick cut.  There&#x27;s a spring like action when you are using this nipper.  It was easy to clean after use.  I recommend this nipper to anyone wanting a beautiful manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li> These are laughable! Cheap plastic, the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; to help them open and close is stiff and chintzy, a total piece of junk. Yes they were only $8.99 but really are worth about 25 cents!</li>
            <li> I am keeping this because I am too lazy to return, but.... it isnt the best quality and the handles stick a bit causing you to push down harder and will eventually case me to make a painful mistake :( When i have time, I will seek out a better one.</li>
            <li> Good cuticle clippers. Thank Goodness they are not cheap ones either. They did the job at hand with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Is awful. The label said 0% satisfaction guaranteed, and it wasn&#x27;t lying. Blades were never aligned, and the trigger was never functional. Boo.</li>
            <li> Had to return, plastic piece of _. Couldn&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible. Can&#x27;t help thinking the &#x27; good&#x27; reviews here are fake. These giant cut for toffee.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. Nipper is not even sharp</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!!! HORRIBLE!!!! It couldn&#x27;t even cut paper! Let alone what it&#x27;s made for. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> The tips don&#x27;t line up. Theses are every cheep made. I Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of these clippers. The grips make them easy to hold and use. Also the ability to hang them up out of reach of children is very nice.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality product. Yes, it is light weight, but difficult to work with. It is sharp on the outside of the blade rather than inside. It will not cut anything unless you pull your cuticle.</li>
            <li> best cuticle nail clipper ive ever used. cuts perfectly and its easy to use no problems what so ever !</li>
            <li> I got these cuticle clippers in today and used them. I needed to come on here and just tell everyone how great these clippers are! It is easy to handle and the clippers are sharp enough to cut my cuticles. I also love the pink to keep it feminine for me, fits in with all my other girly products lol.</li>
            <li> These are plastic and not not sharp enough to cut cuticles</li>
            <li> Horrible purchase! Take it from me &amp; don&#x27;t waste your time on these plastic, flimsy nippers. Never again</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars. When you use the nippers to cut the cuticle they are not smooth and very jumpy. Cannot use I product like this at the risk of cutting someone and it does not work like anything it should! Very dissapointed!</li>
